"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  is an omnibus taxation bill covering 10 separate subject areas. The major ones are corporate philanthropy, treatment of bribes of overseas officials, tax rate for friendly societies, post-judgment interest on damages claims,and a number of technical issues including anti-avoidance provisions, simplifying rules for prior year losses, amendments to the dividend franking rules and redrafting to take into account simplifying tax legislation and the correction of drafting errors. I move:
That all words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading this House;
(1)	 condemns the Government for its continuing unwillingness to legislate against tax minimisation through the use of family trusts and notes the conflict of interest involved in approximately 17 Government frontbenchers holding family trusts; and
(2)	 calls on the Government to introduce into the House without delay the anti avoidance entity taxation arrangements announced in the ANTS package; and
(3)	 notes with alarm the consequent failure of the Government's response to the business 
 tax revenue neutral criterion and the effect of the resulting fiscal loosening on the current account deficit; and
(4)	 notes that Jeff Kennett has received a strong rebuke from the voters of Victoria due to his championing of the GST, excessive secrecy and nobbling of the Auditor General.
The key issues for debate here are, first, corporate philanthropy. The Prime Minister and other ministers announced these proposals in March to take effect from 1 July this year. They are supposedly aimed at increasing private philanthropy by making the tax consequences of gifting much more attractive. This is to be achieved, firstly, by providing tax deductibility for gifts of property valued at more than $5,000 held by a taxpayer for more than one year, irrespective of the valued at which it was acquired, to tax deductible public funds such as charities, universities, et cetera, and for similar gifts to a new category of tax deductible private funds. Secondly, it will provide a capital gains tax exemption for the increase in value of the property over the period that it was held by the gifting taxpayer under the cultural gifts program and for testamentary gifts—that is, gifts through wills to tax deductible funds. Thirdly, it will allow taxpayers to elect to spread tax deductions for gifts made over five years instead of the year of gift only.
While increased private philanthropy may be a worthwhile aim, Labor is concerned that the government wishes or intends to use this as an excuse for reduced future public philanthropy to welfare or charity agencies or to cultural ones. The opposition is concerned that the government is positioning itself to be able to pull back support in the future, arguing that it has installed incentives for the private sector to donate. This is similar to the arguments that the coalition will want to run in the future concerning vital state government services. So, when states complain they do not have enough resources to provide adequate levels of service to the public and ask the Commonwealth to contribute, we know what the conservatives will say: `You have the GST, if you want more money, you will simply have to increase the rate of the GST.' This is the Howard agenda on tax. We 
 are concerned it will be the Howard agenda on community support as well.
That is why we need to closely scrutinise these proposals, which will greatly increase the tax benefits accruing to gifts. I point out that the cost of the concessions is quite considerable—it is said to be in the order of $71 million by the financial year 2002-03—so whether these public resources are best spent by assisting private philanthropy, over which the public has little or no control, is an open question. This is something that the Senate should examine closely. How do we ensure that the resources that will be obtained in tax concessions will be efficiently used to assist our community?
Providing tax concessions in respect of testamentary gifts is a complex issue. Should tax concessions be provided to assist the estates of what are almost exclusively wealthy taxpayers? If people decide to be generous with their assets in death, should a tax concession be granted to their estates? These issues need to be explored, and I dare say they will be in the proposed Senate inquiry into this bill.
The second area of concern is the proposal to allow deductibility for gifts of property to private funds. Whilst private charitable funds may be as beneficial to the community as well-known public funds, there is a major accountability risk with private funds. How are we to know that the funds are being effectively administered? How are we to know about the effectiveness of their operations? Are they worthy of public subsidy through tax concessions for donations to them? We need to be certain that such entities cannot be used to foster tax avoidance. It might sound obscene to suggest that a charity would get involved in tax avoidance, or that anyone would attempt to use a charity for tax avoidance, but that is a real threat.
A former Treasurer, Ralph Willis, prior to the election in 1996, announced a crackdown on the misuse of charitable trusts, and the incoming government picked up that initiative and carried through with it. Clearly, the threat of misuse for private charitable trusts must be significantly greater than that attached to public institutions. I make the point that 
 private philanthropy should be about services to the community and not about tax dodges for wealthy people to hide behind.
The third issue in the legislation is that of donations to political parties. This bill proposes that gifts to a political party of property over $5,000 will qualify for a $1,500 deduction. In a separate bill, Labor is opposing measures which would increase the level of tax deductibility for cash donations to political parties from $100 to $1,500. Labor intends to be consistent and to oppose the proposal in this bill in respect of gifts of property.
It is outrageous that the government seeks public subsidy for gifts from wealthy people to political parties. If wealthy people wish to make political donations, that is their prerogative, but they should not be able to get a subsidy from the Commonwealth—from the taxpayer—for making such a contribution. Indeed, the Howard government ought to have much more pressing priorities than to subsidise wealthy contributors to the Liberal Party. The government is happy to cut funding for essential community services, and yet it now seeks to subsidise its own wealthy contributors. This is an outrageous proposal which this House should reject.
The next issue in the legislation is that of bribes for overseas officials. Australia has agreed, through the OECD, to legislate to deny tax deductibility for bribes paid to foreign government officials in an attempt to level the international playing field for foreign trade and investment. These proposals are consistent with recent amendments to the criminal law, which make it a crime to pay such bribes to foreign officials. The measures in the bill extend to situations where amounts are paid with the intention of influencing a foreign official in the exercise of his official duties to obtain or retain business or to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business. However, if the bribe is legal in the official's country, it will be allowed as a deduction.
In addition, facilitation payments will still be deductible. A facilitation payment involves a payment to get an official to undertake or to expedite a routine government function. 
 Examples include visas, the provision of electricity, water, telecommunications, mail services and the loading or unloading of cargo. This simply recognises the reality of dealings in some countries. Note that facilitation payments cannot extend to a business contractual matters. Labor supports these measures; they should assist Australian businesses to compete against less scrupulous competitors. They are being enacted around the world and they should therefore penalise those competitors who are paying bribes and thereby gaining an unfair advantage against honest Australian competitors.
We can all speculate about how many taxpayers honestly describe the bribes they pay as `bribes'. There would be dozens of euphemisms to cover what objectively are bribes, so one would expect that the revenue attached to these proposals would not be large. Notwithstanding the specific practical issues around this, the principle is a sound one and Labor supports these proposals. On the same principles as those for foreign officials, denial of tax deductibility should also be extended to domestic officials' bribery situations. This should level the playing field for businesses operating in Australia. We intend to pursue this matter by way of an amendment in the committee stage of this debate.
Labor is recommending to the government that the non-deductibility should be extended to domestic bribery situations—to Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments—not just to foreign situations. This is an important issue that my colleague the shadow minister for justice and customs will take up in detail in his contribution in this debate.
I want to go to an issue relevant to this, that of corruption in government and the culture of secrecy—which I have referred to in the second reading amendment—the culture of the Kennett government Victoria. There is no better description of this than on the web site of Stephen Mayne, which can be found by people who are interested at: www.jeffed.com. Stephen Mayne has a unique history as an adviser to the former Victorian Treasurer, Alan Stockdale. On this web site he raises 
 issues to do with secrecy inside the Victorian government. The first issue that concerned him as an adviser to former Treasurer Stockdale was his knowledge that the Premier was `using his position to secure unusually large allocations in hot floats'. He said:
. . . I became uncomfortable and raised these concerns with Alister Drysdale, the Premier's chief adviser at the time.
The other cause for concern that he had was the Premier's attitude to the media. He says:
He regularly and systematically courted the moguls such as Kerry Packer, Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black whilst simultaneously beating up on frontline journalists and editors where necessary.
Mr Mayne refers to the Premier's media director, Steve Murphy, gloating about a lunch with Rupert Murdoch at which, he says:
The Premier opened proceedings with a very familiar ""So, Rupert, how's your mother?""
Mr Mayne makes the point, which I think is absolutely valid, that `politicians should deal with journalists and editors, not management and proprietors'. The other part of the Premier's way of dealing with the media was, and has been, by very vicious attacks, including those on the Age . Mr Mayne says that the Premier was active in seeking to secure changes of personnel he did not like at media outlets. He goes on to say at his web site:
When David Walker was appointed state economics editor, we got a much better run in The Age and were also supported by Age business columnist, Steve Bartholomeusz, who I've disagreed with strongly over the appropriate level of criticism that should be made of Crown . . . a more critical eye should have been cast across some of the later dealings by the government, particularly in areas such as the profits generated from gambling licences, share allocations in the Transurban float and beneficiaries of government policy who subsequently donated to the Liberal Party.
Mr Mayne goes on to say:
The Premier's strategy of aggressively courting and complaining to media owners, chairmen and directors has worked profoundly in his favour . . . Basically, I believe the Premier has most commercial media outlets either in his pocket, cheering from the side or too intimidated to take him on. The others, most notably ABC television, have largely been marginalised through denial of access and vitriolic attacks. 

Mr Mayne also says in relation to his own situation as someone who resigned from the Australian Financial Review  in order to contest the recent state election:
. . . based on past performance, he or his staff have probably already made contact with Fairfax senior management and directors to argue the case that I not be reinstated at the Financial Review. AFR Editor-in-Chief and publisher Michael Gill refused to reinstate me after my nomination was ruled ineligible.
Some of the issues that Mr Mayne wished to raise and became very concerned about, given his knowledge from the inside of government, are, for example, that it was Alister Drysdale, a key person on the Premier's staff:
. . . who wrote the statement for Elliott when he first went publicly on the attack in 1993 against the NCA and the DPP. The statement lamented the ""relentless and unremitting campaign"" against Elliott who, using Drysdale's words, said the DPP had ""aided and abetted"" the NCA ""in an attempt to blacken my name"".
Mr Mayne goes on to say:
. . . the most senior member of Mr Kennett's staff should not have written statements for Elliott attacking the DPP at the same time as the Premier and Attorney General Jan Wade were planning sweeping reforms to Mr Bongiorno's office. Asked in State Parliament about this, the Premier said it was a matter for Mr Drysdale. No one ever has asked Drysdale directly if he wrote that speech and what broader role he took in Elliott's campaign. If what media manager Murphy said is true, this basically means Elliott's campaign against the DPP was partly being run out of the Premier's office. Most reasonable people would think this is inappropriate given the widely accepted doctrine known as separation of powers, whereby the judiciary should be completely independent from executive government.
Indeed, it is most ironic that some of the words that Mr Drysdale, ghostwriting for John Elliott, said in this speech were:
One of the cardinal principles of the rule of law in democratic society is that there must be a strict separation of powers between politicians and law enforcement bodies.
Stephen Mayne also comments at his web site on the issue of the Crown Casino. He comes back to Alister Drysdale, who also doubled as the Premier's special adviser on gambling, commenting to him that:
. . . Crown's application in May 1994 to triple the size of its hotel to 1000 rooms was  ""a done deal"". 
 The so-called independent Casino and Gaming Authority announced it had approved the proposal several weeks later.
It is a matter of public record that Mr Drysdale received a $62,000 discount in early 1993 on a St Kilda Road apartment, in the former BP House, which was redeveloped by Hudson Conway. Naturally, it was the casino subcommittee of cabinet, chaired by the Premier, that did the deal rather than Drysdale himself. Mr Mayne also expresses concern about the fact that Hudson Conway was involved in suing the government and doing deals with the government simultaneously. He says:
I thought it was a bit rich that the Casino Sub-Committee of Cabinet, still chaired by Mr Kennett, was doing ""deals"" with Crown when its major shareholder and manager Hudson Conway was suing another arm of the government. Only weeks earlier, HudCon lodged its $100 million claim against the government-owned Gas and Fuel Corporation . . .—
which was over the cancellation of a contract by the Gas and Fuel Corporation to build a new headquarters. He says further:
It is indeed ironic that the Coalition is still attacking Labor for losing the State Bank, when the Tricontinental chairman was given government posts and the state successfully extracted a $136 million settlement from the failed merchant bank's auditors, KPMG.
He goes on to say that the other key part in the Crown-Kennett equation was the Premier's defamation action against the Nine Network's A Current Affair , which was resolved some three months after Mr Mayne rejoined the Herald Sun . A Current Affair  had carried a story about a Melbourne water worker who had committed suicide because of changes to WorkCover introduced by the Kennett government. This was an erroneous story. When Mr Mayne raised this with the Premier's media man, Steve Murphy, on the night it was broadcast, he was abruptly told not to correct it. He was told that the Premier had attempted to call Kerry Packer and Ian Johnston, the head of the Nine Network in Melbourne, to complain about the story, and when it had not been corrected, the Premier told his wife that he was going to make them pay. 
Further down the track, we find that Steve Murphy told Mr Mayne that the Premier received a cheque for $400,000 in relation to this defamation action, that this was more than enough to pay for his renovations, which cost $300,000, and that the Premier had spoken to Kerry Packer about it directly and so it should not have taken so long to settle. Mr Mayne also says that he quoted Mr Murphy in the Financial Review earlier this year, saying the settlement was $400,000 and had paid for the renovations. There was no communication from Mr Murphy denying it or seeking clarification. You would expect this if it were inaccurate, particularly given the sensitivities of the parties involved. Mr Mayne said that it was this combination of events which first seriously pricked his concerns about the Premier.
Kerry Packer owned almost 20 per cent of Hudson Conway, about 45 per cent of the Nine Network, and almost 30 per cent of Crown at the time. As Stephen Mayne said:
The Premier should not have been simultaneously negotiating a personal payment from one part of the Packer empire while adjudicating on regulatory changes for another part, namely Crown. At the time of the settlement, Mr Packer was well over $100 million in front on his Crown/Hudson Conway investment. Given all these circumstances and varying accounts, surely the parties could agree that the public has a right to know what the settlement was and who organised and paid for the renovations, just to clear the air once and for all. It is simply too sensitive an issue to remain confidential.
This emphasises the need for vigilance against bribes to public officials.
Stephen Mayne goes on to outline the fact that Mr Alister Drysdale, the top adviser of Premier Kennett, subsequently departed to the gambling company Tattersalls on a package he told other staffers was worth $460,000 a year. He says:
This hiring came just a few months after Treasurer Alan Stockdale had written to Tattersalls seeking a retrospective fee for its lucrative gaming machine licence.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Negotiations with Tattersalls dragged on until the eve of the 1996 election, when it was announced that the beneficiaries of the late George Adams would contribute the equivalent of $422 million in today's dollars. Based on Tabcorp's share price, the 
 Tattersalls pokie licence is in fact worth more than $2 billion and it is making more than $100 million a year in profit after these additional annual licence payments.
They are in an extraordinarily good situation. Mr Stephen Mayne asks:
So what did Drysdale bring to Tattersalls? Was he a fee stopper, or a fee minimiser? A door opener, perhaps?
Stephen Mayne points out:
In the United States, it is illegal for government advisers to leave and immediately start working as lobbyists or advisers for companies negotiating with government. As far as I know, no-one has ever asked the government or Tattersalls what role Mr Drysdale had in negotiations.
He then turns to Ron Walker. He says:
I had a problem with Ron Walker being many tens of millions of dollars in front on his Hudson Conway shares thanks to Crown and also being the primary fund raiser for the Liberal Party and one of the Premier's closest personal friends. As the man who personally brought the Grand Prix to Melbourne without any Cabinet or Treasury scrutiny, I felt his prediction on the day the coup was announced that it would cost $10 million to establish the course and would run at an annual profit should have somehow been binding to him. When the public costs started mounting, I can remember Steve Murphy telling me that Ron had said in one meeting ""It would be different if it was private money"" . . . ""the Treasurer nearly fell off his chair"".
Stephen Mayne says:
Given that Mr Walker has made about $30 million out of Crown and taxpayers have spent more than $100 million on the Grand Prix and related infrastructure, I felt Mr Walker should have been held more accountable for the huge blowout. If it was good enough for him to personally take over a $4 million Liberal Party debt, then why shouldn't he also have personally contributed to the Grand Prix blowout he never predicted, especially given his casino profits. Ron Walker is so close to the Premier, this is never going to happen.
Mr Mayne also talks about some of the Premier's personal investments. I may not have time to go into them in the detail that would be appropriate, but one that ought to be mentioned is where he rang the former Stock Exchange chairman, Laurie Cox, and secured some 20,000 Yates shares for his wife. Mr Mayne alleges that Mr Kennett used his position to make a $7,000 profit in the name of Mrs Kennett, and he described Mr Cox as 
 one of his brokers. This is interesting because Mr Cox is also chairman of the world's biggest toll road company, Transurban, a position he was supported into by the Premier. Mr Mayne says:
The Transurban float is the best example I've ever seen of fat cats and insiders making millions from a business which relies on ordinary citizens paying up . . . Mr Cox has profited to the tune of more than $2 million. So one of the Premier's brokers has made $2 million out of Transurban, yet no-one in the Melbourne media seems to care.
For these reasons, we will be moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage concerning bribes to Australian government officials, and we hope this is something which would strengthen the hand of the tax office.
In the remaining minutes open to me, I will briefly comment on some other issues in this bill. For friendly societies, the bill proposes to keep the current tax rate for the 1999-2000 year and then raise it for the 2000-01 year, when the business tax reforms are currently scheduled to commence. This is a measure which Labor supports.
The bill will exempt from tax the amount of post-judgment interest in personal injury compensation cases. This issue has arisen from the Whitaker case, where Mrs Whitaker became blind, and it was held that post-judgment interest was taxable income. Frankly, the government's delay in addressing this issue is quite unacceptable. This is a measure which will cost $14 million this year and $2 million in future years. It is strongly supported by Labor. We assume that the $14 million cost this year reflects the refund of tax paid back to those unfortunate enough to have been caught up in the net already. The minister might like to clarify that point when he sums up at the end of this debate.
The fifth item in the bill is controlled foreign corporations and capital gains tax. There is the closing of a loophole, ensuring that capital gains tax is payable on assets held by these controlled foreign corporations. This is an important issue in terms of the future integrity of the tax system and has the full support of Labor. Item six is dividend imputation. There are a series of amendments covering anti-avoidance provisions concerning the dividend imputation system. These matters are 
 highly complex. We want to have a look at them in the Senate. They are not opposed in principle by us, but we do want to look closely at what they mean.
Item seven is the company law review. There are a couple of categories of amendments proposed, flowing from the reform of company law to eliminate the concept of par value of shares. We proposed this reform and supported its introduction. But in relation to the tax avoidance possibilities that are opened up by it, the measures now before the House protect the revenue base and are supported by the opposition. Item eight is company loss provisions. At this stage, this proposal is not opposed in principle. We will have some further exploration of this provision in the Senate.
Item nine is the extension of family trust election. The bill will allow an extension of time for a family trust to make a family trust election in order to take advantage of other provisions in this bill that I have previously mentioned. Trusts and their tax avoidance opportunities are the favoured vehicles of this government. Yesterday, yet again, we saw the Treasurer squib on tackling the taxation of trusts. It is something that the government says it is going to do. It promised before the election that it would do it, but in fact the government has put off tackling this issue again. We are told that this is going to be addressed the year after next.
So hardworking Australians get the GST next year; tax avoiders get let off again. This is a disgraceful set of priorities by this government, always with the same objective: shifting the tax burden away from those who have the greatest capacity to pay to those who have no choice but to pay. As I pointed out earlier, this is a government which is full of ministers with trusts who have a permanent conflict of interest in terms of dealing with this issue. Indeed, it is more important to this Treasurer to tax a takeaway sandwich than it is to deal with tax avoidance through trusts.
I do not have time to go into detail on the issues to do with business tax, but I think other speakers on this side of the House may make some observations about business tax. We are concerned about the lack of fine print 
 in the government's proposals. There are all the signs of a smoke and mirrors piece of trickery. It is disgraceful that a government which made much of the Charter of Budget Honesty refuses to provide information about where the revenue is coming from to balance the package and make it revenue neutral, as the government claimed it would be.
I would like to foreshadow amendments that will be moved in the committee stage of this debate, which will limit tax deductions to $100 for donations of property to political parties and extend non-deductibility for bribes to bribes paid to Australian government officials. We will explore these important issues at a later stage of this debate.
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—I will confine my remarks to some of the issues raised by the member for Wills on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  rather than his motion to amend, which to me does not touch on the bill but it certainly did give the member for Wills an opportunity to continue to vent the `Jeff obsession'.
There is no one theme to this bill, it being a series of measures intended to deal with a whole range of taxation issues, some rather technical amendments and some as a result of anomalies in the current law. All in all there are some 10 separate issues within this amendment bill. At a time when the government has introduced wide-sweeping changes to business taxation consequent upon the Ralph review, there are still many aspects to our current laws that require amendment or review.
The member for Wills did not touch in any detail on much of the bill, so we are obviously getting it right. I must admit that reading through this bill was rather like eating an artichoke: it looked pretty unpalatable reading at first, but as you peeled off the layers it became increasingly tasty. But it seems I will only have time to devour a few of its leaves, for there is an enormous amount of detail involved—perhaps best evidenced by the fact 
 that the explanatory memorandum itself runs to about 110 pages.
I believe that some of the issues I will address will be of interest and will certainly be welcomed by those in the Curtin electorate, including: the treatment of certain post judgment interests, which responds very quickly to a recent full Federal Court decision; non-deductibility of bribes, which might sound self-evident but it is a response to an OECD initiative; and amendments to encourage greater philanthropy by allowing certain tax deductions—this being in line with the government's commitment to introduce measures to encourage the further growth of philanthropy in this country.
I will start with the last mentioned first. The government has been committed to encouraging greater philanthropy in corporate circles since coming to office and has sought to foster a greater philanthropic commitment to arts and culture in this country. In view of the suspicions voiced by the member for Wills as to the motive, I restate the obvious. The government identifies corporate sponsorship as complementary to federal government support of the arts so that there can be an overall increase in total funding of the cultural sector. It is true that, through enlightened self-interest, many businesses in Australia contribute in this way now to the community, including to the arts and cultural sectors. But the government must lead the way and enhance the opportunities.
In March 1998 the Business and Community Partnerships Round Table was convened by the Prime Minister, and it came up with a number of recommendations. In March of this year—12 months later—the Prime Minister announced that the government would establish a new body to encourage partnerships and philanthropy in Australia. More recently, he announced the membership of the Prime Minister's Community Business Partnership, which he will chair. Eleven prominent Australians have agreed to be part of the partnership, which is to play an important role in developing a new social coalition for Australia by fostering new partnerships between community, government and business. I was particularly pleased to see the range of inter 
 ests, backgrounds and experience of the members comprising the partnership, including a constituent from the Curtin electorate, Mr Tony Howarth of Challenge Bank in Western Australia, who I know will provide to the group an extremely sound business and financial perspective.
Against those objectives the taxation regime must be compatible. The philanthropy provisions in this bill result from the government's announcement of a $51 million package of taxation measures to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy in Australia. It is intended that the initial annual revenue cost will rise over time as these measures encourage the further growth of corporate philanthropy.
Specifically, the Income Tax Assessment Act will be amended to allow an income tax deduction to certain funds, authorities and institutions and to political parties for gifts of property worth more than $5,000, regardless of how or when the property was acquired. The amendments will provide a capital gains tax exemption for testamentary gifts of property to certain funds, authorities and institutions and to political parties unless the property is reacquired by the estate, a beneficiary of the estate or an associate. It will provide a capital gains tax exemption for gifts of property made under the cultural gifts program unless the property is reacquired for less than the market value by the donor or an associate. It will allow the apportionment of deductions for donations made under the cultural gifts program over a period of up to five income years and will allow concessional taxation treatment for specified private funds which will not be required to seek donations from the public but which will be subject to the other requirements applying to public funds.
Currently taxpayers are entitled to tax deductions for certain gifts or contributions, as set out in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and certain donations made to listed recipients are eligible for tax deductibility, the recipients being gift deductible organisations. The cultural gifts program encourages gifts of significant cultural items to public art galleries, museums and libraries. It offers donors a tax deduction for 
 the market value of their gifts. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts administers the program with the advice of the committee on taxation incentives for the arts.
Donors are required to ensure that the public collecting institution of their choice is eligible to participate in the program and that it will accept a gift for its collection. Currently, two valuations of the market value of the gift are required. Following valuation, presentation and endorsement, the donor can then claim the average of the valuations as a tax deduction for the financial year in which the gift was made, unless otherwise advised by the committee. So the new provision in division 30 of the act will allow apportionment of deductions for gifts made under the cultural gifts program over a maximum of five income years and this apportionment applies to deductions for gifts made on or after 1 July 1999.
Specifically, the recipients under the cultural gifts program are the Australiana Fund, any public libraries, any public museums, any public art gallery in Australia and the Commonwealth for the purposes of Artbank. In Western Australia we have some fine collecting institutions in the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Western Australia Museum and the Battye Library—all well-deserving beneficiaries of philanthropic support. I believe that these amendments will add stimulus to those wishing to contribute to our national cultural and heritage collections and to ensuring the viability of our collecting institutions. They are measures that will be welcomed by many who contribute in this way or who wish to do so.
As to the other amendments, deductions for gifts of property valued at more than $5,000, the schedule to the bill will amend the table of deductible gifts and contributions to allow a tax deduction for gifts of property valued by the Commissioner of Taxation at more than $5,000. This relates to recipients that are funds, authorities or institutions specified as public funds—broadly, funds that are open for subscription by the public and to which the public can contribute. A public fund is not actually defined in the act but case law has 
 established that a fund will be public where it is the intention of the promoters or the founders that the public will contribute to the fund, that the public—or a significant part of it—does in fact contribute to the fund, and that the public participates in the administration of the fund.
There is also an amendment to allow deductions for gifts made to specified private funds. The member for Wills questions the accountability of charities, for example. He overlooks that, while a prescribed private fund does not have to comply with the requirement of public funds in seeking and receiving contributions from the public, it will have to comply with all other requirements of the public fund. This will mean that individuals and corporations will be able to establish funds for philanthropic purposes without advertising for public contributions. I think the member for Wills was somewhat uncharitable in his assessment of these measures. I believe this to be a measure that will see an increase in personal and corporate philanthropy that perhaps will begin to mirror in some way the extraordinary levels of private philanthropy that underpin much of the cultural and artistic life in the United States, for example. This will be of benefit to generations of Australians. But the government needs to set the environment and stimulate growth in the area.
The second matter about which the member for Wills spoke is the amendment to the act to disallow deductions for bribes made to foreign public officials. It may seem to most right-thinking members of the Australian business community that such a provision need have no place in our domestic tax laws. Most certainly the government considers that the Australian business community has high ethical standards in general. But we are increasingly carrying on business in other countries. It is an increasingly global marketplace and Australian business and industry is evident around the world. I do note the support for this measure as articulated by the member for Wills.
Australia is also one of the 29 member countries of the OECD, an organisation that provides governments of the countries com 
 mitted to a market economy and a pluralistic democracy a setting in which to discuss, develop and perfect economic and social policies. The OECD recognised that corruption is internationally a major problem in society that is capable of endangering the stability and security of societies and undermining the value of democracy and morality. It recognised that corruption has the potential to threaten social, economic and political development in some countries. This holds true both at domestic and international levels. So, with the growing globalisation of markets and of services, goods and people, there has been an accompanying internationalisation of illegal activities and an increase in the international dimension of corruption. Accordingly, reducing corruption has become a priority at both national and international levels in countries, including those which are members of the OECD.
The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery in International Business Transactions went into effect on 15 February this year. The convention was signed by all 29 OECD members, and commits the members, as well as five non-OECD member countries which signed the convention, to adopt common rules to punish companies and individuals who engage in bribery transactions. The convention and an associated recommendation represent important steps in the concerted international effort to criminalise bribery and reduce rampant corruption in world economies. It aims to stop the flow of bribe money for the purpose of obtaining international business deals and to strengthen domestic anticorruption efforts—all aimed at raising standards of governments and increasing civil society participation—a worthy objective.
The OECD convention makes it a crime to offer, promise or give a bribe to a foreign public official in order to obtain or to retain international business deals. The convention also effectively puts an end to the practice affording tax deductibility for bribe payments made to foreign officials.
Australia, as a signatory to that convention, has made recent amendments to the criminal code which make it a criminal offence to pay bribes to foreign public officials. Under these 
 amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act, a taxpayer will be regarded as having made a bribe to a foreign public official to the extent that an amount is incurred in providing a benefit to a person where the benefit is not legitimately due to that person, and the amount is incurred with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of that official's duties in order to obtain or retain business or an advantage in the conduct of business.
Currently our laws allow deductions for losses and outgoings that are incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable outcome, or that are necessarily incurred in the carrying on of the business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. The act does not differentiate between expenditure in pursuing an illegal or a legal income-producing activity. Therefore, theoretically, the payment of a bribe to a foreign public official could be an allowable deduction if the payment otherwise satisfies the requirements set out in the act. The test to be introduced in this amendment that the taxpayer incurs is the intention of influencing the foreign public official in the exercise of the official's duties.
There are, of course, circumstances where legitimate payments are made to foreign officials. In order to prevent a taxpayer being denied a deduction in those circumstances, the amendment proposes that an amount will not be treated as a bribe to a foreign official if no person would have breached a law of that particular foreign country. We of course have a self-assessment tax system and it is unlikely that an Australian taxpayer will have a detailed knowledge of foreign criminal laws to meet this requirement, but, if a taxpayer has been asked to make payments to foreign officials, obviously prudence would dictate that one would obtain advice on whether such a payment to a foreign official is in fact a criminal offence in that particular country.
There are of course exceptions. One of the proposed subsections deals with facilitation payments which treat amounts as not being bribes paid to foreign officials if they are paid for the sole or main purpose of obtaining routine minor government action. This phrase is defined as meaning that the action of the 
 official is that ordinarily performed by the official and the action is listed in a specific list of activities.
It is obvious that the act was not ever intended to enable deductions for illegal activities in international business transactions but, theoretically, if we allow a tax deduction for what turns out to be a bribe to a foreign public official, by retaining this position on the statute books we would contribute unwittingly to a perception that such payments are an acceptable practice for those trading in the international business community. This amendment will align Australia's tax position with the other OECD member countries who have also committed themselves to ensuring that their national parliaments pass legislation to end the practice, or indeed the theory, of allowing tax deductibility for bribe payments made to foreign officials. This will be of interest to people doing business overseas and to their financial or taxation or, indeed, legal advisers. The proposed amendments therefore implement the recommendation of the OECD council and they satisfy the federal government and the community expectations of our contribution to a more equitable and efficient world market. 
The third matter to which I will address some comment—although the member for Wills did not specifically address this in detail—is the amendment to exempt certain post-judgment interest received in personal injury compensation cases, which is again a matter of considerable interest to all parties involved, or to be involved, in such cases—plaintiffs, insurers, the legal profession.
The correct tax treatment of an amount received as an award of damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident has exercised the minds of lawyers and legal writers for some time. There has been case law as well as commissioners' rulings on the tax treatment of awards of damages. The position regarding the tax treatment of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest has been the subject of even further debate. In Whitaker v. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation, the Federal Court of Australia at first instance held that pre-judgment interest, although included in the overall award, was 
 assessable income. The matter went to the full court of the Federal Court who overturned that decision. The reasoning of the full court in the Whitaker case was that the whole amount, including interest, is awarded for the loss of income earning capacity—that is, for the loss of a capital asset—and therefore the full amount is of a capital nature and accordingly it is all exempt under the Income Tax Assessment Act.
The interest is a quantification of the compensation due to the plaintiff for the loss or detriment suffered by being kept out of his or her money during the relevant period. If the plaintiff had received his or her entitlement at the time the cause of action arose, the plaintiff could have chosen to use the money however he or she wished to alleviate the pain and suffering.
The full court in Whitaker's case then confirmed that post-judgment interest was a separate matter and found that interest to be assessable income. The payment of such interest could arise where the original decision is the subject of an appeal and payment by the defendant is delayed until the liability to pay the award is confirmed on appeal. So it awaits the outcome of all of the avenues of appeal. Interest would accrue in the period between the handing down of the original judgment and the eventual date of payment to the plaintiff—and that can be some years in some cases.
The position was therefore that the whole amount of damages, including components for loss of income and superannuation in the past and in the future, and pre-judgment interest, was a capital receipt and was exempt from capital gains tax. But the post-judgment scenario was deemed to be assessable income by virtue of the full court in Whitaker's case.
The member for Wills speaks of a delay, which is an absurd thing to say. The judgment was in 1998. The minister announced the proposal earlier this year and the impact of the proposal will date back to the 1992-93 tax year when Mrs Whitaker should have been paid the sum, but the matter went on appeal. Hence these amendments seek to exempt from income tax post-judgment interest received in personal injury compensation cases where 
 there is delay in payment awaiting the outcome of any or all avenues of appeal. This is a fair and equitable outcome to those who have had to wait, often for many years, for the full payment of damages and interest consequent upon a decision in their favour of an award of damages.
There are seven other aspects to the bill containing equally interesting changes to the tax laws, but time does not permit anything other than this small offering. I commend the entirety of the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, you can tell this is a tax bill. We have about three times as many advisers in the advisers' box as we have members in the House.
The member for Wills has outlined the opposition's general approach to the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  as a whole and has circulated a second reading amendment. That has been seconded by the member for Rankin who, when he makes his contribution, will I am sure go through the full array of the bill in detail. There are two issues which I want to draw attention to. The first is the proposal to increase the deductibility of a donation to a political party from $1,500 to $5,000. Here I wear my former party official's cap, on the old adage `once a party official, always a party official'.
This legislation is linked, in a sense, to legislation which has been presented by the government to increase by a comparable amount from $1,500 to $5,000 the size of a non-disclosable donation. Talking in terms of public policy crimes, it is probably the case that it is a far greater public policy crime to increase the size of this non-disclosable donation from $1,500 to $5,000, than it is to increase the amount to which deductibility applies. So the fact that this amendment to increase the deductibility from $1,500 to $5,000 follows on from legislation which the government has presented to increase the non-disclosable amount from $1,500 to $5,000, makes it doubly offensive in policy terms.
The hallmark of our political system in Australia ought to be that if people make donations to political parties then those donations are disclosed. That is the primary 
 objective, which this government has run away from both when in opposition and now in government. I will not labour the point about the Greenfields Foundation and the obvious rort in that respect, but I make the point that this particular measure in this tax bill follows on from a government measure to increase the non-disclosable size of a donation to a political party from $1,500 to $5,000. That runs counter to a sensible public policy regime which says that donations to political parties ought to be disclosed and therefore on the public record, for the obvious point that if there is going to be a conflict of interest it is there for all to see.
For all the differences we might have had at the Commonwealth level about public policy over almost a century of federation, from time to time in the state arena—in different states over different times with different political parties—state administrations have got into trouble in the donations area. That is for two reasons. Firstly, they have not had at the appropriate time comparable disclosure measures as the Commonwealth has had and, secondly, there is a far greater measure and diversity of scrutiny at the Commonwealth level. But the primary bulwark of that diversity and scrutiny when it comes to donations is the disclosure regime. I make that point about the increase in the deductible amount for donations to political parties because it is linked to the government's measure to move away from the disclosable nature of such donations.
The second area that I want to comment on briefly is the corporate philanthropy measures. I am in favour of increasing corporate philanthropy in Australia. While I am always naturally chary to pat the Prime Minister on the back, from time to time he may well pop up with something which, at its heart, is a good or benevolent measure. For example, the United States has a very well-honed culture of corporate philanthropy. In Australia, we have none of that. So a measure which seeks to change the culture I think is worth supporting and worth doing.
The key point about corporate philanthropy is that it can never be an excuse for not having public policy philanthropy or for bad 
 public policy, or for not having public policy philanthropy expressed through the statutes of this parliament. I will mention a couple of anecdotes. In addition to being a former party official, I am a lapsed lawyer. Like lapsed lawyers, I have in the past done my share of voluntary duty counsel and pro bono work. The legal profession I come from in Western Australia has a very fine tradition of doing that. The former member for Pearce in this place, Fred Chaney Jr, was one of the people who, from nothing, helped establish a very rigorous Law Society of Western Australia duty counsel regime. That was to his credit, as it was to the profession's credit. But that was not and could never be a substitute for decent public policy which gave rise to a decent legal aid regime. While corporate or business philanthropy can be an appropriate and desirable and acceptable contribution, it cannot be a substitute for good public policy.
The same applies in the health area. I can remember, when I was very much younger—probably at the same time that the minister at the table, Mr Abbott, was at university—sitting having a cup of tea—it was probably a beer—on a veranda in Cottesloe in the western suburbs of Perth, which are entirely different from the western suburbs of Sydney, as the minister at the table would know. However, I can remember at that time having the argument made to me by the daughter of a medical practitioner that because her father did voluntary medical work that was a substitute for the proposed introduction of a Medicare regime. So somehow the benevolence of community oriented good doctors was a substitute for decent public policy in health, namely making sure that decent health care was available as a matter of course and of right to individuals, irrespective of income and irrespective of whether or not medical practitioners decide to be benevolent.
The point I make with these two examples is that to promote and encourage corporate philanthropy is of itself a good thing, but it is no substitute for public policy. On the one hand, the Prime Minister stands up and encourages philanthropy by way of taxation incentives and, on the other, he implements a public policy regime from day one in office 
 where he withdraws sensible public policy and sensible services which benefit, through this parliament, the vast bulk of the Australian people, whether that be the withdrawal of services from rural and regional Australia or the imposition of an unfair consumption tax regime.
I do not propose to go through the detail of the proposed legislation, other than to make the point that I assume that this tax bill—like just about every other bill that goes through this place—regrettably or otherwise, will be referred to a Senate committee. There are a number of points of detail which are worth looking at. In any taxation legislation the devil is in the detail and the same applies to these measures in respect of corporate philanthropy. Some of those points of detail will go to whether the taxation concession, for example, should be provided to the estate of a taxpayer and what accountability measures, nomination measures or approval measures ought to go to the proposed mechanism for private funds. So there are some points of detail which are worth seriously considering, and I suspect they will be considered in the committee process in another place.
The provision of a taxation deduction for contributions to a political party being increased from $1,500 to $5,000 is wrong because it parallel tracks or mirrors the government's move to remove the disclosure requirements for that comparable amount; secondly, corporate philanthropy is a good cultural change to seek to imbue in the Australian business and general community, but it can never be a substitute for sensible public policy. In my experience, that sensible public policy which benefits the vast bulk of Australians only ever comes from our side in this chamber.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—I rise to support the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999 , which seeks to amend the taxation law. It is appropriate that some of the measures have been discussed in this chamber today. The bill contains a series of amendments which I believe would have the support of the community. Part of the bill involves amending the control of foreign company rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It 
 also enables those tainted capital gains to be taken into account when applying the active income tax and it also relates to the franking of dividends. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to make a number of corrections to the franking credit trading and dividend streaming rules, and these changes will apply from the commencement of the measures. It also relates to the non-deductibility of bribes, questions of corporate philanthropy and company law review amendments. All of these provisions are worth while, and I will return to the question of corporate philanthropy.
The provision in the bill which particularly attracts my attention concerns a couple living in my electorate—and that is the amendment to the income tax law to exempt post-judgment interest received in personal injury compensation cases from income tax where the interest accrued from a time a judgment debt arises until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted. The amendment will apply from the 1992-93 year of income. This will allow taxpayers who have already paid tax on post-judgment interest in recent years to obtain a refund.
This aspect of the bill has come about because of a bitter struggle between one of my constituents, Mrs Maree Whitaker, and the Australian Taxation Office. I commend the Treasurer and the government for making these amendments and for responding to what happened in the courts. They saw there was an injustice and they took it into account. It has been a difficult case for Mrs Whitaker. I have met the Whitakers—both Mrs Whitaker and her husband Norm. This was a case where justice won out in the end. Not only did justice win out but also the fact that Mrs Whitaker was prepared to take this to the wire—it was eventually taken to the High Court—to stand up and defend her rights, means that it is a win for everybody in a similar situation throughout Australia. This is a particularly significant amendment because of that.
 In 1984, Mrs Whitaker underwent an operation for a corneal graft in one eye. The operation went badly but, worse still, she lost the sight of the other eye. The basis of her 
 case was that she was not warned by her surgeon of the likelihood that a graft in one eye may affect the sight of the other. As a result, she lost her sight and now she cannot differentiate night from day. She brought proceedings against her surgeon in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In these proceedings she claimed damages against the surgeon for negligence. In addition, she claimed for interest pursuant to section 94 of the Supreme Court Act. Mrs Whitaker's case was eventually heard by Justice Campbell of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the decision was handed down in Mrs Whitaker's favour—in the sum of $808,000. The judgment included an amount of $65,000, representing the interest.
Mrs Whitaker's surgeon appealed to the New South Wales Court of Appeal. His appeal was unsuccessful. He then appealed, with leave, to the High Court of Australia, and again the appeal was dismissed. Subsequently, Mrs Whitaker received interest on the verdict for the period 13 August 1990 to 19 November 1992, agreed upon as being $208,671.
Mrs Whitaker became entitled to pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest in respect of claims for damages for personal injury. The pre-judgment interest compensates a plaintiff for being deprived of money between the date the action arose and the date of judgment. The interest is calculated on a sum that is not known until the date of judgment and is part of the underlying cause of action. Post-judgment interest is paid to compensate a taxpayer for being deprived of the judgment award between the date of judgment and the completion of the appeal process. If a defendant unsuccessfully appeals a judgment, he or she may be liable for post-judgment interest. As Mrs Whitaker's surgeon was unsuccessful in his High Court appeal, Mrs Whitaker was awarded post-judgment interest for the period from the date of the judgment to the completion of the High Court appeal. I make the point that this judgment money is not some windfall that came Mrs Whitaker's way but rather damages awarded to her to compensate her for damage and loss, 
 to give her some financial security in her later years.
After this amount was awarded, the Commissioner of Taxation contended that the amount paid to Mrs Whitaker and the amount of post-judgment interest payable under section 95 of the act were income in ordinary concepts. Of course, Mrs Whitaker considered this amount to be of a capital nature and thus not assessable income. In Mrs Whitaker's case, the taxpayer was found to be assessable on her post-judgment interest but not the pre-judgment interest. The distinction between the two for tax purposes was that the post-judgment interest was paid in respect of a known principal sum whereas pre-judgment interest relates to an unknown principal amount.
The case was reported in the media and depicted as being a harsh result for the taxpayer—and rightly so, may I say. This couple, who live at Miranda in my electorate, have had a particularly difficult time in this regard. It was harsh for the Taxation Office to impose a taxation on the interest she received because her surgeon, unsuccessful in the New South Wales Supreme Court, took it to the High Court, so she was unable to get the money. When she finally did get the money and was entitled to the interest, the tax office said, `You can pay tax on that amount.'
Fortunately, the government took note of what was happening in the court. Normally it goes through as a legal process. The government decided that to take this action was unfair and unconscionable conduct. The government has reviewed the taxation treatment of post-judgment interest and concluded that post-judgment interest does form part of the assessable income in the year in which it was received. The government has decided to amend the income tax law to exempt such interest from taxation. This is part of the amendments today. The purpose of the amendments is to exempt from income tax post-judgment interest received in personal injury compensation cases. This will ensure that, where individuals have suffered injuries and there has been a delay in receiving the compensation, they will not be taxed on the interest that they receive because of the delay brought about through no fault of their own— 
a delay brought about by the plaintiff who takes an appeal to another jurisdiction. They will be entitled to receive that interest without being further taxed. The proposed amendments will provide a fair and equitable taxation treatment for post-judgment interest. They will provide an equivalent or more generous taxation treatment than currently exists in other jurisdictions.
The basic principle in relation to the assessment of damages under the common law is that damages are supposed to place the injured person in the position in which that person would have been had he or she not been injured, as far as this can be done by the payment of money. A claim for damages is made up of various heads of judgment in terms of pain and suffering, past loss of income, future loss of income and the like. Because there is this delay, the interest factor becomes involved in the whole equation.
We have a situation where Mrs Maree Whitaker has suffered considerable personal loss. She was not warned of the possible damage to the sight of her other eye if she undertook this corneal graft. As a result, she is permanently blind and with no possible chance of reversal of her current situation. I am very glad that the fact that it was allowed to go right to the High Court, that the surgeon took it that far and yet still lost—lost twice—has come to the public attention. Clearly, Mrs Whitaker, who undertook this operation in 1984, had to wait until 1992 until she actually saw any of the money, despite all the changes that she and her husband needed to make to their home in Miranda and their own lifestyle and the fact that she lost all possibilities of future occupation and the damages that that involved. To be then taxed on the basis of the payment which she received from the courts was to add insult to injury.
Through these provisions, which are only one part of the provisions in the bill today, this anomaly can be reversed. I am very pleased that the government has taken on board an issue which should not have been allowed to happen in the first place. There is a need for compassion in these cases. It is a great pity that the tax office took this line of action. But it has been resolved, and I am 
 delighted to see that to be the case. I wish Norm and Maree Whitaker a long life together and that Mrs Whitaker overcomes the difficulties that she has experienced. At least she receives compensation for her injury and can receive the interest payment without the tax office having its own share of that revenue.
It is also appropriate that I make a comment in regard to the question of corporate philanthropy. There are provisions here of taxation incentives for personal and corporate philanthropy in Australia. It is one of the features of Australian life that Australians are generous in support of aid agencies when there is a cause there. Even though we have the cynical nature of Australians, when Australians do believe in something they are better in giving than many countries around the world. In their support for the aid agencies, whether it be World Vision or Australian Aid Abroad, they are very generous.
Sometimes it is disappointing to see that some companies are not as generous as we would like them to be. It was one of the observations of the recent inquiry into the retail sector that one of the disappointments in rural and regional centres was that the majors, Woolworths, Coles and Franklins, did not get involved in philanthropy in local communities. While they may have given on an overall basis—I know that Woolworths have given to Sydney Children's Hospital and Coles, likewise, to various worthwhile activities, the Salvation Army, et cetera—approaches by local communities were normally rejected. This was experienced by local communities that we visited in this process whereas we found that in the past many of the small stores provided assistance to the Brownies and the Guides and provided football jumpers to the teams, et cetera. One of the comments that has been made by both Dennis Eck and Roger Corbett is that they now understand that part of the problem is their lack of involvement in the local community with assisting charities and various community groups, and I do believe we will see a change on their part as a result of the inquiry. To have a bill that will actually assist this process is to be supported. If you look at the 
 US, for example, there is a major program of corporate philanthropy there. Company employees are encouraged to donate significantly to support charities, and there are many successful programs and campaigns under way.
I note the comments of the opposition member before me saying that all worthwhile initiatives come from his side of the House. I take issue with that. There are many issues that have been developed by this government which do show our compassion. I have outlined one of them today. No one side of politics has complete control of all that is good and worth while and shows compassion in our community. This concern with those in the community runs deep on both sides of the House, and there are many of my colleagues who show deep compassion to the community.
My final comment is on the questions that have been raised as a result of the amendment today. It seems as though the opposition are floundering on the very day on which we have all the major newspapers in the country coming out and supporting the taxation changes proposed by the government. We have this somewhat pathetic attempt to condemn the government for a raft of measures, the ANTS package and various taxation measures. The fact is that the opposition have been left behind in the process of taxation reform, and some amendments that they wish to make today will not save them from the corporate view that they have missed the boat. The most significant reforms to taxation that this country has seen since Federation have been put in place by this government by way of both the ANTS package and the Ralph reforms which were announced yesterday by the Treasurer. There is no second prize. The opposition have cut themselves out of the agenda by not debating the key issues but more acting like some sort of mean-minded accountants going through a litany of small technical questions rather than being involved in the overall debate. The amendments today will highlight that poverty of understanding of what is required to provide real incentives to the business community in this country. As 
 someone who comes with some reputation from New South Wales—
—A reputation?
—A fine reputation as someone who did an excellent job in New South Wales. I note the comment made in the amendment that `Jeff Kennett has received a strong rebuke from the voters of Victoria due to his championing of the GST'. This is somewhat amazing, having seen no mention in any of the papers about that being a factor. So a good try but it has no validity. There is also mention in the amendment of `excessive secrecy and nobbling of the Auditor-General'. If we want to talk about excessive secrecy and nobbling of the Auditor-General, I suggest we also look at New South Wales, which has been subject to some considerable criticism by the Auditor-General for excessive secrecy. It has been criticised continually in editorials in the Sydney Morning Herald  for its failure to disclose information. So by all means have a debate on excessive secrecy, but if we do have such a debate let us put all the cards on the table and let us see which states are lacking in this regard. New South Wales clearly has a lot to answer for in terms of excessive secrecy the way the current Carr government operates.
Overall, I would like to say how much I support the provisions in this bill. Obviously it clears up many of the anomalies that we have in the tax act, but also from my point of view it has two outstanding provisions: first, encouraging corporate philanthropy and, secondly, removing the anomaly so that those people who receive compensation through the courts for personal injury are not disadvantaged through the tax office taking its share in taxation revenue from the interest payment because of delayed judgments and decisions. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I wish to speak to the Labor amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999 . In particular I want to spend some time talking about the government's disgraceful backsliding on the taxation treatment of trusts. The government's record on this matter is a very sorry history. In 1995 the then Labor government introduced in the parliament 
 specific amendments to the legislation that dealt with particular aspects of the taxation of trusts. That legislation went to the Senate and the Democrats and the now government—the Liberal and National parties—combined to put it off into some sort of Senate inquiry and ended up killing that particular piece of legislation.
Since this government has come into office, it has spoken long and loud about the crying need to do something about the taxation of trusts, but every time it speaks it defers. On the one hand it says, `We must do something,' but within months, if not weeks, of those pronouncements the measures that it talks about are deferred. Yet again, in the release of the government's response to the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, there has been a deferral of changes to the taxation treatment of trusts—a large area of revenue lost and a large area of tax avoidance which urgently needs addressing.
To his credit Mr Ralph, in his review, actually recommended that measures to deal with this problem of tax minimisation and avoidance through trusts come into effect from 1 July 2000. I do give credit to Mr Ralph for making that recommendation. Yet this is the same legislation about which, as reported in the Australian in an article by Glenn Milne, the then Leader of the National Party of Australia and Deputy Prime Minister declared in a party room meeting a few months ago, `We will kill this in cabinet.' The National Party has enjoyed spectacular success!
There are around 17 holders of trusts on the government front bench. Those 17 holders of trusts, who enjoy the benefits of tax minimisation through this particular vehicle, have obviously formed themselves into a special taxation review committee of the cabinet. Each and every one of those members who holds those trusts would be a member of this taxation review committee. They would be saying, `We have had a wonderful victory today.' They would not miss being a member of that committee for quids.
In the announcement by the Treasurer yesterday, he said the key changes to business tax include:
Implementing the entity tax arrangements outlined in A New Tax System  (including the taxation of trusts like companies, but with removal of the inter-corporate dividend rebate rather than the reintroduction of a deferred company tax.)
That seems like good news. This is one of the measures that those opposite reaffirm. But this is what they talked about at the last election. It was going to be in the ANTS package, it was going to be part of the legislation implementing the ANTS package; but no, the decision then was to defer that to the business tax review.
When you read the first couple of pages of the Treasurer's press release of yesterday you think that at last they are doing something about this very big problem of leakage of revenue from the tax system. But, when I went over to page 3, to my dismay I read that the government will defer until 1 July 2001 the commencement of some major elements of the package, notably most of the redesigned company tax arrangements including the consistent treatment of entities. In other words, it is deferring—against the recommendations of Mr Ralph—an attack on tax avoidance through the use of trusts. He says to implement it from 1 July 2000, but those in government announce, `No, we are going to defer it to 1 July 2001.' Okay, let us have some evidence of their bona fides that this is a deferral for one year and not into the never-never. That evidence is not forthcoming because there is no legislation. They have not put into this parliament or have not even shown the parliament the legislation that they propose to deal with this. Why? Because the National Party and the 17 holders of trusts have had a great victory in killing this in the cabinet room, as they declared they would.
The implications of this continued condoning of tax avoidance are very profound indeed. If we go to the one solitary table in the Treasurer's attachments to the announcements that he made yesterday and add up the overall impact of the concessions that the government has offered in the business tax review, we see that adds up to $3,820 million. That is a really large hole in the budget. That is $3,820 million over the period covered in the table, which is from the current year through to 2004-05.
The next line beneath that is headed `Impact of deferred measures'. That includes the ever-elusive attack on tax minimisation through trusts. The figures are not disaggregated. But if we add together the amounts for the various years in that same period—the revenue that could be obtained from these initiatives—we see the figure is $4,220 million, which is actually considerably larger than the cost of the package.
A most alarming footnote is attached to that. It says the revenue from the deferred measures `is dependent upon the time of implementation'. If the government were genuine about implementing the antitrust legislation from 1 July 2001, it  could put in firm figures there. But obviously some people,  probably Treasury officials, have had the integrity to indicate that the timing is uncertain; the timing has not been determined for the implementation of this legislation. We now have a new chapter in the `Charter of budget dishonesty' and that is that you can count the money from measures such as the attack on trusts if the Treasurer happens to express a disposition towards doing so.
That point is reinforced today in the Australian Financial Review in an opinion piece by Alan Kohler where he says:
Treasurer Peter Costello has pioneered a new technique in tax policy announcement: you defer the nasty measures for ""further consideration"" but still count the proceeds from them.
The business tax changes announced yesterday look revenue neutral only because up to $1 billion per year from deferred, possible, anti-tax avoidance measures was included in the numbers.
He goes on to say:
In fact the new business tax system unveiled yesterday is a triumph of smoke and mirrors and political tap dancing.
That says it all. There is a large black hole in the tax package announced yesterday. The government has said time and time again that the fundamental criterion governing the tax changes in the business tax review would be the criterion of revenue neutrality, that new measures would pay for new concessions, but the new measures designed to collect that extra revenue have, by and large, been deferred. They are new measures on the never-never. 
This hole of $3,820 million over the six-year period is another blow to the ever diminishing budget surplus. It does not include the government's decision on accelerated  depreciation where they said, in relation to mining in particular, `We will remove accelerated depreciation from the mining industries. However, if you want to knock on the door of our special projects unit and come forward with reasons why you think you should have a special deal on accelerated depreciation, you are most welcome to do so.'
There will be large projects, the proponents of which will be knocking on the door of government saying, `This large project in Western Australia cannot proceed unless we get a special deal on accelerated depreciation—that is, the reintroduction for our project of accelerated depreciation.' We will get the same thing in Queensland. There will be major projects that they will argue will not proceed unless they get a restoration of accelerated depreciation—I am talking here of projects such as the expansion on the North West Shelf and other major mining and gas development projects in rural and regional Australia—and the government, inevitably, will agree.
But where are the figures in this document on the cost to the revenue for restoring accelerated appreciation for those projects? There are none. I cannot recall a more rubbery set of figures than those provided by the Treasurer yesterday. He said, `We nearly got revenue neutrality'. He did not get anywhere near revenue neutrality. They have fudged the figures and they have fudged them in a most disgraceful way so that they can obfuscate and backslide on their repeated promises to deal with the taxation of trusts and the minimisation of tax through that device. That is why the 17 frontbenchers of the government have had a great victory because they have had this measure deferred indefinitely, yet again.
What worries me about all of this is that the government are bent on the redistribution of the tax burden of Australia. They always want to redistribute the burden of taxation off the shoulders of higher income earners, who are able to take advantage of these trusts, and 
 onto the shoulders of low and middle income earners and, amazingly and disgracefully, the pensioners of Australia. They bring in a massive change in the indirect tax system through the goods and services tax and, for the low and middle income earners and pensioners, they say, `You will pay GST.' But for the big end of town, which is able to avoid its fair share of tax through the instrument of trusts, they say, `We will defer that indefinitely.' The impact of that on fairness is self-evident: it is completely unfair.
I want to talk for a moment about the impact of the overall tax changes on small business. Consider this: a small business operator who happens to breach the law in relation to the GST will face severe, stiff penalties, there will be no negotiation and no special deals for small business people who do not pay their GST on time. But if you happen to be from the big end of town, if you happen to be an active and financial supporter of the Liberal and National parties and you have a trust, you are safe from the government because they have deferred, indefinitely, these measures. In doing so, they have opened up a large hole in the budget. That hole is expanding on the hole that they blew in the budget as a result of the fact that their tax package—the ANTS legislation—gave around 80 per cent of the tax cuts to the top 20 per cent of income earners. They used a lot of the surplus to finance that and now they are using more of the surplus to finance this.
What does that mean for the basic issue of service delivery in this country? The Treasurer declared a few weeks ago, `I'm a tax cut man. That's what I like to do: offer more cuts in the higher rates of marginal taxation.' At first he said that he wanted to push that 48.5 per cent marginal tax rate out to multiples of average weekly earnings, but then a few weeks later he followed up and said, `There is not much incentive in 48.5 cents in the dollar tax but there is a lot of incentive in 30c.' What he is trying to do is get that top marginal rate of tax down from 48.5 per cent to 30 per cent. Just yesterday he was asked, as a result of these arrangements announced in the business tax review, `Won't this in 
 crease the incentive to avoid tax through incorporation?' The answer was astonishing.
The Treasurer said, `Yes, it does increase the incentive to incorporate, and therefore to minimise tax, but only for those people earning more than $100,000 a year.' In other words, `Yes, we have made changes that allow people earning more than $100,000 a year to get a further tax break.' And he was proud of it! That is the colour of this government. Where is the money going to come from to finance these further benefits for high income earners? The money is going to come out of basic services. It is going to come out as further cuts in education funding.
Last Friday the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures on government funding of education. Total Commonwealth spending on education in the first two years of this government went backwards by more than $500 million. It went from 1.99 per cent of GDP to 1.90 per cent of GDP. University funding has fallen by a massive 12.7 per cent. The government is going to find the money to plug the black hole with further cuts to education and with further cuts to health—further cuts in the basic services that Australians expect of governments. The government will say, `We have to do this to be fiscally responsible. We have to be responsible economic managers. We can't go into deficit, so we have to confront a new round of spending cuts.' We are witnessing a complete shift in the burden of taxation from high income earners to low income earners, and the withdrawal of services from ordinary families in Australia, to fund these ongoing tax breaks for high income earners.
What is happening in Australia is a tragedy. It has been disguised by the good economic figures that come out from time to time about economic growth, but the benefits of that growth are not being fairly shared. I want to draw to the attention of the House this disgraceful backsliding on the part of the government. I call on the government to confirm that it will proceed with the legislation on trusts. I call on the government to table its legislation on trusts so that we can have just one example of this government 
 doing something towards a fairer and more decent Australia.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The title of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  is a pretty good guide to the growing complexity of the Australian tax system. There have been eight omnibus amendment bills just this year in the House of Representatives. I can give the House this one guarantee: where there is tax complexity there are tax avoiders and tax evasion. This government continues to go down the path of complex tax policy. It is adding to the complexity of the tax system. In some of the methods mentioned earlier by the member for Rankin it is opening up further opportunities for tax avoidance in this country.
If you asked a prospective tax avoider what sort of income tax system they would want in Australia, they would say they want one personal income tax rate, a separate company income tax rate and a separate rate for capital gains tax. Out of the recommendations of the Ralph review, that is what this government is planning to. It is planning to give the tax avoiders in this country more complexity. It is planning to give the tax avoiders three separate tiers of income tax rates.
We know what the likely outcome will be—people will shift around their tax arrangements to suit the various rates. They will shop around within those rates for the best chance to minimise their tax commitments. Further, if you were to ask someone how to most substantially hurt the knowledge economy in Australia, they would say, `Provide tax incentives to move economic effort from trading income to asset trading.' Again, what is this government proposing to do out of the Ralph committee? It is proposing to do the thing that tax avoiders want. They want incentives to move out of trading income into trading assets. They want the opportunity for property and asset speculation in the Sydney land market rather than a taxation system which promotes value adding in the information technology sector.
The member for Rankin outlined some of his concerns about the Ralph review. Let me say that my prime concern is that it will add, through these shoddy capital gains tax propo 
 sals, to the great Australian disease of asset and property speculation, particularly in our big cities. It will take away resources from the knowledge economy and put them into the least productive, least honourable aspects of Australian economic activity.
If anyone thought that the ANTS package should have been rejected due to its massive inequities, then they would have to thoroughly reject the capital gains tax proposals outlined by the government yesterday. Ralph has squibbed it; Ralph should have had the foresight and courage to recommend the first best option for business tax, which is to move to an expenditure base. It is an amazing missed opportunity for this country. At a time when the superannuation industry, the financial houses, the information technology sector, the Australian Industry Group, the NFF, the mining sector and Bob Joss—who was one of the members of the Ralph review—were supporting the move to a business expenditure tax, it is absent. It is absent in the action of this federal government, and it is absent in the front-line recommendations of the Ralph review.
Let me now move to one of the provisions in this omnibus amendment bill: the provisions on corporate philanthropy. The legislation provides $71 million in additional tax concessions for corporate philanthropy directed at registered charities and universities. This is said to be a key part of the Prime Minister's so-called social coalition, yet this is a coalition where people do not come in contact with each other. It is not very social at all, and it is not very effective.
It is a social coalition that promotes the worst features of passive, remote and impersonal welfare. The proposals in this bill for corporate philanthropy encourage rich executives to write their cheques on the 25th floor and then wipe their hands and clear their consciences of any direct contact with the poor. It adds substantially to the distance between the rich and the poor in our society.
It is certainly true, as many people have said, that, unfortunately, in Australia at this time the poor are falling further behind. But so too it needs to be understood that the rich are becoming more remote. The development 
 of walled housing estates, the loss of public space and the loss of shared public activities in our society are of great concern. We are seeing the polarisation of Australia into two societies, and a lot of it happens on a geographic scale: suburbs for the rich, suburbs for the poor. So what does this government do with its so-called social coalition? It promotes a philosophy of corporate philanthropy where the executives can write their cheques and wipe their hands of any direct personal involvement with the poor. It is not promoting a genuinely social coalition where companies are expected to have direct personal contact with the most disadvantaged parts of our community. It is a real concern that the government is going down this path. Passive corporate philanthropy adds to the welfare problem in Australia; it does not solve it. The more passive the solution the less effective the answer to welfare issues.
The Prime Minister's so-called social coalition reflects a failure of welfare and social philosophy. In July at the Brisbane Institute the Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson fingered the central failing of Australia's welfare sector: it operates under the suspicion that the poor are hopeless. It believes that, without growing government intervention, the poor will remain helpless. It gives no credence to the idea that the poor actually have the capacity to help themselves. It positions the poor as the problem and the government and now, in this case, the corporate sector as the only solution. In fact, this `pity the poor' attitude is the real problem. It fundamentally misreads the nature of welfare dependency. It sees welfare as an equation in dollars and cents, and this bill perpetuates that. It just sees the welfare issue as an equation in corporate dollars and cents instead of an equation between people. The main drivers of dependency are social, not financial. Basic relationships of self-esteem, status and trust have broken down in disadvantaged areas. At its core, long-term poverty is a problem in the relationship between people.
There is a debate about welfare, and this bill is part of it. I do not support the welfare philosophies of either the New Right or the old Left. The New Right, led by the Minister 
 for Employment Services, tries to position poverty as a rational choice, as if the poor are sitting down everyday, having a cup of coffee and doing their sums to work out whether they are better off staying on benefits. He then says that they make a decision to stay on benefits and that makes them job snobs. Well, that just shows his total ignorance of the position of the poor. Being poor is not a quiet life in this country; it is not a life of inactivity. It is a life of turning to the wrong side of social behaviour, where people start to take their self-esteem and their success signals from negative rather than positive behaviour in our society. The sign of success in youth gangs may come from how many cars you pinch or how many houses you break into instead of how many job promotions you might receive. So the New Right, with this rational economic choice philosophy, is totally wrong.
So, too, the compassionate Left has always expressed its concern for the disadvantaged, but it has neglected the significance of social relationships. It has positioned welfare solely as a relationship between government and its citizens. Its only answer to poverty lies in changing the immediate material conditions of welfare recipients. While this remains an important policy goal, it is not sufficient to break the cycle of welfare dependency. People will use the material gifts of government productively only if they have the basis of self-esteem and social capital. This is one of the reasons why inequality and social exclusion have become so entrenched in our country, despite massive increases in welfare spending. The things that people can do for themselves have been overlooked.
The first step in ending poverty is for welfare dependent communities to rebuild the habits of self-help and achievement. This will not be achieved through pity or through the material gifts of government or the corporate sector. A number of Third Way projects have demonstrated the critical role of social entrepreneurs in rebuilding communities. Far from being helpless and hopeless, people have regained the dignity of achieving things in their own right. The poor are actually the solution much more than the problem. Only 
 with a strengthening of these social foundations is it then possible for government to play a constructive role. Governments are needed in these projects, but very much more as junior partners to communities rather than the reverse. That is the welfare philosophy to which I subscribe and I only wish it were reflected in the Prime Minister's so-called social coalition and the provisions in this bill for corporate philanthropy.
The Howard social coalition also allows companies to direct the benefits of public money involved in the tax concessions. Companies tend to support those causes that have a maximum PR spin-off. Other causes such as AIDS related work tend to be left behind, and that is one of the very real concerns of this bill. I advocate a better approach, a real coalition, something that addresses the social and personal nature of the welfare dependency problem. This approach has three main aspects. The first is that it must encourage direct personal contact. The companies themselves should run projects and programs for the disadvantaged. They should establish a direct relationship with disadvantaged communities. Projects such as housing redevelopment, education and training initiatives, community employment programs and other forms of community development are available to the corporate sector. It should not be a matter of passive giving; it should be a matter of active involvement and face-to-face contact with disadvantaged communities.
The second aspect supports a tender system for corporate giving, rather than tax concessions. It is much better to have direct outlays rewarding good corporate projects on a merit basis than to do this through tax expenditures. Government should pick the quality corporate projects consistent with public interest goals, and it should ensure that no projects and no charities are left behind. If a charity or a project does not necessarily have a positive PR spin-off for the company, that is no reason why it should be punished in the financial allocations of this parliament.
The third aspect of a different approach, a different and much improved social coalition, is to recognise the self-interest and profit motive that companies might have in develop 
 ing their corporate skills through community projects. The company of the coming century needs lateral thinkers. It needs problem solvers and managers who can think on their feet and solve issues and problems in a rapidly changing corporate environment. What better way to develop those skills of management than to get corporate managers involved with social problems and solve some of the problems of disadvantaged areas, face-to-face, with their direct involvement.
This building of a bridge between the corporate sector and disadvantaged communities matches up corporate and public interests. I refer the parliament to an outstanding article by Rosabeth Moss Kanter, in the May 1999 edition of the Harvard Business Review, which sets out this very different approach to corporate philanthropy. It advocates hands-on, face-to-face corporate involvement in the issues and problems of the poor instead of passive, remote giving. It wants to bring the rich and the poor closer together in a social context. The article states:
Today several leading companies are beginning to find inspiration in an unexpected place: the social sector—in public schools, welfare-to-work programs, and the inner city. These companies have discovered that social problems are economic problems, whether it is they need for a trained workforce or the search for new markets in neglected parts of cities. They have learned that applying their energies to solving the chronic problems of the social sector powerfully stimulates their own business development. Today's better-educated children are tomorrow's knowledge workers. Lower unemployment in the inner city means higher consumption in the inner city. Indeed, a new paradigm for innovation is emerging: a partnership between private enterprise and public interest that produces profitable and sustainable change for both sides.
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . .. traditional corporate volunteer activities only scratch the surface . . . companies often just throw money at the problem, then walk away. The fact is, many recipients of business largesse often don't need charity; they need change. Not spare change, but real change—sustainable, replicable, institutionalised change that transforms their schools, their job prospects, and their neighbourhoods. And that means getting business deeply involved in non-traditional ways.
. . . companies that are breaking the mold—they are moving beyond corporate social responsibility to corporate social innovation . These companies are the vanguard of the new paradigm. They view community needs as opportunities to develop ideas and demonstrate business technologies, to find and serve new markets, and to solve long-standing business problems. They focus their efforts on inventing sophisticated solutions through a hands-on approach.
Tackling social sector problems forces companies to stretch their capabilities to produce innovations that have business as well as community payoffs. When companies approach social needs in this way, they have a stake in the problems, and they treat the effort the way they would treat any other project central to the company's operations. They use their best people and their core skills. This is not charity; it is R&D—a strategic business investment.
Ms Kanter goes on to give some case studies from the United States of this new corporate paradigm. This is the kind of thing we should be promoting in Australia—not remote corporate giving but hands-on corporate involvement in community projects in disadvantaged areas.
The Prime Minister has a coalition which is not social at all. He is forming a coalition which is remote and distant and which is adding to the divide between the rich and poor parts of this country. There is a better way to approach this issue and that is to develop the sort of model advocated by Rosabeth Moss Kanter. It is a model where companies would put forward to the government their community development projects for disadvantaged areas. The government would then, on a tender basis, look at those projects and ask: are they hands-on? Are the corporate managers involved in the communities? Are we building a real social coalition to help the disadvantaged? Are less glamorous causes being assisted as well as those where there might be a positive PR spin-off? Are we getting a good spread of our charitable effort and community effort for public resources in Australia? The government would make all those assessments and then pick the projects that best match the public interest. The good thing about this model is that it also matches the corporate interest.
I repeat: if companies want to develop lateral thinkers and problem solvers in their management, they need broad skills. They 
 need to get them involved and skill them up, and community projects are a great asset for the modern, forward-looking corporation. So there is a better way; unfortunately, it is not being addressed by this government, but I understand it will be addressed in Senate processes, where opposition members and, I hope, the Democrats will pick up the different model for a social coalition. We can do much better than the approach that is being used by this short-sighted Prime Minister and government.
I turn now to another provision in the legislation, and that is the encouragement of corporate philanthropy for Australia's universities. There is a good reward for the country in people providing resources, particularly for research, to our higher education institutions. But the great problem with this legislation is that it neglects the existing gap between rich and poor universities.
Some universities in Australia have a huge base of assets and investments. Other universities, such as the University of Western Sydney, have a very limited base of assets and investment. Why isn't there, in this legislation, special consideration for asset poor universities so that they can attract a bigger proportion of public and corporate giving to their research and other activities?
I have done a few sums from an answer I received from the education minister, which is recorded in the Hansard of 8 February this year. It adds up the current asset investments, the non-current asset investments, the equity reserves and investment income for each of Australia's universities for 1997. I will give the statistics to the House, because they demonstrate the great gap between asset rich and asset poor universities. According to these statistics, the University of Sydney has holdings of $2,600 million, the University of Melbourne has $2,010 million, the ANU has $1,051 million, and the University of Queensland has close to $1,000 million.
At the other end of the scale, Swinburne University has barely $9 million in assets and investment holdings, the University of New England has $25 million, Deakin University has $30 million, Central Queensland University has $33 million, and Northern Territory 
 University has $38 million. I  mentioned the University of Western Sydney: it has $148 million in assets and investment holdings. How do you compare that? Just look at Sydney University with $2,600 million and the University of Western Sydney with $148 million. It is a small fraction—about five per cent of the assets that are held by the University of Sydney.
Surely governments should be trying to equalise our universities and give an improved tax arrangement for the asset poor universities so that they can catch up to the sandstone institutions—the older universities—which have a very rich bank of assets and investment. I hope that one of the outcomes from the Senate process will be that, through this particular taxation amendment, government will be able to play a proper equalising role in the university sector.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—As previous speakers have stated, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  deals with 10 separate subject areas. I intend in the time I have today to contain my comments to the measures contained in schedule 5 of the bill. Schedule 5 implements the government's response to the report on philanthropy in Australia by the Business and Community Partnerships Working Group on Tax Reform. The measures will amend the income tax law to implement the government's response to the report on philanthropy in Australia by the Business and Community Partnerships Working Group on Tax Reform.
On 26 March 1999 the government announced measures to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy in Australia. There are three different categories of gifts for which a deduction is available. Under the 1997 act, taxpayers are entitled to income tax deductions for certain gifts. Donations to listed recipients can be claimed as income tax deductions. Examples of recipient organisations include public libraries, public hospitals and charitable organisations. The cultural gifts program provides a tax deduction for gifts of significant cultural items to public art galleries, public museums and public libraries by offering donors a tax deduction. This program is administered by the Department of Com 
 munications, Information Technology and the Arts.
The  Taxation Laws Amendment (Political Donations) Bill 1999  amends provisions on political donations. The political donations bill is amended by item 12 of schedule 5 of this legislation to allow a gift of property valued at more than $5,000 to qualify for a tax deduction. The government proposes to limit the deduction to $1,500 for contributions of more than $5,000 or a gift of property valued at more than $5,000. As previous speakers have stated, Labor does not support this amendment.
In the area of deductions for gifts to private funds, schedule 5 also allows gifts to be made to certain private funds called `prescribed public funds'. A prescribed public fund would be defined as a fund that is prescribed by the income tax regulations. The proposed provision expressly excludes funds that are declared by the Treasurer in writing to not be a prescribed public fund. Private funds have to obtain the approval of the government to be prescribed in the regulations. If a prescribed public fund does not comply with the requirements, the Treasurer may declare the fund is not a prescribed public fund. From the date of declaration, gifts to such a fund will not be deductible.
While I believe that increased private philanthropy is a worthwhile aim, I am very concerned that this government or future governments could use this as a reason to reduce public contributions to welfare, charities and, in fact, cultural organisations. I wish to thoroughly endorse the comments made by the member for Werriwa and, particularly, the member for Perth in earlier debate today on this part of the bill. I am concerned that we might be heading down the old American path, where very many worthwhile welfare and charitable organisations will not receive any significant corporate support because they do not have a sufficiently high public profile—in other words, that the charitable donations are made purely on the wish of the philanthropist and not expressly on the need of the community.
There can be no doubt that American corporations skew their contributions towards 
 those causes with the greatest public relations spin-off. Other causes—such as disability, drug and sexual health related work and so on—can tend to be left behind. It is with the American experience in mind that I caution against adopting their model without putting in place any appropriate safeguards. We need to be sure that future governments of either political persuasion, when facing tough financial times, will not be tempted to reduce public welfare provision. We need to be sure that those causes that are not `marketable' or `appealing' are not forgotten.
We only need to look at the area of the environment to see what this could mean. How much work has it taken to promote the eradication of weeds—in fact a worthwhile cause—as against maybe cuddly warm animals, dolphins and so on? I do not wish to sound flippant, but it is a very good example of how a corporate donation could be very much skewed to the image they wish to promote rather than to the actual environmental need. We can very easily use that as a good analogy when we think about the sorts of donations that could be made into the welfare sector particularly.
I concur very much with the comments of my colleague the member for Werriwa that this Howard model of corporate philanthropy encourages that passive charity that he spoke so well about. It is easy to see the big corporations writing their large cheques, providing the odd opportunity for a photo that would go into the annual but then basically walking away. What responsibility will they take for the outcomes? What meaningful relationships will be formed with disadvantaged communities? I am afraid the answer will probably be none or very little in terms of responsibility or relationship.
In closing I would like to say that it does not really have to be like this. I am sure the parliament can work towards an alternative model—a model that provides for more direct community involvement with corporations. Why can't companies be encouraged to get more involved in directly running the projects with those disadvantaged communities very much as the member for Werriwa has just in great detail outlined? I can personally think of 
 a range of projects in my electorate that would benefit greatly from a level of direct corporate involvement. Some of them would have great appeal to the corporate image, some of them much less appeal, but none is less worthy than the other. I am sure all members would have a similar range of examples in their own electorates.
I will be one of the first people in this House to step forward and encourage the philanthropy of those who can afford it into our community and to the areas where that assistance and help is required. In fact, I sometimes bemoan the fact that members of our communities answer doorknock appeals, badge selling appeals and Daffodil Day appeals with much more enthusiasm and generosity in relation to their affordability for those families than many of our larger more well-off corporations and individuals. I would be the first one to encourage similar generosity across the higher level of income in this country.
However, I believe the government of the day should be the part of this puzzle that actually dictates where most of that money goes. If the government of the day is not in a position to know where the need is, I do not believe we should leave it up to corporations to find where they believe their need is—their need being the good feeling of giving to where they believe they can get the most return, not the charity itself.
For those in the corporate sector who do play an honourable role in the philanthropy of their communities, I do not wish for one moment to malign them; but I say to the government: think very carefully about what path you are taking us down and where you believe it could lead us. In the long run, a partnership arrangement between the community, the government and the corporations sector, particularly when we look at philanthropy in the welfare sector, is the only way we should go.
As the member for Werriwa said, rather than a corporation merely writing out a cheque, getting the good photo for their annual report and feeling pretty terrific about it at the end of the day, I would much rather see a corporation take an active role—to 
 understand the relationship between themselves and the wealth that is generated to them by the community in which they operate and then to act accordingly. I strongly urge caution before we go too far down this path. I agree with earlier speakers that the Senate process must have the opportunity to flesh this out more and to come up with what we would regard as a viable, good alternative model.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—in reply—I thank all participants in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999. It certainly will not come as any surprise to members of the House that as a government we reject the ALP's second reading amendment. This bill makes some very substantive changes to the tax law to reflect some major and not so major policy developments and it also contains some highly technical amendments. Firstly, schedule 1 of the bill will address anomalies which give rise to avoidance opportunities in the interaction between the controlled foreign company laws and the capital gains tax laws. To correct the anomalies, capital gains tax arising on the deemed disposal of assets of foreign controlled companies, where the companies have previously taken advantage of rollover relief under the capital gains tax provisions, will be subject to tax in Australia as a result of this bill. This is what would have happened if the whole transaction had taken place in Australia.
It was always the intention that income of controlled foreign companies would be treated the same as income of Australian residents. In addition, there will be amendments to enable the tainted capital gains to be taken into account when applying the active income test and to prevent taxpayers from using schemes or arrangements to dilute their attribution percentage in the foreign controlled company holding the relevant development assets.
Secondly, with effect from the 1992-1993 income year, post-judgment interest payable in personal injury compensation cases will be exempt from income tax. This is the interest which accrues from the time a judgment debt arises until the time the matter is finally 
 settled. The exemption reverses the effect of a decision in the Federal Court in Whitaker v. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation which held that post-judgment interest is taxable. The honourable member for Cook in his speech mentioned the plight of the Whitakers. I acknowledge the efforts of Mr and Mrs Whitaker in bringing about this change to the law, which has the result that those who have suffered personal injuries do not bear the added burden of income tax on interest payable as a result of time elapsing in finalising the case while the court process is followed.
Thirdly, there will be a number of amendments to the franking credit and dividend streaming rules to ensure that they operate as intended. Again, these amendments have a strong anti-avoidance flavour. They will reflect the 45-day rule, the limiting the source rule, and general anti-avoidance and antistreaming rules.
Next, in accordance with the recommendation of the OECD, deductions for bribes paid to foreign officials will be disallowed unless the payment falls within the category of facilitation payment. It might help the House if I outline the difference between a bribe and a facilitation payment. A payment is a bribe to a foreign public official if it has been paid to provide a benefit to someone that they are not legally entitled to in order to influence the official to obtain or retain business or obtain an advantage in the conduct of business that is not legitimately due. However, a payment will not be a bribe if it is a facilitation payment, which is a payment incurred to expedite routine government action of a minor nature such as issuing a work permit or visa or installing a telephone, et cetera. I was particularly pleased to see the honourable member for Wills indicate that the opposition is supporting this measure.
In a separate measure, the government has introduced amendments to the criminal code to make it an offence to pay bribes to foreign officials. Schedule 5 includes major initiatives designed to encourage personal and corporate philanthropy in Australia. There are three main elements to these measures: increased incentives for gifts of property to eligible 
 bodies, tax deductibility for gifts to suitable charitable private funds, and a provision to allow the apportionment of deductions for gifts made under the cultural gifts program over a period of five years.
It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Werriwa, who always makes a thoughtful contribution to debate, suggest that asset-poor universities, such as the University of Western Sydney, should gain some additional advantages over other institutions. I assure the House that the government is treating all tertiary institutions equally. Most honourable members would believe that this is the appropriate way for the government to proceed.
Schedule 5 gives effect to the government's response to the report on philanthropy in Australia by the business and community partnerships working group on taxation reform. It is a recognition of the valuable philanthropic work of business in Australia and will make it easier for business and individuals to contribute more to their communities. I was absolutely astounded by the suggestion made by the honourable member for Werriwa, and supported by the honourable member for Canberra, that it was in some way wrong for corporate Australia to write a large cheque to benefit charities. There seems to be some criticism of the body because it may not personally have a hands-on approach to carrying out the charitable work. Quite frankly, the purpose of this legislation is to encourage philanthropic donations and, of course, those donations would be handled by appropriate management bodies and there would be very substantial benefits to the entire community as a result of those donations. The actual company does not necessarily have the hands-on situation for the money to do the job.
Schedule 6 will ensure that the rate of tax on friendly societies remains at 33 per cent rather than be increased to 39 per cent as previously scheduled for the 1999-2000 income year. The government has previously indicated that the scheduled increase will be deferred pending the outcome of the review of business taxation.
The explanatory memorandum indicates that, subject to the review recommendations with respect to business taxation, this rate will be changed to the company tax rate for the 2000-01 income year. Honourable members will be aware that the review of business taxation has, in fact, recommended that the company tax rate be reduced from the current rate of 36 per cent to 34 per cent in the year 2000-01 and 30 per cent in the 2001-02 income year. To avoid undue disruption to friendly society policy holders, the review has recommended that the rate of tax on the life insurance business of friendly societies be retained at 33 per cent in the 2000-01 income year and be reduced to the 30 per cent company tax rate in the 2001-02 income year.
Schedule 7 amends the tax law to ensure that share premiums are included within the ambit of capital streaming and dividend substitution rules and makes minor technical changes so that the provisions will operate as intended. Schedule 8 makes further technical corrections to the provisions governing excess tax offsets. Schedules 9 and 10 provide for the concessional tracing rules to companies. The measures will largely benefit family companies owned by discretionary trusts, including discretionary family trusts.
I now want to move to the pious second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills. He is critical in that second reading amendment of the position taken by the government in a number of areas. I want to place on record that the government has taken substantial action to combat tax minimisation and avoidance and significant reform has already been implemented. For instance, we have closed the abuse of the research and development concession, and we are stopping abuse on luxury car leasing, closing down the infrastructure borrowing scheme, addressing tax avoidance through overseas charitable trusts, extending the general anti-avoidance provisions, preventing the trafficking of trust losses, taxing distributions disguised as loans from private companies, and preventing franking credit trading and denial of artificially created losses. They relate to point (a) of his pious amendment. 
With respect to points (b) and (c), the reforms will take Australia into the next century with a modern, competitive and fair taxation system. They will create the environment for achieving higher economic growth. When one looks at the newspaper editorials around the country today, there is very strong support for the government's approach. Also, more jobs will be created and there will be improved savings—and providing a sustainable revenue base means that the government can continue to deliver services to the community.
Opposition members suggested that we were going to cut social spending, that indeed we were not interested in providing a social safety net. This government is very proud of the fact that we do provide services to the community, and our ministers and the government generally will continue to do this.
It should also be noted that changes proposed under the tax proposals include the lowering of the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, and we will have an internationally competitive capital gains tax regime. Small businesses are big winners with the introduction of a simplified tax system—despite the erroneous comments made by the honourable member for Rankin. The government is committed to introducing an entity tax arrangement to address concerns raised by those opposite in relation to trusts. As well, a substantial number of measures will reinforce the tax system's integrity. For instance, the 13-month prepayment rule is being tightened. We are preventing loss duplication and value shifting. We address the taxation of lease assignments and also the matter of treating non-commercial loans from members to closely held trusts. Those non-commercial loans are, in fact, treated as equity. So the government certainly rejects any suggestion made by the opposition that we are taking an inappropriate course of action.
The government wants to encourage philanthropy. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that we are trying to create a new culture in Australia. I believe this is supported strongly by the Australian community, and we are certainly not going to back away from that. 
The fourth element, though, of the pious amendment referred to the Victorian election. I can understand my colleague opposite, the member for Wills, likes to talk about the Victorian election. I felt a bit sorry for him because he frittered away an enormous proportion of his time indulging his vendetta against Premier Kennett and the Victorian government.
The honourable member for Wills also asked how the government could explain the $14 million cost to the revenue in the 1999-2000 year of income with respect to post-judgment interest arrangements. I want to assure the honourable member that the $14 million cost to the revenue reflects the taxpayers who have paid tax on post-judgment interest since the 1992-93 year of income and who will, upon passage of the bill, be able to have this tax refunded. This represents an estimated $2 million revenue cost in each of the prior income years.
The honourable member for Perth and the honourable member for Wills both referred to suggestions that the philanthropy measures increased the tax deductibility of donations to political parties from $1,500 to $5,000. This statement is incorrect. If the Taxation Laws Amendment (Political Donations) Bill 1999 passes, this bill will ensure that donations will only be deductible up to $1,500. If the Taxation Laws Amendment (Political Donations) Bill 1999 does not pass, this bill will not change the amount which is tax deductible for party political donations.
The honourable member for Wills also suggested that the government was being soft on the taxation of trusts. We reject that. An article by Tim Boreham in today's Australian, with the headline `Personal trust havens disappear', states:
By accepting the Ralph committee's proposal to tax personal trusts in the same way as companies, the Government has spelt the end of trusts as a tax minimisation tool.
Labor party members opposite huff and puff and make a lot of noise about the government's perceived lack of integrity in this matter, but the facts simply speak for themselves. The honourable member for Rankin also made a suggestion which I consider 
 bizarre. He suggested that small business is going to be hurt by this bill, which is not the case at all. Again, I refer to a comment in the Sydney Morning Herald  today in an article by Anthony Hughes, who states:
Small business owners have emerged as one of the biggest winners from the overhaul of business taxation through special treatment on capital gains tax and reduced paperwork.
—Hear, hear!
—I thank the member for Leichhardt for his support in that area. It is about time that the Labor Party were honest in this place. It is tragic when they come in and just say whatever comes into their minds with a view to impugning the motives and, indeed, the very fine record of the government.
The government is very pleased with the legislation currently before the chamber. We support it. At this stage I want to foreshadow some government amendments which we will be moving in the consideration in detail stage, and I understand that the member for Wills might have some amendments. We have not yet seen those, but we will look at them when we receive them. I commend the bill to the House.
Amendment negatived.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  sets the maximum amounts for operating and other grants to higher education institutions by varying the amounts already legislated under the Higher Education Funding Act 1998 for 1999 and 2000 and inserts an amount for 2001. It also sets the maximum funding level for expenditure on the international marketing and promotion of Australian education and training services by Australian Education International for the 2001 funding year. It amends the HEFA to make provision for funding 60 medical places at James Cook university for 2001 and provides funding for the science lectureships of $14.7 million and the associated research infrastructure of $73.6 million initially announced in the budget.
There are a number of areas in this bill which I would like to turn to now in more detail. Firstly, the maximum amount of funding for 2000 and 2001 reflects the axing of the merit based equity scholarship scheme, which was $39 million over three years. This action is extremely mean spirited. The scheme was the only skerrick of good news for higher education in the 1996 budget, which otherwise cut universities' discretionary funding by $216 million and cut universities' operating grants by $624 million, and student income 
 support was cut by a further $500 million. The bill also increased HECS charges by $313 million, lowered the repayment threshold to many thousands of dollars below average weekly earnings, thereby taking a further $817 million from students and graduates.
I quote from Senator Vanstone's media release of 9 August 1996 announcing the establishment of the HECS exempt scholarships targeted at disadvantaged students:
The facts are that if you come from a socio-economically disadvantaged background or a rural or geographically remote area, your chances of going to university are less than if you come from a high status background and live in an urban area.
These measures are aimed at bringing higher education within the reach of ordinary Australians. They are a practical demonstration of the Government's real commitment to fairness and equity in higher education.
In 1997, 1,000 scholarships were offered, building to a pool of 4,000 by 1999. The scheme had scarcely begun full operation before it was axed. A sounding of the effectiveness of the scheme was carried out by DETYA. This involved university equity officers being asked via email their views on the scheme in such a way as it could easily be assumed that the government was seeking to improve and enhance the scheme rather than axe it. Many of the 19 equity officers who responded suggested that a grant of money would be more effective than a HECS exemption in attracting financially disadvantaged students and retaining them at university.
The true motives of the government were revealed when, instead of using the same amount of money in the way suggested by their own survey, they used the findings to abolish the scheme. This is a further demonstration of the government's lack of any commitment to equity. Under the Howard government, it is user-pays all the way—and if you cannot pay you miss out.
This bill provides funding to the end of 2001 for Australian Education International. Originally set up in 1994 under the name Australian International Education Foundation, the AEI is fully funded by government, and its job is to promote Australian education worldwide. It represents all sectors of the 
 industry: schools, English language colleges, TAFEs, private training providers and higher education institutions. The concept is good, but it is a pity the government is so incompetent in its management in other ways of our increasingly important education export industry. For example, the establishment of Internet universities, like Greenwich and the University of Asia, has highlighted the need for the government to comprehensively review arrangements for the establishment of any business calling itself a university.
Dr John Walsh, Chancellor of Greenwich University, which was established as an Australian university by an act of the Norfolk Island legislature last year, insists that senior people in DETYA, Australian Education International and the Australian Qualifications Framework Advisory Board not only were aware of the steps being taken to establish the institution on Norfolk Island but actually encouraged it. When the issue was raised in the media earlier this year, however, the minister's department claimed that it was a matter for the Norfolk Island legislature and that it had not looked in detail at Greenwich's bona fides.
A review is now taking place under the auspices of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. It is obvious that this should have happened before Greenwich was established as an Australian university by an act of parliament and before it began to market itself as such. Is John Walsh being untruthful when he says that the federal government was well informed on developments leading to the establishment of Greenwich on Norfolk Island, or is the government guilty of gross mismanagement of the reputation of our higher education industry? It does not matter whether Greenwich was given approval at the end of the review process. The issue is not whether it turns out okay in the end, but how the matter was handled. Conducting a review after the institution is operating is a classic case of shutting the stable door after this educational horse has bolted.
The University of Asia operates out of a room in Adelaide and has not been recognised as a university by any Australian government. 
 Its web site claims that it is accredited by several governments, although none is named. Yet this operation was given authorisation to use the business name `University of Asia' in what appears to be yet another example of poor administration of our $3½ billion education export industry.
Added to this is the government's hopeless management of private training colleges through the Education Services for Overseas Students, or ESOS, Act. The urgent need for review was highlighted by the failure this year of the Business Institute of Victoria and the National Business Management College in Sydney. Under the ESOS Act, the Commonwealth maintains a register of institutions and courses for overseas students; requires private education and training bodies to maintain a trust account as insurance for students should their business fail; and requires such bodies to belong to a tuition assistance assurance scheme.
Evidence given to a Senate inquiry last year highlighted the shortcomings of the present administration of trust funds with the federal department auditing funds once a year on a known date. Evidence was supplied of unscrupulous providers withdrawing funds following the audit. When the Business Institute of Victoria went into receivership in May this year, I understand that there was no money in its trust account. The National Business Management College was apparently catering for between 500 and 600 students, yet the federal minister's department was aware of only 232. These additional students are now missing, and it seems that this institution could well have been operating what the industry calls a `visa factory'.
On 19 August, the minister announced a review of the ESOS Act which, while welcome, is certainly long overdue. Last year's Senate inquiry called for attention to the operation of the ESOS Act as a matter of priority, but it has taken the government an entire year to get to first base. Let me remind the minister that our reputation as a provider of quality education once lost will not be easily won back. In a letter to the Australian on 15 September, the Chair of the Australian 
 Council for Private Education and Training, Clive Graham, said:
ACPET has lobbied hard to clean up the post-secondary vocational education and training sector, and has on numerous occasions presented to State, Territory and Federal Governments details of the ways in which some unscrupulous operators exploit students.
The quotation went on:
That the Government has ignored the industry association warnings, to the detriment of Australia's export earnings, is surely a matter of concern to all Australians.
It is indeed a matter of concern to the opposition, and we can only hope that the minister is serious in his claim that a whole of government approach will guide the reform agenda.
In the meantime, there are many things he can do immediately, such as institute random audits of trust accounts to help expose operators who do not maintain their accounts year round. My colleague the member for Newcastle, following his trip as a member of a delegation to Norway, spoke in the House in June on a range of issues concerning education exports. He raised, for example, the cost of student visas: $290 for an Australian visa compared with $154 for New Zealand, $133 for Canada and $70 for the US. All of those figures are in Australian dollars.
Our major competitors charge student visa fees as low as a quarter of Australia's. The member for Newcastle pointed out that, while the Norwegian government wants to increase the number of Norwegian students studying overseas and pays people to go abroad to study, there are a number of obstacles put in the path of prospective students by the Howard government. These include: the cost of visas, which went up in October 1996 from $145 to $250 and later to the present $290; only three doctors available to do medical clearances for students wanting to come to Australia; the high cost of around $200 for medical examinations for these students; and the lack of an Australian Embassy official in Scandinavia with responsibility for student visas.
I would now like to turn to the VSU legislation. The government's VSU legislation is rapidly sinking down the list of government 
 business on the Senate Notice Paper. On 23 August, it was item 19; by 26 August, it was item 22; and by 20 September, it was item 23. On 16 May, the minister said on Meet the Press that the government would `absolutely' press ahead with its VSU legislation. On 13 June, he told Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program, `If it does not get through this time, we will bring it back to the Senate again in three months time.'
The three months is nearly up, and it has not even been debated in the Senate for the first time yet. That is because the government is faced with major opposition within its own ranks to this ideologically driven plan. It is time the minister admitted total failure in his bid to fight old student battles again in the parliament.
The VSU bill contains other provisions with which the opposition does not disagree, the most important being the recognition in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 of the University of the Sunshine Coast as a separate institution. The Queensland parliament legislated late last year to establish the University of the Sunshine Coast as a separate institution, and the university is anxious to begin receiving its Commonwealth funding directly. It is not fair that recognition under HEFA of the University of the Sunshine Coast should be delayed because of its unfortunate grouping with the VSU legislation. For that reason I will be moving amendments to give effect to that and to another measure contained in the VSU bill of a slight name change to the James Cook University.
I now turn to the government's own amendments. The government is moving its own amendments to the bill before the House in order to provide compensation for increases in the cost of living due to the GST for Australian postgraduate award and Australian postgraduate award (industry) recipients. In 1998 there were around 1,600 APA scholarships and 213 APAs in industry. Universities also offer their own scholarships—there were around 1,240 of these last year—and there are no funds being provided for those scholarships to be increased to compensate recipients for increased living costs. Recipients of other types of scholarships—such as those managed 
 by the NHMRC, other federal departments and agencies and state governments—will also miss out. This is yet another example of how education is far from GST free.
In an article in the Financial Review of 29 July, author Donald Horne attacked the government for its narrow view on the funding of education. He states:
Here we are in what is supposed to be a `knowledge society' and not one Cabinet Minister says so. At times you'd think that all that mattered was still the export of minerals, fibres and foodstuffs. Plenty of silliness about undergraduates being `customers', as if universities were supermarkets, but not one speech about the idea that expenditure on universities can be seen as one of the most important investment programs in a modern industrial State.
Not one speech (of the kind we got from Bob Menzies and Gough Whitlam) on the universities as centres of knowledge and inquiry. Yet it is this that makes them the very centre of a `knowledge society'. And it is not computer technology or whatever that makes them so. It is because they develop the techniques of the critical pursuit of ideas.
Turning to the impact of these cuts, universities are now being turned into businesses—a commercial focus must be pursued to the exclusion of everything else. I would like to bring to the attention of the House some examples of these cuts: University of Adelaide, cuts to performing arts courses; Australian National University, major cuts to the arts faculty; University of New South Wales, closure of St George Campus and cuts in applied arts and performing arts courses; Sydney University of Technology, loss of five academics and support staff in humanities and social sciences; University of Western Sydney, phasing out of the anthropology department, closure of the drama department and rationalisation of the arts faculty; Monash University, loss of 120 staff in the arts faculty and closure of the classics department; Queensland University of Technology, reduction of tutorial hours in the arts, media and social science courses; and Northern Territory University, closure of the English department and cuts to the ceramics, sculpture and cartography courses.
For universities all over Australia, the story is the same. In an article in the Age on 25 
 March this year, Professor John Niland, President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, wrote:
Public-sector funding of Australian universities is at crisis level . . . The steady decline in some fundamental and important disciplines such as university science requires immediate government intervention.
In the Australian  on 19 May, retired Supreme Court judge Hal Wootten wrote:
Public universities exist for the public good . . . Traditionally they have sought to admit the students best able to benefit, and to employ . . . scholars who have chosen to forgo the pursuit of profit from their professions in favour of the satisfaction of teaching those students and advancing knowledge . . . 
It is a radical change if students are admitted (and inevitably to some extent retained and passed) not according to their capacity to benefit from study, but their capacity to make up for the deficits in government funding; and if staff are chosen for their entrepreneurial flair rather than their teaching and scholarly skills . . . 
It is not politically correct to give more than lip-service to scholarship and the need for reflection, or to advocate small classes, to measure publications by quality rather than number, or to treat with suspicion powerful interests bearing gifts.
Words like these fall on deaf ears with this government. The minister does not want to hear anything which conflicts with his ideologically coloured and blinkered outlook on the world.
We cannot discuss higher education funding without reference to the government's own green paper on research. I note that the House Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Resources recently released a report entitled The effect of certain public policy changes on Australia's R&D. This report reiterates the need for concern about the low level of business expenditure in Australia on research and development. The committee indicates its belief that the fall in business R&D which began in 1997-98 is directly attributable to the government's reduction of the R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. While the government's green paper is clearly intended to shift the focus of university research more towards the commercial end, the House committee report canvasses the issue of the right balance between basic and 
 applied research. The report quotes from the ANU publication The case for additional investment in basic research in Australia as follows:
There is a crucial distinction to be made between strengthening industry links and inducing university researchers to shift their activity towards applied and industry research. The former is mutually beneficial but the latter is damaging in weakening the national competitiveness of and infrastructure for basic research.
Ultimately, if Australia ends up having to steal a dollar from pure research to fund an extra dollar in applied research or grant administration, then our research policy has failed. The report also notes the calls for increased infrastructure funding for university research, including that of the West committee. Yet the green paper proposes not only no extra money for research or research infrastructure but also a plan which is likely to lead to less flexibility for institutions to fund major infrastructure.
The opposition will have more to say on research when we see the government's final proposals. We can only hope that the minister uses that opportunity to significantly improve his planned framework for Australian research funding. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	 notes that the quality of Australian education institutions is of prime importance to our future, both economically and culturally; and
(2)	 condemns the Government for damaging the quality of Australian education by:
		 (a)	 punitive cuts to universities;
		 (b)	 a lack of commitment to equity issues; and
		 (c)	 mismanagement of the education export industry.""

—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  makes reference to the 
 functioning of the grant system for higher education. In fact, the recommendations it contains and the implementation of its contents will result in significant changes in the way the higher education grant system works—all to the better. There are 18 different types of grant schemes, according to the Bills Digest , but 88 per cent of those are contained within one, which are the operating grants for higher education institutions.
The Higher Education Contribution Scheme was introduced in 1989. It was updated in 1997 and under that scheme students are able to contribute towards their higher learning and return that money once their salary reaches a certain level. It is a good scheme that is quite effective and which contributes an increasing proportion of the funds that we need to run our universities. The latest figures show that the grants that come through in this way from the Commonwealth make up 54 per cent of the total income of universities. Back in 1981 they made up 89 per cent, and in large part that is the impact of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It is also partly the impact of the increased numbers of overseas students that are full fee paying students and that is an important part of the scheme, too.
The total income of the higher education sector for this year, 1999, is estimated to be $8.6 billion, of which a total of $5.6 billion will come from the Commonwealth. The Bills Digest covers a few possible new proposals that are being considered by the government as a way of amending the scheme still further. It refers in part to a proposal to provide public funding direct through the student, rather than by way of these direct operating grants that I was referring to before. When looking at the implications of that I referred back to the proposals being put forward by the coalition at the time the then Labor government went ahead with the unified national system back in 1988. The unified national system, of course, was the John Dawkins model that basically completely restructured higher education in Australia. At that time I note that the coalition was proposing the following, and I will quote from a press release of the then coalition spokesman on education, Julian Beale MHR, who said:
Federally-funded student places, rather than being allocated directly to institutions, will be awarded directly to students through National Education Awards which will be redeemable at the institution of the students' choice. This will facilitate the development of a demand-driven pattern of enrolment and enable institutions to develop their own planning and expansion strategies.
That sounds very much like a model for the proposals that are now being once again considered. When considering these options there is an immediate perception that we are heading down the path towards a voucher system. The voucher system of education has been demonised regularly by various experts, and I will quote Edwin West who said:
An education voucher system exists when governments make payments to families that enable their children to enter public or private schools of their choice. The tax-funded payments can be made directly to parents or indirectly to the selected schools; their purpose is to increase parental choice, to promote school competition, and to allow low-income families access to private schools. Some opponents predict that vouchers will destroy the public system, aggravate poverty, and foster segregation. Others fear that voucher-receiving independent schools will be regulated out of recognition.
I think that sums up some of the concerns over the years that have been raised about a voucher system of payment. The important thing to say here is that this proposal to fund through students in the higher education sphere is not a voucher system, but it is taking some of the important and positive aspects of voucher funding—that is empowering the students and enabling them to make choice—as an important part of the model and applying it where it has positive benefits.
As I have said, we have had significant changes along the way already since the establishment of the unified national system. We have had the introduction of overseas fee paying students and the introduction of fee payment for postgraduate students in 1989. With regard to overseas students, in 1997 overseas students contributed a total of $620.4 million to the running of our higher education system.
I want to spend a little bit of time now just looking at the unified national system as it stands. I had a few questions about that when 
 I was researching this particular bill and I wanted to see something about how the unified national system has fared. In simple terms, when it established the UNS the government wished to expand the system in an era of intended financial restraint at that time. This meant that a degree of rationalisation of institutions had to be undertaken, together with a reform of the funding system.
Since then there has been no formal evaluation of the unified national system as such. I searched high and low for that, but unfortunately we have not really got around to assessing in a hard-nosed sense just what we have and have not achieved as a result of the unified national system. I can say that from my experience of the unified national system, there have been some good points, but there have also been some bad points. In particular on the good side we have seen an increase in the EFTSU, the number of effective full-time student units—that is, the number of people undertaking higher education through our universities.
If I take some specific examples, there are also bad points. I refer to the continuing difficulties being experienced at the Gatton campus of the University of Queensland, which of course is in my electorate and naturally I have a close concern for its further development. Under the unified national system that particular institution, and other agricultural higher learning institutions across Australia, have not really gone ahead in the way in which it was envisaged at the time they were introduced. Gatton is not alone in that respect. In fact, others have suffered more greatly, but we need to focus in on what is needed for agricultural higher learning. That is an area where the UNS has not really hit the mark at all.
Another area where I have some personal experience was the initial refusal of the then Hawke government to allow the introduction into the system of the Northern Territory University. It was denied access on the basis that they did not believe at the time that the Northern Territory University could raise an EFTSU of 2,000 and so it was thought at the time that its economies of scale would be too small to include in the UNS. As it turned out, 
 when I look at the latest statistics I can see that the Northern Territory University today has over 3,500 EFTSU and Darwin is being referred to as a university town. Really, the initial decision not to put the Northern Territory University within the system was cockeyed and the decision of the Northern Territory government at the time to go ahead anyway, call it a university and put the money in itself has definitely been the right way to go.
There have been efficiency gains across the board and the Bills Digest refers to a reduction in the amount of the operating grant per EFTSU by something like 20 per cent since 1983. But we have to ask ourselves what is the quality or the value of the service we are providing through these universities and what elements we are seeking to progress in students by giving them a higher education through a university.
When I look at the Bills Digest there is an interesting comment which highlights some of the possible concerns. I note that there has been a study of what the students think about what they are learning at university, and I understand that 75 per cent are happy with the quality of teaching and 89 per cent overall are happy with the course that they are undertaking. The Bills Digest refers to `credentialism'. It says:
The process contributes to a form of inflation in credentials or credentialism where graduates are required to obtain more and more degrees in order to compete for jobs that do not really require such qualifications.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to put forward journalism as an example of that. When I started out as a cadet journalist my only experience of education up to that time had been at high school. I think that for many people who were undertaking journalism at that time—in the late 1970s and certainly before that—it was common to embark on a journalistic career with nothing more than a high school education. I do not believe necessarily that journalists were the lesser for it.
In fact, I believe that in recent times there is real evidence that the standard of journalism has gone downhill. I refer specifically to a couple of examples. For example, certain 
 standards used to apply and all those old subeditors at the ABC or on any of the newspapers used to absolutely flog them into the young cadets—things like carrying two sides of the story in every story that you run. It is a lazy way of journalism to take just one side and thereby completely aggravate the other side so that they respond. Then, as a journalist, you can play ping pong with people and fill up your news bulletins with that sort of thing. That is a lazy type of journalism.
Then there is also the age old style of journalism which has really started to gain strength lately and that is comment masquerading as news. We see so much of that today. In practically every news article you read, in practically every TV item you see or in every radio news bulletin you hear, there is comment masquerading as news.
We are getting that today despite the higher level of training that people are going through and you have to say that what we have as a result of this is not a higher standard of journalism. What we have got, I think, is a strong example of credentialism. We are putting a lot of time and money into people who already have a high school education, who are skilled in grammar and creative writing and all the kinds of things that they pick up at school; we insist that they go off and get a university degree before they can even start a cadetship as a journalist. It seems like a very roundabout way of equipping people with the basic skills that they already have. I would like to see us look very hard at some of these courses to see whether or not people already have the kind of credentials needed without having to resort to credentialism.
The Bills Digest also refers to examples of undergraduate courses being re-badged as postgraduate courses. That, of course, would be a real concern. I can think of a couple of other examples, such as the way in which higher learning is made available to people in the public service—or some elements of the public service—where study becomes a part of their work. Instead of paying people to advance the public good by being good public servants, we are paying them to further their 
 own education and they are doing that in work time. I suppose you might say, `Good on them', but we do need to remember that, while training is part of life and higher learning is an important goal to have, people also have jobs to do. They have to do those jobs to the best of their ability and continue with their study at the appropriate time.
I think many people who work very hard in remote locations or in jobs in the private sector have a tougher time of it: they might find that the people sitting in the university course next to them have a free ride from their boss to the extent that they are able to sit down and study in work time. Along the way, I note in relation to some other aspects of training that 51.8 per cent of staff at Australian universities have a PhD and I think that rates fairly well in the world.
One of the aspects of this bill is that it provides funding for the James Cook University to achieve a school of medicine. I think that is fantastic. I referred earlier to credentialism and the worry I have about needless credentials or an over-exaggerated focus on having a degree before you can start a cadetship in journalism. However, I would strongly argue that, when I look at the really disciplined areas of study—and I am talking primarily about medicine, the sciences and those things that are giving us the cutting edge—I would like to see funding diverted out of areas like journalism study and into those that really do involve that higher level of learning. So I do congratulate the government on establishing this new school of medicine at James Cook University, particularly when it is to cater for students from a remote or rural background. That is something I think we should be focusing on to a greater extent as well.
Much has been made along the way of the impact of the government's intention to abolish the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. Looking at the figures in relation to that scheme, and in relation to the raw numbers of people from rural or isolated areas or people from a low socioeconomic background who have taken up that scheme, I see that over recent years we have generated quite an increase in the number of 
 people studying who are from those areas. From rural areas, in 1990 there were 36,000 people studying for a university degree; in 1997, there were 108,000. From isolated areas there were 4,000 in 1990 and 11,000 in 1997. From a low socioeconomic background, 28,000 were studying in 1990 and 90,000 in 1997. That has been quite a significant increase but, while that has been going on, there has also been a significant increase in the general population. Although we have made those improvements, there have actually been reductions in the percentages of people studying who are from those categories.
The Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme was going to consume $18.2 million in the years 2000-01. But, if we look at the impact of the increased funding from 1991 to 1997, we see that people from a rural background studying at a higher education level have gone from 18.5 per cent in 1991 to 17.4 in 1997; isolated people, from 1.9 to 1.8 per cent; and low socioeconomic people, from 15 per cent down to 14.5. We need to do better than that. When we consider the way to go about it, we should listen to the people directly at the coalface. We have got equity experts in every university in this country, who do have consideration for providing equity for students, and they have suggested that this scheme is not the way to go about it. I believe we should listen to them. There are better ways to do it, which we should pursue.
Another point concerns overseas students. They are certainly contributing much more to our higher education budget, and it is interesting to note that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee found in a study that overseas students `significantly outperform local students'. That is, on an assessment of mean student progress units, those students are performing very well.
Also, a study by JM Consulting, reported by the Global Alliance Ltd to the Australian government, found that the cost of attending Australian universities is globally competitive. So we have got a competitive market and a competitive product, and they are performing very well.
I would like to compliment the places that are receiving large numbers of these overseas students. Unfortunately, they are not in Queensland. Monash and RMIT are leading the charge in Victoria, with over 6,000 students each. Curtin University of Technology, in WA, has 5,497 students. But I see that, unfortunately, the University of Southern Queensland has only 2,757. We can do better.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I feel, after the contribution of the member opposite, that I should launch into a spirited defence of journalists in Australia and particularly the Canberra Press Gallery. But I suspect that, in the way of these things, they can look after themselves. I will leave the member opposite to their tender mercies.
The  Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  provides for funding for our higher education system for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. In doing so, it implements a number of budget and policy commitments in the higher education area made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs.
Before turning to the detail of the bill and to the opposition amendment before the House, I want to deal with the policy framework of this minister for education and this government in the higher education area. I cannot say for sure where the minister for education was on Saturday night but it is a fair bet that, as a Victorian Liberal, he was at the Sofitel in Collins Street, at the Liberal Party wake on Victorian election night, watching the speech that, effectively, marked the end of Jeff Kennett's political career. If the minister was there or was watching the proceedings on television from some other location, I hope that the events unfolding before his eyes caused him to reflect on a number of important questions in public policy today.
I hope they caused him to reflect on how one should treat rural and regional Australia, because Saturday night in Victoria proved that, if you treat rural and regional Australia with contempt, it will return the compliment. I hope they caused him to reflect on how Australians value a fair go, a fair sharing of the benefits of government services, and how 
 they reject an approach of governing for the chosen few at the expense of the many. I hope these reflections caused him to adopt an approach to education policy fundamentally different from the one that we have seen adopted to date and the one apparent in this bill.
I suspect that my hopes are misplaced. As Saturday night and its aftermath have proved, Victorian Liberals only rethink their arrogant and foolish approach after being kicked so hard in the head by the electorate that it produces tears. So we are left dealing with this bill in its current form—a bill which fails rural and regional Australia and fails the test of fairness.
First, the bill fails by legislating for a phasing out of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. This is a scheme which provided 1,000 scholarships to encourage the participation of equity groups in higher education—specifically, the underrepresented categories of indigenous Australians, women in non-traditional areas, people with a disability, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, people from rural and isolated areas and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. From the figures, encouraging the participation of these groups is necessary.
For example, using 1997 figures, we see that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders form 1.7 per cent of our population but only 1.3 per cent of our student population. In respect of people from rural backgrounds, isolated backgrounds and low socioeconomic income backgrounds, we see that the percentage within our student population has fallen in each case since 1991 from 18.5 per cent to 17.4 per cent for rural people, from 1.9 per cent to 1.8 per cent for people from isolated backgrounds and from 15 per cent to 14.5 per cent for people with low socioeconomic backgrounds.
My colleague opposite, in speaking before me, referred to the absolute numbers and suggested that there had been an increase in absolute numbers. Of course, using absolute numbers across the 1990s as a statistical measure is insufficient because of the large growth in the student community overall 
 during that time period. The appropriate way of measuring whether or not participation rates are keeping pace amongst the members of these equity groups is to look at the percentage statistics which I have just given. Indeed, even in today's newspapers we see a report carried of a new study which shows that the sons and daughters of blue-collar workers are struggling to enter higher education in part, this study concludes, because of the limitations on the youth allowance and, consequently, income support for students.
Against that backdrop of continuing failure in encouraging participation from members of these equity groups, you would wonder why on earth a government would cut out a scheme that seeks to redress these inequity issues, particularly a scheme as limited as one that costs $10 million a year. But it fits with the philosophy of this government whose view of access issues is that the dumb rich can buy a place while those with intellectual ability but a lack of resources are excluded.
Limitations on access are not the only issue raised by this government's philosophy on higher education. The questions of quality and partial privatisation are also squarely raised by the continuing rolling back of government funding. As we all know, education was chosen for special punishment in the first Howard budget—$800 million was hacked out of university operating grants, the HECS burden for university students was increased by $1.1 billion, TAFE funding was cut by $167 million, $128 million was ripped out of government schools and student assistance was cut by half a million dollars.
This bill details funding arrangements which will see in 2001 the real levels of the Commonwealth's contribution to operating grants of higher education institutions at about the same level as it was in 1983, although planned student load will have become in that time period 58 per cent higher. So the same level of resources effectively has to do 1½ times or more than 1½ times the job.
Under this bill, the Commonwealth's contribution to operating grants per planned equivalent full-time student unit will continue its decline, and the decline between 1983 and the projected 2001 figures in this bill will be 37 
 per cent. Clearly, the increasing reliance on non-government sources of funds has different effects on different universities, but that is the source of funding that universities are forced to look to now with continuing cutbacks in the level of government support.
Regional universities, and universities such as the Victorian University of Technology which has a campus located in my electorate, suffer considerably under this system. Regional universities, and the Victorian University of Technology which has made it a special mission and a considerable cause of pride to cater specifically for those from non-English speaking backgrounds and from less advantaged backgrounds, have a far smaller capacity to attract non-government funds than the Ivy League universities. To conclude that is simply no more than commonsense. Yet this funding cutback program continues apparently without regard to the special needs of the non-Ivy League universities and without regard to the quality questions raised by increasing student-staff ratios.
Indeed, the student-staff ratio has moved from 13.5 in 1989 to 17.9 in 1998, a 33 per cent increase. Perhaps this is part of the explanation as to why 75 per cent of students expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of teaching in our higher education institutions in a 1996 survey. It may also be part of the explanation for a recent study showing that 40 per cent of students who commenced an undergraduate degree in 1992 had not completed their degree after five years, and one-third had dropped out completely. Comparable with the schools debate, it stands to reason that, if we have fewer teaching staff in our higher education institutions, they are able to offer less special care and less pastoral care to those students who need additional attention and, consequently, such students are at a greater risk of not completing their course.
There is no doubt that appropriate resourcing, access and quality are significant issues which require creative public policy initiatives and, at the end of the day, the right number of dollars. This government in this bill shows no sign of providing either the creative public policy initiatives or the appropriate level of resourcing.
Whilst the significant issues in higher education go generally unaddressed by this government and are not addressed in this bill, this minister spends his time reliving the battles of his youth. On 12 May this government gagged in this House further debate on the  Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 , which dealt, amongst other issues, with voluntary student unionism. That debate was gagged despite the fact that the opposition had a large number of speakers still wanting to address the issue, and despite the fact that members of the government backbench had publicly aired their concern about the matter and despite the fact that the minister could not be bothered turning up for the division on the gag.
The bill then proceeded to the Senate and since that time nothing has happened. Despite nothing happening, the Prime Minister in this House on 29 June stated:
The government's attitude towards voluntary student unionism has not changed. Any suggestion that we have sort of gone slow on the legislation in the Senate because we have altered our view is wrong . . . 
If we believe the Prime Minister that the government has not changed its view, what explains the fact that 133 days after the voluntary student unionism bill was gagged in this place it still has not been dealt with by the Senate and that there is no sign that the Senate is intending to deal with it any time soon? Could the explanation be ministerial incompetence?

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Treasurer has had an interesting week. First there was the humiliation of Jeff Kennett last Saturday and then there was the football. Two more points to Essendon and he would have had the perfect weekend! Yesterday the Treasurer announced a business tax package that he says will not need to be changed for another 50 years. Then in his press conference he announced a `new standard of fiscal accountability'—that is, if the Treasurer has a `disposition' to do something in the future, the dollars can be counted now. This is a truly revolutionary concept. And then last night, as Labor was poring over the detail, elsewhere we had Lachlan Murdoch delivering what can only be described as the surrogate Placido Domingo speech.
Finally this morning, on Radio National, we heard the Costello doctrine on tax policy—that is, oppositions should never seek to negotiate on tax policy. In the past, he said, the practice has always been to immediately endorse government tax policy. That is what the coalition always did from opposition, isn't it? Except for a couple of occasions, like its opposition to capital gains tax; its opposition to fringe benefits tax; its opposition to ending tax deductibility for entertainment; its opposition to taxation of foreign source income; its 
 opposition to trust stripping; its opposition to reform of superannuation taxation; its opposition to petroleum resource rent tax; and its opposition to reform of employee share ownership.
This is the same member who said, in 1995, that he would oppose Labor tax legislation `root and branch'; `we've knocked off the last two, and we plan to knock this one off as well,' he boasted. So much for the precedent of oppositions automatically supporting governments' tax policy. And so much for his approach to bipartisanship in trying to get a result. So we will not, be accepting his demand that we agree immediately to the whole package. We will not, because he has never done it and, more importantly, because the material he has given us is so incomplete.
For all the Treasurer's assertions that his great tax adventure is over, it is not. For a start, it fails the revenue neutrality test. Yesterday's release of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation and the government's response is a good basis for negotiating competitive business tax reform in this country. There are many initiatives proposed by the government that Labor can support. Indeed, many reflect Labor policy. They include a lower company tax rate; simplification of the tax arrangements for small business; better depreciation arrangements for small business; measures to encourage greater investment in venture capital in Australia by foreign pension funds; pooled development fund relief for Australian institutions investing in venture capital as well; rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeovers; and some tighter anti-avoidance measures. In addition, Labor even has a preparedness to look at other capital gains tax measures to promote a more active investment climate.
However, the key weaknesses of the government's response are its deferral of a number of the hard decisions, particularly in relation to the taxation of trusts, the opening up of new tax avoidance opportunities, and the failure to deal with some existing tax avoidance practices pointed out by the Ralph committee. By doing this it has sacrificed revenue neutrality, to the tune of $3.8 billion. Despite the Treasurer's promise that this 
 package would pay for itself, it does not—but it can, although at the moment it does not even come close. If the detail of the tax avoidance and trust issues are addressed, it can. If the government is prepared to bite the bullet, talk with Labor and work to address the shortfall, it can be done. But at the moment it fails the revenue neutrality test—a parameter imposed by the GST, imposed by the Treasurer himself, and now being squibbed by the Treasurer.	The Treasurer would have you believe that he has already met the test. He wants people to believe it. He gets us there by telling us about his `predispositions'. This Treasurer has both taxing and spending predispositions.
We know about the $3.8 billion shortfall, but that is not the end of it. There are also the Treasurer's spending predispositions as well. To offset the considerable impact that the package may have on some areas of industry, he has announced that the government:
. . . will be prepared to consider such projects, in the context of an expanded strategic investment coordinating process, including consideration of the option of targeted investment allowances.
This gobbledegook means that the government may have to pay a grant to some businesses in order to ensure the important investment proceeds. Some very major projects may need to be assisted in this way, especially large resource projects. For this assistance to be meaningful, it is going to have to be very large indeed, as it is partially replacing over $10 billion worth of depreciation savings announced in his package yesterday.
But we do not have any indication of the amount of money that has been set aside, or even if it has been set aside. So we have here a predisposition to spend but not to cost it. We suspect that there is no provision being made for these enormous further costs—a fact that the Treasurer was given the opportunity to address in question time today but again also squibbed. The extent to which there is none makes the revenue neutrality shortfall even larger than the $3.8 billion disclosed by the Treasurer. This is an important area that has to be explored more closely. As usual, this Treasurer has not provided the relevant information. He has hidden the detail in 
 amongst other items so that we cannot see the actual effect of the separate decisions.
His predispositions also extend to claiming savings from yet to be announced measures. Let us have a look at the attachment to the Treasurer's release yesterday. The only fiscal information provided by him was one table at the back of the release. It provides aggregate information only, and there is a deliberate strategy of not itemising separate decisions, so decisions are bundled together. There is a deliberately non-transparent methodology. So much for your Charter of Budget Honesty. Each measure should be separately disclosed. There should be some budget honesty about this process.
The real impact, as I have been saying, is the bolded line headed `Overall impact of announced measures'. That discloses the $3.8 billion shortfall. Then we have the extraordinary next line, which is the deferred measures. So the Treasurer is trying to include measures which his cabinet has either rejected or specifically deferred by saying that he is predisposed to them. It is further qualified by the footnote in his table which says that the revenue from these measures is dependent upon the time of implementation. Remember the `never, ever' state taxes being abolished in the GST package? This is another cut at it. It is code for saying that they may never happen. Indeed, until the measures are agreed and legislated, we should treat them as not going to be implemented by this government. Just as we have draft legislation before us reflecting the decisions taken, we should see the legislation confirming these predispositions, to complete the package—to complete what has not yet been completed. But the secrecy and duplicity was exactly the same flawed strategy as the government pursued with the GST package. It has not supplied the relevant information.
There are other critical areas of costing information which need independent analysis. One of them is the assumptions concerning the capital gains tax. This is a Treasurer who is arguing that tax avoidance will be tiny. The Ralph report, at page 732, admits that there will be tax avoidance from halving the capital gains tax, but then puts in a ridiculously low 
 cost at only $20 million in year 1 rising to $180 million in year 5. This is simply not credible, especially if you do not bring in provisions to attempt to deal with the problem—another point of a question asked today which he refused to answer. Perhaps the Treasurer should seek advice from the last Liberal Treasurer, John Winston Howard, about the size of tax avoidance converting income into capital gains. He has a bit of experience in presiding over such a regime.
For all of these reasons, I have written to the Treasurer seeking a detailed briefing from Treasury officials on the modelling underlying the package. It is an important first step in the process of public disclosure. This will be a pointer to how open and transparent the government will be. If he chooses not to cooperate, then we can conclude that he is hiding something, as he was with the GST. The only way the truth came out with the GST was a full Senate inquiry. We have always said we do not need to go down that route if the government is cooperative in providing full information. Unfortunately, it looks as though the Treasurer is determined to keep going down the secrecy route. If that is the case, then he will reap what he sows.
The package represents a further loosening of fiscal policy at a time when we have an unsustainable current account deficit and when people are already beginning to worry about the fiscal irresponsibility of the government—a government that already has form with the GST package. It is almost as if we are now in the position that, so long as there is a surplus, there will be no public examination of fiscal policy. This is a wrong principle. Being soft on tax avoidance is not a worthy use of public funds and it should not be tolerated. This is the same Treasurer who, within the last week, has said that he wants to cut expenditure in order to pay for our national defence effort in Timor. Yet he is happy to dismiss a nearly $4 billion shortfall just a few days later. He has the priorities of Jeff Kennett as well as his arrogance.
Labor supports a lower company tax rate. However, the extent of the cut and the means of funding it must be carefully considered. The proposals need further explanation and 
 investigation. But they are a sensible basis on which to commence negotiations. In particular, it will be important to test with affected industries the impact of the trade-off between the lower tax rate and the abolition of accelerated depreciation. Labor welcomes the announcement concerning venture capital and scrip for scrip. To a very significant extent, it picks up Labor's policy.
—Ha, ha!
—Don't you laugh, you know it is true; and so does the Treasurer but cannot admit it. This was the same policy, I might add, that they wanted to ridicule at the last election.
—We did ridicule the policy.
—There he is. The Treasurer said that he did ridicule this policy, and now he has picked it up. More fool you, Treasurer. Other measures, particularly the across-the-board cut to capital gains tax, need more analysis. In particular the new Costello avoidance opportunities have to be properly analysed. Inadequate information has been provided by the government to allow Labor to make a final judgment. The trade-off is simple. If this package does not pay for itself, then ordinary punters paying the GST will have to. That is not acceptable to Labor, nor should it be acceptable to the Senate, so we must ensure that the figures are real.
Labor will support all measures designed to attack tax avoidance. However, the package does not go far enough. What we have said is that we will seek, through confidential briefings, access to the information that is not contained in the material. There does remain a strong basis for getting agreement to business tax reform. Labor is committed to an outcome which yields a more competitive Australian business sector with more jobs and investment. We will continue to talk with business and to pursue a constructive reform outcome. We have written to the Treasurer seeking detailed briefings on this report. Let us see how he responds to that to test whether he is genuine about entering any dialogue. In addition, we will continue our discussions with the business community, with the Democrats and with the government to find the common ground. If we can find that common 
 ground, we will expedite its passage through both houses of the parliament. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, the one thing you did not hear in that speech, and he read every word of it, was a policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up here announcing Labor's response to the biggest overhaul of business taxation that this country has ever had and what he says is, `I can't make my mind up. I'd like to have some briefing, I'd like to talk to some other people and then I'll try and make a decision.' The one thing you never hear from the Australian Labor Party is a policy. You never get a policy out of them.
He said that he wants lower company tax, he wants a simplified taxation system, he likes venture capital cuts, he likes scrip for scrip rollover, he likes capital gains tax cuts and he wants revenue neutrality. In other words, he will support every cut but he will not support any one of the measures which is required to pay for them. Yet his real objection is that we do not have revenue neutrality. Did he say that he supported the change in accelerated depreciation? No, he did not. The change in accelerated depreciation is the one key measure that funds the package—the one thing that he studiously avoided saying anything about. Did he say that he supported the pre-payment rule, the second-largest funding of the package? No, he studiously avoided that. He says, `I'll support every cut, I won't commit myself on any funding measure, and my real objection is that there is no revenue neutrality.' It is intellectual bankruptcy—complete intellectual bankruptcy. He cannot get up here and say, `I will support a lower company tax rate paid for in an accelerated depreciation trade-off.' That is the first thing you could have committed yourself to. No, he only supports the lower company tax rate. He wants to have a look at accelerated depreciation and he wants revenue neutrality.
He supports a simplified tax system, which of course cuts company tax rates, but he does not support the pre-payment measures. He is just in favour of every tax cut that is going and he wants more revenue neutrality. I must say it is intellectually barren. I have said this 
 before: Labor was not always intellectually irresponsible. There was a time in the mid-1980s when Labor actually had people who thought about economic policy. During the period of Hawke and Keating there were people who were serious about economic policy. A test, I guess, of Labor's seriousness about economic policy was that in 1985 the Labor Party supported a broad based consumption tax. It was prepared to do something in the national interest. It had people who were prepared to go out there and argue a case, but now Labor has slipped into the so-called leadership of people who have never had a serious economic thought.
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims that this is an endorsement of the Labor Party policy before the last election. The Labor Party had two key policies before the last election. One was to put a capital gains tax on all assets bought prior to 1985. It was your key policy.
—No, it wasn't.
—It was your key capital gains tax policy, which was debated right throughout the election campaign.
—It wasn't.
—It wasn't your policy?
—It wasn't the key policy.
—It wasn't the key policy, it was just one of the policies.
—What about the pension funds? What about tax credits?
—The Treasurer should ignore the deputy leader.
—What they were arguing before the election was that Australia really needed a new capital gains tax at full marginal rates on pre-1985 assets. That is what they argued right throughout the election campaign. When they lost the election, they came out and said, `Oh, that was actually a wrong policy.' Whoops! As I said before, the luckiest thing for them was that they were not elected, because if they had been elected, by their own admission, they were trying to get elected to introduce a wrong policy. `We were saved from ourselves,' they say.
Their other key policy, and I remember it well because of a very memorable sound bite from the old deputy leader himself, was that they were going to tax the Toorak tractors. That was their other policy. What Australia really needed was higher tax on four-wheel drives. With all of the trade union bluster that he could muster from a lifetime career in trade unions, he said that he was going to tax the Toorak tractors. When they lost the election, they announced that that was a wrong policy too. They wanted to get elected to introduce two wrong policies, both of which they said after the election were wrong and were mistakes and should never have been introduced or adopted. The thing we can say for the Australian Labor Party is that the luckiest thing that ever befell them was that they were unsuccessful in the last election.
We come now to the period of indirect tax changes, the big changes in the Australian taxation system, where Labor was AWOL. Labor was absolutely AWOL on the big changes to the Australian taxation system. When the history of this period is written—when the big changes in the Australian taxation system were being put in place in 1999—serious political commentators in Australia are going to ask how it was that the Australian Democrats became the second party of Australian politics. How is it? The Australian Democrats came to the government, recognising the mandate that the government had received, and made themselves relevant to the tax debate. As for Labor, again in one of its most memorable events, the great contribution I recall the Deputy Leader of the Opposition making to the indirect tax debate was his coming into this chamber with a thermometer. Do you recall that? His thermometer was his great contribution to tax reform. And coming into this chamber with his salad in his plastic bag. This was the party of Chifley and Curtin!
Mr Emerson interjecting—
—Can you imagine it. Old Chif would have been saying, `Has my light on the hill come to being a thermometer at the dispatch box?'
Mr Emerson interjecting—
—The member for Rankin! Settle down.
—This is somebody who has been a career politician from birth—went into dad's business, through the trade union movement and into the Labor Party—and the contribution that he made in relation to the tax debate was to wave a thermometer. I said in question time and I will say it again: if the Labor Party can support national interest legislation, we would welcome them in doing it.
—Good.
—We would welcome them in doing it. If the Labor Party will stand up and will announce its support of the Ralph report—
—Oh, yes!
—a report which has been produced by three leading Australian businessmen after 12 months of inquiry—
—What about the deferred bits?
—If the Labor Party will stand up and say, `We will support the government and John Ralph'—a short sentence—then we can reform business tax in this system.
—Yes, but you don't support the deferred parts.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Slow down.
—You can see it from the way in which the speech was framed: `We cannot think of any theoretical reason why this is wrong. We cannot think why it is wrong to have a lower company tax rate. We cannot think why it is wrong to reduce capital gains taxes. We cannot think why it is wrong to introduce a simplified taxation system for small business.' But what you heard was one of those little political speeches to try to set up an opportunity to do the wrong thing. That is the key thing that happened today: to open a gate to doing the wrong thing.
It was not as if there was an argument today that it is wrong in principle to lower company tax, nor that it was wrong in principle to lower capital gains taxes, nor that it was wrong in principle to trade off indexation 
 and averaging, nor that it was wrong in principle to have a simplified taxation system and nor that it was wrong in principle to change arrangements in relation to life insurance. You never heard an argument. What you heard was an attempt to try to construct a basis for opposition to good policy.
—Rubbish!
—That is what you came in here today to do. You said, `We will be entitled to do the wrong thing if we do not get enough detail on costing,' or, `We will be entitled to do the wrong thing if we can argue revenue neutrality against the government.' All you ever hear from the Labor Party is about a mandate or an entitlement to do the wrong thing; you never hear a policy.
You would never hear the Australian Labor Party come in here and say, `We are against a lower company tax rate because our policy is a higher one, and we will tell you why.' You would never hear the Australian Labor Party come in here and say, `We are against cuts in capital gains tax because our policy is a higher one, and we will tell you why.' You never hear a theoretical underpinning on policy, and I think this is why the commentators are now saying that an opposition, used to saying no for so long, after a while loses the capacity to create.
This is why I think you are seeing trouble in relation to the leadership of Mr Beazley and his deputy, because they have now had 3½ years to construct a policy but we have not got one. They could actually say, `All right, we will support the government on this policy. This government has been determined to lead. We will support you on this'—and this would be a good political stratagem—`because the business community supports it and it is right for the country.'
Mr Nairn interjecting—
—The member for Eden-Monaro should restrain himself.
—Then they could try to move on to some other policy issue where they could try to heighten the differences. That is what a responsible opposition could do. I can remember the period when we were in opposition when we would walk to the 
 dispatch box and we would argue a policy position.
—You're joking!
—We would walk to the dispatch box and we would argue the GST day in and day out. We would walk to the dispatch box and we would argue income tax cuts until the government got to the stage where it actually implemented our income tax cuts. It said it would do it without a GST and won an election and came back into the parliament—
—Shameless!
—It was shameless.
Mr Emerson interjecting—
—This is shameless.
Mr Emerson interjecting—
—It was shameless. It was totally shameless—and you were part of it. You sit around here as if Paul Keating was somebody who is lost in the mist of history. You know, Paul who? You served behind him. You were part of his cabinet. You voted to increase every indirect tax after the 1993 election. Then you took away the income tax cuts and then you increased the company tax rates. You actually increased the company tax rates just to make sure it was a complete betrayal of the Australian electorate that was actually put in place.
Mr Emerson interjecting—
—If the member for Rankin expects protection from the chair, he should restrain himself and should set an example to others. Also, if he wishes to remain here to participate in the debate, I counsel him to be silent.
—Let us come to fiscal responsibility, because I do appreciate being given lectures by the Australian Labor Party on fiscal responsibility. This was another one of their big points in this debate. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not actually give out costs. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what he does? He adds up six-year costs—`You add it up over six years.' We do not even budget over six years; we do four years on forward estimates. He repeated in his prepared text the cost of accelerated depreci 
 ation of $10 billion, which is the accumulated cost over six years. What he does not say is that the accumulated savings, if you added them up over six years of the company tax cut, would be something like $18 billion. That is just to put a perspective on it.
Even if it were the case that this had a net cost over a four-year period of $2 billion, the accumulated budget surpluses would reduce from $28 billion to $26 billion. That is the point I made in question time. I take it the Labor Party's point is that there is a significant difference and their support will hinge now on whether the accumulated budget surpluses of the next four years will be $26 billion or $28 billion. The key question in their mind is whether the accumulated surpluses of the next four years would be $26 billion on $28 billion, after taking into account this package.
This is the proposition, apparently, now being seriously advanced by a political party that, in its last four years of government, produced a cumulative budget deficit of $57 billion. It is a turnaround between $57 billion of deficit and $26 billion of surplus. What is that? An $83 billion turnaround. When we argued that the Australian budget ought to go into surplus, we were fought every step of the way by the  Labor Party. After we have put the budget into surplus, what does the Labor Party lecture us on? Fiscal responsibility. It is an extraordinary proposition, isn't it? You fought every single savings measure—you said the budget did not need to go into surplus; you said we would put the Australian economy into an economic downturn—you fought us every step of the way, and when we put the budget into surplus you lecture us on fiscal responsibility.
Once upon a time, when the Labor Party had economic thinkers, the Keatings and the people who thought about economics, they would not even have advanced a proposition like that. That proposition is so intellectually shabby that it would not even have been advanced under the Hawke and Keating years. The way to get through business tax is to accept the recommendations that have been put to the government, to endorse the government's position to move on to reform 
 the tax system and to make this economy productive again. (Time expired)
—It has expired without him addressing the point!

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The government's response to the business tax review contains a $4 billion hole. The Treasurer says that Labor quibbles about $4 billion. We do quibble about $4 billion because $4 billion can buy a lot of education for our children and a lot of health care—$4 billion is important. The government said very clearly and very early that the task of coming up with a response to the business tax review was to produce a plan that was revenue neutral. This package fails that test fundamentally by $4 billion. Why has it failed so abysmally that test of revenue neutrality? The answer lies in the government's unwillingness to take on the hard task—for them, but not for us—of dealing with tax avoidance through the use of trusts.
This has a sorry history. When trusts started to explode in the mid-1990s, Labor started moving against those trusts. Labor introduced legislation into the parliament and it was blocked in the Senate by a combination of the Democrats and the now government, including the Treasurer advising them to block this legislation in the Senate. They did block it. We then went to the 1996 election and the present government was formed. In 1996, the government said, `We are going to do something about trusts,' but did not. In 1997, they said, `It is getting worse; we are going to do something about trusts,' and they did nothing. In 1998, when the government went to the federal election, they put in the ANTS package figures on the revenue that would be gained from attacking trusts—that is, tax avoidance through trusts—and they said, `We are going to do that,' but they did not. When they came to confront the issue, they said, `We will put that off to the business tax review'—and it has been put off to the business tax review. Mr Ralph, to his credit, said, `From 1 July next year, these measures should 
 be implemented to attack tax avoidance through trusts.' What has the government said? `We're going to put it off for another year, to 1 July in the following year.'
Why is the government putting off dealing with tax avoidance through trusts? The answer is quite clear: 17 frontbenchers on the government side hold trusts. This is a massive conflict of interest. They formed a special taxation committee, and they are all members of it of course. You can imagine the talk down the corridor. One says, `Are you going to the special meeting of the taxation committee?' and the other one says, `I wouldn't miss it for quids!' And you would not miss it for quids. You cannot afford to miss it if you are on the front bench, because 17 have these trusts.
What has that done to the revenue neutrality of this package? It has blown it to smithereens because the overall impact, over the period of the measures that have been announced by the government in reducing the corporate tax rate, capital gains tax changes and so on, is $3.8 billion. That is the cost, but if you look at the line underneath that it says, `The impact of the deferred measures.' If you add those up over the same period, it is $4.22 billion. That is more than enough to cover the hole. These deferred measures are primarily the deferral of the government's decisions on trusts.
The deferral was foreshadowed by the then Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the National Party in his party room when he said, `We will kill this in cabinet.' Well, it looks as though they have had a great victory because the footnote on the deferred measures says:
The revenue from the deferred measures is dependent upon the time of implementation.
Someone had enough integrity to put that in. If these measures were going to proceed from 1 July 2001, they would be able to put the figures for those in here and fill the hole, but someone with integrity has admitted that there is no fixed date for the implementation of this legislation. We would take heart if we were able to see some legislation. The government has been drafting legislation hand over fist 
 but not one line of legislation dealing with trusts.
The Treasurer, on AM this morning, laid down the Costello doctrine. He said:
Normally what happens when a government announces a tax policy is that an opposition gives it bipartisan support because they recognise that governments have to enact these packages . . . 
He went on to refer to `normal' rules. The Treasurer spoke in question time against opportunism on the part of political parties. That is the Costello doctrine—bipartisan support for any tax changes that a government introduces because, to use his words, `Governments have to enact these tax packages.'
Do you know how many times the Costello doctrine was violated in the 1980s by the current Prime Minister of Australia? No less than 12 times. The coalition, then in opposition, voted against the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1984, which was an anti-avoidance measure. It voted against the Trust Recoupment Tax Assessment Bill 1985. The coalition certainly had form! It voted against the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax Assessment) Amendment Bill 1985, which dealt with bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It voted against the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1985 to remove the tax deductibility of entertainment expenses by big business. It voted against that! It is a case of, `You go out to your free lunches; it'll be subsidised by the taxpayers of Australia. That's our policy.' And we get lectured about opportunism!
The coalition voted against Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) of 1985 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Bill 1986. The coalition, the now government, opposed the Income Tax Amendment (Capital Gains Tax) Bill, which provided a capital gains tax and stopped high income earners converting their income into capital, thereby avoiding tax. In 1986 it opposed the petroleum resource rent tax, and it opposed it again in 1987. There we have it. There were also the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6). There are a dozen of them.
These are the opportunists. `We are going to offer you bipartisan support,' is what we said to them, and we meant it. They said, `We have to have bipartisan support on all these things.' A dozen times! It happened in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990—I have not counted any of the repeated times that they did this during the 1990s. Will the Treasurer rebuke the Prime Minister for his opportunism during the 1980s? `Bad Prime Minister for being opportunistic!'
We will have a good responsible look at this legislation.	The shadow Treasurer wrote to the Treasurer time and time again. He said, `Give us some advance notice; give us access to the Ralph report so that we may have a look at this in the spirit of bipartisanship.' Last night the Treasurer was in the media saying, `I'm not going to deal with Labor because I can deal with my friends in the Democrats. We'll get an easier deal.' Dirty deals done dirt cheap with the Democrats!
The Leader of the Opposition time and time again offered a bipartisan approach to this. The Prime Minister said, hands across the table, `Let's get into some sort of bipartisan spirit on business tax,' but they are not interested in that; they themselves are interested in opportunism. The Treasurer asked us during question time, `What do you support?' We support a lot of the measures here, but the fundamental measure that the government has deferred—that we will offer full bipartisan support to—is a long belated attack on tax avoidance through the use of trusts. The government do not have the courage or the willingness to take on their constituents, and they do not have the fortitude to look over the top of their conflict of interest—the 17 members of that tax review committee—to come up with a decent policy that will make for a fairer Australia.
We have this huge $4 billion hole. How is that hole going to be paid for over time? It will be by ordinary Australians through extra tax and through further cuts in services—further cuts to education in this country, which has been cut savagely by this government, and further cuts to health, which has been cut savagely by this government. When will this government show some decency and 
 take on what for them is a hard issue—that is, overruling the 17 people who have a conflict of interest—and do something, for once in their lives, for decency and fairness in this country?

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent some time talking about tax avoidance. In the excitable way the government has come to expect from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, he said in his speech that these changes do not go far enough. The member for Rankin, in his shabby way—which unfortunately surprised us on this side of the House—launched a very personal attack on people who hold trusts. He also talked about tax avoidance and asked why the government had not done something about tax avoidance earlier.
This side of the House finds it amazing—it makes us laugh—that the Labor Party has a genuine belief that it can come into this House and lecture us about doing things about tax avoidance. After 13 years of Labor government one finds it hard to remember when it was denied the implementation of a tax avoidance measure. The coalition did everything it could to support the former Labor government when it was in power, but now that we are in government, Labor puts up every hurdle. It comes in and lectures us when, for 13 years, it had a chance to do something about tax avoidance. One wonders when they were going to do it. In the 14th year?
In the 1993 election, Ralph Willis waxed lyrical about tax avoidance and how they were going to fix up trusts when they were in power. Was anything done after the 1993 election, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins? You were a member of the then government; you would remember. Nothing was done by Ralph Willis when he was Treasurer following the 1993 election. For 13 years, Labor failed to effectively manage the Commonwealth budget in this country. It left a legacy of debt, excessive largesse and economic failure, and it did it all with the c'est la vie attitude of the Bourbon regime of France.
Labor is as economically illiterate as the rotten Bourbon regimes of continental Europe. Its capacity for self-delusion is legendary, but 
 this matter of public importance has raised the high bar even further. How can the Labor Party genuinely believe that it can come into this House and lecture this government—the government that has delivered surplus budgets within three years of coming to office—about fiscal rectitude? It is like Mobutu Sese Seko of Congo or Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania trying to plead the case for equitable distribution of incomes.
Labor's legacy to Australia included interest rates soaring above 20 per cent, record high inflation and a deficit of over $10 billion. This package of business tax reform is the most far reaching of its kind in the history of the Commonwealth. Don't just take my word for it, listen to what the President of the Taxation Institute of Australia said:
Small business is a winner under the government's proposed New Business Tax System. Tax should no longer be a hindrance to the competitiveness of small business to the extent that it is at present.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Investment and Financial Services Association said that:
The reduction [to the company tax rate] will make Australia's companies and capital markets internationally competitive and will encourage new business ventures.
The Director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants said quite simply, `This looks like an exceptionally good package.' Labor is so hopelessly lost on this issue that they remind me of what Benjamin Disraeli said when he commented, `They are not so much out of their depth as they are three miles from the shore.' Labor has had more sides about what to do in business tax reform than a 50 cent piece. It is not like they have not had plenty of choices about where to get advice. They could turn to the book of the member for Werriwa, they could turn to the book of the member for Melbourne, who is sitting near the dispatch boxes, or they could turn to the bible of the left launched by Martin Ferguson or the myriad other sources of advice set up by the Leader of the Opposition in the last few months because of his inability to make a decision. They could turn to these sources to know what to do next.
The incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition to make decisions or stick to a decision 
 was well documented by the Hon. Neal Blewett in his book A Cabinet Diary, in which he wrote that the Opposition Leader was `flawed by a streak of most un-Churchillian timidity'. Later in the book he explained why:
For so outwardly aggressive a figure he is extraordinarily timid, fearful of the students over the loan proposals, fearful of the Bishops over Catholic schools, fearful now of the public servants over the proposed Austudy transfer.
Labor are a rudderless ship, snatching desperately at straws to fend off the inevitable. Inevitably, they will have to look seriously at tax reform. I know, and the government side knows, that they are a bit burnt since the attempt at tax policy by the member for Holt at the last election, but they are going to have to do more work than has been put into this matter of public importance by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
The government's business tax reform plan is a blueprint for more investment and more jobs in Australia. The most visible feature of a country's business tax system is its company tax rate. The measured reductions proposed to the company tax rate, from 36 per cent to 34 per cent and then to 30 per cent, will earn Australia a reputation as an attractive and efficient place to invest and do business. Compare the proposed package to the tax regimes of some of our international competitors. Australia will enjoy a company tax rate which is lower than those of the United States, New Zealand, Germany, Korea, the United Kingdom and most of our regional neighbours—the countries we are often competing with for international investment.
This is a comprehensive package of reforms which will deliver Australia a world competitive business tax system. Reducing the company tax rate will encourage the expansion of less capital intensive industries, particularly industries which are exporting services, such as the tourism industry. Slashing the company tax rate will also foster a broader range of foreign investment which will extend beyond mining and manufacturing and make many of our domestic industries more internationally competitive. Yet we have our toy soldier shadow Treasurer grasping at straws, with a distorted interpretation of the report's figures. 
 He claims that the government's response costs revenue around $3.8 billion by adding in the impact of the announced decisions together over six years. That has no foundation. As the Treasurer said in question time today and earlier in this MPI discussion, that claim is as plausible as claiming that the real budget deficit left by Labor was $57 billion, because that is what it would have been after six years of more of the same. If they would like us to, we are happy to use that figure instead of the $10 billion of actual budget deficit they left this country with after their term of office. We are happy to say it was $57 billion if they want to start getting into those sorts of rubbery figures.
The report clearly indicates that the reforms are revenue neutral in the first two years—in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. In the third year the reforms are revenue negative by approximately $1½ billion. Furthermore, there are some deferred measures disclosed in the report which may come into operation and which will raise approximately $800 million. If these deferred measures are adopted, we will have a bottom line of close to revenue neutrality after four years.
Surely it is impossible for the member for Hotham, the heir to the poisoned chalice that is Labor's shadow treasury under our Treasurer, to ignore the advantages of a lower and more uniform application of company tax. Unfortunately, it seems that he is still hogtied to the ACTU just as his predecessor, the member for Holt, was. The member for Hotham does not understand—or perhaps the unions will not let him acknowledge—that Australia's economic future lies in the services industry. At present, just over 40 per cent of Australia's work force are employed in the service and information sectors. All available indicators show that this figure will increase as we move into the next century. That is why the government has done what the former Labor government never could—reform the broken tax system that this government inherited from Labor and give our emerging industries a chance to be internationally competitive.
The business tax package is a shot in the arm for the service and information sectors. 
 The services sector will benefit from venture capital investments, a lower company tax rate, lower personal tax rates and reduced compliance costs. Reductions to the capital gains tax rates will encourage investment and saving and ensure that the services sector continues to contribute to economic and jobs growth. So why doesn't the member for Hotham focus on this in his debate? Why does he always look for the negative? Why doesn't the member for Hotham come up with any positive ideas? Why does he try to pretend that for 13 years Labor could not make the changes that we are making? Why does he try to pretend they were going to do it in the 14th year?
The member for Hotham should consult his colleague the member for Werriwa. He understands something that the rest of his colleagues do not: that economic efficiency is best achieved if consumption patterns are determined by the true cost of production, and not by tax considerations. The member for Werriwa and all the members on this side of the House know that the current tax system fails to achieve adequate efficiency. If Australia is to remain internationally competitive and to stay in front of the pack, we need to lower the company tax rate to 30 per cent, reduce distortionary measures in the business tax system and provide an `aspirational' incentive for Australia's small investors. We are a reforming government, but there is more work to be done. Last night on the 7.30 Report the Treasurer quoted some of the things that we are going to continue to tackle. He said:
. . . there's a lot of work to be done at the Commonwealth level . . . We have a complete tax reform . . . We're reforming family entitlements.
There's more work to be done in relation to welfare reform. We're privatising Telstra and retiring Government debt. There's more work to be done in relation to industrial relations.
The faster we achieve reform the faster we will progress as a country. This tax package will deliver just that, and I commend it to the House.

—I seek leave to make a brief statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
—I thank the House and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. As far as I am aware, this is probably the first time that a statement has been made in relation to a report of the Selection Committee, and I make it at the unanimous request of the members of that committee. You will be very much aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Selection Committee's task is to allocate time for private members business on private members days. One of the frustrations that the committee experiences is that normally there are only 45 minutes available for the presentation of committee and delegation reports.
Under a recent change to the standing orders, the Selection Committee does have the option of cutting into private members business to provide more time for committee and delegation reports. The view of the committee is that it is not satisfactory, where people have made an enormous effort, either in a 
 parliamentary delegation or in a committee inquiry—sometimes taking a year or two years—that, because of time constraints, they are not able to speak for a reasonable time or they are not able to speak at all.
The matters contained in the report I have just presented include an Australian parliamentary delegation which spent a week in the Philippines and a week in Japan, which I actually led. We sought a total of 15 minutes for the debate of that report—not a great deal of time—but we are able to accord it only 10 minutes.
The Joint Standing Committee on Migration have a report to present, entitled Going for gold: Immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games—a very important subject. They requested 25 minutes, and the committee was able to allocate them only 15 minutes. The next one is a report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on a visit to the northern defence bases. I naturally do not know what is in the report, but I would imagine, in view of what has happened in the last few days, that the parliament would be very interested to know the details of that report regarding our northern defence bases. They asked for 15 or 20 minutes; we were able to give them 10 minutes.
The next one is a report by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, on treaties tabled on 11 August 1999. They wanted `as much time as possible' and we were able to give them only 10 minutes. The final one is another report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the peace process in Bougainville—another very important issue and a very important report. They asked for an undetermined time, and we were able, by cutting into private members business, to provide 20 minutes for that report.
I will not go on in greater detail, except to say that the committee is continually being bombarded by members because of their frustration and perturbation at not having the opportunity to discuss the reports or delegations that they have spent so much time on. I just wanted to advise the House that the Selection Committee is concerned about this 
 matter. We are operating within the standing orders, but we believe there needs to be something extra done to provide backbench members—ordinary members—with sufficient time to speak about the enormous effort that they put into the compilation and examination of inquiries and delegations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"Sercombe, Bob,MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—by leave—I will be very brief, because I think the honourable member for Cowper has very adequately covered the matters on which the Selection Committee deliberated on Monday of this week. This is a committee which I think does work very effectively in a cross-partisan way in terms of reflecting the interests and concerns of members of the House, giving the opportunity for members to make a contribution, and ensuring that parliamentary delegations which carry out very important work on behalf of all members of the House have some opportunity to present it.
As the honourable member for Cowper has indicated, this is a matter that is increasingly of concern to members of the Selection Committee, because the immense amount of work that members put in, on both private members business and on delegation matters, does not receive the attention in the House that it ought to.
I would like to draw to the attention of the Manager of Government Business and others in the House that members have an interest in ensuring that this matter is considered so that work that private members and delegations do achieves more recognition and more opportunity for consideration. The purpose of my very brief statement is to support the remarks made by the member for Cowper on this matter.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—by leave—I would like to place on notice that I have not heard the full input of either of the members who have spoken before. I do have some concerns that my colleague opposite purports to speak for all members in relation to our views on various matters. I would also like to place on record that it perhaps might have been appropriate for this matter to have been discussed with all members of the Selection Committee before it was raised in 
 the House today. If the views of the honourable member opposite are meant to indicate full compliance on behalf of all members of the Selection Committee, I am sure that all members of the Selection Committee would like to have some discussion before statements are made on their behalf.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection Committee</title>,Committees,16,1

—I seek leave to make a brief statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
—I thank the House and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. As far as I am aware, this is probably the first time that a statement has been made in relation to a report of the Selection Committee, and I make it at the unanimous request of the members of that committee. You will be very much aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Selection Committee's task is to allocate time for private members business on private members days. One of the frustrations that the committee experiences is that normally there are only 45 minutes available for the presentation of committee and delegation reports.
Under a recent change to the standing orders, the Selection Committee does have the option of cutting into private members business to provide more time for committee and delegation reports. The view of the committee is that it is not satisfactory, where people have made an enormous effort, either in a 
 parliamentary delegation or in a committee inquiry—sometimes taking a year or two years—that, because of time constraints, they are not able to speak for a reasonable time or they are not able to speak at all.
The matters contained in the report I have just presented include an Australian parliamentary delegation which spent a week in the Philippines and a week in Japan, which I actually led. We sought a total of 15 minutes for the debate of that report—not a great deal of time—but we are able to accord it only 10 minutes.
The Joint Standing Committee on Migration have a report to present, entitled Going for gold: Immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games—a very important subject. They requested 25 minutes, and the committee was able to allocate them only 15 minutes. The next one is a report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on a visit to the northern defence bases. I naturally do not know what is in the report, but I would imagine, in view of what has happened in the last few days, that the parliament would be very interested to know the details of that report regarding our northern defence bases. They asked for 15 or 20 minutes; we were able to give them 10 minutes.
The next one is a report by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, on treaties tabled on 11 August 1999. They wanted `as much time as possible' and we were able to give them only 10 minutes. The final one is another report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the peace process in Bougainville—another very important issue and a very important report. They asked for an undetermined time, and we were able, by cutting into private members business, to provide 20 minutes for that report.
I will not go on in greater detail, except to say that the committee is continually being bombarded by members because of their frustration and perturbation at not having the opportunity to discuss the reports or delegations that they have spent so much time on. I just wanted to advise the House that the Selection Committee is concerned about this 
 matter. We are operating within the standing orders, but we believe there needs to be something extra done to provide backbench members—ordinary members—with sufficient time to speak about the enormous effort that they put into the compilation and examination of inquiries and delegations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2
"Sercombe, Bob,MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—by leave—I will be very brief, because I think the honourable member for Cowper has very adequately covered the matters on which the Selection Committee deliberated on Monday of this week. This is a committee which I think does work very effectively in a cross-partisan way in terms of reflecting the interests and concerns of members of the House, giving the opportunity for members to make a contribution, and ensuring that parliamentary delegations which carry out very important work on behalf of all members of the House have some opportunity to present it.
As the honourable member for Cowper has indicated, this is a matter that is increasingly of concern to members of the Selection Committee, because the immense amount of work that members put in, on both private members business and on delegation matters, does not receive the attention in the House that it ought to.
I would like to draw to the attention of the Manager of Government Business and others in the House that members have an interest in ensuring that this matter is considered so that work that private members and delegations do achieves more recognition and more opportunity for consideration. The purpose of my very brief statement is to support the remarks made by the member for Cowper on this matter.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—by leave—I would like to place on notice that I have not heard the full input of either of the members who have spoken before. I do have some concerns that my colleague opposite purports to speak for all members in relation to our views on various matters. I would also like to place on record that it perhaps might have been appropriate for this matter to have been discussed with all members of the Selection Committee before it was raised in 
 the House today. If the views of the honourable member opposite are meant to indicate full compliance on behalf of all members of the Selection Committee, I am sure that all members of the Selection Committee would like to have some discussion before statements are made on their behalf.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—Prior to the adjournment of the debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  earlier today, I had addressed the provisions of this bill as they reflect the government's broad approach to higher education policy. In particular, I had pointed to the problems that this bill continues. Those problems are the continued underfunding of the sector and the fact that, in terms of the funding formulas, there is no regard to the 
 different capacities of rural and regional universities—universities such as the Victoria University of Technology, which is located in my electorate—to raise private sector funds from the capacities shown by our ivy league universities. I had also pointed to the continuing problem of the government's disregard for access and equity questions in terms of higher education. That is well and truly continued in this bill with the phasing out, as it is defined in this bill, of the higher education equity merit scholarship scheme.
Immediately prior to this debate being adjourned I had commenced to address the amendment the opposition has moved and the question of some good initiatives being held hostage to the fact that they are tied to the minister's voluntary student unionism legislation. I indicated that on 12 May this House dealt with the bill concerning voluntary student unionism but it also had within it a number of important provisions regarding Queensland universities. Specifically, those important provisions were to add the name of the University of the Sunshine Coast to the list of institutions able to receive funding directly from the Commonwealth. Until that matter is legislated and the name is put on that list, the University of the Sunshine Coast has to receive its funding through another Queensland university. That is obviously an important provision to the students and staff of the University of the Sunshine Coast and an amendment which the Labor Party supports.
Also within that bill is the question of changing the name of the James Cook University of North Queensland to James Cook University, presumably a change much desired by James Cook and something that they would want to see dealt with to finality. But those particular provisions, those particular changes which the Labor Party would support, have become bundled together with the bill that this House dealt with on 12 May which contained the voluntary student unionism provisions. People will no doubt recall that debate. That debate was gagged with many opposition speakers wishing to continue to speak on the question, but the government did not want the debate continued. Ironically, 
 perhaps, the minister did not even turn up for the division on the gag, but the debate was gagged. Here we are, after the passage of 133 days, seeing no progress with that piece of legislation in the Senate. Simply nothing has happened with it. I think we can explain why nothing has happened with it. Nothing has happened with it because it is a bill which will not garner the support of the Senate in the same way that it has not garnered the support of the education community or the community generally.
Indeed, I think we can fully explain that bill ever being presented to this House and being dealt with by this House as part of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs' ideological obsession with the question of voluntary student unionism. As a former student union activist and as a former president of the Australian Union of Students, I am somewhat younger than the minister for education, and I hope better preserved—
—I would not bet on that.
—Unfortunately that is not something that is being agreed to by colleagues. I am somewhat younger than the minister for education. But it was well known amongst the student union community when I was there that the minister in his youth had pursued vigorously the question of voluntary student unionism as a student union activist. On each and every occasion that he pursued that question he failed to make any inroads. I think, given those failures in his youth, he has now sought to do something in his middle age which he could not achieve as a youngster. In his middle age, in seeking to achieve that result, he once again is staring down at a failure because, as we all know, when that idea was presented to the education community it was rejected all round. It was rejected by student unions; it was rejected by students generally. It was not supported by academics; it was not supported by vice-chancellors; it was not supported by student university sporting organisations; it was not supported by those concerned with student welfare and, indeed, it was not supported by a substantial number of members present on the govern 
 ment's own backbench—and they are on the public record in relation to the question.
I can certainly say that in my electorate, which contains the Werribee campus of the Victoria University of Technology, the issue of voluntary student unionism most certainly was not supported. I think once again this is the kind of issue about our non-ivy league universities which the government simply fails to understand. The council of the Victoria University of Technology actually wrote to the minister about this question in March and specifically raised its own position on the question of voluntary student unionism. It said:
New universities like ours, with a large number of campuses, have not had the opportunity to build up the student support and amenities infrastructure which exists in more established institutions so the inevitable losses of revenue—
that is, the loss of student fees should the voluntary student unionism legislation ever pass into law—
will be particularly damaging. The problem is made even worse by the lower socio-economic group from which much of our student population is traditionally drawn, making it difficult to raise what would need to be a greatly increased general services fee (GSF) as a voluntary contribution.
The letter goes on:
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that in an effort to establish the standard of amenities required to attract students to the newer Victoria University campuses the Victoria University Student Union arranged to borrow money from the University to build new facilities. The University lent this money on the understanding that the debt would be served by future GSF proceeds.
So we can see there—and I think it is actually a theme throughout the education issues that this bill raises—that the government has no understanding of the needs and issues that face the newer campuses, the campuses that are not ivy league campuses. They have different needs in respect of funding, they have a different capacity to raise private sector funds from those of the ivy league universities and, even in terms of the question of voluntary student unionism—which is objectionable overall—that in and of itself would raise a differential and harsher impact on those campuses than it would on the ivy league universities.
So what we are proposing today to assist the minister out of the conundrum that he has got himself into, to assist him to get away from the position where he has tied some desirable reforms with a highly undesirable reform—with a reform for which he can get no support and is unlikely to secure passage of the legislation in the Senate—in order to assist him out of that position that he has put himself in, to help him to get over his incompetent performance, we are suggesting that the desirable bits of the legislation that are stalled before the Senate, by amendment, be dealt with as part of the bill today. I honestly cannot see there being any objection to that, given that they are reforms that have broad support across this chamber and are supported by the institutions in question. I would have thought, given the debacle that the voluntary student unionism debate has been for this minister and for the government overall, that a face saving way out would be what they are looking for. On that basis I urge members to consider the amendment that has been moved and to consider the broader education policy questions which are raised by this bill.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—I rise today in support of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 . As the pace of change increases in Australia, and as we move towards the 21st century, it is imperative that the government has the appropriate higher education focus to meet the significant challenges that lie ahead. That is why I am so enthusiastic about supporting the bill before the House today. Given the coalition's willingness to provide the opportunity of near universal tertiary education at university, in vocational education and in the TAFE sector, effective higher education outcomes are fundamental and critical to ensuring that Australia can continue to prosper in the information age.
When assessing the impact of the government's proposed amendments, it is clear that the coalition is committed to providing flexibility for students to maximise the benefit from their study at higher education institutions. To ensure this, it makes sense for institutions to be lessening their dependence on Commonwealth funding. This poses a 
 challenge to higher education institutions to be much more responsive to students, business and community needs, as well as to be proactive in generating their own income to fulfil goals that they have for themselves as institutions.
Currently and in the past universities have provided research and have worked with the private sector, particularly business enterprises, in a variety of communal projects. My own university—the Queensland University of Technology—and the marketing and international department in which I worked, provided regular modelling and worked consistently with the business sector, particularly in marketing consumer behaviour models.
The purpose of this bill here today is to provide new levels of maximum grants for higher education in the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. The good news about specific funding for higher education can be observed by considering the figures of Commonwealth financial support. Overall, more than $10 billion is available in maximum grants for operating purposes for the years 1999 and 2001. Given the vital strategic importance of research in higher education, the coalition government has fulfilled its promise of funding for research infrastructure and has said that this will not fall below the 1996 levels. As a consequence of this, total funding for research infrastructure over the next three years will be over $315 million for each year.
I know that many people living in my electorate of Petrie will welcome the increasing opportunities available to them to study and to be better equipped for a satisfying career of their choice. In particular I draw attention to the benefits and opportunities to students at the Carseldine campus of the Queensland University of Technology and campuses of the North Point Institute of TAFE at Redcliffe and Bracken Ridge. Obviously, these institutions will continue to be encouraged to be relevant and responsive in preparing today's students for the job opportunities that will be created in the next century. There is no doubt that how these institutions prepare students will have a direct impact on the economic and social fabric 
 within the electorate as well as a wider impact on the country.
Recently I had occasion to present a $4 million cheque to the Queensland University of Technology at the Carseldine campus. I have to applaud their efforts in developing their science and information technology program. It is my dream and vision that that particular area of my electorate will become a high-tech information technology triangle, particularly with the development of Mango Hill—or Northern Lakes as it is known now in the middle of my electorate—which will have a housing development as well as an information technology park. This is the way of the future and IT is clearly an area which the universities and colleges of higher education in my electorate are moving towards, and it is one of the most significant areas for job opportunities in the future.
Some significant changes have come about in how higher education has been funded since the Commonwealth took over responsibility for higher education in 1974. Of critical importance was the introduction of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, HECS, by the then Labor government in 1989. The Howard government has improved on this scheme, and very sensibly, by allowing a number of things. Firstly, it has allowed for the differentiation of the rates of repayment dependent on what particular course of study is pursued. The electorate understands very well that it is only fair that students who study towards a degree which leads to a significantly higher income should not be subsidised by other students.
HECS is vitally important because its continuation has allowed for real expansion of the higher education sector when there have been very real pressures on government expenditure to guarantee responsible economic management. This year there will be $8.6 billion available to Australian universities. Of this, the Commonwealth will be contributing $5.6 billion, which includes money collected from HECS contributions. There can only be greater benefits for students as institutions are encouraged to obtain alternative sources of income from private sources.
As well as HECS, higher education institutions have become less dependent upon government grants by the introduction of fee paying students. These fees were first introduced for overseas students in 1986 and they were followed by some postgraduate courses in 1989. Last year the Howard government took the logical next step by allowing Australian students to be able to pay for some undergraduate positions and they have been received very well indeed.
When assessing the financial figures for the funding of higher education, it is important to realise that DETYA has chosen to combine both the higher and vocational education sector into one group under its accrual accounting format. This lack of distinction between the two is highlighted by the Higher Education Report for the 1999-2001 Triennium, where the trends indicate the continuation of the integration of traditional boundaries in postcompulsory education. It is important to note that. As a result of this, there will continue to be even greater pressure on regulatory and financing arrangements to accommodate this trend.
The significance of this can be understood in the context of some of the recommendations of the West report, and they have been mentioned by previous speakers before me today. This included the following: public funding should be directed through the student rather than through the institution; there also needs to be greater flexibility for institutions to set tuition fees and to determine their actual student numbers; and there should be student access to income contingent loans.
The result of the government's initiatives in higher education means that more opportunities exist for all Australians to study at a postcompulsory level. Eighty-eight per cent of higher education grants are devoted to one program only, namely, the operating grants for higher education institutions. There are two sources of these funds, Commonwealth grants and higher education students. Because of the rise in the HECS payments, the Commonwealth contribution to operating grants will be the same as it was in 1983, although the planned student load will have increased by 58 per cent.
Given the growth in the HECS stream and the potential for the pick up in the full fee paying Asian students, there is every likelihood that the Commonwealth grants will drop below 50 per cent in this current triennium. To put that into perspective, this will roughly equate to the proportion that existed before 1974 when the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for funding higher education.
The real issue is how financial contributions have affected student place numbers. The reality is that, under the coalition's leadership, there will be an estimated 402,372 students studying towards an undergraduate degree in Australian universities this year.
—How many?
—An estimated 402,372. This includes the government's decision to allow 1,740 full paying positions to be made available. An extra 12,665 Commonwealth funded places for undergraduate students have been made available in the last two years. Altogether, the Commonwealth will fund 364,400 undergraduate student places in the university sector.
However, having record numbers of students in higher education is not an end in itself. Students must have the confidence that the particular institutions that they are attending are pursuing the highest standard of excellence. Part of this responsibility involves the recognition of the vital difference that an inspired lecturer can make in ensuring that students maximise both their potential and their higher education experience, and the coalition government is eager to encourage and reward excellence in teaching.
As a result, I would like to draw attention to the Australian Awards for University Teaching. As a Queensland member of parliament, I would like to take this opportunity also to highlight the outstanding contribution of Ms Spegel from the University of Queensland. Ms Spegel was one of the 10 winners of this award and was well regarded for her expertise and professionalism in the teaching field of law and legal studies. That this achievement has been recognised is indicative of the commitment of this government to reward and encourage excellence in the higher education sector.
Finally, the coalition government has an ongoing concern about the needs of rural and remote students, and in particular how they may contribute to their local community when their studies have been completed. This is why I welcome the announcement that there will be 60 places at the new medical school at James Cook University in Townsville. Significantly, each year there will be five places earmarked for indigenous students and 15 for students in remote and rural areas.
Mr Lindsay interjecting—
—I note the member for Herbert is very pleased about the new medical school and no doubt will speak about that later on. This example highlights the commitment of the coalition government to making higher education open and accessible to all who want to pursue further study options and particularly commendable is the fact that there will be a new medical school. It is the first time that a new medical school has been opened in Townsville in 25 years.
—Due to the work of the member for Herbert.
—Indeed. The work pursued in this area by the member and the government will provide a number of things to the community. Rural communities do tend to lose a number of their medical staff, particularly when they go to university in some of the cities. By encouraging a new medical school, more and more students will be encouraged to go back to the particular regions and country areas where they are from. Hopefully they will continue to practise medicine in those areas and provide welcome relief for their communities, particularly when they have been part of the community for such a long time.
To conclude, it is very clear that the funding arrangements that the government is intent on implementing will help higher education institutions to be much more flexible and to be much more responsive to the needs of students, the community and also the economy. Lessening the dependence on the Commonwealth grants can only achieve significant improvements for the sector as a whole. Excellence must be the overriding factor here in ensuring that students are 
 appropriately equipped to make a very meaningful contribution to Australia as we progress to the 21st century. The proposed funding arrangements for the current triennium will help ensure that this is the case. I commend this amendment bill to the House today.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The member for Petrie is correct in saying it is very important to honour the work of inspired lecturers. It is just a terrible shame for the Australian education sector that we do not have an inspired minister or an inspired Prime Minister. It is quite amazing that, 3½ years into Mr Howard's prime ministership, he is yet to make his first speech on Australia's potential as a knowledge society, a knowledge economy. It is amazing by the standards of international leadership that our Prime Minister has not made one speech in 3½ years on those all important subjects for Australia's future.
The last time I spoke on higher education in the House, I set out ideas for a focused research agenda at the University of Western Sydney covering my electorate. I then followed up with an article in the Campus Review on 25 August, setting out a positive agenda for the university's second stage of development, and then the Vice-Chancellor of the UWS, Jan Reid, responded. She put pen to paper and had published in the Campus Review an article on 1 September. It was in fact a very defensive and disappointing response, which does not address my core concerns about the University of Western Sydney.
It may be a shock to some publicly funded academics that it is indeed healthy for parliamentarians to cast a constructively critical eye over their performance from time to time. These things may come as a shock, but I am afraid to say they are absolutely necessary in the democratic process and the accountability for the good expenditure of public funds.
There was no response to the particular problem I raised at the University of Western Sydney Macarthur regarding poor attitudes towards TAFE links. My comments on the university's federated structure were dismissed by the Vice-Chancellor, Mrs Reid. The House can then imagine my interest when I saw the 
 front page of the Campus Review two weeks later, which stated:
PROFESSOR Janice Reid, vice-chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, has been asked by the UWS board of trustees and the university's three member councils . . . to prepare a paper on the future shape or structure of UWS by October 10.
The request to Reid, by a special combined meeting of the trustees and the three member councils last week, may signal the end of the statutory UWS ""federation"", the only such structure among Australian universities.
Several senior UWS executives present told Campus Review  that the meeting's clear consensus held that UWS could no longer afford a ""federated"" structure in which services were ""triplicated"".
Obviously, the board of trustees and the member councils did not share the vice-chancellor's enthusiasm that the university was well advanced in addressing these issues arising from its federated structure. The vice-chancellor dismissed the federal department's figures on equity performance as `misleading'. She then said:
UWS is by far the strongest equity performer among other metropolitan New South Wales universities.
My first response to that statement was to think, `So what?' As I am sure the member for Batman would know from his time growing up in Western Sydney, it is no great achievement to have a bigger equity performance in higher education than the University of Sydney, UNSW, UTS and Macquarie. What state of affairs would we have in Sydney if UWS was not the strongest equity performer?
Despite that first reaction of `So what?' the statement itself is not true. Newcastle can be classified as a metropolitan university in New South Wales. It certainly covers an urban area. Its equity performance is quite revealing. Newcastle draws 25.1 per cent of its students from the bottom quarter of socioeconomic status areas in urban New South Wales. Compare that performance with UWS at just 19.5 per cent of its students. The vice-chancellor has still got it wrong. UWS lags behind the University of Newcastle among the New South Wales higher education institutions in its equity performance, measured by the 
 number of students coming from the bottom SES urban areas.
To take an interstate comparison, there is still even greater concern about the UWS equity performance. The Victorian University of Technology, which is comparable because it covers the western suburbs of Melbourne, has an equity performance whereby 30.7 per cent of its students are drawn from the bottom 25 per cent of suburbs in urban Victoria. My point is that the University of Western Sydney has much to learn from VUT in terms of equity strategies. VUT, as a dual sector institution with sophisticated equity concerns and strategies, is leading the way in the country. All I say is that there is no shame in UWS learning from that and starting to match the outstanding equity performance of VUT. I wish every single university in Australia could have the VUT equity performance: over 30 per cent of its students drawn from the bottom 25 per cent of suburbs. That is a fine performance and one which the UWS can learn from and, indeed, the Western Sydney region can benefit from.
Fourthly, I suggested a focused UWS research strategy using the university's great strengths, that is, some of the economic and social issues in its own backyard, the region of Western Sydney itself. Vice-Chancellor Reid could point out in reply only that the Urban Frontiers Program was in place, trying to leave readers of Campus Review with the impression that this was a longstanding UWS research institution. In fact, it is due to be formally launched in December this year. Its program is not yet 12 months old and its formal launch is some months hence. While welcome, it does not nullify the view which I set out in Campus Review and which I now give to the House:
By financial necessity, UWS needs to develop specialities in its research work. This is the only way it can build a national and international research reputation. It needs to pitch its expertise and resources to the establishment of competitive advantages in the global learning environment.
In this task, the university's greatest asset is in its own backyard. No part of the nation or even the globe has a more diverse and challenging social and economic environment than Western Sydney. It is a natural laboratory for the study of 
 globalisation impacts, labour market change, modern service delivery, multiculturalism, social exclusion and social capital. The natural resource for research at UWS is the region itself.
Unhappily, UWS has not used this resource well. It seems to have dabbled with all kinds of research disciplines except its strategic strength. It has had little to add to current debates about the welfare state. It has no centre for the study of population and settlement along the lines of Monash University. It has no institute for the study of urban poverty on the scale of the University of Wisconsin. It is neglecting the one great service it can do for itself and the people of Western Sydney: new research and new answers to the great socio-economic issues of our time.
Vice-Chancellor Reid's Campus Review  article does not engage in a positive dialogue about her plans and vision for the future of UWS. As I again pointed out in my Campus Review  contribution, a federated university can succeed only with the right kind of leadership at its centre.
I now turn to some of the university policy issues arising out of the recent research green paper released by the federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. This is a topical document, despite its delay by Dr Kemp. Nonetheless, a research green paper is of the utmost importance to Australia's universities and the progression of this material into a satisfactory white paper is all important. Much work needs to be done to turn this green paper into something more acceptable, as it might translate into government policy in a white paper.
I have concerns about the four key flaws in the research green paper. The first of those is on the issue of portability. The key demand of the new economy is for government to fund smart people, to provide research funding directly to the best and brightest in its nation and to allow the funding to be portable. Funding of institutions is likely to be a handbrake on innovation and technological upgrading. Better results can be achieved by funding individuals rather than institutions. Institutions, through their vested interests, their turf wars and their institutional conservatism, get in the way of best practice innovation and technological upgrading. This is the golden rule of the new economy in public policy. I would like to stamp it on the fore 
 head of every single member in this place and every single bureaucrat in Canberra. Pick national research priorities and people. Do not pick technologies, companies or industry winners. That is the golden rule. Public funding needs to be poured into national research priorities and the best and brightest of our Australian researchers. We should not be diverting any of those funds into the flawed government process of trying to pick technologies, industry winners and corporations out for favourable publicly funded treatment.
The green paper recommends portable research scholarships but, tragically, it proposes a scheme which is not portable at all. It talks about portability but delivers a situation which may be worse than the current circumstances in the Australian university research sector. It proposes a scheme whereby the scholarships are awarded by the institutions themselves. Surprise, surprise, if the institutions choose to pick those people most likely to stay within their research system. The portability only comes into effect after 12 months of study at the awarding institution. So again there is a massive disincentive for portability. If after 12 months of study students decide they want to move somewhere else, they have to go to the trouble of physical relocation and establishing new supervisors for their studies. Under this proposal they have to start their studies again with no additional resources to do so. The disincentive for portability after 12 months is high. Of course, we also know that in Australia's tight research networks—what some have described as the `research club' in Australia's universities—they can be pretty hard on dissenters in any shape or form.
I have the reservation that the portability in this scheme is worse than the current circumstances. The government has fallen into the trap of funding institutions rather than individuals. It is funding the institutions to give out the scholarships. The institutions will favour those most likely to stay within their research system, and only after 12 months does the portability kick in. Even if the students move on to a different institution, they have to start all their studies again 
 without any additional public money. In practical terms, we will not get any portability from this flawed scheme.
Just as the new economy and the research agenda are demanding portable research scholarships, the government delivers a feet-in-cement scheme where you can barely move at all. It is absolutely hopeless. What we need is a massive improvement in the white paper. We need a national standard for honours degrees throughout the country, we need an independent awarding body and we need genuine portability for the best and brightest of our undergraduates. We need a major national effort to make sure that Australia's best and smartest undergraduates are kept here through an effective portable research scholarship scheme.
The second flaw concerns resources. What is it about education policy statements from this government? Why are they not allowed to talk about resources? In every single country around the world the great burning education policy issue is that of funding. How do you pour more national effort and more national resources into the education sector? We have the absurd situation, the atrocious situation, in this country where every time there is a major education policy report no mention is made of the most important issue.
Earlier the member for Petrie mentioned West. As the member for Batman pointed out, he has gone west. His report made no mention of resources, it made no recommendation for an improved funding effort for Australia's universities and, if that was not bad enough, it was just taken by this government and put on the shelf. It was put on the shelf to gather dust. West has made no greater contribution to university policy in this country than he made to disadvantaged schooling during his time as a schoolteacher. It was bad enough that the West report had nothing to say about resourcing—obviously on the orders of Minister Kemp—but now we have a green paper that does not mention resourcing.
Why is it that education policy documents are not allowed to mention the funding question when other aspects of this government's effort mention funding? There is talk about greater funding in all areas bar 
 education. Look at the Ralph review released yesterday. It was told to be revenue neutral, but the Treasurer is willing to cop a funding hole of $3.8 billion. It did not even stick to its riding instructions of revenue neutrality. Look at the foreshadowed defence white paper. The minister was in here yesterday on the Timor debate saying that there will be a bucket load of money for defence to pay the terrible cost of bad foreign policy from this government. So other reports—Ralph and defence—are allowed to have strong recommendations about greater public funding but, in the most vital sector of all, education and research, public funding and resourcing are not mentioned at all.
My third concern is about the research funding formula in the green paper. The bias is very firmly against any national growth in scholarships and it is against regional newer universities. The Vice-Chancellor of Deakin University, the much respected Geoff Wilson, has pointed out—and I quote:
It's amazing, given those particular objectives—
that is, in the green paper—
that they then reduce the number of research higher degree places in Australia from 25,000 to 21,500.
That was reported in the Australian  of 8 September. There was Geoff Wilson saying that, by his calculation from the green paper, the number of publicly funded research higher degree places in Australia is going to come down. It should be going massively up. But under this government it will go from 25,000 to 21,500. His own institution, Deakin University, has pointed out they will lose $1.5 million in the first year of implementation and the figure could rise to $3 million by the third year. Jan Reid of the University of Western Sydney—I hope she has got this right—mentioned a funding cut in Western Sydney of $2.3 million on the research agenda.
—She should read the Hansard.
—She may be sent a copy of the Hansard  to brush up on some of the public policy matters that get debated around this place, some of the public accountability that comes to weigh on university administrators. 
—You seem to have a lot of confidence in her.
—You wouldn't know. You didn't get past kindergarten, so what are you going on about? The fourth problem that I have with the research green paper is its failed attempt to reconcile the research policy tension between pure and applied research. This is a real difficulty in the document. It starts out pretty boldly by talking about how, in the new economy, `some of the locations of research activity are changing and knowledge generation is increasingly crossing the traditional boundaries between institutions and sectors'. It talks about the way in which:
. . . the primacy of the universities in basic research is being strongly challenged in a variety of fields such as the computer sciences, many applied sciences and engineering where the emphasis is on application of research. There is an increasing role for applications driven approaches in many spheres of research, and a growing share of the national research effort is occurring in commercial settings. These trends are particularly pronounced in the fields of science and technology research but are by no means confined to them. Similar trends can be observed in a wide range of social sciences and humanities.
There is a bold and promising statement at the beginning of the document about the tension between pure and applied research, but then in the policy recommendations there is no reconciliation of this tension at all. I am afraid the green paper has just gone down the standard Dr Kemp pathway of imposing more commercialisation on the education sector. The document talks about bringing users of research into the peer review process. That is just part of Dr Kemp's code for letting business direct research. It is a very crude approach—the sort of crude approach that he has brought to bear on Australia's training agenda.
The recommendations in the green paper unfortunately perpetuate the artificial binary between pure and applied research. It should not be just a question of whether we are funding pure research or applied research. There is in fact a third approach which synthesises the two. While I will not have much time to read out the findings of this particular document, I refer the parliament to a book that has been largely overlooked in Australia 
 called Pasteur's Quadrant: Basic Science and Technical Innovation by the late American academic Donald Stokes. It is an outstanding read and an outstanding lesson in how it is possible to synthesise pure research and applied research and develop quite cleverly what he defines as a `use-inspired basic research approach'. Because time is running out for my contribution, I cannot go through all the detail. But those members who read books—books other than my own—might want to turn to Donald Stokes' Pasteur's Quadrant and learn a great deal about these important public policy issues. Most importantly, those working on the research white paper need to read that book and certainly improve the sort of document they produce. There is a long way to go to turn this green paper into something acceptable.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—In the debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  I would like to focus on the aspect concerning James Cook University in Townsville and in particular the new medical school. The medical school is the first new medical school in 25 years in this country. Its funding is dealt with in the bill before the parliament at the moment.
—Was it because of your representations?
—That is for others to say, Mr Parliamentary Secretary. This is a project that has had a very long history that goes back to 1983 when the then Labor Party leader Bob Hawke promised to establish a James Cook University based North Queensland medical school. History records that that particular promise was never delivered by the Labor government. Indeed, in the lead-up to the 1996 federal election the then Keating Labor government had the hide to resurrect the promise of a James Cook University Medical School as an election promise. I think, if my memory serves me right, that at that time they said it would be implemented within 12 months. That was just not technically possible. The academics—the people in the industry—knew and understood that it was not technically possible to do it in that short time frame.
When I became the member for Herbert, I began working with the local community, with James Cook University and the local medical profession, as well as with my parliamentary colleagues Senator Ian Macdonald, the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, and the members for Kennedy and Dawson, to get a medical school proposal back on track. It was a real team effort, and I must acknowledge the efforts even of the former Labor senator Margaret Reynolds, who for a long time pushed the north's cause for a medical school, although she was not successful within her own party. It has taken a long time, but Townsville and James Cook University have finally secured a medical school, with this bill forming one of the last pieces of the jigsaw that will turn this project from a proposal into a reality.
The project means a lot, as you could understand, not just for Townsville but for the wider North Queensland and northern Australian region. Queensland is one of the most decentralised states anywhere in the world. While this may not seem much to those who live in the south-east corner of the state—or in the capital cities of Australia—for those who live outside that corner the effects of that extreme decentralisation are certainly very considerable. North Queensland, as I have long told this House, makes up about 45 per cent of the state's total area and about 17 per cent of the population. But it is home to only about nine per cent of Queensland's registered medical practitioners. Indeed, of Queensland's 1,100 or so specialist medical practitioners, about 840 live and practise medicine in and around Brisbane.
The consequences of this state of affairs are simple and stark. People in rural and regional Queensland are being denied ready and equitable access to medical services. The nearest medical school to Townsville is in Brisbane, some 1,400 kilometres to the south. With the establishment of the medical school in North Queensland, for the first time students will be able to be taught and trained in regional centres like Townsville, Cairns, Mount Isa and Mackay instead of having to move south to Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne. I believe this will be central in the 
 long term to encouraging more doctors to live and to practise medicine in regional North Queensland.
James Cook's Professor Ian Wronski, the Dean of Health, Life and Molecular Sciences, has in the past equated the establishment of the medical school as rating alongside the formation of the National Health and Medical Research Council in terms of importance to health in Australia. That is a sentiment that I agree with wholeheartedly. I have said it once and I will say it again: I cannot think of another decision that will have a more lasting and positive impact on the long-term health and physical welfare of rural and regional Queenslanders than this decision to establish a medical school at James Cook University.
I note that in the second reading speech a few months ago the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs stated that the additional funding to James Cook provided in this bill keeps faith with the coalition's election commitment for 60 medical places at James Cook, with the first intake of students expected at the start of the 2001 academic year, following accreditation from the Australian Medical Council. The starting time of 2001 was cited because the department was under the impression that the accreditation from the AMC would not be forthcoming in time for a year 2000 start-up. The timetable that both I and James Cook have always pushed was for the first student intake to happen at the beginning of the year 2000—next year.
I am very proud to have this particular letter in my possession, which is from Dr David Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. It is addressed to Professor Bernard Moulden, Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University. It reads:
Dear Professor Moulden
I am writing to you to confirm financing for the James Cook University Medical School. The Commonwealth will, when the school receives Australian Medical Council accreditation, expected for the 2000 academic year, be financing a six-year course with an annual intake of 60 students. Funding will be $20,000 per student—
that is at 1999 prices—
with an assumed retention rate of 100 per cent. 

The source of the finance will be a combination of already legislated operating grants funds and money being legislated in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999, which is currently before the parliament.
This is the bill we are discussing today. The letter continues:
The Government wishes James Cook University well with this initiative and looks forward to the benefits it will bring to medical care in Northern Australia.
This is a historic document. This is the funding for the James Cook Medical School to start at the beginning of next year.
It has been a truly awesome effort to get the school up and running. In relation to the accreditation from the AMC, the politics of medicine are more political than the politics of politics. The accreditation council met and decided that James Cook's application was the best they had seen for a number of years and they made the recommendation to the AMC executive. When it came to be considered by the AMC executive, which was scheduled last month, what happened? The politics of medicine got in the way and the AMC executive's decision was not to consider the accreditation council's recommendation. Can you believe that that is how that would go? But we have got around that. We will see the accreditation proceed now, I believe on 18 October. It certainly will happen. The government was resolute in its decision that we would have a new medical school at James Cook and we are going to have that.
In confirming the funding, the minister was strongly supportive of James Cook's position in Townsville. I would particularly like to place on record my sincere thanks to Minister Kemp for the positive way in which both he and his staff dealt with this matter, and also, of course, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge, for the way in which he and his staff have dealt with this matter. This means that the only piece that is now missing from this jigsaw puzzle is the formal accreditation and, as I said, that is expected in the middle of next month. I would certainly like to see that accreditation come through sooner rather than later.
There are some other points to consider today. I was interested to note in the amend 
 ment to the second reading of this bill moved by the member for Bonython the reference to the government failing the higher education system in relation to export opportunities. Let me respond to the member for Bonython in the same terms that I recently used to respond to a student journalist at James Cook in relation to issues associated with the recent research green paper: do not underestimate the importance of the proposed new James Cook University medical school not only to Townsville and North Queensland but also to other countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. At the state and national level, the new medical school will play a central role in helping attract future research dollars to regional North Queensland. The University of Queensland in 1999, for example, received more than $12 million in federal funds through the NHMRC to fund some 150 medical research projects. Following the establishment of the JCU Medical School, I expect to see in a gradual way more and more research grants coming north to Townsville.
But more than that, getting back to the question of education exports that the member for Bonython raised, the new medical school will also firmly establish James Cook University as the leading research centre in South-East Asia in the areas of rural, regional and tropical health. This is very important indeed. Other countries will look to James Cook in Townsville in the years to come for the expertise we now have and will continue to develop well into the future. James Cook University Medical School will put Townsville not only on the national map but also on the international map. I therefore reject the amendment moved by the member for Bonython.
There are some other big issues in Australia in higher education today. I refer to the production of intellectual property and capital. There are a number of countries which have shown that they are able to speed their development remarkably when they develop intellectual capital. This government certainly recognises that. We also recognise that globalisation creates challenges, and higher education needs to be able to grow in this area with certainty and stability. As tertiary 
 education becomes more and more universal, as high school education did earlier in this century, we have got to find ways of funding it and generating best outcomes for society and intellectual excellence. For regional universities such as James Cook, there is now a real opportunity to develop as part of regional economic clusters. I point out to the House the example of what happened in Nevada. They saw a field of expertise in telephony. Nevada, which is basically a semi-desert state in the United States, grasped this opportunity with both hands and has not looked back. These huge opportunities for regions were not there prior to globalisation.
In Australia, I would suggest that, when you look at the resources in the regions, Townsville and perhaps Newcastle have the most potential in this regard. Regional universities need to work out what their role should be. James Cook is in the box seat to take advantage of the opportunities to build around economic clusters in its operations. The breadth of diversity in Townsville, with industry, commerce, communications, defence, education and so on, bodes well for James Cook to be able to link in with these economic clusters. It has been my privilege to be associated with the establishment of the James Cook University Medical School, and I look forward to it opening next year with its first 60 students. I wish the school well, and I certainly commend this bill, which funds the university medical school, to the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—`Australia needs a skilled and educated population to meet the challenges and opportunities arising from new technology, changes in the domestic economy and globalisation.' That statement was made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the member for Goldstein, in the opening remarks of his second reading speech on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 . That was a reasonable, admirable opening statement, you might say, from the minister. But little else of consequence followed from the minister, as we have come to expect. In just over 20 minutes the minister presented the second reading of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 and then 
 proceeded to present the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999, followed by the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999, followed by the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1999.
In just over 20 minutes the minister presented what was considered to be important by the government on every aspect of education in this nation. Sadly, it did not amount to very much. Sadly, this government does not want this debate on higher education to continue much longer as I understand further debate will be gagged later this evening. It says a lot about this government and its attitude towards education at all levels. But those of us on this side of the House should not be surprised about a coalition whose leader, in a previous life, refused a shadow education portfolio and has little to say about the current and future status of education.
The rhetoric of this government simply does not match its actions. Take, for example, the minister's penultimate paragraph in his second reading speech:
The measures in this bill continue the government's objectives of fostering a quality higher education sector that is open, accessible and responsive to Australia's future needs.
As with the minister's introduction, this concluding statement is also potentially admirable. But he destroyed himself, just two paragraphs earlier, when he correctly told the parliament that the merit based equity scholarship scheme would be phased out from the year 2000. Merit and equity—such foreign words to the minister and to the government.
How could anyone reconcile the minister's opening and concluding statements with the phasing out of the merit based equity scholarship scheme or perhaps with the axing of the innovation program or with the government's failure to provide more research funding? Oh dear, innovation and research—such foreign words to the minister and the government.
The minister continues, on almost all occasions when references are made to funding and resourcing education, to state in Orwellian terms that more is more when really his exposition is that more is actually 
 less. Let me give some examples as they apply to higher education. I make no apology whatsoever that the real question facing education, including higher education, is a resources question, something that this government does not want to face and refuses to acknowledge.
The Commonwealth resources—known as the base operating grant available to higher education institutions per planned and actual equivalent full-time student units—tell a very interesting story indeed. In 1983 the base operating grant was worth $3,196.3 million. This applied to 260,000 planned full-time students and 255,100 actual full-time students. However, the key figure to observe is not the total base operating grant or the numbers of planned or actual full-time students; it is the per capita rate then and now. That rate has fallen dramatically, confirming the minister's `more means less' rhetoric.
In 1983 the planned per capita rate for a full-time university student was $12,294. The actual per capita rate was marginally higher at $12,530. In 1999 the base operating grant for higher education institutions is $4,662.9 million. The planned per capita rate, based on 413,000 students, is $11,292. That is 8.1 per cent less than in 1983 but 0.9 per cent more than in 1996, which appears to give the minister and the government some credit—not much but some at least.
However, with further examination—and you always need further examination with this government and this minister—a far more accurate picture emerges. By contrast to what I said in the previous paragraph, the actual number of students for 1999 is 463,500, some 50,500 more students than planned. This makes the actual per capita rate $10,060, a massive negative change of almost 20 per cent from 1983 but, as far as the government's rhetoric is concerned, 5.4 per cent less than in 1996. So in fact more is not more, less is actually less.
No-one should be surprised by this blatant dishonesty by the government or by the blatant misrepresentation of statistics by this minister; he is very good at it. Take, for example, the Commonwealth investment in education since 1994-95. Expenditure has 
 fallen from about 2.06 per cent of gross domestic product to less than 1.8 per cent in 1999-2000. But it is worse than that. Projected Commonwealth investment in education is expected to fall to just above 1.6 per cent of GDP in the years 2001 and 2002. If people think that is bad, the future will be worse. That is just a disgrace but it reflects accurately the lack of thought, energy and commitment of this minister and of this government when it comes to investment in the current and future human capital of this nation.
But the story of education and this minister gets worse. Take, for example, the Commonwealth investment in research and innovation. In the financial year 1993-94, the percentage of GDP of Commonwealth investment in research and innovation, excluding indirect university funding, was just less than 0.55 per cent. In this financial year, the percentage has fallen dramatically to 0.44 per cent, a massive drop in funding measured against GDP of 20 per cent. So we have a 20 per cent fall again.
Again, to repeat a familiar pattern by this government and this minister, the projected future Commonwealth investment in research and innovation is expected to fall in the financial years 2000-01 and 2001-02. It is bad now, worse later. One last examination of Commonwealth investment in education training and research continues the sorry saga of this minister's and this government's negligence in all aspects of education. Other productive nations in the world have based their spurts of economic growth on massive investment in education up to a generation earlier.
This government enjoys a false dawn in economic growth due to the efforts of governments of both persuasions over the last 30 years. How else could you explain the very considerable reduction in investment by the Commonwealth in education, training and research? It is just madness, as far as the future of this nation is concerned, to report to the  House that the Commonwealth investment in education, training and research has fallen, as a percentage of GDP, from three per cent, when this government took office, to less than the projected 2.4 per cent of GDP in 
 2001-02. That is the real story of higher education in this country.
—Dopey policy.
—Exactly. That is a massive drop in investment of 20 per cent in the nation's future—its own people. When I point these facts out to people interested in education often a first reaction is, `No, no, this is not true. Surely the arguments and supporting statements that you make are exaggerated. Surely you are exploiting political rhetoric. Surely the investment in education is not that bad.' But then I sit down with them and I show them the real figures from the government's own graphs. I show them the tables and they look at me in disbelief. Surely no respected national government could do what they are doing, reducing investment by up to 20 per cent across the board in education. This is real negligence.
This is a government without a future plan for its people, particularly its younger people—our future. This is a government oblivious of proper processes in education. This is a government determined to fudge and to distort almost all information on education at not only a higher education level but all levels of education. The minister and the government could be described by some commentators as only being outcome driven. However, the reality for this government is that because real purpose and process have gone missing or, more accurately, have not been recognised by this government, its education outcomes are nothing more than a very simple, motley collection of unconnected issues.
For this government, outcomes are not the result of belief and process with appropriate analysis. For this government outcomes are a confused set of issues that bear little relation to each other. Synthesised outcomes are no recipe for improvements in education in Australia. This government has a problem with all aspects of education, not only higher education. Informed people in education in Australia know this to be true. Informed people overseas, including our expatriates, also know, to their embarrassment, that Australia is increasingly less regarded as far as education is concerned. Consecutive 
 Clayton's budgets on education will not alter those views.
In fact, what must be worrying to all members of this House is the continuing brain drain of talented Australians overseas. Many ideas people, including those in education, have—to this nation's loss—simply got up and run. They have got the message from the government, from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and this minister that they are largely to be ignored, that they are superfluous to requirements. If they did not get that message in the 1996 budget, the 1997 budget and the 1998 budget, they have certainly got it now.
People with process skills in education are simply demoralised in this country. These people, unrecognised and unacknowledged by this government, who have connected ideas, process and outcomes have, over a period of time, had their lights punched out. Even those in education for whom ideas and process mean little—like the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is at the table—and outcome everything have been divided into winners and losers. The minister made a bit of a losing statement this afternoon that will haunt him forever in his career.
Divide, isolate and crush are not unknown in politics, but in education, at any level, it is destructive and against the future of our nation in a world that is increasingly unsympathetic and highly competitive and ruthless.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—You protest too much, sir. It is a great sadness to me that, for many members on the government side and their advisers, education is nothing more complicated than but a mere reflection of their own inadequate personal experiences in education, in various disciplines of learning but none whatsoever in education. There is certainly no real encouragement to the backbench, other than those genuinely committed, to get out there and score a few goals for education. The minister's legacy to education, after his stewardship, will be stonewalling, misinformation and confused statistics, but nothing much else.
As I said at the outset of this speech, this minister, in just over 20 minutes, managed to present a plan for all aspects of education—in other words, 20 minutes of very little value represented the total future planning of the minister and the government on every aspect of education for the next year. Like the minister's contribution to coherent education planning for our nation's future, this Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill does not amount to very much. But then, sadly, who would be surprised at that!
In conclusion, I would like to make a comparison between  Labor and the coalition in government. In Labor's last five years, the percentage of the nation's wealth invested in education, research and training rose from 2.35 per cent of GDP to 2.99 per cent.
—Smart.
—Exactly. In the coalition's first four budgets, they have reduced that investment back to 2.53 per cent in 1999-2000 and they are heading towards less than 2.4 per cent in 2001-02. By the financial year 2001-02, the coalition will have undone all of Labor's good work and will have taken us back 10 years to 1990-91 when investment in education, research and training was 2.36 per cent of GDP.
Only when the coalition begins to take on and deliver the broad Labor example of three per cent of GDP—because that is the message, that is the target: the bottom line for you guys is three per cent of GDP on investment in education, training and research—will we take you seriously. Forget the rhetoric of this government. Forget all of those people on that side of the House who get up and talk about education. Get hold of the bottom line, Minister. Get hold of per capita rates, Minister. Get hold of some honesty, Minister. Get hold of percentage of GDP, because that is the only measure that counts.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,1999-09-22,"—It gives me great pleasure to speak to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 . I warmly welcome the net increase of $183.8 million to 1999 university funding provided in this legislation. I also welcome the boost that this legislation will give to science education by funding new science lecture 
 ships. The increase in funding of research infrastructure by $36.8 million in each of the 2000 and 2001 years comes not a moment too soon.
I heartily welcome these increases in university funding and I also welcome this opportunity to further consider the huge challenges still facing universities. These challenges are largely due to the legacy of attrition and an apparent disinterest in the pursuit of academic excellence which characterised much of the Labor years of the 1980s and 1990s. Until recently, our government has been unable to do little to remedy the situation, initially working and concentrating our efforts on putting Australia's economic house in order.
 Now under the auspices of a robust economy we can turn our minds to our vision for Australia in the 21st century. The 21st century will be a new frontier in time and space where only the clever countries of the world will prevail. The best guarantee we have to ensure that Australia will be one of those clever countries is to invest in our intellectual capital. Sir Robert Menzies knew this 50 years ago. We now have a great opportunity, those of us who would dare to walk in the footsteps of Sir Robert, to seize the day and invest, as he did, to a meaningful degree in the intellectual capital of Australia. We need a Menzies style renaissance to purposely recharge our centres of academic excellence in our universities across the nation.
The broadening of tertiary education in recent years has become a welcome development, but I fear that the broadening has not often been accompanied by deepening. Put bluntly, our international cutting edge institutions have paid a heavy price as funds have been diverted elsewhere. This is not a situation which any leading developed country can tolerate for long without paying a huge price. It is a price in lost international competitiveness, a price in losing our brightest and best and a price in the form of dreaded mediocrity.
I cannot help wonder what form the new support for infrastructure will take. In an institution as complex as a modern day university, there is a vast spectrum of infrastructure which is essential if our academics 
 are to be free to excel at the research and teaching for which they have rigorously trained. I understand that our great university libraries have been sorrowfully cutting subscriptions to respected international journals because their purchasing power has been hit by a weaker Australian dollar and low university operating grants. There are decaying university buildings, not least those built in sandstone. There is expensive scientific equipment, which simply has to be cutting edge if Australia is to flourish. Perhaps most importantly, there is the essential technical and support staff, whose dedication and expertise is essential if our academics are to be free to research, create, write and teach. These too have been severely cut back in recent years. I understand that this has had serious effects on the morale of our already overworked academics.
I applaud our minister's support of investment in infrastructure. It is an excellent initiative which should help reverse decades of neglect. We need to know that coming funds will be sufficient to do all these jobs and more and properly to international best practice. It seems that we have a long way to go to reach the infrastructure standards of quality overseas universities. It would indeed be wonderful if the government could restore the acquisitions purchasing power to our leading university libraries. We need to ensure that operating grants are also sufficient.
If our principal universities are allowed to stagnate for want of funds, Australia will also stagnate. Stagnate our universities will if they cannot attract to their staff the best creative intellects, the best critical thinkers and the best inventive minds who will advance the frontiers of our knowledge and perspectives into the new millennium.
It seems to me that the real problem—the most fundamental one of all—is funding. I informed this House in June that what Australia needs now is a Menzies-sized injection of funds into our leading universities. With great respect I repeat the plea. The United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden are increasing research investment in their universities to a significant degree. South Korea, New Zealand and China have all committed 
 to the serious funding of selected lead site universities so that they will at least have a few institutions of international standing. Australia cannot afford to be left behind.
I have read that in 1998 the United Kingdom government announced a further $A2,600 million over the next three years for research infrastructure. The Wellcome Trust pledged a further £400 million. Singapore announced plans for a $5 billion science hub for science companies. However, we can see that Japan has lost out to the United States in technology based industry because it failed to invest in basic science.
Recently, the University of Sydney announced a 15 per cent salary increase for its staff in three increments. It made this decision in times of serious financial stringency because it had no other option. It was by all accounts a difficult decision, but at the end of the day it could do no other. A university has no greater asset than its staff. Its first priority, therefore, must be to ensure that it attracts and retains the very best.
Yet if the government does not fund reasonable academic salary increases, as it did in the Menzies era, the universities will have to shed even more vital staff and bleed catastrophically in other areas. Let me put this into context. I understand that Sydney professors earn about $94,000 per annum. The Wellcome Trust, the United Kingdom's largest medical charity, which has disbursements comparable to those of the United Kingdom Medical Research Council, has recently awarded its scientists a 30 per cent increase in salary. It did so in order to prevent a loss of expertise to the United States, where salaries are very much higher.
According to the Financial Times in London, this will mean that some medical scientists will earn more than £100,000, which is approximately $A250,000. Yet when you consider that medical science has been principally responsible for the staggering increase in life expectancy this century, can there be any serious objection to paying its leaders about the same as a state supreme court judge?
It is also very welcome news that our government is to spend $25 million over the 
 next two years to fund science lectureships. Minister Kemp must be warmly congratulated on this innovation. My hope is that the government will also ensure that these additional lectureships, as well as those posts already existing at both junior and senior levels, are associated with salaries properly commensurate with the serious expertise of the individuals we expect to fill the positions.
There is much ground to be made up. The number of lecturing staff at Sydney University's renowned chemistry school has dropped from 43 to 28 in the last decade. Furthermore, it is crucial that our leading edge research institutions maintain a critical mass of scientists and that expertise is not distributed too thinly on the ground. I am glad indeed that Minister Kemp emphasised this in his forward to the higher education green paper entitled `New knowledge, new opportunities'. If you ask why institutions such as Britain's Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge have managed to win eight or perhaps now even more Nobel prizes since it was founded after World War II, you will find that the answer lies largely in part in its ability to attract and keep that critical mass of the very best scientists.
The same philosophy underpinned the foundation of the Australian National University as told in a wonderful book written to celebrate its jubilee by Foster and Varghese entitled The making of the ANU. It is a matter of some concern to me that university publication data may no longer be considered in assessing university grants. Publications in the international peer review press and their citations in international journals are the standard criteria by which academics are assessed. Of course, there is the potential, as with all criteria, for some data to be misleading. After all, one should never confuse quantity with quality, especially at the individual level. Still, for all their faults, publication data taken over time are generally considered to be one of the most reliable measures of output data in assessing research excellence.
Sir Robert Menzies' legacy to high quality tertiary education is with us everywhere, not 
 just in Australia but internationally as well. In a delightful inversion which he would have loved, it must be said that the influence of scientists trained in Australia in the 1950s is now particularly evident in Britain. To name just a few, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Sir Alec Broers, is a physics graduate from the University of Melbourne; the recently retired Director of the Wellcome Institute in Britain, Dame Bridget Ogilvie, is a science graduate of our University of New England; and Sir Robert May, who is the Chief Scientific Adviser to the British government, is a theoretical physics graduate and a former professor of physics from the University of Sydney. The rigour and depth of their Australian education in the 1950s has stood them and the world in good stead. It is an expensive rigour which Australia risks losing at its peril.
The higher education green paper is rightly encouraging of universities to collaborate with industry and to engage its financial support. It would, incidentally, be an excellent thing if the international pharmaceutical giants, who base much of their research in other countries, were to establish major research centres here in Australia in a much more meaningful way than they have done to date. The green paper further ties government funding to the extent of other such external support.
But let us not forget that it is not just governments who would seek to add dollar value to areas that already demonstrate excellence and existing support. Private industry too knows what dollar for dollar support is in a converse sort of way. Put another way, private industry will want to support enterprises that others, including the government, have considered worthy of support and usually which have a demonstrated track record to build upon. Corporate donors will want to know for certain that university staff have the flair and potential to take things further. Private industry is not likely to want to move onboard too many apparently sinking ships or to provide money so that the government can bail out with no net benefit to universities.
There is another very important angle to this: basic science is an utterly crucial but long-term and sometimes risky activity. 
 Inherently, it may be less attractive to Australian industry than will be applied science and correspondingly more dependent upon government. Unless we increase the total funding base, the transfer of university funds to departments that have the highest success in attracting corporate funding could be at the expense of basic science and the humanities, to our long-term economic detriment. I respectfully ask our minister to keep a firm watching brief on this to ensure that benefits from external support flow also to those high quality departments that are not in a position to attract external funding.
The point is that in order to attract private, and particularly private international, money, the government itself must invest not less but more—much more. Excellence begets excellence and money begets money. In this context I point particularly to the United States, whose major companies are endowing the already well-endowed universities of Oxford and Cambridge in particular. Oxford has its Kellogg Business College, thanks to the cornflakes manufacturer, which also sells the odd flake or two here in Australia. Microsoft has given unprecedented sums to computer research in Cambridge because that is where Professor Needham and other similar brilliant minds work. Dr Gordon Moore, Chairman Emeritus of Intel, has given another £7.5 million, which is $A18 million, for a Cambridge science library, because that is where Professor Stephen Hawking works and also because `the University of Cambridge has a long history of doing leading research into some of the most fundamental questions that mankind can ask'. If we wish to entice American money to cross the Pacific instead of the Atlantic, we need to show the Americans that our universities have a great track record and that we employ well-paid, high-flying and well-credentialled staff.
Even though I have concentrated on science, I rank the core humanities no less highly. It is science which provides us with the technical wherewithal to enjoy life and the health with which to live it, but it is through the humanities that we all try to understand what it is to be human. Let us not forget, as we approach the millennium, that we are the 
 inheritors of 2,000 years and more of the Western Judaeo-Christian tradition, a tradition which links us inextricably with the ancient civilisations of Greece, Rome and Mesopotamia via the complexities of history and discovery. To adapt Sir Isaac Newton's words, if we in Australia see further, it is only because we stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before. It is the universities which, more than any other institution, are the guardians and conservers of these sacred traditions of history, of philosophy, of mathematics, of literature and of language.
Sir Robert Menzies once said, `If a university failed to produce a single doctor, lawyer or engineer its place in a civilised community, with a sense of real values, would be secure.' It seems to me that those who teach and advance the frontiers of these humanities in our universities are principally responsible for their conservation and transmission in Australia and the dissemination of this understanding within the community and to those who teach our children. Yet major university history departments, like chemistry departments, have borne the brunt of the decade's cuts. At Sydney University, the number of history lecturers has also fallen by about half over the last decade.
Earlier this month, the Australian government enjoyed the honour of hosting the visit to Australia of the President of South Korea, Kim Dae Jung. President Kim is a most remarkable man. He has spent years in prison and has borne many attacks on his life because of the kinds of values which we in Australia hold dear and because of his support for democracy and for human freedom. I hope I may be permitted to mention that my alma mater, Sydney University, had the prescience to honour him in 1996 with an honorary doctorate of law while he was still fighting his battles from opposition. But now he is President, and we rejoice that he is in a position to promote these values even more effectively.
I speak of President Kim in the context of higher education funding because there can be no greater advocate of the need for basic research in universities than President Kim. He emphasised this support for basic science 
 when he addressed the United Kingdom Confederation of Business and Industry at the time of the ASEM conference in London last year. Furthermore, the South Korean government has now pledged to increase spending on research and development by 28 per cent by 2002. All this is in the context of a program of financial liberalisation, which is effectively helping South Korea recover from the depths of the Asian economic recession which marred his taking of office. It is an illustration of how research, democracy and financial deregulation can go hand in hand with financial recovery.
This month also provides an interesting conjunction in time and destiny for Australia. Earlier this month, there was a celebration in Parliament House in Sydney to mark the 150th anniversary of the speech that our great colonial statesman W.C. Wentworth gave on 6 September 1849 to promote the building of a university in Sydney to rank with the best in Britain. The public was sceptical and critical of the expenditure, but he went ahead anyway—and what a wonderful result for our national posterity. It is a delight to realise that President Kim and W.C. Wentworth are each celebrated in Australia this month as protagonists of both democracy and tertiary education.
In the year 2000 time and destiny again collide. October 1 will be the final day of the Sydney Olympic Games and the eyes of the world will be on Australia and its closing ceremony. Yet exactly 150 years ago, on 1 October 1850, an act of parliament was passed by Australia's oldest legislature to establish Australia's oldest university and so fulfilled the dream of William Wentworth. If we want our young scholars to attain first-rank world status like our young sports stars, the quality of our infrastructure investment for our universities must equal the solid, quality infrastructure that is in place for the Sydney Olympics.
Finally, I do encourage our government in its new commitment to research in universities. Our young people have a right to aspire to the highest levels of academic attainment and recognition. Young Australia has a birthright to be taught to world-class stand 
 ards, as their predecessors were. We are moving upwards from what was a very low 1996 baseline, and again I beat the drum: any proposed redistribution of funds cannot be substituted for a desperately needed and dramatic increase in their magnitude.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  reflects the Howard government's approach to higher education and the value it places on it. It is about cutting funds to universities, undermining their operations, and reducing the access of ordinary, non-paying Australian students to those institutions.
This is the fourth year that the Howard government has cut operational funding to universities, and universities are hurting. Australian universities have been forced to make do with fewer funds whilst other developed countries are spending more on education and universities. Our nation recognises that research is essential for economic development. Australian people know that we must have money going into universities and money being put aside for research if we are to go ahead. We in the ALP certainly know that, but unfortunately members on the other side of the House do not recognise that, and the government's policies and legislation do not reflect it.
This government constantly cuts funds for research and development, and this is resulting in universities becoming training schools for students. Instead of needing to go to university to access information, they can pluck it from the Internet, missing out on the valuable interchange of ideas that takes place in universities. Teaching staff are employed not for their ability to teach or for their ability to give students information but rather on their entrepreneurial skills. That is the vision this government has for universities and those who teach in universities.
The reduction in funding for research will have an effect on innovation and the independence of universities and it will mean that Australia will be left behind—at a time when it is so important for a country to be a knowledge based society. We are part of a world economy and we are part of a world where we have got to compete with other countries. 
 We are not competing with each other; we are competing with the rest of the world. And if the government does not make an investment in education, then we will be left behind.
Australia's future lies in knowledge, in education and in a work force that is educated and highly skilled. Unfortunately, this government is not prepared to make a commitment to see that Australia achieves this. It is constantly cutting funds for education and research, and this will not deliver the work force or the society that we need to meet the new millennium. We live in a changing society where skills, expertise and careers can disappear overnight. You only have to look at BHP. Back in the early 1980s they employed a work force of 12,500. If you worked hard, you could be assured of a job for life. But on 30 September, BHP will no longer exist in Newcastle.
We need a society that is able to go ahead with change, and it means a totally different approach to education. It means a whole of life approach to education, where we are constantly developing new skills and where we are able to access education and knowledge. We need strong, properly funded universities, not universities that are reacting to change, putting money in and developing courses at whim.
The minister says that this bill enhances the collaboration between universities and industry. What that really means is that he is transferring the funding of universities to industry. This will reduce the independence of universities, and it will reduce our ability to go out to the cutting edge and come up with new ideas, new technologies and new discoveries to put Australia at the forefront of the world. It will lead to a decrease in innovation, and that means Australia will be left behind.
The Howard government promised Australians an education budget, but it has given us a 1950s budget. It is not a 1950s Menzies-style budget, as the member for Hughes was talking about, because Mr Menzies had a commitment to the development and fulfilment of individual human potential. Rather, it is a 1950s-style budget that is elitist in its approach to education—not based on a 
 person's ability to achieve but rather on their ability to pay. It is a vendetta against ordinary Australian students, and that can be seen in a number of ways.
The government has made changes to the youth allowance, which has made it more difficult for ordinary Australian students to go to universities. What are these changes all about? They are not about making it easier for students to go to university; they are about cost cutting. The independent age for Austudy has been increased from 22 to 25 and the means test has been tightened—every change that has been introduced has been about cuts. These changes are about reducing this government's obligation to Australian students and to universities. The result is that those students who have money have access to universities while those students who do not have money are being deprived of the opportunity to attend universities.
Australian students are the future of our nation. Those students will be able to access university education only if this government makes it available to them. The abolition of the merit based equity scholarship scheme was another attack by this government on those needy students who have got the ability. Getting an education should not be about having the money; it should be about having the ability. This government is making it harder and harder for ordinary Australians to go to university. It has changed HECS. The government has increased the charges and it has reduced the threshold for repaying. It is changing the system all the time so that it is more difficult for ordinary Australian students to go to university.
What does that mean for the future? It means that those people who have got the money to pay are going to get all the advantages. They are going to get the education, they are going to have the skills and they are going to get the good jobs. That means that we are going to have a two-tiered society in the future. To access university at the moment you either have to have the money or be prepared to work part time and go to university full time, or work full time and go to university part time. It is harder for ordinary Australians to access the universities, and it 
 is all because of this government's cuts. It is all because this government has waged war on ordinary Australians. In Australia, 15 per cent of the population go to university whilst in the US it is 26 per cent.
This government continues to slash funds. It is providing $4 million for an advertising campaign to encourage students from overseas to come to Australia but at the same time it is withdrawing funds from the universities. The Howard government sees all undergraduates and potential students as consumers and universities as supermarkets, which is absolutely ridiculous. It trivialises the importance to our nation of university and education. Education is not a luxury of life; it is essential. If Australia is to go forward we must spend money on education. We have to invest in knowledge, expertise, skills and the future, and money directed towards the universities does just that. If we do not do this we will be left behind as we approach the new millennium.
We must fight hard to see that this government's plan or picture for Australia does not come to fruition. University education is too important an issue to leave to economic rationalists. We are starting from a point of disadvantage here in Australia because of the policies this government has introduced. This government's philosophy blinds it to the needs of ordinary Australians. It is hurting Australians and it is hurting Australia. Not only is the government axing funds from universities, it is seeking to make student unionism voluntary. This is driven by a hatred of unions, and it is going to have enormous impact. In regions like Newcastle, where we have a strong university, it will definitely cut back services to students. This government is marginalising universities by all the actions it is taking.
John Howard and his government have achieved the impossible: they have united the vice-chancellors and students against the government. The education legacy that this government is going to leave Australia is both sad and serious, and was highlighted in the Expenditure on Education report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Friday. This report highlights the damage done to 
 Australia's education system by the Howard government, particularly in the area of university education. John Howard's government slashed funding to Australian universities by a massive 12.7 per cent between 1995-96 and 1997-98. This government is comprised of educational vandals. It has no commitment to education. It is bad news for Australia, bad news for Australian students and bad news for industry and business.
I must conclude now because not only has this government got no commitment to education but also it is about to gag the debate on funding to higher education institutions, and  I know my colleagues would like to make a contribution to the debate. The simple fact that this government is gagging this debate symbolises the lack of commitment of the Howard government to Australian universities, Australian students and to Australia's future.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Katter, Bob, Jnr, MP",NP,1999-09-22,"—This is a very historic moment for the people of North Queensland in so far as the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  contains the provisions necessary for the commencement of the James Cook Medical School. The 700,000 people who live in North Queensland have no medical school and no way of training their own doctors. The demographic centre of North Queensland, which lies a little bit north of Townsville, is nearly 2,000 kilometres away from the nearest medical school. For all of North Queensland's history we have seen our northern boys and girls who are bright enough to get into the medical faculty go down to a southern university or, almost exclusively, to the University of Queensland. They live there while doing their course for the next six years of their life—very formative years of their life—and the chances of them returning to North Queensland are very small indeed.
The figures cited earlier this evening by the honourable member for Townsville were very accurate. He said that there were some 1,100 specialist doctors in Queensland but that around 850 of them were in the south-east corner of the state. When one considers that more than half the intake of undergraduates of the University of Queensland comes from south of the border, one realises that its 
 chances of supplying doctors to North Queensland are small indeed.
Over recent years we have once again reached crisis point. There have been mass rallies. Some 400 or 500 people attended the rally at Mareeba protesting at the shortage of doctors there. A large number of people attended the anti-government rally at Tully over the same issue—a shortage of doctors. I was on the receiving end of another rally at Cloncurry, which again was over a shortage of doctors.
If we were to go through the historical sequence that occurred in this case, we would turn our minds back to George Roberts, a man from a very prominent legal family in North Queensland, whose energies and vision for the future of North Queensland saw the necessity for a North Queensland university. Whilst there were many other players, I do not think George ever got the acknowledgment that he richly deserved for the formation of the university. I pay very great credit to my father, who with the government of the day instituted the growth of that university.
My first memory of the doctors issue was the opening of the Julia Creek hospital. I was secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Cloncurry. At the opening everyone was there in all of their finest regalia, expecting great speeches lauding the state government and the state minister for health on the beautiful new air-conditioned hospital at Julia Creek. The then member of parliament, Bill Lonigan, venomously attacked his own government and his own minister. He said: `What the hell is the use of having a three and a half million dollar hospital when we have no doctor to man it?' Some 12 months later, little did I expect that I would be the member of parliament representing Julia Creek. I promised myself that if there was one thing that was never going to happen, it was that little Julia Creek was ever going to be left without a doctor again.
I could write a history book about my efforts to secure and keep doctors, but suffice it to say that the history books will read that in the three years before I became the state member of parliament Julia Creek had a doctor for six months and in the three years 
 after we were only without a doctor for some three months. I carted around with me for some 16 years of my life—I never went anywhere without it—a list of 12 doctors' names throughout the world whom I knew I could ring up because they were willing to come to Australia and serve in Julia Creek or Richmond or any of those other towns where we needed the doctors.
I pay great tribute to that living saint, Dr Harvey Sutton from Cloncurry, who instituted the inland medical service at the cost of his own family's fortune and his own personal fortune, which he lost entirely. But his loss was gain to the area. He went overseas and, out of the little  money he had, he secured doctors for us to man so many of our inland towns that had never seen a doctor before. Whilst financially he may have fallen and died, it was over his financial dead body that we were able to secure medical services in those areas.
However, we rode once again into very grave and difficult waters some two or three years ago when Aramac and Muttaburra, two little towns very close together and serviced by one doctor, lost their doctor. It was 11 months before that doctor was replaced. There is a statistic for this: if 1,000 people are left without a doctor for a period of two years then someone will die as a result of that doctor not being there. We went without a doctor there for 11 months. This was very public. The situation was venomously attacked by me on numerous occasions through the public media. It was a national issue, even though it was a small area.
On top of that, we had the AMA demanding that no doctors come in from overseas. There were moves by the government of the day, of which I was not part, to ban the immigration of doctors into this country to service country areas. The minister said that, whilst it was a general rule, it was a rule that could be broken specifically. I launched what some described as a fairly venomous attack upon the AMA. Bill Coote, the national director, arrived in my office the next day. I had the honour of being president of my university college at the University of Queensland and president of the faculty. Bill happened to be 
 a freshman at my university college when I was the big chief, so I had some psychological one-upmanship on Bill. Dr Bill Coote came in and said: `Look, Bob, you don't understand this.' I said: `I most certainly understand this. Over the riches of the doctors practising in Australia are going to be the dead bodies of we people in the bush. That is what this amounts to, William.' He said: `The only solution to this problem is a medical school in North Queensland. What do you think is the only way we can attack this?' I answered: `The medical school in North Queensland; that has been my belief.'
I then went and saw Michael Wooldridge. He sighed and looked to heaven and said: `The only way out of this is the Townsville medical school.' I said: `Well, Michael, that doesn't solve the problem for Australia.' He said: `Two-thirds of this problem is a Queensland problem and two-thirds of the Queensland problem is a North Queensland problem.' At all stages throughout this very historic move I thought that was the intellectual underpinning of the drive for the university to expand that medical school into the area.
I went to see Mike Horan, who was the then minister in Queensland. Mike said to me: `Bob, there is only one way out of this situation, and that is a medical school in Townsville.' So the three key players all said that there was only one solution, and that was the Townsville medical school. That was always my belief.
Probably Mike Horan—and I do not mean to denigrate anyone by saying this—more than anyone else took it upon himself to deliver that medical school. Peter Lindsay said that we had been promised it in 1983. I think that at about eight elections we had been promised the Townsville medical school. But still nothing had happened in the year of Our Lord 1993. I called a meeting. Rhonda Jones was then acting vice-chancellor at James Cook University. Ian Wronski and a number of other heavies from the university were at that meeting; I cannot remember everyone. There were two representatives from the Premier's Department, one of them Mary Jane Streeton, the Premier's representative in North Queensland.
Rhonda Jones suggested that a committee be set up under Lady Pearl Logan, and everyone thought that that was an excellent proposal. I met Dr Ian Wronski for the first time, and he was a bundling ball of nervous energy, drive and commitment not only to intellectual attainment but also to what he thought needed to be done in Australia for the betterment of his country. Ken McKinnon, who was the Vice-Chancellor for only two or three years, was probably one of the most important key players in the delivery of this. Though his time in North Queensland was very short, his contribution most certainly was giant.
We were vehemently attacked by the University of Queensland on a continuous basis. They never relented in their attacks to try to stop this medical school from going ahead. They had failed totally to deliver doctors to us in North Queensland and western Queensland but still had the hide to try to prevent us from having our own medical school in the northern half of the state.
At the annual conference of the National Party, Lady Pearl Logan got Mike Horan aside and said, `Mike, I want the medical school and I want it now.' He said, `I can't deliver it. It really has to be Bobby Borbidge.' So she said, `Right, get him over here now.' She is a feisty little fighter, even though most people her age should be out playing bingo and watering flowers. Pearl demanded that Bob Borbidge come over, so Bob went over and got a good hammering too. They were both browbeaten into submission and agreed that there would be a decision made immediately about the medical school, and there was. So the Queensland government took its decision in cabinet that there would be a North Queensland medical school.
We got immense support from Margaret Reynolds. It would be improper for me not to mention the support and contribution by Margaret. I think she had a lot to do with convincing the incoming minister, Wendy Edmond, and we thank Wendy too for her contribution. Peter Lindsay called a very key meeting in the Snowy Mountains when the coalition was up there with the Prime Minister and all of we players, and I think that had a 
 very real part to play in delivering to us the school.
Finally, to the Prime Minister, David Kemp, Michael Wooldridge—all those people who made this decision—we say a very sincere thank you. To date, as the famous journalist in the Australian newspaper Heather Brown put it, we have been left to die in the mud in the bush. That most certainly has been the situation to date. A very serious determination has been made by this government and by the successive governments in Queensland to turn that around, and for this we are very thankful indeed.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  sets a funding framework for various government initiatives in the education sector. It sets a maximum amount for operating and other grants to higher education institutions by varying the amounts already legislated under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for 1999 and 2000, and it inserts an amount for 2001. It also sets maximum funding levels for expenditure on the international marketing and promotion of Australian educational and training services by Australian Education International for the 2001 funding year.
As has been referred to by the previous speaker, the member for Kennedy, it amends HEFA to make provision for the funding of 60 medical places at James Cook University for 2001, and it provides funding for the science lectureships of $14.7 million and research infrastructure of $73.6 million. Those initiatives were announced in the budget.
The bill before the House really masks the failure of this government as far as higher education funding is concerned. The importance of education to Australians and the future of the nation has been stated in many debates in this House. Access to educational opportunities for all Australians is a central plank of Labor's policy platform. Our policy framework is based upon the creation of a knowledge based society as a driver of economic growth into the future.
As far as the contribution of tertiary education to Australian society is concerned, that contribution was succinctly summed up in its length and breadth in the comments of Profes 
 sor John Niland, who is Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales and President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. These comments were reported in the Melbourne Age on Thursday, 25 March 1999. This statement really sums up succinctly the importance of tertiary education to Australians, to the Australian economy and to our future. He said this:
University education generates many significant external benefits to the community. In particular: additional income generated by a highly skilled labor force is returned to general revenue, thereby benefiting all citizens; education helps raise public awareness and integrate new migrant groups into the Australian culture; education reduces income inequality and promotes long-term economic growth; educated workers inspire and raise productivity of co-workers; and the body of knowledge created by university research often results in new or improved goods or production techniques that can save lives, increase welfare and accelerate economic growth.
It is a very comprehensive statement of the importance of higher education to Australia. But, sadly, this government, which claims wisdom in so many policy areas, has seen fit to grossly run down our educational resources and our educational infrastructure not only in the amounts of money going from the Commonwealth to the primary and secondary levels but also in the area of higher education.
In 1996, the coalition wiped some $2.7 billion from the education budgets of the nation in succeeding years. If we look at our particular record and compare it to the coalition's, the community can well understand why this federal government is selling them short and selling the nation short as far as the resources that it is putting into the tertiary education sector are concerned.
In Labor's last five years, the percentage of the nation's wealth invested in education, research and training rose from 2.35 per cent of GDP to around three per cent of GDP. The government, in its first four budgets, has reduced this investment as a percentage of GDP back to 2.53 per cent in the budget projection for 1999-2000.
If John Howard had maintained our investment in education and research at three per cent of GDP, the Commonwealth would now 
 be spending an extra $2.87 billion on education and higher education. Of course, ministers and members from the coalition come into this House and lecture us about the Commonwealth budget and the dangers of deficits, and the fact that the sky will fall in if the Commonwealth government happens to run a deficit or even a modest surplus. What they do not tell us is that in the postwar era it was a Labor government that ran surplus budgets for the first time. Most of the budgets in that postwar era were in deficit and they were run by coalition governments. So when you beat your breast about how good this coalition government is, I have to remind you that you are merely catching up to Labor and following Labor's example as far as surplus budgets are concerned.
There is an essential difference between the coalition and the opposition in relation to education, and it is simply this. The minister and the government essentially view education as another line item in the federal budget. It is a cost to the budget that has to be substantially reduced to pander to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and this minister's ideological prejudices. We on this side of the House regard education expenditure as an investment in the future, an investment in our citizens both young and old, and in the nation.
There are some significant issues that are of real concern to the higher education community in this nation. It has been articulated in many forums that there has been a decline in teaching standards and a significant increase in student staff ratios in the tertiary sector since this government came to power. Day after day we hear vice-chancellors complaining about the run-down of infrastructure within their institutions. That is an inevitable result of this government's policies. We also hear people from within these universities complaining about the fact that equity and access considerations have fallen by the wayside. For example, in the higher education student population the proportion of students from rural backgrounds has declined from 18.5 per cent in 1991 to 17.4 per cent in 1997. We have seen significant reductions in the access of people from rural backgrounds 
 to higher education institutions under this government.
In the remaining time available to me in this debate—I understand the government intends to gag the debate later this evening—let me pay tribute to Deakin University, which is in my electorate. Deakin University owes its existence in Geelong to the efforts of the former member for Corio, Gordon Scholes. The Liberal government of the day wanted to locate the university in a metropolitan environment and it was through the efforts of Gordon Scholes that the university was located in Geelong.
In August, Deakin University was named joint winner of the 1999-2000 University of the Year Award. It is the second time that the university has won that title and it is the first time in the history of national awards that the award has been won twice by a particular university. This is an excellent university. I pay tribute to Professor Geoff Wilson and the staff of Deakin University for winning this award yet again. The criterion for the 1999-2000 awards was productive partnerships. Deakin University has very extensive and productive partnerships not only with the Geelong community but with industry in Geelong and corporate companies throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It is a very important award and will do much to lift the morale of the university which has suffered severe funding cuts and difficulties in recent times.
What does Deakin University say about the thrust of the recommendations of the government's green paper on research and research training? The vice-chancellor who accepted that award, Professor Geoff Wilson, had this to say:
Deakin University was one of several universities that would suffer dramatically by the funding model proposed in the Federal Government's Green Paper on research and research training.
. . .              . . .             . . .
I find it surprising and disturbing that Deakin University, recently named joint University of the Year for its outstanding education and training partnerships, is treated so badly in the recommendations of the paper.
Deakin is a leader in its professional doctorate programs that are offered in partnership with 
 industry and are aligned precisely with the thrust of the Green Paper. Yet the proposals would cut our research degree places from over 500 this year to under 200 in 2001, with further reductions to follow.
So much for the clever country. So much for encouraging a knowledge based society. So much for laying an educational base that will underpin economic growth in our future. So much for securing the future of this country and young Australians in it. This government is to be absolutely condemned for the cuts that it has made to education across the board, particularly in higher education.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I rise to speak to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  with particular reference to its impact on Tasmanian students and the Tasmanian community, but before I outline some specific Tasmanian repercussions, let us look at the broader impact of the Howard government policies in the area of education. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, in their submission to the West review, called for an increase in government funding of over 20 per cent. They warned that:
Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures.
In the lead-up to the last budget this government referred to the production of an `education budget'. This government claims an interest in the furtherance of our educational standards and consistently restates its supposed commitment to education. Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different. Education has been one of the first casualties of the Howard government. This is the fourth year in a row that the Howard government has reduced the operating grants to the University of Tasmania.
Although the number of undergraduate university places has increased, as the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs was very quick to point out in his second reading speech on the bill, the number of applications received by universities is decreasing. This is a direct result of the 
 disincentives that the Howard government has created. Under this government, first generation university students are less likely to explore their potential due to economic constraints. In fact, applications to universities have been driven down by around five per cent. It is hardly worth bragging about allowing universities to lower their entry standards to accommodate those in the community who can `buy' their university place in a course. A total of 1,740 university places were offered in this way by the government. This is not about equitable access—this is about providing privileges for the wealthy. A further advantage to those students with a higher disposable income relates to HECS. With savings of up to 25 per cent for up-front settlement of fees or payments over $500, economically disadvantaged students pay more and, once again, miss out.
In the last budget the Howard government attempted to make us forget the ills that it has wrought in education. It speaks of extra funding for literacy, additional Commonwealth funded places and additional medical school funding. These measures are fine, but they do not in any manner redress the $2.7 billion education hole that this government has created. Because that is what this government has ripped out of education funding and that is the reality of its so-called commitment to education.
The University of Tasmania has suffered significantly at the hands of this government. Many potential students for the university in Tasmania are first generation students. But this government, with its talk of up-front fees, is putting barriers in the way of families who do not feel that they can encourage their children to pursue further education as an option because they may well not be able to afford it. The university is vital to the future of our state. It needs to be perceived as a viable option for talented Tasmanian students, to give them a pathway to excellence.
But this government is not committed to education excellence. In particular it is not committed to educational opportunities for regional students. Perhaps the most offensive issue is the attack on students from isolated or low income areas. There is little doubt that 
 people living in regional Australia suffer a disadvantage when it comes to accessing services such as health and education. And there is little doubt that the problems facing people living outside the major population centres such as Sydney and Melbourne have increased since the Howard government won office in 1996. The government has focused on metropolitan constituencies at the expense of regional Australia. In Victoria, the Kennett government is now learning about consequences.
There was, however, surprisingly, one initiative taken in 1996 by the then Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, that was actually designed to help people living in regional Australia. It was called the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. It provided assistance for students from low income families and rural or isolated backgrounds. It enabled some of the cleverest kids from rural or battling backgrounds to go to university. In essence, it provided some measure of equity for disadvantaged students.
The introduction of this scheme recognised that if students live in regional areas their chances of going to university are less than if they come from cities. Potential students are in many cases prevented from accessing education due to isolation. Senator Vanstone said that the scheme was designed to bring higher education within the reach of ordinary Australians. I could not agree more. She said it was a practical demonstration of the Howard government's real commitment to fairness and equity in higher education. That statement by the then minister was misleading. This was not a commitment to equity in education by the Howard government. It was a commitment to equity in education by Amanda Vanstone. And when she went so did that commitment.
Across Australia this initiative was taken up by 1,127 students from low socioeconomic backgrounds; 375 from rural or isolated areas; 199 indigenous Australians; 188 students from non-English-speaking backgrounds; 149 students with disabilities; and 109 women studying in non-traditional areas. Tasmania was a beneficiary of this scheme. In its first 
 year, 58 Tasmanian students applied for assistance. The number of scholarship applications increased to 121 in 1998 and 225 students applied to access the scheme this year. Out of those  58 applications in 1997, 20 students were successful. The number of students accessing the scheme last year was 46 and this year that number increased to 68.
The abolition of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme was a low point in the 1999 budget. In terms of the total budget it cost very little. But its cancellation was a significant cost to the many students in northern Tasmania who want to get to university. It demonstrates the meanness of this government—that it would tear up with such abandon the opportunity for talented students to overcome disadvantageous circumstances to realise their full potential. The Prime Minister, in the lead-up to the last budget, referred to his education budget and then promptly scrapped a program for clever kids in rural areas.
This is a small but very important example of how this government operates. As far as Tasmania is concerned, it is all bad—in particular in the area of research. In the last three years the Howard government has had a devastating effect on university research and development. Cuts to university operating grants of more than $800 million have reduced Commonwealth investment in higher education research by 11 per cent as a percentage of GDP. In order for universities to be successful in obtaining Commonwealth or industry funding, there must be an adequate research infrastructure. This government should embrace education and research as the future of our nation. Yet the Howard government has further plans for attacking university based research.
My concern for the future of university research was echoed by the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations Inc. in a briefing paper prepared on the federal government's research green paper in 1999. Criticisms were also considered valid by the president of the student association at the University of Tasmania Launceston campus, Paddy Dorney. Specifically, there is real potential for commercially profitable research 
 to reign supreme at the expense of less commercially profitable research in the arts and humanities streams.
The imposition of time limits on the completion of postgraduate courses fails to recognise the plight of disadvantaged postgraduate students who have been financially unable to follow straight from their first degrees into further university study. What about those students who have family commitments which prevent them from making university a full-time occupation, or those who are working and simply cannot be at school full time? It seems that the government is, in the words of the President of CAPA, of the belief that older students are `a less than optimal investment of limited public resources'. I would have thought universities would have been enriched by the contributions of students who had different experiences to share and offer. It would seem, however, that this government is intent on decreasing access to universities for disadvantaged students and is not prepared to invest in opening universities to allow lifelong educational access to the community.
Students with high disposable incomes will be able to conduct their research at interstate universities. Regional universities offering fewer research options will lose talented students because they are unable to offer equivalent research options. Economically disadvantaged students will have no option but to cancel their plans to work towards postgraduate qualifications. Who is the poorer for restricting their access to education? We are. We are the community that will bear the cost of this Howard government's education cost cutting practices. This government's policy is about making postgraduate university studies more elitist and less accessible to ordinary Australians—and it will significantly impact on the people of Bass. I am left with the impression that mature age students, as we used to call them at university, are not important to this government and that full fee paying students who will roll in and out of university quickly are this government's priority.
The quality of research completed at the University of Tasmania's Launceston campus may also be reduced because quality research 
 takes time. Significant educational cutbacks coupled with a GST of 10 per cent imposed on books and stationery, added to increasing HECS rates recovered earlier and potential attacks on postgraduate study opportunities signal a difficult time for university students throughout Australia. Regional universities such as the Launceston campus of the University of Tasmania will struggle.
To assume that education is not a lifelong journey is a fatal mistake. The Howard government appears intent on destroying access to quality university education in this country. Tasmania has three university campuses which are affected by the cuts to higher education funding. Cost shifting to universities themselves and the private sector is not the solution. This government should be working on guaranteeing adequate funding and providing an educational experience in our university institutions that all Australians can access on the basis of merit.
The government's research green paper released in June 1999 proposes significant research changes to postgraduate studies. If adopted by the government, the policy will signal a change in the university culture and environment as we know it today. Imposing time limits on postgraduate studies and decreasing choices of what can be studied and where will alienate many Tasmanians, particularly northern Tasmanians, from a postgraduate university education and/or career. The Howard government would do well to reflect on the World Bank report of autumn 1999, which found:
. . . that a key reason for the economic success of the countries [studied] was a high level of investment in education by the state . . . 
I call on the government to recognise and value the enormous contributions postgraduate students make to the quality of our universities and I urge the government to adopt measures which remove a significant barrier for prospective first generational and rural university students to seek a university education. I remind the government that education is an investment in the intellectual capital of this nation. Need I remind the government of Victoria's message to Kennett only last weekend. Privatisation of basic services and 
 neglect of regional Australia will not be forgotten at the next election.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—Prior to the budget of this year, the Prime Minister said that the budget would be:
. . . good for education and what I might call the future intellectual capital of this country.
That was very interesting because ever since then we have heard little of support from the universities, vice-chancellors or students involved. Indeed, the ANU annual report of 1999 actually criticises—most unusually—the federal government and its policies. The report says:
Federal policies have harmed Australia's ability to sustain high-quality universities with research excellence and outstanding staff that enable the nation to claim a world-class higher education system.
Turning to my own state, I refer to a letter to me from the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania on 20 July 1999. This is his assessment of this government and its policies:
The 1996 Commonwealth Higher Education Budget cut operating grants to the University and reduced the number of Commonwealth-funded student places. The Government also discontinued supplementation for salary increases in universities. As a result, at the end of this year the University will have reduced its operating budget in the order of $10 million and will have shed 408 student places. Expansion, not contraction, of the University is needed to confer economic benefits on the State. While the university is acting to diversify its sources of revenue (including industry funding for research), increased Commonwealth funding is required in this, the most educationally deprived of the Australian states.
In 2001, Commonwealth funding for higher education will be at around the same level as it was in 1990. This is an unsafe level of public investment. We cannot and should not rely on the market to deliver sufficient additional income to ensure quality and equality of access. By reducing funding to valuable public infrastructure and decreasing subsidies to students, the features of universities which matter to Australians—that is, their contribution to our economy, their contribution to knowledge and the excitement of discovery, and their contribution to improved employment outcomes—are all put at risk.
I will not repeat the figures that have been presented by my colleagues on this side of the reduction in all sorts of ways of the actual level of government funding to universities when we take out HECS funding as a proportion. All I know is that those figures have been duplicated in Tasmania. I refer to the Senate estimates evidence, in response to Senator O'Brien's question No. 1181, concerning those figures. All they do is duplicate the criticisms and observations by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on funding.
The coalition's policies are limiting participation. For example, in 1998 there were 16,500 fewer fully funded places than had been budgeted for in Labor's forward estimates. At the same time, costs to HECS liable students have increased by between 35 per cent and 125 per cent and the salary threshold for repayment of HECS has been lowered to $21,684. The combined effect of reduced opportunities for fully funded public participation, coupled with increased costs to students, has led to a sharp decline in undergraduate applications since the coalition took office. Although there was a small recovery in demand in 1999, there has been a big cumulative decline since 1996.
I turn to the question of participation of students in rural and isolated areas and those students that are affected because of their socioeconomic status and background. A recent study by the staff of the Centre for the Study of Higher Education has found clear evidence that cost is a particular disincentive for participation by students from rural backgrounds or from low SES backgrounds. That relates in particular in my electorate of Braddon, on the north and west coasts of Tasmania. It found that rural students were significantly more likely than urban students to believe the following: their families cannot afford the cost of supporting them at university, the cost of university fees may stop them attending, and there is no point in their going to university.
The study found that rurality and socioeconomic status combined to produce the greatest educational disadvantage. The least advantaged students, that is, lower socioeconomic status students who lived long distances from 
 university campuses for example, have significantly different attitudes from the most advantaged students, that is, from urban higher SES students. For example, at least twice the proportion of the least advantaged students believe that the cost of university fees may stop them from attending university—43 per cent compared to 21 per cent. Thirty-one per cent of the least advantaged students believe that a university qualification was not necessary for the job they want, while 15 per cent of their most advantaged counterparts believe the same. Sixty-nine per cent of the most advantaged students believe that their parents want them to undertake university study, while 38 per cent of the least advantaged students believe so.
The cost of higher education is identified by the study as a serious inhibitor or barrier to rural students. Rural students were much more likely than urban students to believe that universities are really for wealthy people, and for many financially disadvantaged rural families the costs of education are well beyond their income capacity. Cost, however, is not the only inhibiting factor. The study concludes that present imbalances in higher education partly reflect differences in family and community attitudes towards the relevance of education. These social factors have a bearing on student choices before the final years of school, explaining partly why school completion rates are lower in rural areas. The study concludes that many rural students do not actually reach the point where it is meaningful to consider potential barriers to higher education.
These sorts of attitudes point towards the need for policies which address not only the limited access which students from equity groups experience but also the extent to which their aspirations have been blunted by the policies of this government. Dr Kemp, knowing the figures of the CSHE study, chose to suppress them and proceed with such measures as the abolition of merit equity scholarships, claiming that they do not work. I will have a look at this claim. These merit equity scholarships were introduced in 1997 to further encourage the participation of equity groups. A thousand new students each 
 year were to be exempted from HECS charge, building up to a pool of 4,000 students by the year 2000. Up to the present time, 3,000 scholarships have been allocated to universities. Recipients by category of disadvantage in 1998 included indigenous Australians, women in non-traditional areas, people with a disability, people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, people from rural and isolated areas and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds—the latter two, of course, making up the greatest percentage of those who were recipients of the equity scholarships.
I cite the parliamentary Research Digest, which says:
DETYA has conducted an informal survey of university equity officers and states that the main points to arise were as follows: 85 per cent of respondents claimed that the scheme was ineffective in attracting people into higher education who might otherwise not undertake university study because young people did not value an exemption from HECS and because the universities did not advertise the scheme properly; there was no agreement on whether the scholarships improved retention; HECS exemptions are more attractive to mature age students and single parents, rather than school leavers; and the scheme is administratively expensive for the universities.
When you do a little bit of investigation on this, it is interesting to find that phone call after phone call by people investigating the government's claim on the equity scholarships found that they had not been consulted, and that they wanted to see the results that allegedly had been gained through this informal survey of university equity officers. I can cite Robert Main, the Central Queensland University equity coordinator, or Dr Allen Barlow of the University of West Sydney or Jeanette Ryan of the University of Ballarat, and on and on it goes. They did not hear about this informal survey on the equity scholarships.
I come from an area that is severely disadvantaged in terms of economic downturn and also in terms of educational retention rates to years 11 and 12 and to further education, those at TAFE and university. Unfortunately, the retention rates in my area are some of the lowest in Australia. Students in my area actually benefited from the equity merit scholarship scheme. In fact, 11 of the 21 
 offered in 1999 went to students from the west and north-west coast of Tasmania. Since 1996-97, 30 of the 68 scholarships offered by the University of Tasmania have gone to students from the west and north-west. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee said, through Don McNicol of this state, that the scrapping of this scheme was incredible; that it was incredible that the one scheme that might offer some incentive to people to go on in areas that are very difficult in terms of retention rates had been scrapped.
I will finish now because I would like to give equal time to my colleagues. Don McNicol, the Vice-Chancellor of our university, has said this:
Post-compulsory education retention rates in Tasmania have consistently lagged behind the national average. While the gap has been reduced in recent years, Tasmania's retention rates to year 12 remain the lowest of all the Australian States. In a similar fashion, Tasmania's higher education participation rates remain substantially below the national average with participation in the North and North-West regions 25 per cent and 55 per cent respectively below the national average . . .
Further reductions in Commonwealth funding to the University will restrict higher education opportunities and have a negative effect on the State economy. An increased number of Commonwealth funded places—
not reduced but increased—
for the University is justified and required to address the problems of low participation and to meet the State's higher education needs.
I will finish by again quoting Vice-Chancellor McNicol:
Research has revealed a number of factors that contribute to the low higher education participation rates in Tasmania. However, there is clear evidence that financial considerations are one of the major disincentives for many Tasmanians, who are otherwise well qualified and motivated, to undertake higher education.
Instead of scrapping the scheme, in fact they should have added to and expanded the scheme so that more and more people would find an advantage in going on to further education and so break the cycle of those that believe that higher education is out of their reach. When I started my speech I mentioned what the Prime Minister had to say about higher education in his budget. I reckon the 
 government has its fingers around the universities' windpipes and is squeezing them with both thumbs.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I am very pleased to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 . I think that all members from Western Sydney really care very much about the knowledge based society and, inherent in that, about government and society investing in universities and investing in education. We in Western Sydney want our full measure of the jobs that go with a knowledge based society.
Some of my colleagues are in fact suggesting that we ought to take the jobs that are associated with Badgerys Creek airport. I want to make a couple of observations about that. The quoted number of jobs that would flow as a result of the building of Badgerys Creek airport would be delivered in full by the year 2026, which is 27 years hence. But for every three jobs that would be created one would be in Western Sydney and two would be in the rest of Sydney. So it is not a great job generator in Western Sydney: only a third of the jobs generated would be there, and you would only get them in full measure by 2026. Bear in mind that by the year 2016 the people of Western Sydney will constitute more than half the population of Sydney. That is why I am not so impressed about the jobs.
Why do we have to accept these jobs, which come at such a heavy price in terms of our quality of life and our environment and when it is documented that the airport is going to do so much harm to the people of Western Sydney? Why can't we be excited about getting the knowledge based jobs that so many speak of? As I say, I would like to have these jobs in full measure.
I have a profound belief that it is the responsibility of governments to invest in young people, particularly in their education, and in the higher education field I think the Labor government has a great track record. We went through the pain, as the honourable shadow minister at the table would know, of introducing the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It caused great controversy at the time—the students were very unhappy about it—but we did so from the moral point of 
 view that for every dollar raised under HECS we would turn funds back into the university system and we would expand the university system, which of course we did.
We had a fundamental belief that those who aspired to a tertiary education should not be denied it because they came from the wrong part of Sydney or because their parents were battlers and could not afford to send them. The real tragedy of this government is that HECS charges have now risen by $1,130 million and it is not all going back into the tertiary system. That is the real tragedy.
In fact, it is fair to say that by the year 2001 the Commonwealth's percentage of funding to universities will be at 1971 levels—around 48 per cent. Isn't that a disgrace? Here we are talking about the need for better trained and more highly skilled people, about the need for their training and retraining throughout their careers and about the need for them to be able to be adaptable and to change from one career path to another, and what is happening in the Commonwealth's investment in the young people who go to universities? It is declining and with HECS, the principal mechanism that the Labor Party introduced to expand university education, the charges have increased by over $1.1 billion with not all of it going back into the university system.
Professor Deryck Schreuder is currently the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, but he was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney for a considerable period of time. He said:
In the face of the extraordinary international emphasis on innovation, new intellectual property and new technologies, we are . . . beginning to reduce national investment in higher education, in research and development, and in basic research.
He was quoted in the Australian  of 5 May 1999. What a sad indictment of this government. Hal Wooten, the retired Supreme Court judge and foundation Dean of Law at the University of New South Wales, called the cuts to higher education `ignorant vandalism'. He was quoted in the Australian  of Wednesday, 19 May 1999 as saying:
Once financial benefit dominates the selection of staff and students, and of research projects, an insidious corruption of processes begins.
He also said:
Academic independence, dearly won over the centuries against the pressures of superstition, populism, potentates and priests, is of incalculable value to the community and the world at large. Under the current policy it is increasingly eroded as universities become more and more dependant on the rich end of town.
The students in my electorate have to get to university on the basis of merit. Their parents do not have the opportunity to give them a second chance, to pay for their place in universities. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, a society of a fair go where battlers can succeed, and nothing is more obnoxious to us than the fact that, if you come from the North Shore or the eastern suburbs of Sydney, you get two chances at university and not one. Donald Horne, as quoted in the Australian Financial Review  of 29 July 1999, said:
Here we are in a society in which business shifts and changes and specialist expertise and job skills can become so quickly obsolete that whole careers disappear, yet we move further and further away from those concepts of general education that provide the basis for adaptability (including commercial adaptability).
What a sad commentary, Mr Deputy Speaker, on what your government is doing to the higher education system. Some of the cuts that these people are quoting and complaining of include a reduction in discretionary funding of $215 million and a reduction in operating grants of $623 million. The phased abolition of the Commonwealth Industry Places Scheme will see a cut of $67.4 million. The abolition of the Merit Based Equity Scholarships Scheme will see a cut of $38.9 million—and I will return to that—and a reduction in the Higher Education Innovation Program will see a cut of $16 million. The University of Western Sydney had the second largest number of merit based scholarships, 146, and they were just wiped away. These were scholarships that the battlers aspired to.
Discussion about education, particularly in schools, has been replete with the need and the necessity to ensure there is an appropriate ratio of teachers to students, with the emphas 
 is of trying to drive that ratio down so that you would get smaller numbers of students getting the benefit and the attention of the teacher. What has happened in the university scheme? What has happened in the universities of Australia? Are the ratios remaining stable under this government? Have they gone down under this government? No, they have increased by 33 per cent. In fact, the universities are increasingly being pushed into degree factories. You will pay a price for this. It is just like investment in capital goods and machinery: if you fail to invest, if you make the short-term decision, you pay the higher price down the track.
There has been a lot of talk in this place about the economy, about trying to improve production methods, and about value adding and increasing exports, but the most precious and singularly important commodity in production is, of course, the people. What are we doing? We are cutting our investment in people. But we are not cutting it across the board, we are sending out young Australians, the future generations, to bear the burden of these cuts and, of course, we are going to pay the price in the future. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to say a lot more but, as you know, the opposition, in a disciplined way, are limiting their time in this debate. I must therefore draw my remarks to a conclusion and thank the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—Australia's place in the world in the 21st century, in the information age, will depend on our ability as a nation to garner the resources of our young people and their innovative skills to become competitive in the production of ideas and services. Yet our place in the world is under threat. It is under threat from the government's persistent program of cutbacks in our most vital service area: that is, our investment in education. Let me give the House a few examples of the cutbacks that have occurred.
There has been $840 million cut from university operating grants under this government. There have been increases in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, or HECS, of $2,258 a year, if the student was considering studying maths, science or engineering. That 
 is a clear deterrent to young people from low income families taking on those courses. Half a billion dollars has been cut from student income support. Under the common youth allowance we have seen the problems that have been experienced as a result of the application of that policy. There have also been cuts of $240 million over four years from the forward estimates for TAFE. Overall, there has been a six per cent cut in investment in public education between 1996-97 and 2001-02.
Just last Friday, figures were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirming large cuts in the overall education funding by the Commonwealth government. What does the minister for education do about this? How vigorously does he argue in the Expenditure Review Committee for increased funding for education? He cannot be arguing very hard because he spends all his time on the ideological pursuit of voluntary student unionism. That is all he is concerned about in the education sector—trying to attack student unionism on the university campuses.
The minister is doing that because he wants to curry favour with the Prime Minister. He has lost half his portfolio. He is probably a bit worried about his pecking order in the cabinet. He thinks he will have to get on the right side of the Prime Minister. That is pretty hard to do, because the Prime Minister declared in 1987 that he is the most conservative leader that the Liberal Party has ever had. So getting on the right side of the Prime Minister is pretty hard. However, this minister is making a pretty good fist of it.
Let us recall where this minister comes from. He displaced Mr Ian Macphee in a preselection ballot in the late 1980s. Why? Mr Ian Macphee was regarded by the Prime Minister of Australia as too wet. The Prime Minister of Australia who declared that he was the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had did not want Mr Macphee to continue as the member for Goldstein. So this man, who is successfully positioning himself to the right of the Prime Minister, defeated Mr Macphee in a preselection ballot.
We are witnessing a very ugly transformation in the education policy of this nation 
 through this government. We are witnessing in the minister the behaviour of a person described by Manning Clark in his history of Australia as a punisher and straightener. That is the behaviour of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. He has a perspective on literacy and numeracy which says that we need to punish these people and that we need to get lists of all the failing schools and students so that we can publish them in the Melbourne Age, the Melbourne Herald, the Sydney Morning Herald and all the national newspapers. We can then shame these people, punish them and put extreme pressure on them to lift their performance. The reality is that Australian people respond a lot better to encouragement. I am very sorry to say that they get no encouragement under this minister or this government when it comes to education.
Nothing can be more fundamental to the quality of Australian life and to the principles of fairness than the provision of education for everyone regardless of their capacity to pay for it. However, the direction that we are being carried is away from that. It is a direction that rewards and entrenches privilege and at the same time entrenches underprivilege.
We think of the higher education system as one important way of providing equity and equality of opportunity, and it is. However, another fundamental problem emerging as a result of the government's policies is that young people from disadvantaged communities are not even getting to make a decision about university. I have to report that four in 10 boys in government schools do not complete high school. Fifteen to 20 years ago, that may have been manageable. A young boy leaving school at 15 could go into a trade and use his physical prowess to become a plumber, builder or plasterer. But in the information age of the 21st century, a young boy who leaves school at 15 has very grim employment prospects.
We have seen with the business tax review a $4 billion funding hole. I want to issue this warning: we will be watching very closely as a result of the government's unwillingness to take on the difficult issue of closing down tax avoidance through trusts. We will be watching 
 for every budget decision in the education, health and other arenas of vital service to Australians to identify the government's agenda of making them pay for the government's unwillingness to take on the difficult issue of trusts. I close by saying that we must restore equality of opportunity in this country. The government is committed, through a right-wing political agenda, to move in precisely the opposite direction.
Debate (on motion by Mr Tuckey) adjourned.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 will have a grave effect on those who wish to further their education through universities. It deals a fatal blow to those in our society who may never enter a university or other tertiary institution but who rely on such skills and expertise in their daily life. The passage of this bill has ramifications for all Australians. In summary, it means (1) despite a tertiary student load that has increased by 82 per cent since 1983, Commonwealth based operating grants, or the equivalent full-time student unit, to tertiary institutions have decreased by 37 per cent since 1983; (2) the actual dollar amounts of budgetary allocations have declined from $12.3 billion to $11.3 billion in the 2001 financial year; (3) tertiary institutions have had to meet their running costs through charging overseas student fees, tuition fees and the Higher Education Contribution Scheme; (4) there has been the phasing 
 out of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme.
The purpose of this bill is to provide new, yet lower, levels of maximum grants available for higher education in the triennium 1999-2001. There are several relevant issues in this debate. The first is that the increase in financial pressure from decreased governmental financial support has resulted in diminished teaching standards. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee report of May this year noted that the student-staff ratio has increased from 13.5 to 1 in 1989 to 18 to 1 in 1999. The report also noted that only 75 per cent of students are satisfied with the teaching received.
The second issue concerns the progression rates of university students. I refer specifically to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 5 June this year which cited a report from the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The report found that one-third of students who started an undergraduate degree in 1992 dropped out of university completely, and 40 per cent of these students had not completed their degree within five years. The primary reason for this fall in progression rates is cost. A growing number of students are simply economically dissipated.
The third issue is that of maintenance of infrastructure. I note that the roll-in of capital gains grants into operating grants has provided tertiary institutions with improved flexibility, but it is entirely possible that recurrent funding pressures have resulted in some neglect. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs has recently written to vice-chancellors, seeking confirmation that the capital roll-in of components of operating grants was being used to maintain their capital asset base. If this is the case, then we are witnessing a major meltdown in capital maintenance. In short, the buildings are falling.
The fourth issue is of equity and access. I have left this cost until last because it most graphically demonstrates the social impact and cost of this government's policies. In particular, the proportion of students from rural Australia and from isolated and low socioeconomic backgrounds declined between 
 1991 and 1997. Indigenous Australians remain significantly underrepresented in higher education enrolments. The most graphic example of the government's contempt for those seeking access from disadvantaged groups is none other than the phasing out of HEEMSS, the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme.
I cite the higher education budget statement. HEEMSS was introduced in 1997 `to further encourage the participation of equity groups'. One thousand new students were to be exempt from the HECS charge, building up to a pool of 4,000 students by the end of the year 2000. Up to the present time, 3,000 scholarships have been allocated to universities. Scholarships are awarded by universities in accordance with guidelines published by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The guidelines specify that recipients should be commencing students and should belong to a prescribed equity group. Such groups include indigenous Australians, women in non-traditional areas, people with a disability, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, people from rural and isolated areas and people from low socioeconomic backgrounds—in short, your classically disadvantaged groups that are deserving of special assistance.
I beg this House to preserve the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. In this day and age, it is unthinkable that we could sacrifice these 4,000 places, whilst at the same time allowing in this bill a further spot-appropriation to James Cook University for 60 medical faculty places and allocating $14.7 million for science lectureships. When I gave my inaugural speech in this House on 12 November 1998, I made the following concluding statement:
I commit myself to the pursuit of job creation, social equity and a diverse economy that can sustain the growth necessary to enable my constituents and all Australians to live with dignity and happiness, and to achieve harmony in a more independent, tolerant and egalitarian Australia.
This bill violates every precept I gave in my maiden speech. This bill is a recipe for an elitist society, inequitable income distribution, a less tolerant Australia, an Australia that makes a mockery of Aboriginal and Torres 
 Strait Islander reconciliation, an Australia that discriminates against the low and disadvantaged income earners, an Australia that divides people economically, an Australia that ensures drop-out rates of people unable to fund their way either into tertiary education or through that education system; and, finally, an Australia that has a new underclass of academically dispossessed.
This House will also remember that I am a country boy myself, born and raised in the New South Wales country town of Dunedoo. What can the National Party and country-representing Liberal Party members say to their constituents about this bill? What can possibly be their reply? Yet again they have made it even more difficult for a young man or woman from the country finishing their higher school certificate to complete their education—as if the economic circumstances in the country are not hard enough as they are.
Finally, I wish to touch on the subject of research. It is the lack of research funding in this bill which will reduce Australia's competitiveness. I again refer to the press release of 13 May 1999 of the shadow minister for education, Michael Lee, in which he notes:
In Labor's last five years, the percentage of the nation's wealth invested in education, research and training rose from 2.35 per cent of Gross Domestic Product to 3 per cent. In John Howard's first four budgets he has reduced that investment back to 2.53 per cent. . . . The crisis in education and research is made worse because reduced investment by the Commonwealth has led to reduced investment in R&D by the private sector.
Whilst I do not oppose this bill, I endorse the opposition's second reading amendment, which condemns the government for the budget's higher education cuts—to merit based equity scholarships and innovation programs—and for its failure to provide more research funding. The losers are any persons who participate in tertiary education, those who are employed in tertiary education and those who use tertiary education—in short, all Australians. There are no winners. The government, Australia Inc., will reduce its budget by a paltry amount, which cannot compare to the irreversible damage that will flow from this budget.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I would like to start by congratulating the Hunter based Liberal senator, Senator Tierney, on formally declaring himself a republican. Like him, I will be voting yes in the republic referendum on 6 November, and I look forward to working with him to achieve a strong yes vote in our region, the Hunter.
Senator Tierney's decision to vote on 6 November for Australia to become a republic with an Australian head of state will show the people of the Hunter that it is not a political issue; rather, it is a decision about Australia's future—a decision that will determine whether Australia has the courage to become a truly independent and proudly Australian nation.
One hundred years ago, the six colonies came together to become a nation with a constitutional monarch. Now it is time to become a republic with an Australian President as our head of state. The beauty of having an Australian as our head of state is that each and every Australian can aspire to become President—unlike the current system, where only members of the British royal family can become our head of state. If you are not born into that family, if you do not have that birthright, you can never become the head of state of Australia. Under a republic, a person will be able to become head of state through ability rather than birth.
It flies in the face of Australia's egalitarian system that we have a head of state who is the Queen of another country and that she represents our nation throughout the world. Further, it flies in the face of our egalitarian Australian ideals that whenever we toast our head of state we toast the Queen of England.
Unlike Senator Tierney, I grew up believing Australia should become a republic. My mother, who is 80 years of age, instilled in 
 me her dream of a truly independent Australia. I must say that this has developed further over the years, and I can see the advantages of having an Australian President representing Australia and only Australia.
In his speech in this parliament, Mr Baird, the member for Cook, talked about when he was trying to obtain the Olympics for Australia. He tells the story of Princess Anne arguing against Australia, arguing for England rather than Australia to be the country that had the Olympics. She had split loyalties. Her loyalties were to the UK and to England, not to our country.
Mr Abbott—interjecting—
—Order! The minister is defying standing orders, and I will deal with him if I need to.
—To say, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it' trivialises the issue. It is not about fixing our Constitution and our system of government but about making it better and taking the best of our current system and making it truly Australian. That is why it behoves the government to ensure that all Australians are in a position to make an informed decision. Unfortunately, to date it has failed, and some members of the government even seek to misrepresent the question and the argument.
My office has been inundated with requests for copies of our Constitution but, as a member of this parliament, I am entitled to only 50 copies of the Constitution a year. Mr Speaker, I would be most grateful if you could look into this, because it means that I can give a copy to only the first 50 people who contact my office, which is just not good enough. Further, the government-run $9.5 million neutral public education program that is currently being run has been accused of being blatantly biased by the republican movement, whilst the constitutional monarchists have endorsed the advertising campaign wholeheartedly. To me, this level of disagreement supports the claims of bias, which is particularly disgraceful as the campaign is publicly funded and supposedly unbiased. This government even bypassed the expert panel which was appointed to oversee the program and to ensure balance and untainted 
 information. I think the government really needs to look at making sure that this issue is put to the Australian people in a fair and unbiased manner.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Referendum 1999</title>,Adjournment,22,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1999-09-22,"—The Victorian state election held on Saturday in my view was not a referendum on Jeff Kennett, though he tried to make it such. It was an election about competing policies for Victoria and for communities. Many people treated the poll as a referendum on local services and what the Kennett government had done in their area and planned to do in the future.
In my local area the referendum was about the future of the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. The Kennett government had decided to sell this fantastic hospital, the largest teaching hospital in Victoria. The Austin is also one of the leading medical research hospitals in Australia, with the Austin Medical Research Institute being at the forefront of research into cancer and other life threatening illnesses. It is also important, with yesterday having been Alzheimer's Day, to acknowledge the research done at the Memory Loss Clinic at the Austin and, in particular, the clinical trials performed on Aricept, a drug that many in the field see as groundbreaking in the treatment of memory loss. There are many other very important areas of research that the Austin undertakes but, given the time, I have not got the capacity to go through those today.
The two state electorates where the Austin and Repat sits recorded large swings to Labor at the recent election. In Ivanhoe, the swing was one of the largest in the metropolitan area, at over 4.4 per cent, and in Bundoora it was around 3.3 per cent. Ivanhoe is a seat that has been held by the Labor Party for only six years since 1955. We can be sure that the Liberals have lost the referendum on the sale of our hospital.
During the election campaign we had the now departing Minister for Health, Rob Knowles—he lost his seat with a 9.6 per cent swing—visiting volunteers at the hospital to attempt to assure them of the future of services at the site and the ongoing importance of their role. To say that the reception he got was frosty is a vast understatement. They made it clear that volunteering to work for a for-profit company was very different from working for a publicly owned and operated hospital. They rightly felt betrayed by the Kennett government. I hope now that we have won the fight to save the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre.
I know that the Labor Party has listened and is committed to public hospitals. If we do end up with a Labor government, we will have a strengthened, publicly owned Austin and Repat. If the Liberals do scrape back, they must end this ideological obsession with the first sale of a major teaching hospital in Australia. The local community deserve to be heard. They do not want their hospital sold.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre</title>,Statements by Members,24,1
