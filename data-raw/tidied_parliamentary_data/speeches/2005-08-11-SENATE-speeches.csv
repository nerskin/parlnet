"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-08-11,"—I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in the name of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for 10 sitting days after today for the disallowance of the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Regulations 2005, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 11 and made under the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Act 2003. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee’s correspondence concerning this instrument.
Leave granted.
The correspondence read as follows—

HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Regulations 2005

The Hon Phillip Ruddock MP
Attorney-General
Suite M1.21
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Attorney-General
I refer to the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Regulations 2005, Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 11.
Regulation 4 gives ASIC access to “any record of, or relating to, the HIH Royal Commission”. The quoted words, found in regulation 4, are copied from section 6 of the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Act 2003. Nevertheless the words “or relating to” appear to have wide application. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice about the intended scope of these words.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 29 April 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Tchen

I refer to your letter of 17 March 2005 to the Attorney-General seeking advice about the intended scope of Regulation 4 of the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Regulations 2005 (the Regulations). I regret that a response to the Committee’s enquiry has been delayed due to a misunderstanding that the substance of the enquiry had been answered by the Attorney-General.
Whilst the Treasurer has responsibility for the enabling Act, the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Act 2003 (the Act), I am responding to your enquiry as it was I that recommended that the Regulations be made. In this regard, I note that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the controlling agency for records (other than administrative records) of completed Royal Commissions, including the HIH Royal Commission (the Commission).
The Explanatory Statement sets out the reasons for making the Regulations in some detail but the following information may provide a better understanding.
The intent of the Act was to give the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) custody of all documents or things produced to the Commission still in its possession when it ceased to exist (section 4) as well as electronic copies of electronic versions of documents or things produced to the Commission (section 5), which would include electronic copies of documents or things produced which had been returned to their owners before the Commission ceased to exist. In essence, ASIC was to have all original material still held plus electronic copies of all material provided, whether still held or not, to the extent such material had been copied and kept by the Commission.
Late last year, it became apparent that there are electronic records, copies of which ASIC has an entitlement to under section 5 of the Act, held in part of the database received by PM&C from the Commission which PM&C understood only to hold documents created by the Commission (i.e. documents to which ASIC was not entitled). There was no way of determining which of these were electronic versions of documents produced to the Commission, and which therefore should be provided to ASIC, without opening and examining each of over 10,000 documents at issue. There was also a possibility that there might be documents produced to the Commission, the custody of which ASIC would be entitled to under section 4 of the Act, in the hard copy records of the Commission still held by PM&C. ASIC needed to be assured that it had received all material to which it was entitled under the Act, in order that potential prosecutions would not be compromised.
The Regulations were made to allow ASIC officers to access such Commission records and related records as would be determined by the Secretary to PM&C and to undertake the examination necessary to determine which further documents should be provided to ASIC, in order that the Commonwealth’s obligations under the Act to transfer documents were met in full.
As you have noted in your letter, Regulation 4 simply copies the wording found in section 6 of the Act.
The database provided to PM&C by the Commission is a version of the Commission’s electronic database in the custody of the National Archives of Australia. As such, the database in PM&C is not “a record of the HIH Royal Commission” but rather a version containing copies of Commission records. As controlling agency for the Commission’s records, PM&C needed to be able to supervise any access to records by ASIC officers. It was determined therefore that access would be provided to the database held by PM&C rather than the Commission’s electronic database held in the National Archives.
The PM&C database is not the official record of the Commission but is a copy of the record for PM&C’s purposes and is therefore only a record relating to the Commission. In order to allow ASIC to have access to the PM&C database, the section 6 wording was adopted in drafting Regulation 4. The intention was that ASIC should have access to (but not custody of) such records either held by PM&C or under PM&C’s control that would enable all concerned to be satisfied that all material to which ASIC is entitled under the Act has been provided, and no more.
To this end, ASIC has been provided with access on PM&C premises to a discrete part of the hard copy Commission records held by PM&C and to two folders in PM&C’s electronic version of the Commission’s database held. It is not anticipated at this stage that any further access will be required.
I trust that this answers the Committee’s enquiry. Please let me know if further information is required.
Yours sincerely

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-08-11,"—I present a supplementary report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on its inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission has a statutory responsibility to examine and report on trends and changes in the method and practice of criminal activities. In 2003, the committee conducted an inquiry into the commission’s involvement in assessing trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual servitude in Australia. At about the same time as the committee commenced its inquiry, the government announced its national action plan to combat trafficking in women. The plan included a legislative review as well as policy initiatives funded by an allocation of $20 million to the key agencies involved. These agencies included the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Attorney General’s Department, AusAID and a range of state agencies.
The committee’s inquiry focused on six major issues:
the extent of trafficking in women in Australia;
the effectiveness of the National Action Plan …
the need for interdepartmental co-ordination of the response to the National Action Plan;
the protection and treatment of trafficked women;
the adequacy of the applicable legislation; and
the need for ratification of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons especially Women and Children.
In its report of 24 June 2004, the committee made nine recommendations. Broadly, these included: that Australian Crime Commission investigations should focus on the methods people traffickers use to perpetrate visa fraud; the formalisation of the interdepartmental committee established to implement the national action plan; the speedy finalisation of the legislative review and assessment of the adequacy of provisions dealing with recruiting, transportation and transfer of trafficked women; that the measures needed to ensure Australia’s compliance with the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children be assessed and implemented; that the benefits payable to women under the victim support scheme be reassessed urgently; that all trafficked women accepted onto the victim support program or receiving the Criminal Justice Stay Visa be exempt from compulsory return to their country of origin; and that the government review current visa provisions, and consider changes to provide for a ministerial discretion to allow witnesses to return to their country of origin for short periods for contact with their families.
The committee decided to revisit the issue to assess the progress made and evaluate the progress of the implementation of its recommendations. On 23 June 2005, the committee invited officers of key agencies to participate in a roundtable to discuss the progress of initiatives in the national action plan.
The committee found significant progress has been made in creating an effective and equitable response to the trade into Australia of women for the sex industry. Many of the issues over which the committee expressed concern have been addressed by a comprehensive package of legislation passed by the parliament on 21 June 2005 and assented to on 6 July.
However, the committee would like a review of the new legislation to take place a year after its implementation. That review should consider amendments to enable the provision to the court of victim impact statements specific to these offences similar to those contained in the New South Wales Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004. This recommendation was made by the committee in its first report and the committee still considers it worth consideration.
The intelligence gathered by the ACC shows that the problem of trafficking in women is significant. The committee is pleased to note that a recent ACC board determination ensures the continued active involvement of the commission in intelligence gathering in this area. This is particularly important given the potential involvement of organised crime in trafficking.
The national action plan represents a significant whole-of-government activity. During the hearings the committee canvassed the possibility of an audit of the plan being undertaken. This was done out of the concern that in any situation such as this, where multiple agencies share responsibility, no-one has either the authority to ensure that actions are taken or clear responsibility for results. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the ANAO evaluate the national action plan after three years of operation.
The committee was impressed by the commitment shown by the agencies involved to implementing the action plan and their willingness to maintain the momentum of this progress. The committee is confident that the combination of the new legislation, the continuation of the national action plan and the criminal intelligence provided by the ACC lays a firm foundation for combating trafficking in women for sexual servitude. It remains for these measures to be monitored and adjusted where necessary to ensure this foundation is maintained. I thank the participants in the roundtable for their most valuable contributions and assistance.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Australian Crime Commission Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,9,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-11,"—Labor welcomes the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. It is in effect a supplementary report to the inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude. Labor was pleased to work with the government recently to improve the legal regime so that federal law enforcement agencies can combat and counter the evil of trafficking for sexual servitude. We gave our support for the measures contained in the recent Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking In Person Offences) Act. However, the process of public consultation in the production of that bill—and I think this was made plain at the time—was completely inadequate and symptomatic of a government that is out of touch with the community. Had Labor simply passed the bill, as was this government’s original desire, we would have been left with a substandard set of protections that would have left Australia unprepared to fight against trafficking in persons.
However, on Labor’s insistence, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. As a result, a large number of improvements were made to the bill. Labor went on to support those amendments which the government sought to make to its own bill on the recommendations of that committee for the purposes of ensuring that there was a better outcome. In fact, there has been a better outcome as a consequence. In addition, Labor was successful in seeking an amendment to toughen the way the bill applied to instances of deceptive conduct when the language in which the deception occurs is a language other than English.
The committee report we have today makes three important recommendations. The first recommendation is that the ACC continue its involvement in law enforcement strategies against sexual servitude and trafficking in women. Labor supports this recommendation as experience in Europe and America has shown just how common a scourge this plague can be if it is not detected early and dealt with severely. Secondly, the committee recommended a review of the new legislation a year after its implementation. As part of that review, consideration should be given to amendments to include the provision of victim impact statements specific to those offences similar to those contained in the New South Wales Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004. I can announce to the parliament today that Labor will not only support this recommendation but also commit itself to delivering upon it. Labor stand strongly for the security of Australians and we support this principle as a means of securing Australian values. Thirdly, the committee recommended that the ANAO consider undertaking an evaluation of the results of the national action plan after three years of operation. Of course, the Auditor-General is independent of the executive, but we support this referral to the Auditor-General for consideration.
In conclusion, I want to thank the chair of the parliamentary joint committee and the work of the secretariat in providing the supplementary report. I was not a member of that committee when the original report was delivered, although I did take it upon myself to read that original report. The supplementary report is another example of the good work of a joint committee that commits itself to the improvement of legislation and the law in general and the work of the ACC. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2005-08-11,"—As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission and somebody who has had a passionate interest in this issue for some time, I just want to make a couple of additional remarks. As I think other members of the committee have said in the past and in here today, criminal gangs are involved in the worldwide trafficking process and we know that Australia is not immune. According to estimates from Interpol, trafficking is the second most profitable crime after drugs. A woman brought into Australia can incur a debt of $35,000 to their trafficker.
Although it is difficult to get accurate statistics on this because of the covert nature of the crime, statistics indicate that there are about 300 women trafficked into Australia every year for work in the sex industry. Although, again, it is difficult to get statistics on the industry, we believe that in Australia there could be up to 1,000 women working as sex slaves in the Australian sex industry. This committee has long had an interest in this issue. In fact, former Democrat Senator Brian Greig played a very strong and decisive role in our very first reference. I would like to acknowledge the work that former Senator Greig did on this committee in relation to this issue.
Earlier this year I undertook a study tour to South-East Asia and met with a number of agencies and NGOs in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia which are working with women who have been trafficked and who have returned to their countries and with women who are vulnerable to trafficking. I am sorry to say it is a very active industry in some of those countries. I would like to acknowledge the work of some of the NGOs which are trying to ensure that women are not placed in a vulnerable position in an industry such as this. I am very pleased to be a member of the committee that has carried out references on this issue, and I look forward to keeping a watching brief on it as we go through.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-11,"—I was interrupted while speaking yesterday on this disallowance motion on the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005. This is an important matter, and it is also an urgent matter. I remind the Senate, for those who are not aware, that the effect of these regulations is already in play. The legal effect occurs from the moment the regulations are gazetted, and for these regulations that occurred last month. As we speak, significant parts of Australia are now excised from the migration zone and, in relation to certain people, are no longer subject to aspects of the Migration Act. That occurs now, as we speak, and it will continue to occur until the moment that the Senate votes on it. If the Senate were to vote in favour of this motion to disallow, the regulations would then cease to have legal effect. So it is an urgent matter because the longer it takes to be resolved the more this iniquitous and unjustifiable situation continues. Unfortunately, because of the action of the Greens this morning in putting forward their issue without consultation with or notice to anyone, we will not get to vote on this today, so it will not be resolved until Tuesday, assuming there are no further unforeseen issues. It will remain standing at least until then.
Having said that, it is rather less likely than previously that this disallowance motion will be successful. This is, I think, the fourth time that the government has attempted by either legislation or regulation to excise large parts of Australian soil from the migration law, by excising them from the migration zone. Each previous time it has been struck down by the Senate, sometimes on my motion and sometimes by the chamber on the second reading vote on the legislation. Each time it has been clear that it has not been acceptable to the Senate to further expand this notion of exempting parts of Australia from the operation of the Migration Act.
What is different now is that the government has the majority in the Senate. It would require two government senators to take the very short walk across the floor to vote with the other senators—I am being a bit presumptuous but I am assuming that Labor will support this; they have in the past—for it to be successful. A single vote would give a tied vote, assuming that Senator Fielding votes on this side—and, again, I am not in a position to speak on his behalf. It will require at least a couple of government senators, if not three government senators, to vote with the opposition parties to enable this motion to be successful.
Nonetheless, I urge government senators to give the motion serious consideration. I started outlining the reasons yesterday. As we have until Tuesday before we vote on this, I urge all government senators to have a look at those genuine and important reasons. I draw government senators’ attention in particular to the Canberra Times. There has been a lot of commentary this week about what the world is going to be like under the new government controlled Senate. Will everything the government puts up just be waved through or will there be opportunity for the Senate to continue to operate as a genuine house of review? The Canberra Times said:
And if history, including the history of the last time the Coalition dominated the Senate, is any guide, there may well prove to be a group of generally loyal Government senators with a deep suspicion of handing unlimited power to executive government, likely to submit any proposals giving such power to very close scrutiny and perhaps amendment.
This is one of those times, because this measure gives unlimited power to executive government in a particular aspect of public policy. That is why this is such an important issue. Beyond the specifics of the impact it has on individuals caught up in it, or even the arguments from the other side about the alleged effect it has on deterring people smugglers—I do not believe there is any evidence that it does deter people smugglers, but others I am sure will put forward that case—we have to look at what we are doing in reality in putting forward measures like this even if, for the sake of argument, we say that they do have some effect on deterring unauthorised arrivals.
I might say, as I did yesterday, I support appropriate means of discouraging unauthorised arrivals, including asylum seekers, because it is not in their interests to get on dangerous boats, to go through uncertain processes, to have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to seek safety. They should have other opportunities. This measure does not give them other opportunities; it just denies them an existing opportunity and makes them more likely to be pushed in other directions, theoretically, even if it does have some impact. I do not wish to be accused by others who disagree with this motion that somehow by supporting this motion you support people smugglers. That is nonsense. We do need to ensure that asylum seekers are not in a position where they have to risk their lives. We need to work with other countries to give other viable opportunities. It is only because there is no genuine opportunity to get safety that these people have to go to these extreme measures and put their lives further at risk.
The fact is that the mechanism that is being chosen in this instance—apart from, in my view, not having any genuine impact, but that is perhaps a matter for debate—operates by giving unlimited power to executive government. We saw tabled in this chamber yesterday the Palmer report, which shows how extraordinarily badly the immigration department is handling the powers that it has under the Migration Act. That is an act that I criticise very heavily, an act that I believe is still being administered very poorly even as it stands in its flawed state.
This measure gives those same people, that same department, that same minister—and there has been a scathing report tabled in this place about the culture of that department and the major problems in its structure, its lines of authority and the way that operates—absolute power, unlimited power, to deal with people who arrive without visas in certain parts of Australia, completely outside any legal framework. That is the way the government likes it. Of course, every government loves to have absolute power. We all know the maxim—it is true, and that is why everybody knows it—that ‘absolute power corrupts absolutely’. That is why we have checks and balances. That is why we have things like courts. That is why we have things like independent mechanisms of appeal. Of course they are inconvenient, of course they take a bit of time, but they are to provide a check and balance, they are to provide a mechanism to attempt to ensure that you do not get the sorts of gross misuses of power that we have seen, that we all know happen now, even under the existing act.
The government says it wants to change the culture, and its first action, as soon as it gets the chance, is to give these people the ability to operate completely outside the act when they are assessing what to do with anybody that arrives without a visa in certain parts of Australia. It is an extraordinary move to suggest on the one hand that you are going to change the culture and make everything fairer, with due process and so on, when on the other hand your first act is to push forward a measure that in particular circumstances will enable these same people to operate without any scrutiny. Many senators would not know this, but I do, because I have been to Nauru, I have seen the people there, I have seen some of their cases, I have seen some of their papers: the people that did the assessment in Nauru were able to do that outside any legal framework at all, as will happen if this regulation goes through for people that arrive in the parts of Australia that are excised.
The assessments that are made for people who arrive in Australia are bad enough, and we know that, but the people making them know that their assessments are capable of being re-examined by an independent—or at least quasi-independent—body in the Refugee Review Tribunal. After that these people know that there is the prospect that their assessment might be examined by a court for lawfulness. At least they know somebody is going to be examining their paperwork independently. The people who did the assessments in Nauru knew that nobody was going to see them. The only other person who was going to see them, if there was an appeal, was someone else in the same section of the department, or someone else in the department again. There is no doubt that there was clearly therefore a much greater willingness to be far more sloppy. There were no legal requirements to meet; it was their own interpretation of the refugee convention.
This regulation, in effect, withdraws the refugee convention from the law of Australia. It does not deratify it, but it takes away its legal enforceability in Australia for these parts of Australia. That, I suggest, is completely the opposite of the way we need to go if we are genuinely trying to provide realistic alternatives to people who are seeking protection from persecution and who want to avoid the dangers and risks of people smugglers. It is a completely inappropriate move, and I very much urge coalition senators to recognise that it does hand unlimited power to executive government.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-08-11,"—I rise to indicate that the Greens support the disallowance motion because we do not agree with the government excising parts of Australia from our migration zone. In terms of what is being proposed by the government in this set of regulations, it is almost like the government have drawn a line through the middle of Australia and said, ‘Every island to the north of that is excised from the migration zone of Australia.’ So over in WA they have drawn the line just north of Geraldton and said, ‘Everything north of that is excised.’ On the east side of Australia, they have drawn a line just below Fraser Island and said, ‘Everything above that is excised from the migration zone.’ We do not agree with excising such significant areas of Australian territory from Australia’s migration zone.
This issue has been debated and Senator Brown has spoken much on this issue on previous occasions when the government has sought to excise particular islands from Australia. During one of those contributions in September 2001, Senator Brown highlighted to the chamber a media release which had been put out by the Law Council—a statement that they had made about these proposals to excise parts of Australia. I will remind the Senate of what that statement by the Law Council said. It was referring to a previous bill, but the same thing is being done in the migration amendment regulations. The Law Council said they:
... exclude parts of Australian territory from the operation of Australian law, because—
they—
prevent ... people who have landed in certain parts of Australia from accessing Australian law. Australia is a signatory to the Refugee Convention, and has undertaken to give effect to the obligations contained in the Convention. “It is contrary to the spirit of the Convention, and the operation of our legal system, that the legal rights of refugees are restricted or removed in certain parts of Australia”.
It is worth noting where this idea of excising certain parts of Australia from our migration zone came from. It is interesting to note that in the wake of the Tampa a proposal was put forward by Pauline Hanson in which she said, ‘Let’s convert Christmas Island into an island outside of Australia’s law.’ And do you know what happened? A week later the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, did that, taking up that suggestion from One Nation about excising parts of Australia from our migration zone. One other statement I would like to remind the Senate of was made on 5 November 2003 by the Regional Representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UNHCR. The regional representative said:
For us, a country’s a country within all its territory and any excision has absolutely no bearing on the obligation of the country to abide by its international obligations.
                  …         …           …
The denial to allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum in a country that has signed a convention would be a fundamental breach of international law, both under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Refugee Convention.
The Australian Greens do not support this ‘fundamental breach of international law’—in the words of the UNHCR—that the government is proposing in these regulations. We therefore support this disallowance motion and commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 6)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,12,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2005-08-11,"—I rise to speak in support of the migration amendment regulations. I would also like to make a contribution as to what the government’s views are of this attempt at disallowance. As this place would be well aware, this is not something that is particularly new. These regulations were properly tabled and introduced into this place. I understand they appeared on the DIMIA web site on 26 July. This has been quite a long process. These regulations are not a stand-alone issue. Border protection is a very sophisticated challenge and it needs very sophisticated answers.
In the fabric of the net of our border protection there are many planks and platforms that make up the whole. This particular aspect of regulation is part of that net. We have to continue to check the fibre of that net and we have to continue to upgrade it. We know that, apart from the partnerships, the Navy and Customs and their airborne assets, we need very strong regulation to act as a deterrent.
Principally, these regulations very clearly impact on only one group of people: they act as a deterrent to those people who choose to traffic in human misery. They are the people we are targeting. We are making sure that when they see Australia as a potential place to traffic in human misery, in human lives, they will look at these regulations and say: ‘It is simply too difficult. The Australian government have put everything in our way so we can no longer carry out this terrible practice.’ That is why the maintenance of these regulations is so absolutely important to our border protection and as a deterrent in these matters.
The other side have criticised us. They have said: ‘The Pacific solution has worked. Why would we possibly need these regulations?’ Relatively recently, before Christmas, we had a vessel turn up off the Tiwi Islands. We have had the issue of Gibson Farmer, an Indigenous person from the Tiwi Islands, who saw a boat arrive and acted in an appropriate manner as part of the partnerships aspect of this thread of border control we have in place. That once again demonstrated the very great need for this.
This government is a government who does consult widely in this matter. The parliament actually has a committee. The committee travelled around the islands of the north of Australia and we spoke to the people to whom it matters: the people from the land, the Indigenous people from those islands. Very interestingly, the response from those people was not a response that has been reflected by those on the other side and those who are seeking to support a disallowance on this matter. This is a critical matter. We have the evidence from those people living in those places who said, ‘We want this; we think this is important.’
I would like to quote Richard Gandhuwuy, who is a traditional owner on Elcho Island at Galiwinku. He is a principal member of an organisation called Mungbingagaruliapa. They look after the sea around that country. They have in their own traditional sense a very strong affiliation with border control and a very strong understanding of the consequences of not having good regulations and laws to protect the future of their country. This is what Richard had to say:
I would like to strongly support the new proposal—
he is referring to these particular regulations—
that the committee is looking into now that is going to be a part of the legislation to control the coast, especially in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. I would like to strongly support that legislation to go ahead and be approved by parliament and become a law, an act.
During those processes it became evident that the entire community was very, very supportive, principally because we have to have laws that deter people from coming to those places. Interestingly, another friend of mine, Terry Yumbulul, asked: ‘What about that cheeky maprill?’—maprill is an oyster and ‘cheeky’ means dangerous. He was referring to mytilopsis sallei, a very noxious, invasive marine pest. We know the awful cost of that around the world. It is not only those people who arrive and the misery that is traded. In terms of an environmental outcome, the very worst environment tragedies may come to this country on the hulls of those boats. Interestingly, I noticed that the senator supporting this disallowance motion, Senator Bartlett, was concerned about ‘the massive and uncontrolled degradation of our marine environment’ in question time yesterday. I think it is absolutely critical that we have a set of regulations that are not only going to protect our national interest but also going to protect the fundamentals of our environment.
The Indigenous people who own that land—the first Australians—have a say, and they have said: ‘I want the parliament to support these regulations. It is good for Australia and it is good for us. Will you please go down there and protect our country and put these regulations into place?’ Not only do we consult but we listen. I have been listening, and it seems that those on the other side who propose this disallowance have not been listening to the first Australians and obviously do not really care about their hypocrisy in looking like they are caring for the environment.
This is an essential piece of legislation to ensure not only that our environment is protected but also that our national sovereignty is protected and our borders are not seen by others to be the sorts of borders where you can casually wander in and out of the country. These are not porous borders. If you attempt to traffic human lives to Australia, you will be caught and you will be punished. In April this year, people said, ‘Our laws aren’t tough enough.’ You should tell that to the five people smugglers who have been convicted for, I think, nine years. That is the sort of message we need to send. It is all about messages. It is about sending the message that we are not open for business and we are not going to go soft on border protection, because that is the message that will stop people putting families, women and children onto boats and putting them in harm’s way—in the way of very awful sorts of harm. We have heard stories about vessels that did not make it here and those awful tragedies at sea. What a horrible way to die. These regulations are to ensure that these people do not leave the shore. Of course, because it is a sophisticated challenge—and we are a sophisticated government—we have put other plans in place to ensure that they do not leave.
There is another clear message: you do not have to leave. We have funded the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, to work with the UNHCR in Indonesia and in other countries to ensure that you do not have to make the trip to make an application as a refugee. We encourage you to do it there. There were some comments from a senator opposite that indicated, for some reason or another, that we are somehow in contravention of the convention on refugees. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have never refouled a refugee in the history of this government. We are very proud of that history, and I am very proud to stand here in this place and say that these regulations are an absolutely essential part. The last time that we actually had someone arrive near the shores of the Tiwi Islands we had to rush regulations back in because those on the other side were not listening to the Indigenous people and were not genuinely caring about protecting our borders and ensuring people did not leave to come to this place. We as a government continue not only to fulfil our obligations under the UN convention but also to ensure that people are cared for and have every opportunity to make the applications before they come to Australia.
This regulation only excises Australian islands, as Senator Nettle pointed out, pretty much from Mackay in the east to Exmouth in the west, because they are the places that have been identified as being most at risk. It is interesting to be reminded by the Democrats senator that this is the place of the states—that we should be very careful about how we conduct ourselves in this place, and not usurp power. I as a Territorian can tell you—and I am sure I share these views with the people from north-west Australia to North Queensland—that you are saying that very comfortably if you come from and represent other places in Australia, because it is okay down in Brisbane and Sydney. You are not facing the environmental nightmares that might break out. But that is not the case in the Northern Territory. If you cared about what this place is about—and it is about protecting the rights of all states and territories—you would care a bit about those states and territories that lie in the north of this country.
If these regulations are disallowed, it will clearly lead to people saying, ‘Australia is open for business.’ I am telling you right here and now that this government is sending a clear message: we are not open for business. The only people who are impacted by these regulations are the people who traffic in human misery. By default, anyone on the other side who tries to prevent that is supporting them. I think that is absolutely despicable. There is an opportunity now for the Labor Party to stand up and change their ridiculous stances of the past that have ignored Indigenous Australians. They have ignored the environment imperatives, they have ignored national sovereignty issues and they have ignored the national benefits that are going to come from this. I think this is absolutely essential. It is not too late to change your minds and support government on this very, very important regulation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 6)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,12,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-08-11,"—I rise to speak on the disallowance motion in the short time available to me. As speakers have said, these regulations that were enacted on 21 July 2005—that is, shortly after the government assumed control of the Senate—are regulations that we have seen before in the Senate in the form of both regulation and legislation. Labor oppose the decision by the government to excise the islands from the Australian migration zone. Unfortunately, in the time available to me, I will not be able to set out at length the reasons why we do so.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-11,"—It is now my pleasure to sum up on behalf of the government in respect of this bill. The Arts Legislation Amendment (Maritime Museum and Film, Television and Radio School) Bill 2005 provides flexibility for certain functions of the Australian National Maritime Museum and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. The amendments to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973 will provide more autonomy and flexibility for the school to make decisions on which degrees, diplomas and certificates will be awarded. The amendments to the Australian National Maritime Museum Act 1990 will provide greater flexibility in how museum entry charges can be fixed and will also clarify the museum’s power to fix charges for entry to special exhibitions and events. I thank Senate colleagues for their support for this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-11,"—I now sum up on behalf of the government in respect of the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Protection of Submarine Cables and Other Measures) Bill 2005. It creates a regulatory scheme to enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority to establish protection zones over submarine telecommunication cables that link Australia to global networks that are vital to the national economy. Nine submarine cables carry almost all of Australia’s overseas voice and data traffic and are worth more than $5 billion a year to the economy.
Submarine cables have been damaged several times in recent years and repairing broken or damaged cables is an expensive and time-consuming exercise. Furthermore, damaging Australia’s communication links with the rest of the world causes delays and unnecessary costs to everyone who relies on them. Within the protection zones, activities particularly dangerous to submarine cables will be prohibited. Other, less dangerous activities will be restricted. Once again, I thank senators for their support for the bill and commend it to the Senate.

That consideration of government business orders of the day No. 1 (Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and a related bill) and No. 2 (Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 and a related bill) be called on to enable second reading speeches to be made till not later than 2 pm.
I seek leave to make a short statement on the motion.
Leave granted.
—I am compelled to make these comments as a result of what Senator Brown said in the chamber earlier today when he said that the government, by granting him leave to move his motion on global warming, had effectively ceded control to the Greens in relation to the running of the Senate. I say at the outset that that displays an arrogance of which Senator Brown has been accusing the government in recent times. It is an arrogance which is quite outrageous when you consider the fact that we gave that leave to the Greens in good faith. We gave that leave so that the global warming issue could be debated, and that debate was, in any event, listed for later in the day, with a ministerial statement to be made by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell.
That resulted in a full debate being brought forward and an important issue such as global warming being debated in the Senate. If Senator Brown thinks that, by allowing that to be done, it is in some way ceding control to the Greens then he is sadly mistaken. But it does display an arrogance on his part, an arrogance and a disregard for the good faith which was extended to him by the government and also other parties in the Senate, because they did not deny him leave either. Anyone could have denied him leave. It is a lack of graciousness on his part, to say the least, in assuming such an arrogant approach. He was allowed the opportunity to debate the issue and then he criticised those people who gave him leave to do so. Here is a person who, when he cannot say something, will demand to have that right but, when he is given it, he criticises the very people who gave him that opportunity. That is hypocritical in the extreme. I want to place that on the record.
As far as these bills are concerned, I thank senators for the ability to deal with the speeches in the second reading debate. It means that valuable Senate time will be used to progress legislation and that we are on track in relation to our legislative program.
—You wasted this morning. It was your failure this morning, where you wasted all that time—two hours.
—Senator Carr did not hear what I said earlier and I think he should have.
—I heard it all right.
—Senator Carr should reflect on that, because I do not think he would want to associate himself with the comments made by Senator Brown. I do not think he would say that global warming was not an important issue and I do not think he could contradict the fact that the debate was set for later in the day anyway and would have been much shorter, due to the arrangements.
—Why did you give him leave, then?
—I might say that all parties in this chamber gave Senator Brown leave. No-one objected to it when he sought it. It was done in good faith. But if Senator Carr wants us to do away with the good faith we have exercised in this chamber for many years in the granting of leave we could well accommodate him whenever he seeks that in the future. I am sure he is not saying that, because his colleagues certainly abide by that good faith, and we will continue to do so. But if Senator Carr is intent on that then the record will show that.
There has been an important debate today, and I think that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, placed very squarely on the record the government’s position in relation to the issue and prevented any misconceptions from arising in the community as to where the government stood on this and where the proper arguments lay. To that extent, I think it was an invaluable debate and one where reason prevailed and the motion was defeated. We will now move on to second reading debates. It is understood that there will be no divisions called in the following period.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-08-11,"—When I commenced my remarks on the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 yesterday, I said that the government brings to this debate three basic principles which it says show the need for this legislation. The first is that industry and business needs should drive training. The second is that better training outcomes will be achieved through more flexible and accelerated pathways. The third is that processes should be simplified and streamlined. Today I want to commence by turning my attention to the second principle, as I have already outlined my views on the first.
The second principle is that better training outcomes would be achieved if there were more flexible and accelerated pathways. It may assist us to decode that government statement a bit. What the government are really saying is that, faced with a skills crisis of their very own making, through taking their eye off the main game by reducing funding, they now want to overcome this by cutting back on the amount of training a person receives. As I pointed out to some constituents recently, the free trade agreement with the United States seems to have delivered little except US style industrial relations. Are we now going to see what a free trade agreement with China is about delivering—perhaps Chinese style occupational health and safety? That should be of real concern to all.
At the heart of the changes that the government is proposing in this legislation there is an attempt to throw away the rule book that has covered trades training in this country for over 100 years. Make no mistake about it: flexible training and accelerated pathways mean a reduction in the duration of apprenticeships, wholly and solely. What employer wants a tradesperson with an abbreviated training and work program, I wonder? Do those opposite really assert that the way to make vocational training more effective is to reduce the amount of time that it takes to teach? Instead of having properly trained and accredited tradespeople, do they want to inflict underprepared and undertrained workers onto the Australian economy? Where is the benefit in that?
This principle, like the first one, smacks of short-term solutions to the long-term problems facing the Australian economy. You do not address a skills shortage after it arrives by curtailing training. To do so risks not only our economic position but the lives of Australians at work, due to inadequately trained workers. If this proposal is as sound as the government pretends, if this principle is so effective, where is the legislation that extends this principle to occupations other than the trades? Where are the flexible and accelerated pathways for, say, lawyers—a profession those opposite are most familiar with—doctors, accountants or even engineers? They do not exist for the simple reason that this is not about more effective training leading to a more flexible work force. This legislation is about churning out inadequately trained tradespeople to overcome skills shortages.
The final principle that those opposite cite is that the changes are needed to streamline and simplify the process. What they are really saying about the new streamlined and simplified process is this: ‘If you do not do what we want, we will not sign an agreement, and without an agreement there will be no funding.’ That is pretty streamlined and simplified, isn’t it? It is pretty simple when you put it in those terms. There is no consultation with stakeholders and no interest in working in partnership. The attitude is: ‘Do what we tell you to or no money.’ This is about a grab for power by the minister and some of the bureaucrats in Canberra to curtail the states’ management of vocational education. There is no argument that, where inefficiencies exist in the development of a skilled labour force, the Commonwealth should be taking the lead. That is a proposition we all agree with. ANTA and the funding arrangements previously in place did not work against overcoming those inefficiencies. That is something those opposite do not seem to understand.
What we now find is that the Commonwealth has decided unilaterally that the states are no longer to have any power in the relationship. Although the states provide more than 70 per cent of the funding, the Commonwealth is setting itself up to be able to veto any funding unless there is an agreement between the states concerned and the Commonwealth. What this will mean is that public servants in Canberra, remote from the state—whichever state—and the actual conditions in the local labour market, are going to have more say in what will and will not be offered as vocational education than the relevant state bodies. Whilst I have a great deal of admiration for the professionalism of the bureaucracy in Canberra, I am not convinced that they have the expertise necessary to come up with a suitable way of addressing the unique needs of the labour market and the skills shortages in the north-west of Western Australia. We saw only yesterday that it snows in Canberra, for a start! It is very removed from the north-west of my home state.
To argue that the states should be effectively shut out of determining their own vocational training needs at the risk of having the Commonwealth government refuse funding is an attack on our very Federation. The fact that states have different vocational training needs should come as no surprise to any Australian. In Western Australia, for example, the requirements for skilled labour are very different from elsewhere. For example, there is no motor vehicle construction industry in Western Australia; therefore—and this should come as no surprise—there is no vocational training offered. With our resources sector booming, the requirement for skilled workers in Western Australia is completely different to that of states such as Victoria or Tasmania. I say to those opposite: it is time that we reject this blatant grab for power—a grab for power that will withhold funding unless the states agree with the Commonwealth as to what constitutes vocational education priorities. The Commonwealth needs to prove that they are aware of the varying needs of the states before they go about setting uniform priorities.
The basis of our Federation is a sharing of power between the states and the Commonwealth. What this legislation does is shift the balance of power to the Commonwealth at the expense of the states. That it does so at a time of national skills shortages illustrates the short-sighted outlook of this government, a government that is prepared to make these radical changes to an agreement reached between the states and itself—an agreement that, now the government has the numbers in this place, it does not find suitable. That now offers the states no consultation. There will be no consultation in this, just a ‘take it or leave it’ approach that places more power in the hands of the minister.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,16,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-08-11,"—I join my colleagues on the government side in debating the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and its associated bill, the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. These bills will establish the new national training system. The government believes these bills are very necessary, for—despite the best efforts of the industry and the government itself over the past nine years, going on 10—there have been too many key issues that have not been addressed by the states and territories because of their different qualifications and regulations in the area of training.
I note the remarks of the speakers on the other side of the house, particularly Senator Webber. She dubbed this ‘a grab for power’. Far from being a grab for power, it is fixing a system that is broken. She and others opposite highly exaggerate the states’ resistance to this reform. In fact, the states quite understand and have signed up to it. They are not nearly as resistant as the Labor Party would have us believe. They have signed up to the uniform training system because they know that in the end that is what is really needed to meet the future challenges. It is accepted by this government, all industries and those on the other side of the house that there is a shortage of skills. We have to meet that challenge with reform, with a uniform training system.
Although those on the other side object to the principle of this reform, they are in fact going to end up voting for it anyway. Nevertheless, in all their speeches in debates in this house they give evidence that the Labor Party have reform fatigue. That is quite an achievement in opposition. They are a party that have reform fatigue in opposition. The Labor Party object to any and every reform that is necessary—even those that the states have signed up to. There is no reform that the federal Labor Party will support.
From the very first days when we came into government in 1996, we recognised that there was a skills shortage, particularly but not exclusively in the area of the trades. It was a product of several factors—some short term and some long term. When we first came into government it was quite obvious that the then apprenticeships scheme had been allowed to run down, that the incentives for employers to take up apprentices and for that matter for apprentices to take on a four-year apprenticeship had been allowed to run down and they simply were not there anymore. Take-up had become very unattractive for both sides.
To this end, the government immediately introduced the New Apprenticeships scheme, stimulating the incentive for both the employer and the newly signed on apprentice. On the apprenticeship side we have several new and enhanced incentives for the apprentice to sign up, none less than extending the youth allowance and Austudy to new apprentices. There is also the tool kit allowance which we announced at the last election, which is no small amount—it is some $800. Also, the Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship was introduced and an additional 5,000 places in the New Apprenticeships scheme were funded by this government.
On the employer side, the government enhanced the payments for the employer on the signing up of the apprentice and on graduation, so there has been a beefing up of the apprenticeships scheme, and it has been successful to that end. Also, the effect on the skills shortage was felt very much during the Labor Party’s period in government in the early nineties, when there was a collapse. It was not just the apprenticeships scheme which they totally ignored; it was also the economy, which probably had the major effect on the skills shortage that we are suffering from today.
During the years of the recession, from 1991 to 1993, there was a collapse in the take-up of apprenticeships. That is no surprise; that is a product of the economy. In 1992, there were some 143,000 apprentices. That number dropped to 122,000 within one year. By 1994, the number was 107,000. You can see the effect of an economy that is not growing at a reasonable rate—that is, employers who have lost confidence in the economy and lost contracts will not take up apprentices. It is commonsense. It is obvious that governments, Labor or coalition, have a responsibility to soundly manage the economy so that people, including new entrants into the work force and apprentices, can get a job.
The ‘recession we had to have’ was a manufactured recession that threw people, including apprentices, onto the unemployment heap. Had we not had that irresponsible management of the economy, we may have less pressure on trades and skills today, because those people who would have been in training would now be in the trades. We would have had a greater number. You cannot deny that the management of the economy has a major effect on skills take-up. As I have proven, and as the figures show, when we got a turnaround in the economy from about 1996 to now—we have had nine years of sustained growth—the number of apprenticeships, because of market demand, immediately increased.
The skills shortage we have today does not relate just to the legacy of the previous government and the previous state of the economy. In fact, on the other side of the coin, we are in many ways a victim of our own success. Today, unemployment is at a record low—the lowest level in some 30 years. We have an unemployment rate of five per cent and we seek to better that. As a victim of our own success, naturally, we have a supply and demand problem. Now employers are out there looking for those skilled tradesmen and, of course, they are not there. To that end, the government have reacted. As I said, first of all, we enhanced the incentives offered by and the attractiveness of the New Apprenticeships scheme. We have further increased our skilled migration places by more than 20,000 this year—around 95,000 skilled migrants are eligible to apply. That will take pressure off the problem we have, but it is only a short-term solution, and the government seeks to put in place a long-term solution.
—What is the long-term solution?
—I will give you the long-term solution, Senator Crossin, and it is one I would like to hear you support because, at this stage, the Labor Party are all over the shop on what I think is one of the best policies this government have sought to introduce—that is, the introduction of 24 technical schools to begin with. We are still not quite sure whether the Labor Party support us or not.
One of the long-term effects of today’s skills shortage goes right back to the early eighties with the abolition of the tech schools. The effect of this decision is felt today. Because of some mad reasoning then, it was believed that people in the trades should not have their own establishment and should not be in a stand-alone school. I have to admit that it seems in retrospect that there was a cultural cringe attached to this by the states. I believe that all states made this decision.
—That is just not true!
—So many have missed out because of that cultural cringe. This government believe that we ought to reverse that disastrous decision and reintroduce the tech schools.
—Did you go to school? Maybe that is the problem. You didn’t go to school!
—Senator Carr is interjecting. Neither he nor any other speaker opposite has mentioned the policy of technical schools. It can only lead you to believe they do not support it. They do not support the reintroduction of technical schools to tackle this country’s skills shortage in the long term. We are going to reverse that cultural cringe.
—Not until 2011!
—You had 13 years. If you saw any benefit in it, why didn’t you do something about it then? If you support technical schools, why don’t you support the legislation?
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator McGauran, ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair. I request that senators on my left cease interjecting.
—As the Minister for Education, Science and Training has said in the other chamber on numerous occasions, not everyone is destined to study for a university degree. With the establishment of these technical schools, those that may have felt that they should have gone to university and done some Mickey Mouse course which they were not suited to now have an opportunity and a choice—and those on the other side cringe when it comes to any sort of choice.
The other solution to meet the skills shortage in this country is the market itself. The market will play a role in meeting this country’s skills shortage. The government seeks to underpin it in the ways that I have addressed, but supply and demand will also sort out the skills shortages over the long run. It will simply become very attractive to become a plumber, a carpenter and the like. It will simply become attractive by way of pay. Let us not leave the market solution out of this problem.
I want to return briefly to the question of technical schools, because that is what seems to really burn those on the other side. The government seeks to introduce 24 technical schools for years 11 and 12—
—It will be six years before you get a graduate. Six years!
—Well, they are well and truly in place. The minister handling this, Gary Hardgrave, has been to every chosen site. He has accelerated this policy. And rest assured, Senator Crossin, if you think there is any doubt this is not going to happen, or you wish it would not happen, that it will—and it will meet the timetable that the minister has put out. Some 7,200 students taking up years 11 and 12 will go to these colleges. And I note that one will be set up in Bendigo in Victoria, Senator Carr—do you have any objection to that? I suspect you have.
—Where is one in the northern suburbs of Melbourne?
—Most of these colleges—
—Where is one in the northern suburbs?
—Order!
—You wouldn’t know where the northern suburbs were!
—Order! Senators, please cease interjecting. Senator McGauran, if you direct your comments through the chair and not to the senators on the other side of the chamber, we may have more order in the chamber.
—How rude!
—How rude? I think I was a little ruder before when I gave you the wave. These colleges will be located in many different regions, some metropolitan and some rural and regional. As I said, Bendigo will be one of those chosen places. In conclusion, I recommend that people read this booklet. I would have liked to refer to it in the time available to me but, given the interjections from the other side and the excitable state that Senator Carr is in at the moment, I would recommend that he get hold of this booklet. In fact, I would be more than happy to table the booklet. Senator Carr should read it, instead of interjecting and trying to stifle debate on what is non-controversial legislation involving the government’s reform of technical colleges. As I said, this is a party that has reform fatigue in opposition. That is unheard of. It is quite an achievement. I congratulate you! What is your policy for meeting the skills shortages? I invite the next speaker from the Labor Party to address that question.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,16,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-08-11,"—I will not take up the time of the Senate by trying to respond to that ramble—that rage—that we heard for the past 15 minutes. I want to speak about these two bills, the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. Sadly, these bills are a clear demonstration of how out of touch this government is with the needs of industry in this country. For nine long years it has ignored the skills issues and the skills needs of the nation. It is not that this is something new; it is not that it is something that came up yesterday that the government suddenly had to respond to; this issue has been consistently raised in this parliament, by people on this side of the chamber, for the past nine years. We have consistently pointed out what was occurring with skilled tradespeople in this country. The NCVER has consistently put out reports pointing out the decline in the number of skilled tradespeople in this country and this government has simply ignored it.
This government has tried for nine years to look at quick fixes. It has introduced new systems, new apprenticeships and traineeships—all tricked up for no other reason than to boost the numbers, to create the illusion out there amongst the general public that it was dealing with the skills shortage and the skills crisis. It has done nothing whatsoever. It has not even put a dent in the skills needs of this country. And now, after trying every shoddy trick in the book to look good, it has suddenly found it has to try and do something serious about addressing this issue. And what has it done? It has introduced these bills, which represent an intrusion into the autonomous operation of the VET system. It is going to force TAFE institutions in our country—that have been there for a very long time, that have met the training needs of our skilled work force in this country over a very long time—to adopt the Howard government’s agenda of forcing AWAs out into the work force as a condition of funding. It is threatening to cut funding to TAFE institutions if they are insufficiently entrepreneurial.
Here we see again a government that is so obsessed with its industrial relations reform agenda that, since it has not been able to get it taken up voluntarily amongst the work force, is now using funding arrangements—ones that go to the heart of training our kids in how to be skilled tradespeople in the community and make a contribution to the economy—to force an ideological agenda onto the states, for another purpose entirely. It is doing it in training. It has done it in the building industry, by insisting that its ideological agenda is picked up in the building industry for any contracts that the Commonwealth introduces. It is simply a form of blackmail of various sections of the community to force them into driving the Howard government’s ideological agenda.
Labor will oppose these bills in their current form and will propose amendments to deal with the more contentious elements of the legislation. But I want to say up-front that I am concerned, because back in June the Senate referred these bills to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee for inquiry—a legitimate thing to do. The committee was due to meet to consider evidence and hear witnesses last Monday, 1 August, but that meeting was cancelled. It was cancelled because we were deliberately denied a quorum so that we could not proceed with the hearing. We could not proceed with the hearing despite the fact that the committee had made a decision to hear witnesses in respect of this issue.
We still believe the Senate needs to take a good, hard look at these bills. We still believe that people should have the right to come and present evidence to that committee on the implications of these bills for them, particularly in light of the linking of the industrial relations agenda to funding to the states for TAFE colleges. But we were denied the right to do that. The witnesses were denied the right to come along and speak to their submissions to the inquiry, denied the right to come along and put their point of view. The report on this bill that was presented in this chamber was simply written having regard to the submissions that were received by the secretariat—not good enough. It is not good enough at all having regard to a bill that is so far reaching in its implications as this bill is. It is treating the Senate with contempt to deny its committees the right to hear witnesses put their evidence on these sorts of bills and to deny committees the opportunity to question witnesses on the evidence that they have presented before them.
These skilling Australia’s work force bills that are before us are named for a reason: Australia is facing a skills crisis. The national skills shortage list has 26 trades listed. From metal fabricators to furniture upholsterers and from carpenters to chefs, we have a shortage of workers to do jobs that are vital to our economy. And this is starting to bite. As an example, the Housing Industry Association trade contractor price index has found that over the last 12 months the cost of hiring bricklayers has risen by 22.6 per cent and the cost of hiring plumbers has risen by 17.3 per cent; roofing contractors, up 9.5 per cent; site preparation, up 15.2 per cent; painters, up 7.2 per cent; and general builders, up 3.8 per cent. What is that going to do? At the end of the day, it will drive up the price of housing in our community and make it again more unaffordable for young people trying to get a start in life, get a roof over their heads and start a family.
We all know that when skilled tradespeople are scarce the cost of hiring goes up and that cost is passed on, ultimately, to consumers. This has been caused simply by the neglect of the Howard government. They have turned away something like 270,000 people from the TAFE system since John Howard and Peter Costello came to power. In the same time, however, they have imported 178,000 skilled migrants. That tells you something about the long-term planning this government put into dealing with policy issues. It is the quick fix: they allow the crisis to occur and then simply try to apply the quick fix as a solution.
The other day I heard an interview, I think on Radio National, with the editor of Computerworld, who indicated that, among these 178,000 skilled migrants who have been allowed into the country, there are something like 5,000 computer technicians now operating in the city of Sydney. He went on to say they are being paid low wages—way below what is being paid to computer programmers or computer technicians who are living in this country. They are out of India, by the way, in the main. They are being forced into overcrowded accommodation and their families are being paid subsistence allowances of $100 a month back in India. We are seeing people being imported as cheap labour to compete with Australians under the guise of skill shortages. The skill shortage is being used in a number of areas to simply exploit workers by bringing them into this country and using them as cheap labour—not unsurprising. It is not unsurprising when you look at this government’s industrial relations agenda, because they actually want to force all Australians into the position of being cheap labour under their new industrial relations reform agenda.
My further evidence of the government’s harebrained approach to VET lies in the comically bad New Apprenticeships scheme. Back in June, survey results were finally released—after a very long time badgering the minister to do so; they got them in February—that revealed that the Howard government’s New Apprenticeships scheme is not meeting the needs of apprentices during a time of national skill shortages. What were some of the survey’s findings? Only 35 per cent of people who completed an apprenticeship were looking for work in the same industry or area after that apprenticeship. Twenty-one per cent of apprentices surveyed said that the skills they learned in the apprenticeship were not useful or not very useful. One-third of people who completed an apprenticeship but were not working in that industry area said that the apprenticeship was of little or no use. Nearly 30 per cent of existing workers who completed a new apprenticeship said that the apprenticeship did not improve their job security. Forty per cent of apprentices do not even complete their apprenticeships.
This is a damning indictment of the training performance of the Howard-Costello government. Yet, with this further contributor to the skills crisis staring them in the face, this government cannot do the sensible thing and adopt Labor’s $2,000 trade completion bonus to ensure our apprentices get their qualifications and go on to work.
The Howard government, as I have already said, has declared war on the education staff unions like the TAFE teachers federation and the Public Service Association. The government is setting out to force TAFEs to adopt AWAs and performance based pay. This will create conflicts between the government’s demands and the responsibilities of TAFEs under their enterprise agreements. Peter Costello has told us he wants to see the AWA as the primary mode of engagement of labour. What he did not tell us, however, was that he is willing to force it down the throat of every worker in this country.
On that side of the chamber, they consistently talk about choice. They talk about choice in terms of voluntary student unionism. They talk about choice in terms of superannuation. But when it comes to the form of contract under which you will work for your employer, choice goes out the window. What they are clearly saying to the TAFE colleges, what they are clearly saying to business and what the secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has been saying to his own staff is that you will have no choice about the form of industrial contract that you are engaged under; that you will sign up to an AWA and you will take the AWA or you will not get the job.
That is the new form of industrial relations in this country proposed under the Andrews bill—it is as simple as that. Of course, it is difficult for them to do it in the context of people who are currently in the work force. But we all know that, over time, the work force will roll over and gradually that disease will creep into the system like a cancer and become the norm across most workplaces, at least for a period of time anyway. That is the agenda that is being driven here and that is why we are consistently seeing the use of funding arrangements for education, building contracts or what have you being clearly connected to the implementation of the government’s industrial relations agenda. They are using funding as a form of coercion.
To avoid funding cuts, TAFEs will have to increase their user choice to improve flexibility and competition. TAFE directors will have increased institutional authority that will force them to take on the recruitment and remuneration of staff, try to generate and retain alternative sources of revenue and develop commercial business plans to allow government funding to be reduced. This is simply forcing the devolution of responsibility. TAFEs will have to adopt programs of competency based training. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry supports competency based training but, otherwise, opinions are divided within the vocational education and training sector.
These bills also abolish the Australian National Training Authority, the body that was responsible for the oversight, approval and coordination of training packages and programs and for putting a national structure on our training regime. ANTA has been part of a national training program and has been very successful in responding to the needs of industry because it had industry players involved, including representatives of workers. ANTA did not get the axe because it was in some way deficient or dysfunctional; it has been given the axe because of the Howard government’s attitude to funding VET. The first ANTA agreement provided a partnership between the states and the Commonwealth where the states maintained their levels of funding while the Commonwealth added growth funds to build the sector. The change of government in 1996 brought a change of attitude, abolishing growth funding and implementing successive funding cuts. Growth funding was re-established in the 2001-03 agreement, but the gap has created an $833 million funding gap. The Commonwealth is nearly a billion dollars behind where they should have been in the normal course of events. ANTA is being axed because of the Commonwealth’s refusal to come to a sensible position on growth funding for the 2004‑06 agreement.
When you consider the skills crisis that was well and truly known about during that period, the states are right to say that there was a need for a considerably increased investment in vocational education and training. They are right to say to the government that it needs to do something serious about skills and invest in the system that we already have. The Commonwealth is refusing to make a substantial investment in our national training system.
I now comment briefly on the Australian technical colleges. Instead of committing funds to a system that already works, the government is committed to setting up a completely new and completely redundant vocational education and training system under the guise of Australian technical colleges. Labor will comment further about these in later debates. I will say this: not one single fully qualified tradesperson will pass from the doors of an Australian technical college until at least 2008. Not one metalworker, not one builder, not one chef, not one hairdresser—all areas that currently have pressing skills crises—will come out of an Australian technical college for at least the next three years. That is not the way I suggest we should deal with the skills crisis in the short term or the longer term. Does anyone seriously suggest that having technical colleges that are going to deal with year 11 and 12 students—and there are to be 24 of them, yet nowhere near that number have been established—is the way to handle the skills crisis that confronts this country? They will not even put a dent in the crisis that currently exists.
There was an opportunity for this government to build on a number of skills centres situated around the country. If Minister Hardgrave had really been interested, he could have driven 10 minutes from his office in his own electorate, gone to the building industry skills centre and seen the sort of structure necessary to train 3½ thousand apprentices a week for the building industry. It can not only do that but also can provide training for staff working for individual contractors in the building industry. That was the model that, if it had been followed, would have provided a substantial boost to the number of apprentices in training in this country. Instead, we have a system that will not even deliver a dent to the problem.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,16,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-08-11,"—I am glad that Senator McGauran is still in the chamber and stayed there for your speech, Senator Campbell. He might have learnt something about Australia’s vocational education and training system—something which his speech demonstrated that he knows absolutely nothing about.
The Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 together repeal the ANTA Act that was put in place in 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act of the same year. This effects the abolition of ANTA and of the current funding arrangements, inadequate as they are, for the Commonwealth grants to states and territories for vocational education and training. These bills provide for transitional arrangements for the transfer of the ANTA functions to DEST and for a new funding framework for grants for the triennium 2005-08. Commonwealth grants make up about a third of public funding of VET in Australia, funding through the states and territories to support them as providers and administrators of VET. The Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill establishes a new funding framework and, unfortunately, takes the place of the Australian National Training Authority.
Shortly after winning the 2004 election, less than 12 months ago, the Prime Minister unilaterally announced that ANTA was to be abolished and previous responsibilities held by that training body would be taken over by the Department of Education, Science and Training. These bills put that decision in place. It is interesting to note that that decision was never announced during the federal election campaign; it was not something that was made public then. It is another classic example of how what this government says—or does not say—during an election campaign can be revealed in the way in which it seeks to change the landscapes of certain industries in this country, one being the education industry, just a few days after the federal election. It was not an announcement that people in this country knew about or were able to make a decision about in the lead-up to 9 October last year.
ANTA has been responsible for distributing Commonwealth grants and steering the national direction of vocational education and training in this country. It played a central role in what was supposedly a collaborative framework for the VET system—collaborative in that it was between the three partners involved in vocational education and training: the employers, the employees and the trade union movement, and the governments. There were definite signs that this collaborative framework was under stress with the breakdown of negotiations for the ANTA agreement in previous years, particularly in 2003 and 2004, and the Commonwealth decision to use some funds to fund providers directly. However, the decision to abolish ANTA was unexpected and was not taken in consultation with the states and territories. This was not altogether surprising, however, as this government had long taken to grandstanding and pointscoring against the states and territories. This is a government that cares more for power and control than it does for collaboration, national training or the skills shortage this country now faces.
Having cut funds to TAFE in its first two budgets after coming to power, it refused any growth funds from then on. I think it would be fair to say that the states and territories, at the ministerial meetings, had come to loggerheads year after year because of the refusal by this government to recognise that there was a need to build growth funds into the states and territories funding agreement for vocational education and training and to meet the unmet demand in this industry. Without growth funds, the states and territories were not going to sign up to a funding agreement that pegged them at a level of funding that was years old. The recognition that there was no need to include growth funding in the agreement and a lack of recognition by this government in saying it was not prepared to fund the unmet demand was enough for the states and territories to say, ‘Forget it. We are not going to sign on the dotted line of this agreement.’
The skills shortage was on the way, manufactured by this mean, penny-pinching government. So Australia now faces a chronic skills crisis, a crisis which has been the subject of a report produced by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee and a crisis that has come about because of the complete failure of this government’s policy. These bills continue the government surge towards further centralised control of education and training by taking the role of the former ANTA out of the way in which it was established and placing it into the hands of the Department of Education, Science and Training. The new funding arrangements propose an unprecedented level of Commonwealth legislative prescription over VET in the government’s ongoing attempt to force its agenda onto the states and territories. These are some of the conditions under which Labor cannot support the proposals in this legislation.
The main item is the proposal to force TAFE colleges to offer Australian workplace agreements. Neither ideological workplace relations philosophy nor the government’s IR crusade has any place in legislation that funds education and training—not in the vocational education and training sector and not in higher education. Labor will not support the bill with this requirement included in it. It was put to me yesterday when I spoke to some TAFE teachers I know, having been involved with the Australian Education Union’s national TAFE teachers executive for many years, that this is a government that now wants to use students to drive a wedge between its ideological agenda in funding vocational education and training and implementing its industrial relations reform.
The requirement to fund TAFE colleges only if they offer Australian workplace agreements to their staff does not have the interests of students at heart, and it does not have the interests of this country’s skill shortage at heart. This government has no place dictating to TAFE colleges or to TAFE employers the manner and nature of industrial relations conditions which they offer to their staff. This is a government that will repeat, day after day—they are key lines now, driven down their throats by the Prime Minister and his campaign team—‘choice’ and ‘flexibility’. ‘Freedom of choice’ they champion. ‘Flexibility’ they champion. In fact, they would say that one of the main reasons for their new IR changes is that they want total flexibility in the work force. There is no total flexibility and there is no choice inherent in these bills if TAFE colleges and TAFE providers cannot access funds unless they offer their employees Australian workplace agreements. What if a TAFE college does not want to do that? What if a TAFE college like Holmesglen in Victoria has an enterprise agreement in place that is working well. What does it mean for that TAFE college?
This is a government that is hypocritical, to the very last word, in the way it implements its policy. On the one hand it champions choice and on the other hand it produces legislation that says, ‘You can only get this funding if you offer your staff Australian workplace agreements.’ Who suffers as a result of this? Students will suffer. They are being used as the wedge. This is what we have instead of a vocational education and training system that is visionary, that has a long-term plan, that puts students front and centre of the outcomes—and, with them, industry—and that government supports. But we do not have that under this government. We believe that a successful national training program needs the tripartite involvement of government, industry and workers with students. With the abolition of ANTA, we believe that such a tripartite system is gone. What is proposed by this government does not, by any stretch of the imagination, honour these principles.
I am quite disturbed about the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority. Let us look back at why the Australian National Training Authority was put in place. As the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee on this bill states, in 1990 the Deveson committee made recommendations to allow market forces some influence on the training agenda. That was followed a year later by the now very infamous Finn and Mayer committee reports that recommended the convergence of general and vocational training and the development of six key competencies areas. Where did this come from? It came from a group of people who went over to Germany, you may well remember, and out of that came the visionary document Australia reconstructed. That document said basically that Australian skill and wage levels were very low and that we needed to restructure awards, provide people in this country with a career base, improve their salary level and combine that with training. So the way you moved up your career path was to get some training.
There was an enormous amount of work done in that decade to restructure awards. I know that Senator George Campbell and people involved in the blue-collar industries put an enormous amount of time and effort into restructuring the categories of classifications in the awards and aligning them with competency standards, encouraging the training system to get on board, getting industry involved, and writing competency standards and the module framework so that there would be a total package to improve the work force and the wages in this country.
I have recently come back from a two-week trip to China. I went to Shanghai and Beijing, and I spent a week in Chongqing. In Chongqing we have a group of Australians who are implementing the current way—not the proposals under these bills but the current way in which vocational education and training in this country works. The Chinese government have long looked to Germany for influence for their vocational education and training system. It was one of the best in the world. We went to Germany back in the 1990s and had a look at what was happening. Now China has turned to Australia. People said to me when I met with them—professors and principals of TAFE colleges in Chongqing—‘We are turning to Australia because you do it the best now. You have taken what Germany does, and you developed it further. We are impressed with your module based curriculum, your competency based standards, the way you get industry on board with ITABS, and the way you have unions and employees involved.’
We have got a $20 million AusAID project in Chongqing. We have Australian TAFE teachers going over there and teaching Chinese vocational education and training colleges about our VET system. In fact, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, Gary Hardgrave, was there on 5 and 6 August and put out a press release chanting about the work that is being done by Australians. That will not exist under these bills. If we are so proud to export that as an education, training and development industry overseas—so proud that we can even send our minister to a South-East Asian vocational education and training conference in Chongqing to champion it—why do we want to so radically change it by the abolition of ANTA and the forced introduction of Australian workplace agreements in TAFE colleges that will now be dependent on that for funding? What has brought about the need for this dramatic change? When I ask myself that question, I can only say that it is the backward-looking philosophical outlook of this government that wants to drive up skills shortages in this country, drive down training, drive down any initiatives that our TAFE teachers have developed after 15 years of this system.
The shadow minister in the other place gave an account of the history of ANTA, and I have just given some as well. Some of the people that I know who worked at ANTA were the best not only in this country but in the world—as I discovered when I went to China. Bruce McKenzie from Holmesglen TAFE has been there. Paul Byrne is about to go up there. Moira Scollay, who was in charge of ANTA; Peter Nolan and Julius Rowe—all of those people who have been involved in the establishment and the drive behind ANTA—were people with vision. They were people who actually took our vocational training and education sector forward to sit beside higher education in this country and become an equal partner.
It is a shame that this government is now hell-bent on undoing the good work that was done during that 15 years. Those days will be gone; gone will be the collaboration, cooperation and negotiations. Through the control of funds, the Howard government, wherever and whenever it can, will bully the states and territories into accepting central control and unwanted workplace conditions and will do whatever else it takes to put in place its ideological philosophy.
ANTA was set up following a period of open negotiation with stakeholders, as I said, and it will be abolished without a word. When ANTA was initially established by the Labor government, the funding for VET included $720 million in additional funds over the 1993-95 triennium. If this government were to allow for similar growth, there would be an additional $925 million in today’s dollars for the next three years. Instead, the vocational education and training system gets virtually nothing new. There is just a reallocation of existing funds. There is still no growth funding being offered.
It is absolutely no wonder that under this government tens of thousands of young Australians have missed out due to the lack of TAFE places and we now have a massive national skills shortage. In 1998 there was an unmet demand for 44,400 TAFE places. In 2003 that rose to 45,900. In the nine years of this government—nine years too many, as far as I am concerned—it has done nothing to drive down the unmet demand, create new TAFE places and address the fact that each year hundreds of young Australians who want to do a vocational education and training course cannot because the places do not exist.
If I had another 20 minutes I could talk about the Australian technical colleges, but I think that will be subject to a bill next week. They are not the answer. In the Northern Territory we will be lucky if we can get 150 people into what is going to be the Australian technical college in Darwin. That technical college is going to coexist with secondary colleges. You have to ask why they did not just expand the vocational education and training program in secondary schools, if that is to be the case. A new, discrete building of bricks and mortar is not going to be built in the Northern Territory. There is no demand for that.
That is the problem—this government has not undertaken any skills analysis. I know the Chamber of Commerce did an analysis some years ago, but it must be out of date, and I do not think it goes to looking at a national picture. Where do we need the skills in this country? Which regions need certain occupations and young kids to pick up skills as fitter and turners, mechanics or chefs? We do not know; we are guessing. We are going to plonk 24 technical colleges in the most marginal Liberal seats in this country and hope to God we win the election. But we are not going to do anything about addressing the skills shortages region by region.
A lot of very skilled tradespeople go to the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia and operate that facility. When the next job comes up, they all move to it like bumblebees. The last one would have been Bechtel in the Northern Territory. We do not ensure that when the jobs are finished the skills remain in that community. We do not have a strategic plan under this government to build up a comprehensive skills base region by region so that they are there for years to come.
Not that this government really care. They believe that it is not their fault and still want to blame the Labor Party. The Labor Party is not to blame. We had one of the most imaginative and innovative vocational education and training systems in the world, which is now being recognised by places like China. They would say it is the fault of the states and territories. That is the catchcry of this government—it is everybody else’s fault but theirs. They would say it is the fault of another government or another agency. It is common for them to blame the unions or the workers; the real blame lies with anyone but the Howard government.
I have some really good friends in the Australian Education Union—TAFE workers who give more than their day’s work to ensure that students in this country complete those outcomes and that we have a module based curriculum and competency based training. They will walk away from this. They will not tolerate being forced onto AWAs, because that has nothing to do with the good quality work that they now offer. This government knew a skills shortage was coming, but they have done nothing to address it. They simply want to abolish ANTA, take total control of the vocational education and training system in this country and, in doing so, force draconian conditions on workers. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-08-11,"—I too rise to make a contribution to this debate on the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005, because they are two of the most important bills that we will be debating in this place. They reflect the real concerns that we have about the government’s total control of the Senate and the outcomes that they intend to bring as a result of that control. These bills bring to a head two great debates on our country’s future: first, the future of the Federation; and, second, whether our national vocational education and training system has any future at all. These bills are another manifestation of what is being described in public policy terms as the new centralism of the Howard government.
Senator Crossin just spoke very passionately about the hard and collaborative work, the cooperative federalism, that brought the Australian National Training Authority into existence. This great national project, ANTA, was established in 1992 to pull together a national approach to vocational education and training, reflecting the good research and the industry restructuring that took place in the eighties and acknowledging that we had to build and commit to our resource and skills base to underpin Australia’s economy. Good work has been done in the interests of Australia’s future and it is all about to be undone in these very destructive pieces of legislation.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-11,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I refer the Minister to Telstra’s announcement today of an annual profit of $4.45 billion, the largest in Australian corporate history. Can the minister confirm that Telstra’s line rental revenue increased by $125 million last year as a result of the massive cost increases that the government has permitted under its weak price control regime? Can the minister also confirm that Telstra’s broadband revenues increased by 73 per cent, or $307 million, and that this reflects the fact that the prices paid by Australian consumers for internet access are among the highest in OECD countries? In the light of these results, does the minister accept that Telstra’s profits have been driven by the excessively high prices that Telstra has been charging Australian consumers for its services? When will the government stop focusing on fattening up Telstra for sale and take action to strengthen the competition regime to deliver lower prices for consumers of telecommunications services?

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-11,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister agree with Mr Trujillo’s reported comments yesterday, when he told Telstra’s board that Australia’s communications platform was lagging well behind those of other developed countries and that Australia lagged behind its international peers in terms of investment, the take-up of broadband services, pricing and capacity? He said that the nation was in the bottom quartile of developed countries. Does the minister accept that the level of profit revealed today reflects Telstra’s excessive market power? Will the minister now commit to accepting the ACCC’s recommendations on Telstra’s future price control arrangements and strengthen regulation to prevent consumers from being gouged by Telstra’s monopolistic prices?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-11,"—I thank Senator Conroy for the question. What I think Senator Conroy has failed to understand in his question is that the price control regime does not apply to non-regulated services; it applies only to services that are actually covered under the universal service obligation. Obviously broadband does not come under the price control regime, but the price control regime has in fact continued to deliver services and untimed local calls for Australians and will continue to do so. As the Senate may be aware, I recently rolled over the existing price control regime until December so that further price controls can be announced as part of a number of matters under consideration going forward.
As to the matter of competition, I am glad that Senator Conroy mentioned that, because competition is obviously a fundamental plank of what this government regards as essential to telecommunications. Since we have come into government we have found that a robust telecommunication regime has meant that the telecommunications industry has gone from the cosy duopoly of Telstra and Optus, under Labor, to over 100 telecommunications providers. The economy is about $10 billion larger than it would have been had the government not proceeded down this track. It has provided about another $2 billion for small business and about 30,000 employees.
Competition in this country is a very big success story, but of course it is uneven. In a country as broad as Australia and with the other geographical and population centre issues that Australia has, obviously competition does not roll out evenly. That is why, apart from having some specific guarantees for basic services, this government has spent in the order of over a billion dollars to ensure that people in underserved areas, where competition is not yet developed, will get services—indeed, the services that they want at the moment: broadband and faster internet access. Competition is something that this government says is very much a work in progress and is trending precisely in the right direction.
It is amusing to hear Senator Conroy talk about competition on the one hand and owning Telstra on the other hand. A fundamental plank—in fact, it is probably the only plank—of Labor’s approach to telecommunications, as far as I understand it, is that the government should continue to retain its majority ownership in Telstra. It is a very interesting question. If Senator Conroy is so interested in competition, how can the government continue to own the dominant carrier and at the same time provide sufficient competition to provide all the services that are needed in rural and regional Australia? It is an absolute nonsense that this government has recognised. We know that with targeted investment you can assist in getting people the services they need in rural and regional Australia.
It is very interesting when you think back on Labor’s record on privatisation. I am just reminded about Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, CSL and Australian Airlines. What is it about Telstra that so frightens the Labor Party? They were prepared to privatise one out of two national airlines and one out of four major banks, yet they cringe at and are scared of privatising one out of 100 telecommunications companies.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-11,"—What this government will impose is an appropriate amount of regulation not only on Telstra but also on all telecommunications providers. But certain questions still remain for the Labor Party to answer. If you need to own Telstra to regulate it, how are you going to regulate Optus? How are you going to regulate AAPT? How are you going to regulate Vodafone? The ALP needs to get its concepts straight and stop trying to hang on to—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! How can anybody answer a question with that racket on my left going on?
—The Labor Party should stop trying to hang on to outmoded concepts of what is needed to deliver telecommunications in this country. Mr Trujillo’s comments in relation to Australia’s position on the league table related to broadband, as I understand it. That was precisely what they related to. Of course, the latest OECD broadband figures confirm that Australia is now one of the top countries in terms of taking up broadband—(time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-11,"—This is my first opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Deputy President, on your re-election. I look forward to many more happy evenings in your courtyard.
This week marks the first sitting that the Howard government can claim total control of the Senate. It is a week of great change for this chamber. However, senators should be aware that, despite the recent changes in the composition of this chamber, there are some things that have not changed since the last time that the chamber sat. For one, Australians remain implacably opposed to the sale of Telstra. A recent poll conducted by the New South Wales Farmers Association found that 80 per cent of its members are opposed to the government’s plan to privatise Telstra. A recent nationwide poll published by the Canberra Times found that 71 per cent of Australians are opposed to the sale.
Something else that has not changed is the deplorable state of telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia. The New South Wales Farmers Association survey also found that 29 per cent of respondents said that their landline was unreliable, 63 per cent said that their mobile was not reliable and 60 per cent were dissatisfied with their internet speed. The Canberra Times poll I mentioned earlier found that 23 per cent of those surveyed, including many metropolitan respondents, felt that Telstra’s services were not up to scratch in their area. The government has still failed to live up to its commitment to fully implement the recommendations of the Estens inquiry, with the National Farmers Federation recently reiterating:
NFF believes substantial work needs to be done to bring telecommunications services in rural Australia up to an acceptable standard, as identified in the 2003 Rural Telecommunications Inquiry.
That is, the Estens inquiry. On top of this, telecommunications like broadband internet access, which are essential for 21st century life, remain unattainable for many in rural and regional Australia. Just today we have had the single most powerful advocate of telco services in this country publicly admit:
... Australia’s communications platform was lagging well behind those of other developed countries.
Australia lagged behind its international peers in terms of investment, the take-up of broadband services, pricing and capacity ... and the nation was in the bottom quartile for developed countries.
And who said that? It was none other than Mr Trujillo, the new Telstra CEO. He has been in the job only six weeks and he has worked out what most Australians already know: Telstra have been delivering a second-grade service to most Australians, particularly those in the regional and rural areas of Australia. That is what Mr Trujillo is saying. He has acknowledged it. And do you know what? He has totally exposed this government for its continual parroting of the line that Australia has world-class services. That is the government’s line—they are up to scratch; they are world-class services—but the CEO of Telstra has rung the bell. He has exposed this government as nothing more than ideologically driven and determined to sell Telstra at any cost.
Unfortunately, despite the continuing opposition to the sale in the Australian community and the continuing lack of progress in improving the state of regional telecommunications services, recent developments indicate that the privatisation of Telstra is more likely than ever. The signs are already ominous for what coalition control of the Senate will mean for Australian democracy and the Australian public. For a brief period, it appeared that the National Party might actually use their recently acquired balance of power status in the Senate to represent the people who elected them. For instance, for a while we had Senator Barnaby Joyce telling us:
I’ve got to look after the people who elected me. I’ve got to look after the people of Queensland.
Senator Joyce said he that was more than a rubber stamp for the government’s legislation and that he would exercise his vote in the interests of the people of Queensland. In the face of the Howard government’s obsession with driving through the privatisation of Telstra, many people would have taken comfort from Senator Joyce’s commitment to represent the people of Queensland. After all, Senator Joyce told the people of Queensland on 7 September last year, in the lead-up to the last election:
I agree with John Howard on most things, but I won’t be endorsing the sale of Telstra.
Those are not my words; they are the words of Senator Barnaby Joyce—‘I won’t be endorsing the sale of Telstra’—when he was chasing votes in the federal election. No doubt Senator Joyce took this position because he knew that the vast majority of his constituency opposed the sale of Telstra. No doubt Senator Joyce told voters that he opposed the sale because he knew that if it were sold Telstra would leave the bush quicker than the banks as it chased profits in the big end of town. No doubt Senator Joyce opposed the privatisation of Telstra because he knew that the best way to ensure new telecommunications services like broadband were rolled out to regional areas was to keep Telstra in government ownership.
Surely many people voted for Senator Joyce at the last election because opposing the sale of Telstra is good policy. In fact, the policy is so good that the Labor party has opposed the Howard government’s attempts to privatise Telstra on each and every occasion that the government has introduced the legislation to the Senate. So, while the coalition might have had control of the Senate, people might have thought that, between the opposition and Senator Joyce, Telstra was safe. After all, the then President of the Queensland National Party, Terry Bolger, on 15 March this year said:
We won a senate place in our own right, saying we would oppose the sale of Telstra. It was not with the coalition.
Unfortunately, since the election, Senator Joyce’s position has collapsed. Since the election Senator Joyce has entered into negotiations with the government over the sell-out of his constituency, and the results have not been pretty. Senator Joyce started backtracking from his opposition to the sale of Telstra upon the release of the Page Research Centre report titled Future-proofing telecommunications in non-metropolitan Australia in March 2005, a report which Senator Joyce played a key role in preparing. The report recognised that:
Allowing the final sale of Telstra without ensuring the protection of non-metropolitan communities through sound future proofing would be tantamount to completely abandoning those communities.
It went on to say:
The Page Research Centre does not reject the privatisation of Telstra providing two elements are put in place:
1) It leads to the achievement and maintenance of parity between metropolitan and non-metropolitan communities and that parity is guaranteed through a blend of regulation and competition; and
2) Measures are introduced to create greater competition in the telecommunications sector through regulation designed to address the monopolistic characteristics of Telstra’s market position.
The primary way that these requirements were to be met would be through the roll-out of a fibre optic network to regional Australia at the cost of $7 billion and funded through the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. Senator Joyce accepted these recommendations in March and opened the door to the privatisation of Telstra. Now that Senator Joyce’s support for the sale was up for grabs, the negotiation over the price could begin.
Senator Joyce’s opening offer on 13 May was that he would support the sale of Telstra as a quid pro quo for funding of the $7 billion fibre optic network floated by the Page report. On top of this, Senator Joyce wanted an additional $5 billion in funding for regional development programs identified by the Queensland National Party—projects like a second road crossing for the Toowoomba Range.
So Senator Joyce’s opening offer for his support for the sale of Telstra was a $12 billion capital investment in rural and regional Australia to be funded from the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. That is when Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile got involved. In his first act as leader of the National Party, Mr Vaile determined to undercut Senator Joyce’s offer by $10 billion, suggesting on 29 July that the earnings from a trust fund worth $2 billion would be enough to convince The Nationals to sell out their constituents.
The Deputy Prime Minister’s message was clear: asking for $12 billion in exchange for his integrity was being greedy and Senator Joyce needed to make a better offer. Therefore the day after Mr Vaile named his price, Senator Joyce made his second offer—a $5 billion trust fund for regional telecommunications services. However, this still was not good enough. Liberal Party heavyweights started to heavy Senator Joyce to try to convince him to make a better offer. The Prime Minister told him that he would not sell Telstra at any cost and that if Senator Joyce asked for too much they would all pack up and go home.
You are seeing that the screws have been out. You have heard about the unseemly conduct in the coalition party room. You have seen the photographs of the confrontation between Senator Heffernan and Senator Joyce. The Treasurer, though, was not finished. The Treasurer intervened, saying that allocating too much of the sale proceeds to improve regional telecommunications services would apply upward pressure on interest rates. Barnaby’s $5 billion offer was obviously still too high.
Now Senator Joyce has backed off his $5 billion offer. In recent days Senator Joyce has said that he could support Mr Vaile’s idea of a trust fund so long as the interest earned from the fund is more than $100 million a year. So in the course of 10 sorry months Senator Joyce has moved from opposing the sale of Telstra outright, to refusing to support it without a $12 billion capital investment in regional Australia, to refusing to negotiate without a $5 billion capital investment in regional Australia, to being willing to consider it for something more than $100 million a year. And the negotiations continue. Senator Joyce’s recent capitulation is a disastrous turn of events for rural and regional Australia.
—You like Senator Joyce, don’t you? You spend a lot of time on him.
—I have not met him yet actually, Senator Abetz. The fact that Senator Joyce has been unable to honour his election commitment, stand up to the government and oppose the sale of Telstra is a tragedy for those who voted for him and for the 79 per cent of Queenslanders who oppose the sale. This is a key test here. Senator Barnaby Joyce has turned up. He has embarrassed Senator McGauran. He has embarrassed Senator Boswell. He has embarrassed his leader and Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, because he has come with the message: ‘I’m going to fight for my constituents’—the message being that they have not been. ‘I’m the good guy. All the rest of those Nationals, once they get up on the hill in Canberra, just fold away, roll over and have their tummies tickled by the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz and others.’ But them’s fighting words.
Unfortunately, Senator Joyce has talked a good fight but, when push comes to shove, the Queensland’s newest National Party senator has become ‘Backdown Barnaby’. Has Senator Joyce already become as out of touch with mainstream Australia as the Howard government? In the future, when a privatised Telstra lets regional services fall even further behind the cities, the voters of Queensland should know who to thank: the Queensland National Party, led by ‘Backdown Barnaby Joyce’ and, of course, ‘Rollover Ron Boswell’.
Unlike Senator Joyce, the Labor Party remains opposed to the Howard government’s plans to arrogantly force through the sale of Telstra against the wishes of the majority of the Australian public. Unlike Senator Joyce, the Labor Party will honour the commitment it made to the Australian public at the last election and oppose any move to privatise Telstra. Labor still firmly believes that the best way to guarantee telecommunications service standards for rural and regional Australia is to keep Telstra in majority public ownership.
Labor also recognises that the vast majority of the Australian population remain opposed to the sale of Telstra. Australians are opposed to the sale because they know that a privatised Telstra will leave town quicker than the banks. They know that a privatised Telstra will neglect ordinary consumers and chase the big end of town. We are committed to opposing the Howard government’s attempt to sell out the bush by selling Telstra. We call on senators in this chamber and the government to listen to the people of Australia and keep Telstra in majority public ownership.
I see a little cabal of National Party senators down in the corner—hopefully, they are all going to speak. I want to again point out to you that, notwithstanding anything the Prime Minister or the minister for communications have said about how good the services of Telstra are in the bush, Mr Trujillo, the CEO of Telstra, has blown the whistle today. He has said, ‘We are not doing a good enough job and we have delivered a second-class service.’ That is what he said. He has admitted it. He has had a look and said, ‘Why has Telstra not been rolling out better services and investing in the bush?’ He has admitted it today. The government have been trying to pretend. They have been trying to have you on. They have you out there parroting their line. The CEO of Telstra has gone around the back and exposed you. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-08-11,"—I will get back onto the horse. A matter of public importance was held to be a serious debate at one stage when I first came into this parliament. It was a matter to do some study on, if you were given the task. Whatever importance or gravity was placed on it was utterly reduced to trivialisms by Senator Conroy, who led for the Labor Party in the debate on this matter, no less. This has been the most debated subject in this parliament. I think it outranks native title for time debated. And here is the Labor Party getting up again. I might have misread the MPI. Was it a Barnaby Joyce matter of public importance? Senator Conroy spent some 10-plus minutes of his 15-minute speech on Barnaby Joyce, in some feeble attempt to distract or to divide the National Party or the coalition. What a desperate attempt, if that is all you have.
What you could have done in any one of the debates until now, much less this MPI, is come in here and lay down your own policy. You finished with about 30 seconds of generalities. We are still unclear, Senator Conroy, what you would do, if you happened by good fortune to get into government, with the current safeguards that are in place, what you would do with the current expenditure that is in place. Every time we have sought to increase expenditure in the rural and regional areas—such as Networking the Nation, that fine fund—he has thrown his head back in disgust. That is how you treated it. You would not even support that. You come in here and feign support for the bush and their telecommunications concerns when, given the chance to vote in this chamber for extra funds in the first and second sales of Telstra, you would not support it. You have missed a golden opportunity—you have passed it up—to come in here and lay down your policy. It is a feeble attempt, in some pathetic way, to divide the coalition if not the National Party themselves.
This comes from a man who, in his own state, is the most divisive politician yet to be elected. Who can forget—certainly, very few Victorians—the unseemly prime time TV dispute he had with Senator Carr at his own Labor Party conference? This is the great could-have-been who, from day one, has been divisive in his own state. And it is about to explode.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Senator Abetz, you would like to know that in October this year, just a month or two away, a whole set of preselections is to occur in Victoria—state and federal, I might add. And here is Senator Conroy, party to a bloodbath, as quoted by the Left, as quoted by Senator Carr, of his own party. And he has the gall to come in here and attempt to cause division!
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order relating to relevance. I was wondering if the Acting Deputy President shares my view that the matter before the chamber is actually about the sale of Telstra and that perhaps Senator McGauran has strayed from the matter at hand. I wondered whether you would like to invite him to return to the matter, although I know that will leave him with nothing to say.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Conroy, I listened to your contribution to the debate, which was heard in relative silence by your colleagues in the chamber. It was a wide-ranging debate on the proposed sale of Telstra.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Senator Conroy, you will listen to me, thank you. It has been wide ranging, and I think the parameters in which Senator McGauran has been speaking on the subject are still confined, in that broad sense, to the MPI before the chair.
—I notice that Senator Lundy is the next speaker on the list. I notice her sitting next to Senator Conroy, who led this debate. There is a bit of deja vu, to say the least, because I have debated both Senator Conroy and Senator Lundy on this matter before. It triggers my memory that last time Senator Lundy spoke here—representing the Left, of course—she mounted one of the best cases yet for 100 per cent government ownership of Telstra. So there is a difference in policy over there. You talk about divisions of policy and opinion. I invite Senator Lundy, when she gets up to speak, to give us the facts of what the Labor Party policy really is. I invite anyone to go to the Hansard of her last address on this matter. It was one of the best-mounted cases yet for longing for the old days of Telecom when the government owned the monopoly, but more so when the union utterly held that company to ransom.
—You have cleared the gallery. It is official.
—Senator Conroy, you were heard in relative silence. I ask you to extend the same courtesy to other speakers in the chamber.
—It is quite clear, with the two of them running this debate, that they do have separate policies on this matter. What is more, the credibility of the Labor Party in this debate has been tested on many occasions, no more so than in the four elections when we have gone to the people of Australia with the policy of the sale of Telstra. Let us look at their record in government. How could the Australian people trust them—and they do not—let alone the rural and regional sector? Both of you are absolutely dreaming if you think the rural and regional sector believe that you would give them any support should you be lucky enough to get into government, especially when you have the record. The record is that you voted against every item of funding this government has directed and targeted towards rural and regional Australia.
What is more, you are the great privatisers. Do not come in here trying to sell an ideological belief that you want to keep Telstra in government hands. When you were in government, you were the great privatisers. I will just pluck out the most infamous example, and that is the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. What happened there? Going to an election, you committed not to sell any part of the Commonwealth Bank. By then you had already sold something like a third of the bank, so it was all part privatised and part government owned already. You had done a Telstra, so to speak. Then you went to the election, having committed to the Australian people that you would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. That was supported and underpinned by the then Treasurer, who wrote to every existing private shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank saying that the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold. On the other side of the election, desperate to fill your black hole deficit, you sold the Commonwealth Bank.
You did not look at the polls then. In fact, you did not even enter into debate within your own party, if I remember. It was just pushed through by the then Prime Minister and Treasurer. So do not come in here quoting polls. You went to the ultimate poll and lied to the Australian people. We have been to four polls, the ultimate test—the only poll that really matters—with this policy on Telstra, and the Australian people have supported this government. No matter how often you tried to whip it up, no matter how many times we saw Mr Beazley and Mr Latham attempt to whip up the issue of Telstra, it completely fell flat.
Of course, there are concerns within rural and regional Australia. The National Party know that better than anyone. The coalition know that. We know that there are concerns to be met. That is why we implemented the benchmarking inquiry of the Besley report, which brought down recommendations which the government undertook, followed by the Estens inquiry, which made 39 recommendations. The government accepted each one of them. So we understand that there are concerns in rural and regional Australia to this day.
But we have attempted to meet each one, with funding—to this date, over a billion dollars—for projects like Networking the Nation. We have underpinned customer guarantees and universal service obligations. We have directed money into rural transaction centres and the local government funds. We have put price caps on local standard calls and, of course, we have introduced telecommunications for remote areas. There is now something like over 90 per cent mobile phone coverage in Australia. That is a reaction to the reports and the concerns that each individual parliamentarian receives from rural and regional areas.
Our policy is transparent and honest, and it is understood by the Australian people that we have to fulfil three conditions before Telstra will be sold, ultimately. Firstly, the services in rural and regional Australia will be up to scratch, adequate and comparable to those in the metropolitan areas. Secondly, there will be value to the taxpayer. We are not selling cheap. If the share market does not meet the price, it does not get sold. Thirdly, we will get the authority of this parliament. We know that that is now more than possible for the first time, given that we have been given a majority in the Senate. But we will debate this right up to the vote. We will not shut down the debate at all. We will meet the Labor Party on their grounds. If only they would tell us what their policy is and what their funding arrangements will be for Telstra in the future. (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-11,"—The Democrats do not support the full privatisation of Telstra any more than we supported the previous two tranches—the sell-off of the 49 per cent. The reason we take this view is that, as the text of the matter of public importance suggests, the vast majority of Australians oppose it. They may have re-elected a coalition government that promised to sell the rest of Telstra but that does not necessarily mean that the vast majority of Australians do not think it is a bad idea.
We say that, at a minimum, the government should own key telecommunications infrastructure to ensure equitable access to affordable, state-of-the-art telecommunications for Australia so that it remains internationally competitive and socially progressive. In particular, telecommunications are an essential economic and social service for rural and remote areas, and they are becoming more important in the context of what we call the information economy—that is, e-commerce, e-learning, e-health and banking online. The National Farmers Federation president recently said:
Farmers in the 21st Century need access to more than just a basic telephone service—they also need affordable, quality mobile and internet services to remain competitive ...
Back in September 2003, my colleague Senator Bartlett and former Democrat senator John Cherry undertook a survey of people in regional and rural Queensland, asking how they felt about the government’s agenda—supported, I might say, by the National Party, although in Queensland they have been less than enthusiastic, to say the least—to sell off the rest of Telstra. Of nearly 13,000 responses, 80 per cent were opposed to the further sale of Telstra. A poll 14 months later, on 5 February, found that 77 per cent—that is 26,544 people—agreed that Telstra should be kept in public hands.
As noted in the wording of this MPI, recent polls demonstrate that the majority of Australians are still opposed to the sale of Telstra. So on all of the key criteria, we think the government has failed to justify the sale. Senator McGauran also could not think of a reason for Telstra to be sold off. There are no competitive reasons. In fact, it is the opposite. There are no service reasons. There are no legal or financial grounds to do so.
The government has argued that it will be in a better position to objectively and properly regulate the company after it is sold. That is so counterintuitive and so not the case according to all of the evidence that has been brought to the many Senate inquiries into telecommunications that have been conducted that it is a farcical proposition. The government says it is going to be in a better position to regulate the company after it is sold. More recently, the new CEO of Telstra, Solomon Trujillo, reportedly said that he would take an aggressive stand against the increased regulation, which makes that argument ridiculous. He also said that competition was not the answer to meet the needs of end users.
In recent weeks, the government announced an operating licence to ensure Telstra maintains a presence in the bush. But we believe that this will not guarantee access to modern technology or to equitable pricing. The Nationals apparently are asking for a $2 billion future fund for Telstra but we understand that this fund will only cover the annual cost to maintain services. What that means and how you figure out what this fund should pay for and what Telstra should pay for, I have no idea. But it is not for the roll-out of new infrastructure, and that is the greatest need in telecommunications in this country.
The Liberal Party and the National Party are grabbing at straws somewhat, knowing that a fully privatised Telstra will only be beholden to the shareholders and will abandon unprofitable areas. We all know that Telstra’s investment in infrastructure has been declining ever since it was privatised. Over the same time, Australia’s performance on broadband access compared with other OECD countries has declined. We say investment in infrastructure is in Australia’s long-term interests but that we are not likely to see serious investment in infrastructure under a fully privatised Telstra model.
Even if Telstra was forced to maintain a presence in the bush and was forced to continue with the universal service obligation, there would be nothing to stop Telstra treating people in the regions as second-class citizens when it comes to their telecommunication needs. The shareholders of a privatised Telstra will demand at least a commercial rate of return from their investment and they will be more willing to close down low return assets. We have seen that already in banking, air services and the like. Withdrawing their presence from regional Australia would have to be a top priority.
It is also clear that the government does not need to reduce debt. When it moved on from that argument for selling Telstra, it fabricated another one—another future fund, this one for so-called unfunded superannuation liabilities into the future. We do not think that is a good argument, either. There is no pressing need for us to suddenly fund future liabilities in superannuation. This has been done through revenue in the past and there is no pressing need at this point to change that system. We have this absurd situation where we are still talking about reducing this imaginary debt, despite the fact that we have one of the lowest national debts in the OECD.
There is clear evidence that Australia would have to change its foreign ownership laws to get the return that it expects from selling the rest of Telstra. If you put that to the Australian people, the results of polls would be similar. The Australians polled would most likely say that this was not in Australia’s interest, and that is certainly the view of the Democrats. The government has not given adequate consideration to the implications of the full privatisation of a vertically integrated monopolistic Telstra and the alternatives. We say the government should forget its flawed plan and instead focus on upgrading the network to improve services and make it— (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-08-11,"—It is a great pleasure to speak to this motion today. It highlights how out of touch the coalition government is with the people of Australia in relation to telecommunications and communication services. It is worth having a look at the recent past to see how many inquiries and investigations have gone on in this federal parliament since the coalition came to power and how consistent the findings of those inquiries have been. They have consistently found not only that our telecommunications system inadequate and failing many Australians—a large proportion of whom happen to be in rural and regional Australia—but also how much the telecommunications company Telstra has failed to keep pace with technological changes.
It was only a few years ago that the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, proclaimed that Australians did not want broadband. We did not want it! From memory, he in fact said that broadband was only good for porn and games. How ridiculous does that statement look now in the face of the comments of Senator Coonan, the current minister, who in the chamber today in question time put her hand on her heart and said how important broadband was to Australians? How is it that the coalition is so slow to pick up on the fact that broadband is absolutely critical to our social, cultural and economic future that they have only woken up to that fact very recently?
It was also not so long ago that the then CEO of Telstra, Mr Switkowski, said that Australians did not want to have broadband. He held up as his example the broadband project in Launceston, which was so completely mismanaged by Telstra—at taxpayers’ expense, I have to say, through one of their social bonus schemes—that the take-up rate was very poor. And that was proof that Australians did not want broadband! This has become the character of the coalition government’s approach to telecommunications policy over many years: ‘Australians do not want to advance. We don’t need broadband: we’re happy to stay in the dark ages. We’ll put our heads in the sand and think we can get by in the 21st century on 19.2 kilobits per second dial-up internet.’ Well, well.
What we have had from the coalition government is a confession. It occurred in this chamber some months ago now when Minister Coonan said, ‘Yes, the reason Telstra has not been encouraged to invest and has not been investing in the capital infrastructure for the 21st century is that it wants to fatten up its bottom line in preparation for the sale of the final tranche and future privatisation.’ (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-11,"—This is the annual report of the Aboriginals Benefit Account, which was established under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and commenced operation in 1978. The major functions of the Aboriginals Benefit Account are to receive the equivalent of mining royalty moneys derived from mining operations on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory and to make payments to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory in proportions determined by the minister to meet their administrative expenditure, to make payments to those land councils for distribution to incorporated Aboriginal associations, communities or groups in order to benefit those Aboriginal people affected by mining operations and also to make beneficial payments to other Aboriginal associations, communities or groups who are resident in the Northern Territory.
I speak to this report partly to note that there is concern about potential amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, following the government gaining control of the Senate. The act was introduced by the Liberal government. Indeed, it was back when they last had control of the Senate in the 1970s. It is also an act that is of great importance to Aboriginal people. I suggest that it is not only of symbolic importance but also of great practical importance. There is serious concern that the current government, with their newfound Senate majority, will tamper with this in a negative way. I simply want to flag that as a concern, certainly of the Democrats nationally as well as of the Democrats in the Northern Territory.
That is not to say that the land rights act would not benefit from examination as to ways the accounts might be used more effectively or how the act itself may be improved, but there is a real concern that it could be severely undermined. That is something that we have seen in recent times. We have seen this government make a blatant grab over the top of the Northern Territory government in relation to uranium mines. They have the constitutional power to do that because it is a territory but, given this Liberal government and the alleged Liberal tradition of self-government, simply rolling in over the top and using those powers without any significant form of consultation with regard to uranium mining naturally causes concern to the people of the Territory. Given this government’s obsession with expanding uranium mining, we all know the coalition certainly have some other agendas with regard to weakening Aboriginal land rights. That is why there is genuine concern there. It is a concern the Democrats share, and it is an issue we will be watching closely.
I also draw this issue to the Senate’s attention to contrast it with the situation in my own state of Queensland. There are some differences as this is talking about the equivalent of mining royalties. I draw the Senate’s attention to the continuing problem of the failure to address what is known as the stolen wages issue. On the one hand, you have a situation where you have funds that are legal entitlements of Aboriginal people going back three decades that have been properly managed and reported to parliament so that we can at least see how that is spent and have debates about that. In Queensland, there are many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who performed work over many years that they were never paid for. The money went into a trust, which was paid directly to the government and then disappeared. That is simply a blatant disgrace. The Queensland government has made initial action about that, but I have to say—as my departed Queensland colleague Senator Cherry spoke about in this place—the action to date has been grossly inadequate. To offer between $2,000 and $4,000 to people as a ‘take it or leave it; that is the end of it’ offer—and offer it only to those people who are still alive—is clearly inadequate. It is not simply an Aboriginal issue; it is an issue of wages justice.
In a climate in which we are all debating about basic rights in the workplace, nothing can be more simple and basic than making sure that you have the pay that you are entitled to. Instead, it went to the government who were supposed to hold it in trust for those people but never provided it. It is so fundamental that that injustice must be addressed. It is clearly a long way short of being addressed. Even the state Labor government’s own policy adopted by their conference recognises that, and it will be an issue the Democrats, along with many others in the stolen wages campaign, will continue to pursue in Queensland. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-08-11,"—I was privileged to work on the Community Affairs References Committee, where we had the enormous privilege of listening to the stories of the most amazing group of people, all of whom had some familiarity with what they termed, and which now has become common parlance, ‘the cancer journey’. Through this process we talked with people who indicated that they were working through personal treatments, people who were providing various forms of treatment and—I think, in some ways, most poignantly—the family members and friends of those who identified with having cancer and were trying to work out their role in this journey, giving us such sensitive information from which we can benefit. I hope people will take the opportunity to have a look at the report of the Community Affairs References Committee, called The cancer journey: informing choice.
Through this inquiry we were able to look at the way that the treatments surrounding cancer in this country have moved forward over the last 10 years. Certainly, previous Senate inquiries and also House of Reps inquiries had looked specifically at the issue of breast cancer. There was quite groundbreaking work provided by previous committees that led in no small way to changing how treatment was offered to women across this country. One of the clear things to come out of this committee’s inquiry, though, is that the work done through the breast cancer movement has benefited other people who are suffering from—who have other forms of cancer. I corrected myself when I started to say ‘suffer from’, because this is a term that the people with whom we spoke totally reject and one they do not wish to be used. However, it is too easy to fall into the term ‘suffer’.
I hope to talk again on these issues at different times during my career in this place, but this evening I want to talk particularly about alternative methodologies. We were privileged in the inquiry process to have submissions from a number of organisations which were looking really centrally at the issue of providing alternative help for people who were travelling on the cancer journey. This evening I want to talk about one that I have been fortunate enough to visit in my home state of Queensland. It is called Bloomhill, and it is located in the extraordinarily beautiful area of the Sunshine Coast, just north of Brisbane.
Bloomhill is an inclusive model of treatment. It operates with the whole team of people involved in the treatment options. There are support mechanisms for people who have been identified as having cancer. The process is linked by people sharing a common goal of having someone be as well as they possibly can. The idea is that everybody has a role to play, but it is focused on the individual choice of the person who has been identified as having cancer. The idea is a community based, complementary care organisation. I know that is a mouthful, but it sums up the philosophy of the Bloomhill centre.
This centre was founded in 1997 by Margaret Gargan, who is a nurse by profession and worked for many years on the oncology wards at the Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane. After her own diagnosis, Margaret went from being someone working with people with cancer to being someone who identified as having cancer and was on her own journey. She experienced service models from both sides and brought that knowledge and sensitivity to setting up the Bloomhill model. In 2002 Bloomhill set up a partnership with the local Blue Care palliative care team. The enormous contribution of the various palliative care teams across the country was documented in the process of this inquiry, and the role of community nursing, actually working with people in their own homes, cannot be overstressed. They are people to whom we should be deeply grateful.
The partnership that has been established at Bloomhill is one where the people at the centre can have access to the kind of professional care that is offered through the hospital system and through the community system, but Bloomhill also looks at the wider needs of people and offers alternative therapies. Not too long ago people tended to laugh at alternative therapies but now, through experience, people understand that these can help. After all, the key issue is wellness. It may not, and in this particular disease often does not, result in cure, but it does create wellness and strength of spirit which is so valuable.
The Bloomhill centre can only operate, as most of these community organisations do, on the basis of a very strong group of volunteers. The whole idea is that volunteers with skills come together to share information and be part of the process. In the period from 1997 until now, there has been such growth and need that there is now a management committee, 10 full-time staff, eight part-time staff and over 250 volunteers who work together to make sure that everybody involved is as well as they possibly can be.
The permanent site, since 1999, is the most extraordinarily beautiful place—10 acres of rainforest with room to develop respite facilities, chapels and further facilities for extra therapies such as massage, counselling, music therapy and a whole range of different and alternative methods. These are not exclusive of medical treatment but complementary to it, so that people involved feel nurtured, valued and are given the key choice for themselves as to which path they will take down the journey.
Margaret is an extremely passionate woman. She has worked outside the location at the Sunshine Coast and is working with other communities to try and set up similar organisations. I know that they are working together now to try and set up a similar place in the Blue Mountains—another extraordinarily beautiful place. It has been proven that your environment does have an immediate impact on your sense of wellbeing.
Another model of care which also includes a range of complementary systems to make the person and their family members feel better and part of the whole process is the Brown’s clinic in Perth. One of the key aspects of this model with the Brown’s clinic is that the actual place where these therapies are offered is situated at the hospital. They have a desperate need for more space, but there is something about having this particular centre, which focuses on the wellbeing of people using complementary treatments, co-located with the medical processes at the hospital that I think gives it a special validity.
One of the things to come out of the cancer inquiry is the feeling that the professional medical areas do not give sufficient weight or value to the range of complementary medicines and therapies. There are people with various skills available in our community who are focused on making people as well as they can be. What we do not need, and what no patient or family involved in this process needs, is a sense of competition or any disrespect between the various methods of treatment. What was stressed consistently throughout the evidence received by the committee was that there needed to be a whole-of-patient care and a team approach.
The message that came from the people at the Brown’s clinic and from Bloomhill was that these systems can work. Again, there is no promise or guarantee that people will be cured. During the cancer journey through which people are travelling there will be the consideration that people care, that their views will be protected and valued and that there are ways that this process can work better than it has in the past. The way forward has been led by the enormous amount of work done across this community and also overseas in the area of breast cancer. Throughout the cancer inquiry, the committee learnt lessons from the expenditure, the funding and the research that had been done on the issue of breast cancer.
Each of the words in the title of the report—The cancer journey: informing choice—are important. It is a journey. It is one that so many people are now travelling, and the statistics are quite horrific in terms of the number of people who are facing this process. The key is the last two words ‘informing choice’. We can learn and we must learn. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-08-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Auditor-General’s report listed as No. 4 in the order of the day is in fact Audit report No. 39 of 2004-05, Performance audit—the Australian Taxation Office’s administration of the superannuation contributions surcharge. The Senate yesterday considered and passed legislation to abolish the superannuation surcharge. Perhaps in that context some people would believe that the highly critical Audit Office report is no longer relevant; however, it is. It is relevant for two reasons. Firstly, it highlights the incompetence of the implementation of a policy that this government introduced—namely, a new tax. Secondly—and I know that there are some in the community who do not understand this—the surcharge in terms of accrued debt through defined benefit funds still continues, and there are still considerable amounts of unaccounted for debt to be collected by the tax office from people who have not yet been assessed for the surcharge. That is at the heart of this report. It is a highly critical report. Going to the summary on page 17, I will read paragraph 16:
Surcharge exceptions are an area of significant concern for the ATO, as they prevent the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) from making Surcharge assessments. The ATO acknowledges that its overall management of exceptions since the introduction of the Surcharge has been less than adequate. Decisions not to resolve Surcharge exceptions have resulted in large backlogs (in excess of 11 million exceptions as at August 2004), which continue to grow markedly each year. The ANAO estimates that there is a range of between $360 million and $750 million in uncollected Surcharge revenue associated with these backlogs.
This paragraph highlights the fact that since the introduction of the surcharge tax back in 1996 through to the period of August 2004 there were 11 million exceptions or transactions relating to the collection of the surcharge that the tax office could not successfully conclude to collect between $360 million and $750 million in revenue. That is over a period of eight years, so for those eight years the tax office was unable to collect this amount of revenue.
It raises a number of important issues. Firstly, why did these 11 million exceptions and uncollected revenue over a period of eight years go on for so long? Why wasn’t it reported earlier by the tax office that it was having significant problems in collecting the surcharge tax revenue? Over eight years this went unreported. I am not one who is overly critical of public servants—they work hard; they are a dedicated group—but I think in this case, when a significant amount of revenue goes uncollected because of systemic problems that go to the heart of the collection of this tax and it goes unreported so long, there has to be criticism of the tax office. It is effectively a cover-up over a period of eight years.
I have discussed this report with Mr Carmody at estimates—in fact, I thought he was almost going to resign at one point; he was very upset. He did claim—and I am only paraphrasing him—that he was not informed by some of his management staff about the problems in relation to the surcharge. I accept him at face value that he was not told about it. He has made a number of staff changes in respect to the management and administration of the surcharge tax collection revenue as a consequence. But I think a legitimate and strong criticism should be made of certain officers—I do not go to the names; I did not go to them at estimates—when a situation can be allowed to build up to the extent it did over a period of eight years and go uncorrected. It is only because the Audit Office—I say thank goodness for an independent Audit Office—went into the tax office that this particular problem was identified.
The tax office has begun to resolve the 11 million exceptions and collect the back revenue of between $360 million and $750 million. They have not completed that yet. This brings me to the second point. The fundamental collection mechanism for the surcharge had a number of failings. It had one principal failing: it was government policy and legislation to require the superannuation funds to collect the surcharge tax revenue. The government did that for one reason: it did not want to apply a tax—in fact, it did not even want to call it a tax. That would have been in breach of its election commitment of 1996—no new taxes; no increase in existing taxes—so it applied a surcharge, as it called it, to the superannuation funds and indirectly on the members.
The difficulty—and it was pointed out at the time not just by me but I know by Senator Watson and a range of persons back in 1996—was that it was a very inefficient method to collect a new tax. The tax office had one very significant problem. They had to data-match income across all superannuation funds in order to identify who had to pay the tax, and the fund had to identify who had to pay the tax. The tax office lacked one significant piece of information from a significant group of taxpayers in order to identify who had to pay the tax—namely, they did not have TFNs, tax file numbers. This was pointed out at the time.
The tax office has struggled to reconcile the transactions across superannuation funds. As much as superannuation funds want to cooperate and comply with the law, the super funds at the time of the tax introduction only had, I think, between 50 and 60 per cent of the TFNs of superannuation fund members. It did increase. I understand it is about 80 to 85 per cent of TFNs that have now been made available by fund members to a superannuation fund. It was this central and fundamental flaw that has led to the significant number of exceptions—the 11 million transactions that could not be identified—and the undercollection that went from $360 million to $750 million. That is not the tax office’s fault. The fault lies with the government that introduced a new tax and did not think through the collection mechanism. As I said, there were a number of people in the parliament—not just in the Senate, not just on our side of politics but on the other side of politics—that pointed out this fundamental flaw.
As a result, the tax office is now trying to identify the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have not paid their share of the surcharge tax. Some will never be identified because the problem with the lack of a tax file number, in some cases, still remains. And in eight years, quite understandably, a number of people have died who are supposed to pay the surcharge, and you cannot collect a tax from a deceased person.
So this is a very important report. It highlights a systemic, ongoing failure by the tax office to collect the revenue. It was covered up, and it highlights the systemic failure of this government to think through how it would collect the tax in the first place. Even though the tax has now been abolished, this is an ongoing problem for assessing those for past debts that accrue through a defined benefit fund. That person’s debts through the DB funds are not wiped out; they continue to accrue with interest and are liable for payment. (Time expired)

Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—

RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SENATE FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATION COMMITTEE REPORT, ANNUAL REPORTS (NO. 1 OF 2005)


Recommendation 1: Implementation of a mandatory requirement for listing, separately, both the number of consultancy contracts let and active during a reporting period.

Recommendation 2: That the requirements of Attachment C(2) of the guidelines be amended to make the disclosure of information mandatory in either the agency’s annual report or on the agency’s internet page.

Recommendation 3: That a proforma for presenting the information in annual reports be introduced so that the presentation of this information is consistent across all agencies.

Response: Agreed. The Requirements for Annual Reports for Departments, Executive Agencies and FMA Act Bodies (the Requirements) were recently amended to address the Committee’s recommendations. In accordance with section 63 of the Public Service Act 1999, the Requirements were approved on behalf of the Parliament by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA).
The concerns of the Committee were specifically drawn to the JCPAA’s attention.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND EXTERNAL TERRITORIES’ (JSC’S) REPORT NORFOLK ISLAND: REVIEW OF THE ANNUAL REPORTS OF THE DEPART-MENT OF TRANSPORT AND REGIONAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE

Introduction
This response is tabled jointly by the Hon Jim Lloyd MP, Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads and Senator the Hon Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage.
It should be noted that a number of the recommendations included in this report are either included as recommendations of the JSC report Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Inquiry into Governance on Norfolk Island (the first report on the Committee’s inquiry into Norfolk Island Governance) or are matters that the JSC may consider as part of its second Governance report, which is to concentrate on financial sustainability. Responses to these recommendations will be dealt with in the Government’s responses to those reports.

JSC Recommendations


Government Response


Recommendation 1


That the recommendations of this report be conditional on the acceptance and implementation of the recommendations in the Committee’s report 
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Inquiry into Governance on Norfolk Island
.


Rejected. The Australian Government is still considering Part 1 of the Committee’s Governance report and is still awaiting Part 2 of its Inquiry into Governance on Norfolk Island.


Recommendation 2


That the Federal Government make no decision or commitment in respect of the transfer to freehold title of other types of Crown leasehold or licences until after a suitable period has passed to enable an assessment of the effectiveness of the new land management and planning regime
,
 especially in respect of residential Crown leases that will have been transferred to freehold title.


Accepted. No decision will be taken in respect of other Crown land until the current transfer process is well advanced.


Recommendation 3


That, before any land transfers take place, the Federal Government ensure that the new land package is appropriately resourced and will continue to be in the future and that, prior to any transfer, the Federal Minister report to Parliament on steps taken to ensure the latter.


Rejected. The Australian Government made the land transfer conditional on the Norfolk Island Government meeting a number of prerequisites, including implementing a new land management and planning regime, to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth. The Norfolk Island Government has met these prerequisites. Implementation and resourcing is now a matter for the Norfolk Island Government.


Recommendation 4


That the Federal Government extend its reassessment of its current policies with respect to Norfolk Island and the basis for the Territory’s exclusion from Commonwealth programmes and services to include planning and environmental management on Norfolk Island.


Noted. Included as part of Recommendation 2 in the report on Part 1 of the Joint Standing Committee’s Governance Inquiry. The recommendation will be dealt with in the context of the Government’s response to the Governance Inquiry.


Recommendation 5


That the 
Norfolk Island Act 1979
 (Cth), together with the relevant Norfolk Island laws, be amended to provide for an effective, ongoing role for the Federal Government in the making and amendment of the Territory’s statutory planning and land use regime.


Rejected. Under the Norfolk Island Act ‘land’ is a non-schedule matter and as such the Commonwealth has a veto power over changes to Norfolk Island legislation that would amend current ‘land’ laws. In addition, the Commonwealth always retains the option of amending the Norfolk Island Act to provide additional controls if considered necessary.


Recommendation 6


That the appropriate financial and human resources be provided to the Commonwealth Department of the Environment and Heritage to monitor and enforce compliance with Crown lease covenants and conservation and related agreements on Norfolk Island.


Noted.


Recommendation 7


That the Federal Government act immediately to ensure that Island residents and community organisations, as well as the Norfolk Island Government, be made aware of and eligible to apply for financial and other assistance provided under federal programmes, services and grant schemes that may be relevant to planning, environmental, heritage and land management.


Included as part of Recommendation 2 in the report on Part 1 of the Joint Standing Committee’s Governance Inquiry. The recommendation will be dealt with in the context of the Government’s response to the Governance Inquiry.


Recommendation 8


That net revenue received by the Federal Government in respect of any freeholding of Crown land on Norfolk Island be set aside to assist leasehold and freehold landholders on Norfolk Island who enter into conservation agreements, covenants or access agreements or similar undertakings with the Federal Government concerning the protection and conservation of the environment or heritage on their land or the Island more generally.


Partially accepted. The Australian Government has decided that revenue from the land transfer will be placed in an environmental trust, in honour of the late Ivens (Toon) Buffett. The Government is finalising arrangements for the operation of the trust in conjunction with the Norfolk Island Government.


Recommendation 9


That Recommendation Eight be implemented by the Federal Government establishing a Norfolk Island Trust Fund administered by the Federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage.


Rejected. The Australian Government proposes that, subject to agreement of the operational details, the trust be administered by the Norfolk Island Government.


Recommendation 10


That the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Department of the Environment and Heritage, as the responsible Commonwealth agencies, specifically detail in future annual reports the human, financial and other resources allocated by each Department to administer the Federal Government’s statutory and other responsibilities with respect to the environment and heritage of Norfolk Island.


Rejected. Due to the administrative difficulties involved in disaggregating the human, financial and other resources used in relation to Norfolk Island environment and heritage matters as opposed to other functions, the task would be time consuming and any information published would be of limited value.


Recommendation 11


That the Commonwealth retain both ownership and responsibility for the management of the Norfolk Island National Park.


Accepted. Continued management of the National Park and Botanic Gardens by the Australian Government is consistent with current Government policy.


Recommendation 12


That the Federal Government assist the Norfolk Island Government in upgrading existing sewage services and, where necessary, developing new sewage disposal facilities that protect the health of the community, visitors, the environment and adjacent coastal areas of Norfolk Island.


Noted. The Australian Government will consider this recommendation as part of its consideration of the Joint Standing Committee’s reports on its Governance Inquiry .


Recommendation 13


That the Federal Government ensure that the Norfolk Island Government take immediate and appropriate measures, in accordance with national standards, for the removal and disposal of asbestos on Norfolk Island.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-08-11,"—I will talk about what I was going to talk about later. First, I am moved to talk about something else. I have just met Senator Moore. I had been told previously that she is a particularly decent person. I listened with great interest to her comments in relation to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee and the report, The cancer journey: informing choice. She very kindly gave me her copy of this report. I was having a very quick look through it and I noticed in chapter 4, which is on complementary and alternative therapies, a quote from a Professor Sali, who said:
Cancer is a chronic condition. In order to get the best result, you need to be able to use every possible resource.
I looked across to a paragraph on complementary therapies which refers to biologically based therapies, including herbs, vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements. That reminded me of a next door neighbour and friend of mine Ian Hirst, who died last year. He and I both had this dreaded disease called cancer. I, like Senator Adams and I am sure others in the chamber, am one of the lucky ones. Ian was not.
When I resigned in 2001, after the election I was desperately thinking of what I was going to do. I was not at all aware that my wife had already looked after that and there was a long list of things to do. I started doing up the backyard. Ian was dying of cancer at that stage. He was one of those marvellous men who could turn his hand to absolutely anything. Despite being desperately ill at that stage, he would bring across his mixture of carrot juice and ginger and other bits and pieces. Despite it being the middle of summer and me being desperately hot, I could not bring myself to drink one of these evil-smelling concoctions that Ian made.
He was one of nature’s great gentlemen. Seeing this report has moved me to talk about him briefly tonight before I move to what I had originally intended to talk about. Ian Hirst was a great loss, not just to his friends but to children throughout the Ballarat region. He was an educator. He was a deep thinker. Prior to his illness, he worked for the Ballarat regional office of the education department. I have, regrettably, been to a number of funerals. At Ian’s funeral, the way he was spoken of and spoken about marked a very special person.
I suspect we did not share a lot philosophically—in fact, I know we did not share a lot philosophically—but we did enjoy one of life’s great joys: a bottle of his favourite red wine, Lake’s Folly. It was a glorious drop. He left a bottle of that for me when he died. I shared it with his wife, Gail, who is also a very special person. Alexander, Nicole and Gail have, as I expect Ian would have, picked up the pieces and run with them very quickly. I am very grateful to you, Senator Moore, for bringing that report to my attention and giving me the opportunity to speak about someone who was very special.
Tonight I want to talk about something else which causes me great concern. I was approached recently by representatives from the Bendigo student union. Honourable senators may not be aware that I am very pleased to be the patron senator for Bendigo. Representatives from the student union met with me over a cup of coffee. They were the sort of decent, honourable young Australians I would expect to be studying at a university in Bendigo. We talked about the issue and they raised with me their concerns. They did that in an appropriate manner—in a non-confrontational manner—and discussed the issues. I did not put it nearly as eloquently as Senator Fifield did on the Virginia Trioli program the other day, when he said:
It doesn’t matter whether it’s a sporting association, whether it’s an industrial association or whether it’s a student body. No one should be compelled to join an organisation against their will, and this legislation will outlaw membership of a student union or association or payment of a compulsory fee as being a prerequisite for enrolment at university.
Students at the Bendigo student union do not agree with that, and I respect their opinion. But their approach to this was completely different to the behaviour of 700 thugs yesterday who marched on Liberal Party headquarters in Exhibition Street, Melbourne. They did an enormous amount of damage with paint bombs, which I assume were paid for through compulsorily acquired student fees. They damaged cars at the front of 104 Exhibition Street and did several thousand dollars damage. The staff were of course deeply concerned about what was becoming a very militant group of people. I do not know whether they were university students. I do not know whether I hope they were or whether I hope they were not. It is fairly typical that demonstrations in Melbourne are often filled with people who are not affected by that which they are demonstrating against.
What concerns me most is that, despite there being damage, there were no arrests. The maintenance of the rule of law surely requires that civil disobedience does not go rewarded by inaction. There was inaction yesterday. Despite there being the presence of Victoria Police, despite there being 700 demonstrators, despite there being clear evidence of damage to public and private property, including Liberal Party headquarters and cars outside 104 Exhibition Street, not one single arrest was made. I am afraid it rather begs the question: had 700 Young Liberal students marched to Lygon Street, to Trades Hall, or marched on Labor Party headquarters in West Melbourne, thrown paint bombs and caused the staff inside that building concern—I do not know whether they felt fear, but they certainly were concerned yesterday—would the response have been the same?
Again, I do not know whether I wish it was or I wish it was not. What I am saying is that I think it is incumbent upon the police commissioner to investigate why there were not arrests at this demonstration. I am an absolutely passionate supporter—and senators will hear me say this time and time again—of lawful demonstration. It is the right of every single person in our community to lawfully demonstrate. But when the rule of law is breached by an attack on private or public property and there is no action taken and it happens to be on Liberal Party headquarters then I am deeply concerned. I think the police commissioner, Chief Commissioner Nixon, should respond to the quite legitimate question about why there were no arrests when there was a police presence, when the police were there at least an hour before the demonstration because they were aware of it. Why were there no arrests when there was damage to this property?",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Cancer</title>,ADJOURNMENT,32,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-08-11,"—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
To fully answer this question would require an extensive review of files to be undertaken, which is not an efficient and effective use of Departmental resources. If there is a specific meeting which is of concern, details of that meeting may be able to be supplied subject to any commercial in confidence concerns. My department does not hold records of any meetings which may have been attended by officers of other Departments.
