"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I start by saying that this bill is not an insignificant one. It is a bill which sets up a regulatory mechanism for Australia's biggest properly holder, developer and consumer, and that is, of course, the Commonwealth government and its agencies. Essentially, this bill is about how one handles the state regimes, rules, regulations and legislation in respect of the coverage of the Commonwealth and its operations. We are particularly talking about environment protection legislation.
The objective that the government seeks to attain here is the objective that we sought to attain with this legislation when we were in government before 1996. That was to achieve national conformity and national uniformity in application of state rules and regulations. It is interesting to note at this particular juncture that what the Commonwealth seeks to do here for its agencies is something that it is not seeking to do with other environmental legislation which will soon be before this chamber. It is not demanding of that legislation with respect to the corporate sector the same degree of national uniformity. The environment protection impact legislation is 
 legislation that will be before us very soon and is legislation which in effect devolves national responsibility in many respects to the states.
It is okay for the Commonwealth as a major player to demand and to require national uniformity but, for some particular reason that is unknown, I think, to a major part of the corporate community, that degree of national uniformity is something that this government is not seeking in respect of other environmental legislation. So the question we have before us today essentially is not that we achieve uniformity but that we achieve adequacy of regulations and legislation in protection of the environment. There is a history to this legislation. The genesis of this legislation was, as I say, a process involving state and federal governments undertaken by the previous Labor government. As a consequence of that process, legislation was introduced into the parliament, but legislation which has been substantially changed by this particular government.
In approaching the legislation before us today, what the Labor opposition is attempting to do is to go back to that starting point of the pre-1996 legislation and to recognise that many of the processes that led to that were quite constructive but also to recognise the objectives of that legislation. In doing so, what we are about today is to try and beef up this particular legislation. We recognise that there are a number of major inadequacies in it. Also, in having that starting point, we recognise that some of the amendments to be moved by Senator Allison to the legislation are amendments which do not really conform to the structure and to the objectives of this legislation which the government set out to achieve in 1996 and as governments have set out to achieve now. So in a sense we will probably take a bit of a midway course, but it is a course that will ensure that this legislation is beefed up.
Let us turn to the bill. The bill provides for the application of certain state and territory environment protection laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies in an attempt to create and implement a scheme of uniform national standards. These standards in the legislation 
 are known as national environment protection measures. The bill is also the second chapter in a legislative approach characterised by cooperative Commonwealth-state standard setting, an approach which was commenced by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994. Specifically, this bill provides five different methods for the implementation of NEPMs which are made under the National Environment Protection Council Act.
The bill provides several methods by which the Commonwealth can implement these measures in order that they will apply to the Commonwealth. These are: applying certain state laws to Commonwealth places, applying certain state and territory laws to Commonwealth activities, the making of regulations, environmental audits or environmental management plans and the use of existing Commonwealth laws. The council act of 1994 provides for the making of measures related to seven particular environmental issues: air quality, water quality, noise standards, site contamination, hazardous waste, recycling and motor vehicle emissions. It is a bill which is designed to apply these measures to the Commonwealth once they have been finalised.
As I said at the outset, governments have been trying to get the balance right in respect of Commonwealth and state responsibilities for quite some time. The constitution has provided some source of guidance. It also has to be said that the courts in this country have been critical in providing a capacity for governments to recognise and to exercise their responsibilities. According to the Bills Digest produced by the Parliamentary Library, the difficulties in securing uniform environmental protection outcomes were alluded to in that report. The library is referring to the 1996 Commonwealth State of the environment report. In that particular report the independent advisory panel commented:
The national ability to manage the environment is continually hamstrung by structural problems between different areas of government. Standards vary from State to State, and State and Commonwealth governments frequently battle over environmental issues.
The recent history—over the last 25 to 30 years or so—of protection of the environment 
 in this country is littered with those sorts of conflicts. There have been high profile issues, the protection of wilderness areas, and there has been a need for the federal government, over the last 25 to 30 years, to intervene to protect some areas of national importance.
Unfortunately, in recent days this federal government does not seem to have the same compulsion or the same degree of moral obligation to protect such internationally accepted areas. But not just the major issues have been of concern and have raised friction between the Commonwealth and states; minor ones, the local ones, have also been issues of concern. When it comes to this particular legislation, much of the impact of it is to confront the issues that are raised by measures of government affecting local communities. Achieving uniformity is one thing but recognising one's responsibility as a federal government is another. That is an objective that we will try to meet through amendments.
The bill before us presents itself as a decision to bind the Commonwealth to measures found in state laws. In addressing the question as to whether the bill meets that objective, the conclusion we come to is that it does not do so. The idea of the Commonwealth meeting environmental standards found in state laws for the measures scheme makes sense for two main reasons. First, there is a need for consistency amongst national pollution control and environment protection laws. This scheme of national uniformity would hardly be a truly national scheme unless the Commonwealth was bound to such a scheme.
The second reason, speaking frankly, is that the Commonwealth must address concerns about the environmental impacts of Commonwealth activities. It is a fact that the activities of the Commonwealth and its authorities can have a significant environmental impact. As I said earlier, they do not have to be national to have an impact. They can have an enormous, pervasive impact on quite a number of communities across this country. For instance, the Commonwealth is a major landowner and operates a wide range of facilities which involve a number of land uses with potential to contaminate land with toxic and hazardous waste.
For example, the Bills Digest mentioned earlier refers to the National Transmission Authority which in 1996 was storing over 33 tonnes of highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) material at its 500 sites throughout Australia, posing significant health and environmental risks. Can I say, as a former administrative services minister, that the effect and the spread of Commonwealth property and the contaminated nature of it is something which has to be of continuing concern to government.
Let us go to the issues. The essential question in respect of this bill is whether it adequately resolves the existing legal uncertainties surrounding the question of Commonwealth environmental responsibilities under state law. This issue has been raised for quite some time and, more recently, in a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 June last year. The report was entitled, `State pushes to end exemptions on prosecutions for polluting'. The report stated that New South Wales was seeking a test case to break the long-held perception of standing exemptions of Commonwealth agencies from state pollution control laws.
New South Wales was seeking that. According to the report, all `Commonwealth agencies in New South Wales were believed to be the subject of examination' by the New South Wales EPA. These included military bases, the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor site, Sydney airport and telecommunications facilities. Had the New South Wales EPA found a test case and run it, it could have opened very easily a new chapter in legal relations between the Commonwealth and the states.
But, whilst New South Wales was looking for that case, in 1997 the High Court in the Henderson case revisited this very difficult question of the application of state laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies. In that particular case the decision of the High Court in August 1997 has considerably reduced the extent to which the Commonwealth and its agents can claim a broad constitutional immunity from state laws. The court found that New South Wales residential tenancy law applied to the activities of the Defence Hous 
 ing Authority. It was a 6-1 decision of the court. It was a 6-1 majority which rejected the broad proposition that the Commonwealth cannot be bound by state legislation.
I mention this particularly because one of the amendments we will be seeking to make to this legislation will be to have an opting out arrangement rather than an opting in arrangement. We want a broader application of state legislation rather than having that legislation applied only by individual measures. In that respect, we also do not want to overturn the principles adopted by the High Court in 1997.
New South Wales is not the only state to be concerned. Victoria also has concerns with this particular legislation. In respect of clause 9, for instance, the Victorian government's EPA in its submission to the Senate environmental committee inquiry into the bill stated:
Clause 9 expressly excludes the application of State laws to Commonwealth places or activities, unless they are applied by the Environment Minister under the Bill.
This, says Victoria, in joining with the message from New South Wales, is a significant step backwards. It continued:
Passage of the Bill in its current form would leave States in the clearly unacceptable position where none of their environment laws apply to the Commonwealth, with no guarantee, or even presumption that those laws will be applied.
New South Wales is also concerned about this pick and choose approach which the Commonwealth is reflecting in this legislation. It ought to be made known at this point in the debate that this was an approach the previous legislation had rejected and the opposition's amendments with respect to clause 9 will be to try to restore the principles adopted in the previous legislation. It is important to note that the response of Environment Australia in respect of this point is as follows:
The inclusion of the present clause 9 does not purport to suspend all State environmental provisions, only those implementing a NEPM. Clause 9, for example, would not suspend a whole piece of legislation, only the provisions of it that implemented the NEPM in question.
Even though Environment Australia says that, we feel that objective is not adequately met 
 by this legislation. As I said, we will try to redress that. We do have concerns as to the application of the legislation and we have concerns with legislation which we think focuses more on exemptions of the Commonwealth from the application of state and territory laws than it does on compliance. We are concerned with legislation before us which provides the environment minister with virtually unfettered discretions as to the application of such exemptions on what may be perceived as spurious or indefensible grounds. We are concerned with this legislation because it contains inadequate accountability measures and public scrutiny measures.
The reporting mechanism reflected in this legislation is elaborate, overly bureaucratic and convoluted. We are concerned with the legislation because it expressly exempts the Commonwealth from prosecution for criminal offences and we are also concerned with this legislation because the heaviest penalties of the bill fall on those who are concerned to protect the environment—whistleblowers—rather than polluters. Without prolonging the debate at this stage I indicate that the opposition is supporting the bill but, in supporting the bill, there are quite a number of amendments that we will be moving in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-02,"—The stated purpose of the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998  is to apply the national environment protection measures to the Commonwealth and its authorities as part of a scheme of uniform national standards. According to the government, it aims to harmonise and standardise national environment protection standards. It also claims to give all Australians the benefit of equivalent environment protection and to ensure that investment decisions of business are not distorted by variations in environmental standards between Australian jurisdictions.
The government says it is to stop forum shopping by industries looking to find the state or territory which has the lowest environmental protection standards. In fact, in the Democrats' view, quite the opposite outcome appears likely. This is just one of the ways in 
 which the stated aim of the bill is at odds with what the bill does. In the case of the NEPMs, if we can call them that, the difficulties in reaching consensus as to the content of the national environment standards means that the NEPC will be tempted to settle on lowest common denominator outcomes. Essentially this bill relies on state legislation which, firstly, mirrors the NEPC Act and, secondly, creates the National Environment Protection Council. The NEPC has the job of making national environment protection measures and these measures can consist of one or more of the following seven matters, but not more than those seven: ambient air quality; ambient marine, estuarine and fresh water quality; noise standards; site contamination assessment guidelines; hazardous waste impacts; reuse and recycling of used materials; and motor vehicle noise and emissions.
The Democrats believe that the definition of activity under the bill should be broadened to include the formulation of environmental policy, environmental decision making, cumulative effects and indirect effects. The bill provides several methods by which the Commonwealth can implement NEPMs in order that they will apply to the Commonwealth: applying certain state laws to Commonwealth places, applying certain state and territory laws to Commonwealth activities, making regulations, having environmental audits or environmental management plans and using existing Commonwealth laws.
The NEPC Act 1994 provides for the making of NEPMs related to air quality, water quality, noise standards, site contamination, hazardous waste, recycling and motor vehicle emissions. Its stated aim is to apply the NEPMs to the Commonwealth activities, once they have been finalised. However, the essence of this bill is to exempt Commonwealth activities from state laws, unless the federal minister takes active steps to apply them. Unlike activities carried out by other bodies, the Commonwealth is not routinely obliged to comply with state laws. It is not a matter for the minister to exempt the Commonwealth properties; he or she must take action to ensure compliance. Even many of the states do not regard this as being in keeping with 
 the spirit of their agreement with the Commonwealth. The ACT government said:
. . . the Bill seems more directed to ensuring the Commonwealth agencies are not bound by State and Territory laws to implement NEPMs than it is to giving effect to environment objectives.
Even the Victorian state government was critical of the fact that the grounds for exemption, such as administrative efficiency or national interest, were extremely broad. The national interest is defined as Australia's foreign relations; international obligations; national security and defence; a national emergency; telecommunications activities; the management of aviation, airspace or airports, including aircraft noise and emissions; and any other matter agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. In the Commonwealth's very wide range of facilities and properties, there are some actual and potentially highly contaminating land uses. Hazardous waste is stored, and air, noise and water pollution are not uncommon.
In March last year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts reported on environmental management of Commonwealth land. In the opinion of this committee `compliance by the Commonwealth with State and local government environment protection laws and regulations' were `fundamental to the development of a coordinated approach to environmental management by Commonwealth agencies'. The committee called for a national policy, particularly for environmental management of Commonwealth land and particularly for contaminated sites and for prevention. It said:
The absence of a clear Commonwealth policy framework is a major constraint on departments and management entities seeking to establish priorities and actions in line with best current practice.
Time does not permit me to give a full account of the many problems identified by the audit but, for instance, as Senator Bolkus has already mentioned, in 1996 the National Transmission Authority was storing 33 tonnes of highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyl. There were 1,060 identified ordnance sites throughout Australia in 1996.
The Management Audit Branch of the Department of Defence found that the Air Force failed to follow procedures for the management of hazardous materials, toxic wastes were being stored and disposed of inappropriately and there was discharge of contaminants into stormwater and possibly the watertable. Poorly managed and uncontrolled disposal sites and, in some cases, inappropriate dumping of scheduled wastes posed a potential risk to personnel. There was leakage and spillage around hazardous waste storage and disposal sites and, finally, inadequate records for the storage of hazardous wastes. So, not only does the Commonwealth have many potential and existing environmental hot spots; its failure to adequately manage them is already known, or at least to the extent that audits have been done.
Furthermore, the bill has been widely criticised as being unnecessarily complex and convoluted—particularly the enforcement mechanism—and that, far from creating harmonious uniformity, it has in fact blurred and confused the Commonwealth-state responsibilities. One state EPA offered the view:
The bill exacerbates the existing uncertainties about the application of State laws to Commonwealth agencies. No one knows if and when State laws will apply.
The bill does not in fact make any clear commitment to adopt state laws for Commonwealth places and activities, even though section 7 of the NEPC Act is for this to occur. The bill clearly has more to do with exemption for the Commonwealth from state laws than with compliance.
The NEPC legislation was largely agreed to in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment back in 1992 in an attempt to reduce the conflict between the Commonwealth and the state governments on environment issues. The Commonwealth undertook to reach consensus agreement with the states on environmental matters and agreed to avoid taking action to override state government decisions.
It might be worth noting that, so far, draft NEPMs have only been prepared on the National Pollutant Inventory, air standards, hazardous wastes and contaminated sites. In 
 the case of the National Pollutant Inventory, we saw the government take a very conservative course by declaring only 36 substances to be required to be recorded when discharged to air or water, and this compares with over 200 in similar legislation in the United States.
One of the significant constraints of the NEPMs is the requirement to have regard to a range of social, economic and regional factors. As with the way this government has dealt with so many environment issues since coming to office, short-term economic gains are given a higher priority than long-term sustainability. Also typical for this government are the very wide discretionary powers given to the minister. The Environment Defenders Office said in their submission that this discretionary structure `raises serious problems of ministerial accountability, in addition to the risk of politically expedient, but environmentally unjustified decisions'.
The Australian Democrats' preferred approach to environmental protection would be one where the Commonwealth took a leadership role which resulted in unifying legislation requiring general duty of care for the environment in all jurisdictions. Until that happens, in our view the Commonwealth ought to show the way by at least being prepared to commit its activities to both state and Commonwealth legislation. There may well be an argument for exemption in some circumstances. However, we would argue that this should only be warranted if it is a matter of public health and safety or national security.
It is quite extraordinary to us that this bill gives the Commonwealth so many escape clauses. There is nothing in the legislation which makes the Commonwealth liable to be prosecuted for an offence, and in fact there is no adequate enforcement regime to give affected parties any rights.
The bill obliges the Commonwealth to report, but it is not obliged to monitor and report publicly on how well the goals of an environmental management plan are being achieved, so the public would have no way of knowing whether or not a report had been filed. This fails as any sort of accountability measure. We would like to see a Common 
 wealth enforcement system at least equivalent to that in the United States, perhaps overseen by a section of Environment Australia.
In contrast to the lack of enforcement for the Commonwealth is the provision for a conviction, punishable by imprisonment for up to two years, for an employee of a government who, in the course of implementing a NEPM on Commonwealth property, directly or indirectly discloses information obtained from a search of land occupied by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. In other words, this legislation is very tough on anyone who might blow the whistle on the government.
The bill also seeks to do away with the production of potential evidence in a court. While these clauses do provide exceptions, we believe these measures are not in the spirit of full and true disclosure in environmental performance matters.
The Democrats will, in dealing with this legislation, look to give effect to the government's stated aims and to honour its commitments made in intergovernmental agreements. We will make sure we give effect to the government's rhetoric about the importance of a level playing field. I think it is bad enough that the government has no real national policy on environment protection for its activities, but why should the Commonwealth be allowed to operate with absolutely no environmental constraints? It does not make any sense to allow the pollution of soil, air and water at a facility just because it is in Commonwealth hands, and of course that pollution will not just be confined to that site.
Our amendments seek to see that the rules on polluting the environment and on air and noise emissions are the same for the Commonwealth as they are for every other government, including local government, and for every other individual and company.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-02,"—At the outset, I think it is important to reiterate the comments I made on Monday about the total opposition of the Greens (WA) to debating the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998  during the current session. With a very short spring sitting, we were 
 given little of the legislation to be debated. We were given no idea about the order in which the 18 packages of bills listed for debate in these sittings were to be debated. But we were given assurances that we only needed to prepare those 18 packages of bills. It obviously was not a core promise because we are here debating a major environmental bill with little notice. The government appears not to want any serious examination of this bill, and I am not surprised.
You only have to look at the report of the Senate committee to see the government's lack of commitment to consultation on this bill. The committee advertised the inquiry in the Weekend Australian on 6 December 1997 with a closing date for submissions of 12 January 1998—so, smack in the middle of the Christmas period were the opening and closing dates for submissions. And, surprise, surprise, after that enormous period for preparation of submissions on the bill, the grand total of three submissions were received and the committee determined not to bother with any public hearings. With that exhaustive process out of the way, you would have thought that the government would proceed at full pace to debate this very high priority legislation. But, no, we did not see the bill listed for possible debate until the Spring sittings—that were never going to be in August this year because of the election.
The government needs to be aware that, while it may have ministerial and departmental staff who do little else but live and breathe these particular bills, for my staff bills are considered on a needs basis. If they are listed for debate in the near future, they are considered and prepared. If not, they go into the pending file. From our point of view, this is a necessity for getting bills properly considered. As I indicated earlier, because this bill was clearly not listed for debate in the spring sittings the NEPM bill was in my adviser's pending file until Monday.
Let us have a look at why the government is so keen to flick the bill through such scant attention. The reality is that, despite its laudable aims, the bill only adds to the confusion of environmental law in this country—a situation which will be even more confused 
 after the passage of the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 (No. 2)  next year. Or will it be next week?  Will another bill suddenly appear on the list, which we will have to suddenly debate?
My concerns were well expressed by Senator Allison and Senator Schacht in their respective minority reports, and in the opposition comments in the committee report on this bill. They point to confusion, complexity and problems with the substantial ministerial discretion contained in this bill. There is no point in this government going to the international arena, with their steadily reduced credibility, and saying, `We have the world's best environment laws' when they are all discretionary—or most are discretionary. The reality is they are not enforceable by the public, who know they are being broken.
As the name implies, this bill relates to national environmental protection measures, which are meant to be uniform standards agreed to by all governments in Australia. The fundamental problem, however, is that the nature of the process for uniform standards creates a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards, so we are looking at the lowest common denominator. In the same way that we have a push for internationally competitive labour rates and corporate taxation, we see pressure for lower and lower environmental standards so that we can attract corporate investment to this country. In addition, there are concerns about the scope of NEPMs, which are currently limited to seven areas: ambient air quality; ambient marine, estuarine and fresh water quality; noise standards; site contamination assessment guidelines; hazardous waste impacts; reuse and recycling of used materials; and motor vehicle noise and emissions.
I have been involved in an issue in Western Australia in recent times which highlights one of the concerns about this approach to environmental issues. The issue was the proposal to dump toxic waste at a site near Toodyay, which is 100 kilometres north-east of Perth. Whilst there is an NEPM dealing with contaminated sites, it appears that lack of political will on the part of various governments has meant that there is no commitment to 
 proceed with an NEPM in relation to the disposal of the contaminated material from those sites. Thankfully, massive public pressure led to the abandonment of this particular proposal, but the issue highlighted a major shortfall in national guidelines for toxic waste disposal and storage.
This bill implements the Commonwealth's commitment, under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, to enact legislation to implement national environment protection measures in its jurisdiction. Any agreement that the Commonwealth makes in relation to toxic sites cannot in any way, shape or form be done simply by negotiating with state governments. The people who deal with toxic sites on a daily basis are largely local governments, so waste disposal and toxic sites must take in the good work that is done by many councils and the not so good work by other councils—but basically at the level of local government—otherwise you are not going to get a realistic or enforceable or practical outcome in relation to any agreement on waste disposal or toxic sites.
The essence of the Commonwealth legislation is that state or territory laws implementing the NEPM regime do not apply to Commonwealth activities except by declaration of the Commonwealth environment minister. As the Bills Digest suggests, the whole question of Commonwealth-state responsibility for environment protection is very confused, and this bill does little to clarify the situation.
It is worth noting in passing that this lies at the heart of my concerns relating to constitutional reform in this country. Debate in this country on constitutional reform has been deliberately focused on the minimalist question of the head of state, but little debate has been on important issues such as the respective roles for the three levels of government in relation to environmental protection and community development. It is about time we had that debate rather than pursuing the coalition's devolution approach. Or should that be the Pontius Pilate approach? The Greens (WA) will not be supporting the second reading of this bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I speak to this National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998 , noting that it is a substantially different proposition from the version of the bill that was first proposed by the Labor government. It distorts the original intent of the provisions of that original proposition advanced by Labor when in government. This bill was first introduced in 1996 but lapsed due to the March 1996 election. The bill was extensively amended by the Howard government when it was presented to the Senate on 21 October 1997. The second reading debate had not concluded when the parliament was prorogued.
On the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee, it was referred to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts committee in November 1997, and this committee reported in March 1998. Given the importance of this legislation, I was somewhat surprised to read in the committee's report that the advertisements for the inquiry into this bill were placed on 6 December 1997 with a closing date for submissions of 12 January 1998, and that the committee had received only three submissions by the closing date. That is not surprising, if one thinks for a moment about what people are doing over the Christmas-New Year period. I think very little attention would be paid to writing submissions to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communication and the Arts Legislation Committee.
When the committee finally did get around to considering these matters, it found it had before it 12 submissions in total. However, I also note in this report that the committee did not hold a public hearing into the bill and that officers of the relevant department did not have a forum in which to respond to the criticisms of the proposed legislation that were made in the various submissions to the committee.
What we found was that the inquiry which took place consisted of an exchange of documents between officers of the department and the various interest groups that expressed concern about the bill. It strikes me, given the importance of the issues canvassed in this bill, that a better process of consultation should 
 have been developed by the committee. While it is unfortunate that that did not occur, I note that the report does contain a considerable number of issues that warrant further public debate. I am sure that Senator Kay Patterson, who signed the committee report on behalf of the government, would have given very thorough consideration to the issues raised in the report. As I say, they are very substantial indeed.
Labor Party's concerns about this bill have been borne out in the evidence that was presented through the 12 submissions to the committee. The Labor Party highlighted in its minority report that the bill, firstly, focuses more on exemptions of the Commonwealth from the application of state and territory laws than it does on compliance; secondly, provides the environment minister with virtually unfettered discretions as to the application of such exemptions on what may be perceived as spurious or indefensible grounds; and, thirdly, contains inadequate accountability measures.
An elaborate, overly bureaucratic and convoluted reporting mechanism takes the place of any strong and public accessible reporting and enforcement mechanism and the bill fails the accountability transparency test that might be applied in just about any other area of the environmental legislation. Fourthly, the bill expressly exempts the Commonwealth from prosecution for an offence and, fifthly, the heaviest penalties fall upon the whistleblowers rather than polluters. These are matters of some concern and I trust that at the committee stage of the bill an opportunity will be given to allow further discussion of these matters.
I have said that there were no public hearings on the bill and there was little opportunity to judge the government's responses to the criticisms that had been made of the bill. Nonetheless, it is important to canvass some of the concerns that have been expressed. For instance, the Department of Defence highlights their concerns about the resource implications of implementing the NEPMs, given that it is a requirement of this bill that departments meet cost implications from their 
 own budgets. I trust that the minister will be able to address that issue in his reply.
The states and territories have raised concerns about the lack of consultation on the legislation. The legislation purports to involve state authorities at various levels and I would have thought that there would have been further discussions with the states and territories about the implications of that. It is an interesting and ironic point that both the conservation groups and the states are coming to this question and reaching the same conclusion—I suggest perhaps for entirely different reasons, but essentially the same point is being made, that these issues are far too important to be allowed to be swept under the carpet without public debate.
Concerns have been raised about the definitions contained in the bill that go to the issue of the so-called national interest. On my reading of the measures highlighted, the national interest is presumably defined as matters including foreign relations; international obligations; national security; national defence; a national emergency; telecommunications activity; management of aviation, airspace or airports; and other matters agreed between the Commonwealth, states and territories.
This is an extremely broad range of issues and, I might suggest, it is open to some considerable controversy. For instance, when the issue of communications is being discussed, particularly in a privatised telecommunications industry, one has, I think, legitimate concerns about the extent to which private companies seek to avoid their community responsibilities and environmental obligations by calling upon the provisions of this bill. It applies equally to privatised airports and the extent to which private firms are able to exempt themselves from the community obligations under the terms of this bill.
As to other matters in terms of the defence powers, I think there are always matters of some considerable debate about the appropriateness of the Commonwealth being able to call upon such a broad range of claims as to what is a national emergency or a matter of national security. We notice that there has 
 been a lack of consultation about these matters. I do not think the defences put in the government's response to this committee of inquiry are adequate. I trust that they too will be able to be responded to at the committee stage of the bill.
It appears that there are some inconsistencies in the way in which the Commonwealth has approached this matter through the COAG review of Commonwealth-state responsibilities and the environment which allows the Commonwealth, from my reading of this provision, to pick and choose which state laws and regulatory authorities it can comply with and those which it cannot.
That would not be such a major problem if there were some consistency in the Commonwealth's approach to these issues and we could, therefore, subject to ministerial discretions, have some form of public assessment. But it would appear under this bill that the ministerial accountability provisions are minimal. The ministerial discretions are extremely wide and, given the history of the implementation of environmental laws in this country, particularly in my state, where we see the EPA used essentially in a most arbitrary manner to defend projects for which state ministers seem to have a particular fondness, or where there appears to be some special relationship between private interests and state authority, it is a matter of deep concern that the ministerial discretion is so wide.
I acknowledge that relying upon state laws is not an adequate response to this concern, as we saw, for instance, with the building of the Citylink project in Melbourne, where the advice provided by the state department to the Commonwealth was totally inadequate and, I might say, quite misleading. It was claimed that environmental assessment measures had been taken which, of course, were not undertaken and which, at the very least, one could only describe as being totally inadequate. So we find that it is not entirely appropriate to rely solely on the provisions of state law; it is equally not appropriate, in my judgment, to give ministerial discretion such a broad writ as is proposed in this bill. The New South Wales government's submission to the Senate inquiry stated:
The National Interest criteria for excluding the operations of the bill is too broad . . . the lack of scope has the potential to cause considerable uncertainty.
My particular concern here is that ministerial actions are taken not for sound environmental reasons but because of political discrimination against one group or another or in favour of one group or another. As we have seen in the recent disputes concerning uranium mining, it is quite apparent that this government has a very limited view of its obligations to protect the community at large.
For instance, in Queensland, there is the matter of Hinchinbrook and other matters. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you would be only too well aware of the way in which the Commonwealth has approached environmental issues in such a cavalier manner that suggests that the concerns being expressed by agencies such as the Environmental Defender's Office do have considerable merit. The Environmental Defender's Office highlights that this provision of ministerial accountability may in fact allow for governments to circumvent this bill by using regulations to avoid implementing NEPMs, despite what this government has said about its intent with regard to this legislation.
There is a lack of clarity about the way in which governments will act. There is a lack of accountability, to the point where governments are able to act on environmental matters out of political expediency rather than by following sound environmental practices. If one examines for just a short while the environmental record of this government on a range of issues, one has reason for concern.
Another issue raised in the report goes to the question of enforcement. It would appear that under this bill the enforcement provisions are effectively non-existent. Environmental impact statements, whilst not precluded, are not required as regards the application of a provision of state or territory law. Further, as Environment Australia points out, the use of environmental audits will be quite limited.
The Commonwealth and a significant number of authorities are protected from criminal liability under the provisions of this 
 bill, and the bill provides for criminal liability for state officials but not for its agents.	I acknowledge that governments have to be careful on this point. In particular, a distinction has to be drawn between imposing liabilities on the Crown as a body politic and imposing criminal liability specifically on servants of the Crown.
Considerable attention needs to be paid to ensure that public servants are not liable to prosecution for actions undertaken on behalf of government so long as the terms of the offence are undertaken as a direct result of government policy, in which case ministers should be held accountable rather than individuals. Nonetheless, there is concern being expressed in the community about the way in which there appears to be a double standard exercised here between Commonwealth public servants and state public servants. There are no realistic sanctions for Commonwealth authorities who do not adequately seek to implement environmental action plans.
Finally, there is concern being expressed about the lack of accountability mechanisms within this bill. There is no public scrutiny of Commonwealth actions regarding the implementation of NEPMs. There is a lack of monitoring or reporting arrangements on how well the goals of an environmental management plan are being achieved. A strong point is made in the Senate committee report, and I quote directly from it:
There was a strong feeling in submissions that the bill did call for strong accountability mechanisms to be put in place and certain groups argued for greater public scrutiny of Commonwealth actions in relation to the implementation of NEPMs. In particular, the Environmental Defender's Office deplored the lack of a clear obligation on the Commonwealth to monitor and report publicly on how well the goals of an environmental management plan are being achieved.
This report was signed off by Senator Kay Patterson. I trust that these are the views that she fully supported. I am sure she would not have signed off the report unless she did agree with the propositions put. I commend the reading of this report. I am sure Senator Hill will give us the benefit of his advice on these matters and the concerns raised by the committee in regard to this bill.
Clearly, this is a very important matter. It is a pity that there has not been greater public debate on these concerns. It is a shame that this matter is being dealt with in this way. Nonetheless, I trust that in the committee stage of the bill these issues will be attended to in far greater detail.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I want to take up one aspect of this issue which, as Senator Carr has said, is a very important issue. Indeed, it is essential because it deals with the environment and the way that we, as a nation, are going to look after the natural endowments with which we have been blessed.
The issue of the relationships that should exist between the states and the Commonwealth, and between the states themselves, is an ongoing one. It is time there was a formal debate about that issue. On that point, I want to refer to a report prepared in December 1992 on the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown. It was a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
—It had a very good chairman.
—Yes, I see that from Queensland there was a Senator William O'Chee. They left out the `George', which gives it more of a flurry, Senator O'Chee.
Anthony Anderton was on the inquiry's staff at that time—a person who has been neglected in a way he should not have been. He said at that time that the Shield of the Crown was an issue that had not died and that was still in operation. In the context in which he prepared the report, the legislation at issue at that time was the Trade Practices Act and the corporations legislation—the Australian Securities Commission being an example.
That problem of the relationships between the states and what the Commonwealth can and cannot do is, again, a question in this legislation. One way through these problems is to have an objective as to what we, as a nation, want to do about the environment. As I see things, too often we get caught up in the mechanics of the relationship between various governments and what ministers may or may 
 not do rather than define for ourselves a vision and objective of where we want to go on the issue of the environment. The issue has been raised already in debate about the power of the minister, in this context, to make operative particular legislation that might come from the states. I think that is too narrow a basis on which to have legislation like this decided.
We ought to remember the vision of what Australia, with its states, is all about. Sir Garfield Barwick, who was then Chief Justice of Australia, had this to say at the start of the seventies in the case of Victoria v. the Commonwealth:
I have observed elsewhere that the Constitution does not represent a treaty or union between sovereign and independent States. It was the result of the will and desire of the people of all the colonies expressed both through their representative institutions and directly through referenda to be united in one Commonwealth with an agreed distribution of governmental power.
Later, in his decision in that case, he had this to say:
The constitutional arrangements of the colonies were retained by, and subject to, the Constitution as the constitutional arrangements for the government of those portions of the Commonwealth to be known as States. These, though coterminous in geographical area with the former colonies, derived their existence as States from the Constitution itself: and being parts of the Commonwealth became constituent States.
The concept we have to get through to ourselves—and to everybody else for that matter—is that we are a nation: not a collection of warring states, but a nation. No matter what part of Australia is affected, it is going to affect us all as Australians. The constitution underpins that concept, not only in terms of Australia as a whole but also in terms of the very states that arose out of the constitution, as Sir Garfield Barwick said.
One of the problems we face—and I think it is faced in this legislation—is that we talk about the environment as if it is a battle between the states and the Commonwealth. If the states introduce a particular environmental law which may not be good for the environment, then the Commonwealth should be able to reject it—not only reject it legally, but somehow reject it conceptually. The problem 
 is that our view of the environment in this country is a divided view. It is a view that we take not as Australians but as Victorians, Tasmanians, South Australians, Western Australians, Queenslanders—a great state from which you come, Madam Acting Deputy President—and so on.
A lot of the problems that come about in this area of environmental protection—and, indeed, in other areas—arise from our concept of what sort of people we are. We are able to solve this problem with, for example, the Corporations Law. I think that has worked well. Until the Corporations Law was passed, the concept was that there were different states with different laws. Way back that was quite pronounced. It is time we recognised that it is profitable, right and proper for us all to see things as one country—not only in terms of the economy but also in terms of the environment.
I hope that during the committee stage of this bill the minister will address the idea of going to a concept where we are Australians as a whole—where we all have a purchase on every part of the place, and where we are not a group of separate colonies which, in some instances, deigns to unite for a particular purpose.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions. It seems that, except for the Greens, all parties and individual senators will support the bill. They seem reluctant to support any environmental reform introduced by this government, and we just have to live with that fact.
This is an important piece of legislation. If I might pick up the theme of Senator Cooney, it is an attempt to implement environmental laws on a national scale and to implement consistent environmental laws across the country. It supports a mechanism that was negotiated between the Commonwealth and states and came into effect in 1992, whereby these national standards for environmental protection would be determined through a cooperative state-Commonwealth structure. A number of them under our government have 
 already been determined, such as ambient air quality standards.
The issue then becomes how best to legislatively provide for those standards. Of course, as has been said, the Commonwealth traditionally has been somewhat reluctant to see itself bound by state laws as they apply to its operations. Nevertheless, the trend is towards an acceptance of that, with the remaining reservations being in particular in relation to areas where the Commonwealth would say that there is a particular national interest responsibility.
This obviously leads to debates on detail as to what is an appropriate national interest according to contemporary standards to justify that Commonwealth position. It also leads to a debate on the way in which state laws are to be implemented. Certainly the committee that examined this law did debate the issue as to whether the Commonwealth was given too great a discretion in the application of the state laws. That is something that no doubt we will have in the committee stage of this debate. There is always room to argue about whether this Commonwealth attempt to become part of the national scheme, this bill we are putting before the Senate—bearing in mind that all the states have already implemented their laws to bring into effect the national environment protection measures system across the country—is the best tool to achieve that objective. The debate on some of the detail we are about to have in the committee stage. But I appreciate the fact that the Senate is prepared to give this bill a second reading and look forward to the detailed debate on the provisions in the committee.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I thank Senator Hill for giving me the opportunity to speak much earlier than I had planned. I was assured that the previous debate would go for some hours. 
 It is just as well my staff and I are, as always, prepared for battle.
I wish today to speak on the  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998 , and I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we are opposing the passage of this bill. We do so not because we are opposed to the accreditation system but because we have serious concerns about the method that the government has used in consulting with the industry about the implementation of these measures and about the lack of knowledge that still exists about how the accreditation system payments are to be calculated. So we are using our opposition to the bill as a means of raising those concerns, rather than attacking the issue of accreditation.
This bill would insert into the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act a facility for the minister to set a schedule of fees that the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency would charge when processing applications from aged care facilities for their accreditation under the act. Accreditation under the act will be a prerequisite for receiving government subsidies from January 2001, so the actual accreditation is vital for all providers because without it they will not receive government funding. Therefore, the issues about whether facilities can cope with the accreditation system and afford the costs associated with it are vital to the future of aged care.
The Labor Party supports any initiative that seeks to improve the standard of aged care. It was for this reason that in 1987 we introduced the inspection system for nursing homes, and extended it to hostels in 1991. Between that period and 1993-94, both nursing homes and hostels showed an improvement against all quality standards. That of course is very pleasing and reassuring for the Australian community. However, that inspection system, which is still operating, is wholly funded by the Commonwealth. We as a parliament took the decision that we ought to fund the system that ensured that standards were met in aged care facilities in Australia. It is because of our concern for those standards that we oppose these proposed amendments.
Providers in the aged care industry have genuine concerns about the transfer of responsibility that the bill represents and the implications for standards of care. The providers are also concerned about the lack of information available on the government's proposals for the fees. We seem to be getting mixed messages from the government on just what the proposed fees will cover. The minister in the other House has indicated that fees proposed in the amendment would `reflect the cost of the accreditation service'. This leaves open full recovery of the costs of running the accreditation agency—that is, they are proposing the complete transfer of funding of this responsibility from Commonwealth consolidated revenue to the actual providers, the facilitators of aged care. They will have to meet the costs of providing community assurance of standards in their own facilities.
The reality is that, under the proposed amendment, all these costs will be transferred to those providers from as early as 1 January 1999. The budget funding of the accreditation agency is subject to review and may be withdrawn, leaving the agency dependent upon fees charged to providers. It is unclear to us what the cost of the accreditation service will eventually be. Industry providers estimate the costs of actually carrying out the accreditation in each facility to be of the order of $5,000 to $10,000. If full recovery of costs is the government's intention, an additional $5.5 million would be added to the overall amount charged to the aged care industry. The accreditation agency's budget is $5.5 million, as reported in the last annual report.
When the budget of the agency is added to the possible costs of the accreditation process, each facility may be liable for a fee of $7,000 to $12,000. With approximately 3,000 facilities, this adds up to a potential $36 million worth of fees across the industry. As the fees that providers can charge residents are fixed by the government, along with the number of beds that the facilities can provide, the only option that facilities have for raising the money for these additional fees will be to make cuts in their running costs and service standards. 
By transferring the fees of the new accreditation agency and the costs associated with accreditation to the nursing homes, providers can only recover the costs by reducing the standards of care and by reducing the services they provide to residents. A large number of these facilities are not-for-profit providers. They are not people who have huge reserves or who have the potential to eat into profit margins. They are not-for-profit providers; they are community organisations, and the only way they can absorb these fees is by reducing the services.
There is real concern in some sections, and it is shared by the Labor Party, that this will have a very adverse effect on the small providers. There is no doubt that larger providers will be able to absorb these costs. They have the management systems and the computing systems in place that will ensure they are able to deal with the accreditation process. But 50 per cent of nursing homes have fewer than 41 beds. Many of these smaller facilities are located in rural and remote areas—a development we encouraged because we wanted older people to be able to move into facilities close to their families and close to where they have lived all their lives.
We have serious concerns that this sort of development, with the passing on of accreditation fees to small providers, might affect the viability of those services. So there is a real issue here, one that Ms Moylan, the former minister, highlighted in her speech in the House of Representatives. But it is an issue that the minister has failed to address other than by providing vague assurances that `it will all be alright, don't you worry about that'.
We can only estimate the potential scale of any fee. Providers have made repeated requests for some indication of the size of any fee that we impose on the sector as a result of the bill, yet the government have failed to provide any proper information. In fact the accreditation kit that they provided has a blank page with the heading, `Accreditation fees and charges'. But there is no information in it. They provide you with a kit with all the information about what you have to do, but 
 there is no indication of how much they are going to charge you.
The government has not been honest enough to state what accreditation fees would be introduced, and the providers have not been able to assess properly what impact the fees would have on their operations. It must also be remembered that the fee proposed by the amendment is not the only cost incurred by providers. Facilities may need to introduce new quality control and management systems, provide training to staff, and purchase new IT systems.
A recent survey of providers in my state indicates that the total cost of accreditation may be in the order of $50,000 per facility. This is a very real issue of viability for small providers. It would be tragic if the implementation of an accreditation system designed to ensure the maintenance of standards in the aged care industry was responsible for the erosion of those standards of care by forcing facilities to devote funds to the process of gaining accreditation under the government's new system.
The opposition is concerned that this measure represents another step in the government's attempt to cut funds to the residential aged care sector and pursue its policy of user pays in aged care. The government imposed fees on the residents in 1997, and it is now seeking to impose user-pays fees on the providers. It is shifting responsibility for the cost of aged care from the Commonwealth onto both the providers and the clients of aged care services in this country.
At the time the new charges were introduced in 1997, the government claimed that they were intended to cover capital improvements in the industry. The money raised by the infamous $12 a day accommodation charge will not raise the funds necessary for capital improvements in the aged care sector. Providers indicate that the amount raised by this charge is in the order of $240 million over five years, yet the minimum funds required for capital improvements are in the order of $400 million to $500 million. There is a shortfall of over $250 million in the funding that will be provided for the capital 
 improvements that everyone accepts are necessary in the industry.
This shortfall is exacerbated by the actions of the government which, in 1998-99, cut funding for capital assistance to residential aged care facilities by approximately $13 million—a 29 per cent cut in funding for this item. The government has also failed to highlight that funding for services to rural, remote and other special groups was cut by $5.4 million in the 1998-99 budget, which represented a 27 per cent cut in funding for this item.
If the government members who spoke in support of this bill in the House are true to their commitment to a user-pays system in the aged care sector, they will clearly have to support moves to increase the $12 per day accommodation charge. One of the reasons why we are expressing concern today is that we fear that the government will again seek to make amendments to the accommodation charges for aged care in this country. They are faced with the realisation that the funding measures they have introduced will not meet the capital needs of the industry. They know that the political settlement they reached late last year—in the final announcement prior to the election—will not meet the capital shortfall needs of the industry.
We are concerned that the government are actively reconsidering upping those charges. The whole logic of their approach of user pays, reflected in this bill, means that they will once again have to consider the issue of funding for nursing homes in this country and, if they are true to their user-pays approach, they will have to increase the charges for residents to meet those capital improvements. We are concerned that this is a continuation of the trend of shifting the costs onto the users of aged care services in Australia. However, it may also represent a reconsideration by the government of the charges that will need to be made, because they have pulled the accreditation issue out of the aged care reform package that we were promised in legislation, and have sought only to introduce this measure at this time.
We believe the charges will need to be increased if the government's intention of 
 using the accommodation charge to fully fund capital improvements is to be achieved. The shortfall is obvious, the problem is obvious, and the government's failure to provide any information on this issue in recent months is cause for great concern. We know that the providers are lobbying the government for an increase in the accommodation charge. The fact that the aged care amendment bill has not been introduced and that this bill has been introduced in a piecemeal way gives us real concern that the government is actively reconsidering increasing the charges.
Given all these concerns, I am not sure why the  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  has been rushed into this place in this way. There should have been more time for the government to make clear what fees were to be introduced. The accreditation charges to be levied could have been put out as a discussion document and there could have been proper consultation with the industry. We could then have had this debate today in the context of knowing exactly what charges were to be levied on the industry. That could have formed part of the debate.
We do not have that information, and yet we are looking at introducing enabling legislation that allows the government to charge fees to providers without any real idea of the level of fee to be charged, without any real idea of the impact on the industry, and without any real idea of the impact, therefore, on the services provided to clients. As I say, of particular concern to us is the impact on small providers as they try to deal with the accreditation system.
We think the government should continue to provide funding for the accreditation agency, at least for the first round of the accreditation process. This would allow many providers to go through that first round of accreditation, but would not require them to pay a potentially crippling fee on top of the many other expenses that will be incurred in trialling the new accreditation regime. It must be remembered that this is very much a trial of a new scheme. We support the move to accreditation, but we think we will have to monitor its effectiveness, and it is very much a question of seeing how it goes.
The issue of any fee that might be charged by the accreditation agency should be re-examined in the light of the first accreditation round and after the impact of the many other changes that this sector has recently faced have been taken into consideration. This sector has been badly knocked around and, in suffering reform fatigue, it is in need of some stability and surety. We think that this bill, by forcing them into unknown territory without proper consultation and without proper reassurance about the level of fees, is a very unwise move.
We support the maintenance of standards in aged care. We are opposing the bill on the basis that we think that the requirement that the industry pay perhaps over $30 million to administer the standards is not a reasonable impost, given the history of developments in this industry in recent times. We think that the transfer of responsibility for this process to the providers will lead to a reduction in the funds available to provide services to residents. It will particularly be a problem for small providers, and it may lead potentially to a reduction in the standard of care provided to residents.
Until our concerns about those matters can be addressed, we will be opposing the bill. We think it more appropriate that the government provide a draft schedule of fees, discuss the issue widely with the industry and then bring the bill before the parliament rather than seek to have the parliament give it a blank cheque to say, `Yes, you can set whatever fee level you think appropriate,' and hope that it all works out fine—hope that the agency does address the concerns of small providers and hope that the agency does provide a system which is not going to be a burden on industry. We think we would be abrogating our responsibilities if we took that approach. We think it far more appropriate that the government do the job first and then introduce the legislation in the parliament when it has a full knowledge of what the impact of the move will be.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (ACCREDITATION AGENCY) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-02,"—The bill we are debating today, the Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998 , is a bill that puts enables the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation 
 Agency to do a very necessary thing, and that is to charge aged care services fees for accreditation to enable it to partly fund its operation. The point is, of course, that from 2001 all aged care services must be accredited in order to receive Commonwealth subsidy for the provision of aged care. The government has established the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to manage the accreditation of aged care services. We agree with the government and with the Labor Party that it is very necessary that these things should be properly accredited and properly accountable.
I think all of us are concerned with this issue because all of us have relatives who are aged and therefore require this kind of assistance or assistance through other government measures, or we ourselves know that one day we will face the need for this kind of help. So there is no doubt about it that aged care is an issue that involves all of us, either by proxy or directly. This bill seeks to enable the agency to partly fund its operations through a fee.
I want to point out that the amendment does not set the level of fees for aged care services. That will be set through subordinate legislation, through regulations. We understand that those regulations will be subject to disallowance. We agree with the Labor Party that it really is a pig in a poke for the industry to be hearing that fees will be imposed but not to know what the level of the fees might be. But they are separate issues, and the Democrats do support the establishment of the agency and the ability of the agency to fund itself partly through this particular method. We will, however, be very careful to scrutinise the subordinate legislation, the regulations, which will set those fees. If necessary, we will certainly be involved in disallowing that schedule of fees if they are not realistic—realistic in terms of funding for the agency but, even more importantly, realistic in terms of the ability of the industry to cope with the level of fees charged. So the minister might address in his speech or in the committee stage the question of disallowance, that we have the assurance that we will have the ability to disallow the fee level if it is not in 
 line with what the Democrats believe is a fair thing.
The other issue which the Labor Party has raised is one which is also very important to me personally but also to the Democrats as well. That is the effect on small rural and remote communities and the ability of their services to pay fees when most of them are really struggling to maintain, in the government's words, their own aged folk within their own communities. The working title for some of these reforms that I think the Senate would remember was the title `Ageing in Place'. The Democrats very strongly endorse that concept, that not only should people be able to enter a facility and stay within that one place but also they should be able to enter aged care institutions within their geographic location, particularly for rural communities. People in rural areas who want to stay there ought to be able to do so and not have to be sent, or even have to make the choice to travel, hundreds of kilometres from where they have lived all their lives and where they have the support of friends and relatives, which are things that are very important to them.
The whole idea of ageing in place was one which we endorsed very strongly, and we want to make sure that for those small communities and those small services in those areas the fee structure will not inhibit their ability to operate when we know that many of them are really stretched in terms of their ability even at the present time. So another question to the minister to address is that we have had some assurance that there will be a differentiated fee for small rural and remote services, and we really do need on the record a very strong assurance that that will be so. Then, of course, once the regulations are put in place we will look at the schedule of fees to see if that is so.
We understand that the Labor Party will oppose the bill. As I have listened to the debate, I have had some sympathy for that position. But we believe that they are confusing two issues at this point. The two issues are whether or not the agency should be able to fund itself through a fee structure and the 
 level of fees themselves. We believe that we need to separate those two issues.
From our conversations, the feedback that we get from the industry is divided. But, on balance, the feedback is that the industry does believe that the agency should go ahead and that it should be able to charge fees but that, once the fees have been set, if they are too high we certainly need to have the ability to disallow them. So we would separate those two issues—as they are separate in terms of the legislation and the regulations—and we will support the legislation, although we will certainly listen to the debate. I know the Labor Party have amendments. I will be listening carefully to the justification for those amendments. At this stage I would not rule out supporting them, but we will need to hear the reasons for them. At this stage, however, the Democrats will support this legislation because we believe the principle is right.
Most of the groups to whom we spoke believe that giving the accreditation agency the ability to charge fees needs to be seen as a separate issue to the level of the fees themselves. Certainly that was the feedback we got from Aged Care Australia and Community Services Australia of the Uniting Church. They believe this legislation should be passed because, without the ability to charge for services, the accreditation process itself may fall over. As the Labor Party have said, nobody wants that to happen. We want the accreditation process to go ahead because that is absolutely critical.
Those are the issues on which we need to hear from the government. We understand the Labor Party's position in respect of their philosophy on aged care; that is, that the Commonwealth should be responsible for the total funding of aged care. We have had this debate on quite a number of occasions. The Democrats do not agree with that because we are simply aware of the reality of the tremendous cost which is involved. We have also said that we know there are people who are quite willing and able to make a contribution to their own care and their own accommodation in their old age. We would not want to inhibit those people from also contributing 
 and therefore, in a sense, cross-subsidising the people who are unable to pay.
The Senate would be aware of the work that the Democrats did with the major churches in establishing the subsidy for financially disadvantaged residents. I understand that that part of the reforms is the one part that is really working well. I understand that in most institutions there is no need for the mandatory level of financially disadvantaged residents and that most institutions are exceeding that because the $12 a day subsidy is actually working very well. We are pleased about that.
I need to put on the record that we do not altogether accept the Labor Party's position that the Commonwealth has to totally fund aged care. If, in an ideal world, that were possible, we would accept it. But I noted that even the Labor Party did not actually promise in their election policy on aged care to fund adequately the amount which would have been needed for the infrastructure upgrades. That really meant that the Labor Party were saying it was not really possible to do it totally through government funding.
That was one of the problems that we saw with the Labor Party's policy. In an ideal world we would endorse it, but in the real world there are those who are willing and able to pay for their accommodation in their old age. We believe there should be at least an ability for them to do so, while endorsing very strongly the subsidy which we helped to negotiate for financially disadvantaged residents.
The Democrats will be supporting this legislation. We will listen to the case for any reasonable amendments to it and at that time we will respond. But, in principle, the legislation has our support while we signal that, once the level of fees are established and providing that they are a disallowable instrument, we will certainly want to return to the debate about whether or not the fees which are set are fair. We certainly will want to have an assurance on—and will monitor very carefully—the effect of fees on rural, remote and small services.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (ACCREDITATION AGENCY) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998 which, to my mind, is just another aspect of this government's relentless attack on the elderly. On the surface, the bill seems reasonable enough. No-one would argue that there should not be an agency defending and ensuring a high standard of care within aged care facilities. However, it is the uncertainty surrounding the exact monetary implications of this measure that should be of particular concern. The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency is currently funded by grants made under the Aged Care Act. The bill before us seeks to enable the agency to charge fees for its accreditations, allowing it to recover costs. The problem is that the government has refused to give any solid indication of what these fees might be.
The fees must not be such as to amount to taxation but, beyond that rather vague assertion, we are completely in the dark as to what an accreditation might cost. Understandably enough, it has been fairly difficult for service providers to assess the impact the accreditation fee might have when they have no idea how much that fee might be. It has therefore been virtually impossible for anyone to gauge the impact of this bill.
If the fee is low the impact will be minimal. However, if the fee is implemented at a higher level, some small service providers could be forced out of business. The bill allows the agency to set fees at any level without parliamentary control. The government's failure to reveal the fee or even a possible range of prices has created an atmosphere of considerable uncertainty and apprehension among service providers. Hence, this bill has become just another example of this government's smoke and mirrors approach to reforming the aged care sector. They continue to speak in notional rather than specific terms and their policies fail to outline funding arrangements that will ultimately determine the survival or failure of small service providers in particular. It is the smaller service providers who will be hit hardest by this new measure, no matter what the fee ends up being.
At the moment, 50 per cent of nursing homes have fewer than 41 beds and many of these smaller facilities are in rural and remote 
 areas. Submissions to the current productivity inquiry into nursing home subsidies have indicated that nursing homes need at least 60 beds to operate efficiently under the government's regime. Given this fact, it does not take a rocket scientist to work out that there are quite a few service providers struggling to survive in this environment. How are these facilities expected to endure further decreases in Commonwealth funding? They will, under this measure, have another substantial cost to consider. The only trouble is they cannot even consider it at the moment because the government is refusing to tell them how much the fee will be.
I imagine that at the moment this bill represents a considerable nightmare for small service providers. They have not been able to lobby against it because, without knowing the cost, they cannot say how many facilities will be affected. At the same time, they are unable to reassure residents that everything will be all right because, quite frankly, they do not know. They do not know whether they will be there after this bill goes through. It is impossible to tell. Even if this government does not care about the service providers, what about the residents? How do you think those people feel, knowing that they may not have a home after this measure is implemented? They probably will have a home, they might have a home but, then again, they might not.
If 50 per cent of nursing homes have fewer than 41 beds, and 60 is the commercially viable number, then this measure will undoubtedly hit small providers very hard. Many of these facilities are in rural and remote areas and their closure would have a terrible impact on rural communities which are already losing government services right, left and centre. Older people in country centres have a lot to lose if their small service providers go under. Not only will they be faced with the difficult decision to leave the family home when they need more care but in many instances this may necessitate leaving town as well. Older people often put off leaving the family home, even when maintaining it becomes too much, because they do not want to leave behind the security and independence it represents.
Imagine what a daunting prospect such a move would become if they also had to consider leaving their immediate family and friends. The government simply has not considered some of the practical implications for country people of its bill. Many older couples are separated by illness for long periods of time. Often, if one becomes frail or needs to recover from some sort of treatment, they will enter a nursing home while their spouse stays in the family home. Obviously, it is very important that these people remain in close contact in order to make the whole experience less stressful. Imagine trying to recover from a major operation with your husband or wife  hundreds of kilometres away. Worse still, imagine trying to care for and maintain contact over such a distance with a spouse suffering from Alzheimer's.
Taking facilities from country areas will only exacerbate older people's phobia of nursing homes. No-one wants to leave their family home until they have to. If elderly country folk also have to abandon their families to get the professional care they need, I doubt many of them will ever want to receive it. This bill therefore represents just another aspect of this government's cruelty to elderly Australians. Once again, the Howard government has failed to disclose the full implications of its initiative, thereby veiling it in uncertainty. Elderly Australians deserve some certainty when it comes to aged care. It is highly irresponsible of this government to continue to shroud its policies in ambiguity when the specifics are what ultimately will determine the impact on smaller service providers, particularly in rural and remote areas.
The government has continued to confuse and upset older Australians who are already reeling from the implementation of accommodation charges that have threatened the security of their family home. They continue to refer to `options' and `choices' as though older people choose to enter nursing home care on a whim. Often older people are forced into such `choices' as a result of sudden serious illness. The last thing they need is to be forced away from their relatives and friends at such an unsettling time. Therefore, 
 the threat posed by the mystery accreditation fee is certainly real and quite substantial.
Adding to the uncertainty of service providers is the fact that this may not be the only new expense they incur. Accreditation under the act will be compulsory if they are to continue to receive government subsidies from January 2001. However, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency is a relatively new body that many service providers have not dealt with before.
The new accreditation procedure could result in some facilities incurring substantial costs before they can become accredited. Facilities may need to introduce new quality control and management systems, update IT systems or implement any number of changes as a result of the new regime. Imagine the implications this might have on smaller service providers. Not only will they have to come up with the accreditation fee, but they might also have to undertake significant expenditure to ensure they comply with the new rules. Surely it would have been more sensible to maintain funding to the agency under the Aged Care Act until service providers had time to adjust to the changes.
Some service providers have indicated that the full cost of accreditation could end up being around $50,000. This would certainly be enough to undermine the financial viability of those smaller facilities already teetering on the brink. The irony of this situation is that the agency set up to ensure standards in aged care might actually end up effectively undermining them. Even if smaller facilities survive the changes, the threat to services is not eliminated. If small providers are forced to institute new administrative and management procedures under the new system, they may have to reallocate funds set aside for services or capital spending. Therefore, funds could end up being diverted away from services for residents. This would certainly undermine the objective of ensuring service standards in the aged care industry.
Without being able to put a price on the fee, it is certainly difficult to gauge the extent of its potential impact. But then why would the government seek to make anything clearer at this stage? They have consistently sought 
 to confuse the issue of aged care, refusing to be tied down on any details or specifics. This government have continued to keep Australians in the dark on aged care. Indeed, they seem reluctant to divulge even the most basic and necessary of information for the elderly. Even publications designed to make the changes clear are an exercise in ambiguity and deception.
Home & Residence Choices for Older People is a Department of Social Security publication designed to give the elderly practical information about their aged care options. This book was supposed to make the government's aged care changes clear so that older people could make informed decisions about their future. However, the 1997 edition of Home & Residence Choices for Older People was outdated within about four months. So rapid and confusing were the government's changes to aged care that even the department could not keep up with them. We are yet to see the 1998 edition of Home & Residence Choices for Older People. Obviously, the relevant departments are still endeavouring to fathom the changes. The point is that this publication was supposed to be an effort on behalf of this government to make the changes to aged care clear. It was supposed to clarify things, and yet it has succeeded in confusing the issue even further. The 1997 edition is worthless now and the department has failed to produce a new one.
DSS spent $24,000 on market testing alone for the 1997 edition. They must have thought it was an important publication then, so where is it now? And, if Home & Residence Choices for Older People is not available, where are older people supposed to get this information from? No wonder they are feeling worried and confused.
Perhaps the government should stop trying to rush through massive changes to the aged care sector and start to think about the impact they are actually having on the elderly within our community. Older people are more apprehensive than ever about entering aged care facilities of any kind. I find it particularly disturbing that this government seems reluctant to offer them even basic information that could reassure them.
The  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  will serve to further undermine older people's confidence in the aged care sector as a whole. The government's blatant refusal to reveal the cost of the accreditation fee has left many smaller service providers in a position where they are unable to reassure residents. Surely this is unnecessarily cruel and unfair to both parties.
All of this is taking place within a framework that is completely untested. The accreditation process is being worked through for the first time and the effectiveness of the agency itself is yet to be assessed. Service providers are bound to incur all sorts of expenses associated with the implementation of the new accreditation scheme. It is highly inappropriate that the government is trying to force them to pay to participate in what is actually a trial of its own new system.
This government has done nothing but create confusion and disarray with its so-called reforms to the aged care sector. It has created and maintained an environment of uncertainty and apprehension and older people no longer know where to turn for help. They have been denied vital information about their aged care options and this measure will only serve to confuse the issue further.
Smaller country facilities will almost certainly be threatened by the implementation of the accreditation fee, yet this government will not even give them an indication of cost so that they might be able to assess and prepare for the implications. The government has not provided enough information about this measure to the people concerned; they are hoping to rush it through as an idea and determine the specifics later. This is simply not acceptable considering the potential implications, particularly for country areas.
The Howard government needs to stop approaching aged care issues in such an underhanded way if they are ever to restore any confidence in the sector. If older Australians need to access aged care facilities in times of illness or frailty, they should be able to do so with confidence and without trepidation. I will never support a measure that seeks to deny them that security.
—Senator West.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (ACCREDITATION AGENCY) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-02,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, this is the first time I have been on my feet when you have been in the chair, so congratulations on the extension of your role.
In joining in this debate, I do so with a fair degree of sadness. I am very pleased to see that this government is concerned about accreditation standards, but this  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  follows the traditional path of alterations and changes regarding aged care that this government has followed for the last 2½ years. The history of these legislative changes is littered with uncertainty and a lack of consultation.
This has been the situation since the very first days when the government laid the first aged care bill on the table for the community and the industry to comment on it. For how long did the bill lie on the table for comment? Ten days. And then, when we actually read the bill, we found that a whole lot of key parts of the legislation were missing. This was legislation by drip-feed with short periods in which to respond. The key parts—the key determinants which the industry needed to know so they could make their decisions and make comments on things such as what was going to be included in the classification scales of patients—were continuing to be left out.
We had the debacle of the entry fees. There was only going to be a small amount to be paid, but the government would not put a top figure on it. We had the debacle where for five days people who were to be admitted into nursing homes  had to pay an up-front bond, but that was then changed to a fee.
The government has not managed to get right the whole reform process that they have undertaken. They have always left consultation with the industry until too late. The consultations with the industry have been totally inadequate, and the industry has not been given adequate time. The government has not taken into consideration what the industry has been saying. Therefore, they have had to come back and say, `Oops, we have made a mistake; we will have to amend 
 it.' Wouldn't it have been better for this government to have got its act together on aged care reforms and for it to have talked with all sectors of the industry? When I talk about the industry, I do not mean just nursing home proprietors, of which there is a wide range of categories—the for profit sector, the not for profit sector, the charitable sector and some state government run homes—but I also mean those people who provide the care, the nursing care and the ancillary and support care, and those people who are the recipients of that care. That is what the industry comprises.
But this government has not seen fit to go and talk with the whole industry. One wonders if they only talk with the one part of the industry which happens to be a big donor to the Liberal Party. Now I might be wrong there; it might be mischievous of me to contemplate that. But the lack of consultation that has taken place regarding this particular bill is nothing new. If the advisers in the box opposite care to think back, they could tell the minister, when he speaks, about the short periods of time that have been allowed, throughout all this aged care reform process undertaken by the government, for the industry to comment on the various changes and different aspects. It will be very clearly borne out that this government is not about consultation. They do not care.
Another aspect of this particular bill relates to the fee. What is it going to be? This issue arose with accommodation bonds. Nobody could tell us what the fee was going to be. It was buying a pig in a poke then, and again this is buying a pig in a poke. The industry does not know. A lot of Commonwealth money has been cut out of the industry. It has been forced to become a lot more self-sufficient; it has had to meet many more costs.
When you talk to the industry you find that viability is becoming more and more stretched and more and more uncertain. This is happening more and more with the smaller institutions, and particularly with those in regional areas. It would not take very much consultation with the industry to enable those problems to be reported back to the government. I suggest that it would do this government the 
 world of good if they could actually go out and talk to institutions in those areas because they would learn very quickly about their problems. Financially, these institutions cannot afford to be forced into situations where they do not know what their costs will be. This does not make good business sense. Whether they be for profit or not for profit, these people still have to run to budgets; they still have to negotiate with the lenders or financial institutions that they work with.
How can any organisation that does not know what the financial cost to them is going to be make proper and correct assessments and do their budgets? They cannot do it. Yet this government expects this whole industry to do that, to go and buy a pig in a poke. They are being forced to sign up for something—I accept that accreditation is essential—when they do not know what the costs will be.
As Senator Evans said earlier, the income of these organisations is fixed. This government is making sure that their outgoings are not fixed. Their outgoings are increasing all the time. How do you make A equal B, which it has to do in this situation, or those organisations will become non-viable and be forced to close? You reduce the outgoings, which means that in nursing homes you do not employ registered nurses. You put enrolled nurses in. You bodgie up the paperwork so that it looks like you have adequate enrolled nurses, or you put personal care assistants in. You employ people at cheaper rates. You employ people with lesser skills.
The booklet to which Senator Gibbs referred states only that nursing procedures `may' be carried out by registered nurses. This government is not prepared to give any guarantee that registered nurses will carry out those duties which registered nurses should be performing. This government does not care about that. So there will be a reduction in standards. Either that or you have an increase in the income to nursing homes. This government sure as hell is not going to put any more into them because all it can do is cut funding. Therefore, the daily fee will rise. It has to be one of the two. You cannot have it both ways. The nursing homes will either have to cut 
 their service level, which will impact upon accreditation, or they will have to force a rise in the fee. Those are pretty basic elementary management and accountability figures.
The industry has concerns about the costs of accreditation. We have heard figures of $5,000-$10,000 mentioned. When you throw another couple of thousand dollars onto the cost of paying for the accreditation agency, you are talking about $7,000-$12,000. That sort of money is way beyond the means of many small institutions. This government does not look at those situations. It is not looking at the impact on smaller institutions, particularly when in some of these facilities there is multiskilling and a dual role for individuals. In a small hostel or nursing home, the registered nurse will be undertaking administrative work as well as caring for patients. All of this will increase the administrative work. When does he or she get to spend an adequate amount of time with the patients? That question has not been answered.
Many of these small institutions will have problems with training. They have only one entity, as a cleaner maybe or as a cook. Maybe the cook shares the job with somebody else. There will be only one person doing laundry and that person may be doing another job as well. When these people are sent on training, there is no way that, in a town of 300 or 400 people with a 16-bed facility, they can invite the trainers to go to their institution. How could they afford to do that?
These people have to be sent away if, regionally, there is a training day on. That is fine for a large institution which has a number of people; it can afford to send somebody. But if a small institution has to send people 20 or 30 miles down the track to the centre where the training day is being conducted—because more institutions are involved, it will be more centralised and there will be less cost to get the trainer there—how does it send off for one day or part of a day its one and only cook? How does it send off for the day its one and only laundry person or its one and only cleaner? How does it send off one part of two personal care assistants? If an RN is doing administration as well as patient care, 
 how does an institution send off the administrative part of its RN to another town, which may be only 20 or 30 miles away, and leave the care part behind?
All of this will add to the complexity and the cost of running these institutions. While people are away from these institutions, there have to be replacements. That means the institutions will have to find another lot of wages. This government does not seem to comprehend the cost impact of this measure upon many of these institutions. It is totally callous, uncaring and cruel of this government to plough on with bits and pieces of this legislation without consultation and without telling the industry what the fee level will be.
I have a letter that was written to the editor of Gunnedah's Namoi Valley Independent of 1 October. The letter is from Susan Lyle of the Gunnedah Nursing Home, Sister Judith Carney of McAuley Hostel, and Dawn Beard of Alkira Hostel. They express concern, seek the support of the community and call for a fair share for aged care. The letter goes on to state:
Care for the aged, in the community for as long as possible, and, when required, in quality residential care staffed by a full complement of trained and caring staff, is a right for all older Australians. It is a responsibility for the whole community, whether they live in urban, regional or Rural Australia.
These rights maybe at risk, together with the jobs of those providing care for the aged, unless more funds are provided to upgrade or replace facilities to meet newly imposed building standards, and to meet new accreditation policies. Failure to respond will also detrimentally affect the economy of Gunnedah.
This sort of material could be written about many small to medium size communities around New South Wales. I cannot talk about other states because I do not move around those states. This is the sort of plea that I keep hearing throughout New South Wales as I move around and talk to those in aged care institutions and facilities. I make a point of visiting them while I am in those communities; I have a great deal of interest in this matter because I think the government has made an unholy mess of it.
Accreditation is vitally important, but there is this absolute obsession with user pays. We know that less than 10 per cent of the population will use any of the aged care facilities. They are going to force that 10 per cent to foot the bill rather than consider the fact that the whole of the community has a responsibility for the provision of aged care in their community and in this country. This blind adherence to user pays is being illustrated very classically here, with the sort of burden that it places upon a group of people who are really not in a position to be able to afford it.
The cost of accreditation, as I keep saying, needs to be borne in mind. Many of the facilities need to upgrade their information technology because this government wants a bit of a paper chase. If they can provide the pieces of paper, then they are fine. They are not looking at what is being given.
With regard to the daily fees, I have had complaints from a number of facilities about the amount of additional administrative work that has been placed on them with the Australian dollar flip flopping around, particularly in regard to clients who are in receipt of British pensions. They are receiving letters almost weekly or fortnightly from the department altering the fee schedule that the client is having to pay. This involves extra administrative work for the institution. When you have someone who has got dementia, how do you explain to them that this week the payment is going to be such and such and next week or last week it was different? The government has not thought about these matters. It has not comprehended that over 50 per cent of people in nursing homes have some form of dementia. Every imposition they place upon the industry means that more time is taken away from the actual delivery of care, from the provision of care, support and loving nurturing, and is put behind a desk. It is not a very bright move on the part of this government.
We also know that the Productivity Commission has still to bring down its final report about fees, charges and other issues in relation to aged care. So why the hurry for this? Why not wait until you have got everything organised and have consulted the industry 
 before you bring in something different, a change, particularly when the government cannot or will not tell us what the fee is?
I am aware of rural communities where nursing homes or hostels have elected to come under the same umbrella, to be almost taken over by another non-profit group, so that they can have economies of scale, so that there is only one administrative section for those particular institutions. Is this what the government is aiming for? They actually want amalgamations to take place so that you have large organisations, large facilities, which get more impersonal. That is possible; you can do that in communities of a significant size. But I go back to communities like Carcoar, Condobolin, Trundle, Tullamore, Tottenham, Trangie and Warren. What is this going to do for them? It is certainly not going to help their administration.
They agree with accreditation. Everybody agrees with accreditation. Where we have differences of opinion is with the consultation which this government has not undertaken and the fact that it is expecting the industry to buy a pig in a poke, to sign up for something when they cannot be given any indication of what the fee is going to be. If $36 million is needed, how do you get that? It is going to take quite a deal of money from the individuals. It is of concern to many people. It is of concern to me that we run the risk, if they are not going to be allowed an income increase, if their outgoings are going to increase, of seeing a decrease in standards of care given to our elderly people. The elderly of Australia deserve more than this.
(Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (ACCREDITATION AGENCY) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1998-12-02,"—No-one would object to measures aimed at increasing the level of care given to the elderly. They, more than most, deserve our support and care in their later years. After all, they fought and died for us and gave this country a foundation to build upon. The Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  merely creates an illusion of increasing that standard level of care. In its current form, that is all that it is—an illusion.
Accreditation can be a useful tool to achieve minimum standards of care, but this 
 can only be achieved if the measure is clear and implementation well considered. As the bill stands, none of these basic requirements are present. A major deficit in the legislation, causing insecurity within the sector, is that there is no indication of the costs of the implementation of this accreditation to the various providers.
Stability, both emotional and financial, is vital in a sector, and this is particularly true of community services. If the community service providers of that care are insecure, it will inevitably flow on from even the most professional of providers of care to the clients. This ill-conceived amendment is creating this insecurity because the costs of its implementation are not known. What is known is that there are hidden costs associated with the implementation of the standardised service delivery standards. These costs include employing within their budget the additional administration time, and the time to observe and report, that all accreditation systems require, particularly at their instigation. Secondly, accreditation often incurs additional staff training costs both for learning how to implement the new system and for the additional training which may be required for staff to lift their skills to meet the required standard.
These are just a few of the hidden costs associated with the amendments proposed by the government. This bill is an example of how ill-conceived plans may actually contribute to a reduction in the standards that the amendment is seeking to redress. My home state of Tasmania has a large population of people requiring aged care. Thus the provision of aged care is an industry in our state that supplies employment for many people. While our regional and rural economy has many disadvantages, it can provide a special environment for caring for the aged. A moderate climate and a gentle pace of life contribute to idyllic circumstances to care for the elderly. However, this bill in its current form does not allow for the needs of the rural and regional sector, where economies of scale may cause prohibitive costs—for example, resident classification procedures that are too rigid to work practically in smaller residential hostels.
There are many other factors that can create additional costs to supplying care in regional Australia. Given this government's history of ill-conceived regional policy, combined with their apparent inadequacy when factoring in the needs of rural Australia, I can understand why many providers are extremely apprehensive about this bill.
The extent of the negative impact of this bill will differ from state to state. Each state has its own awards and regulations and the costs of implementing any of the changes could vary considerably. There appears to be no recognition of this at all in the amendment. I have had numerous communications expressing the insecurity of the sector not only on behalf of the organisations and their employees involved in the sector but also from the children of the elderly, who are also expressing their concerns. These concerns relate not only to the cost of providing the care but also to the need for reassurance that the costs associated with this bill will not mean the closure of some of these facilities, thereby endangering the health of the elderly.
In some cases this could result in the elderly moving from the district where they have spent most of their lives. This could have a serious detrimental effect if the elderly face a reduction in choice and are further isolated by the possible closure of the smaller rural hostels. This bill arrives just after another superficially conceived resident classification scale that resulted in immediate calls for review from the government's own partners—the former National Party government in Queensland—because it represented a substantial reduction in revenue from the Commonwealth that will have to be picked up either by the state government or by the elderly.
Largely as a result of this government, Tasmania cannot afford the transfer of the revenue base the reclassification represented. But when you see this amendment in its true light, you see that it also represents a transfer of cost away from the Commonwealth, which is currently responsible for the cost of monitoring standards via the Department of Health and Aged Care to the industry. Thus, the elderly and their families will inevitably pay 
 the cost of accreditation, as the state cannot afford the additional burden and the industry can in no way soak up this cost that could amount to $10,000, just for the accreditation fee. This does not include the costs that may be incurred by satisfying the demands of accreditation, which may be as much as $50,000 for standards to be met. Is it any wonder there are many smaller facilities in Tasmania that are seriously contemplating closure, when presented with the never-ending cost liabilities this government has been imposing on the elderly?
The inability of the industry to absorb this cost becomes clear when we acknowledge that the industry has been savaged to the tune of $500 million in lost revenue since this government came into office. This does not include the additional losses the elderly have incurred in terms of service provision by losing dental care, choice in medication and numerous other erosions of benefits this government is responsible for.
Thus, aged care is in crisis, as are many other institutions since this government came to power. However, the elderly are particularly vulnerable and, as illustrated by my colleagues' illuminating communications over the past days, the elderly who live in regional and rural states such as my own are even more so. They are disadvantaged by ill-considered, superficial policies. Due to economies of scale, reductions in funding, transfer of cost away from the Commonwealth onto the elderly and a looming cloud of the GST, they will not have their day in the sun. Instead, due to this government, they are in real danger of being dislocated, penniless and cold.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (ACCREDITATION AGENCY) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-02,"—The Howard government is working hard to ensure that care provided to individual older Australians and the life they experience will be of the highest possible quality. I refer anyone to our election commitments of this year. To do this, we are developing an aged care system that will be sustainable into the next century and is based on a creative partnership between the aged care sector and the government. It is 
 certainly forward looking and looking not only at the needs of the elderly but also at the impact on government for many years to come.
The Aged Care Act of 1997 sets the broad framework for this. That act ensured that older Australians have equitable access to aged care services that provide high-quality standards of care and accommodation. Under the act, the agency will ensure that residential aged care facilities achieve and maintain high standards of care and accommodation. The agency is working with service providers to improve the quality of care outcomes for older Australians and encourage individual service providers—no matter where they are located—to improve standards by a process of continuous improvement. It will also take action against services which do not meet care standards.
The agency represents the fulfilment of a 1996 election commitment when the coalition promised that a new partnership would be developed between the industry and government in improving care standards. Consistent with this theme of partnership and as an expression of this theme the intention is that the agencies should charge fees for accreditation. This is also consistent with other accreditation models.
I would compare the process that we have undertaken—both in developing the 1997 act and in making subsequent improvements, including this legislation—with the consultation that was undertaken by the ALP when it undertook reforms in this area in 1987 with little or no consultation. I am sure many of the providers and many of the aged residents would be very mindful that the consultation process has been inclusive and far-reaching, compared with those of 1987 when Labor certainly did not undertake that process.
I draw attention to the second reading speech:
The government consulted widely during development of the Aged Care Act 1997 and associated principles and has listened to the concerns of service providers since the implementation of the government's age care reforms. The establishment and operation of the agency were an outcome of this process. 

The explanatory memorandum talks about monitoring and review of the reforms as follows:
In June 1997 the government made a commitment to undertake ongoing review of the aged care reform policy and its implementation. This review will be undertaken by an independent expert advised by a working group representing stakeholders. It will cover a two-year period from the commencement of the act in October 1997.
This bill will enable the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to partially recover its costs by charging a fee to residential care providers who seek accreditation.
As part of the government's targeting the needs of people in regional Australia, the particular needs of small facilities generally, and particularly those in rural and remote areas, will be taken into account in setting the fees. The minister, Mrs Bishop, has instructed the agency to ensure special treatment of rural and remote homes and small homes generally. Senator Woodley very genuinely raised concerns about fees for rural and remote homes and small homes. We certainly take note of those concerns. Minister Bishop is also very concerned to ensure the viability of these facilities to support their important caring work in regional communities.
In relation to the accreditation fees, the minister has given instructions to the agency to ensure that rural and remote and small homes are given special treatment. The bill enables the fees to be dealt with in subordinate legislation—the accreditation grant principles. This was one of the issues referred to by Senator Woodley. The fee structure will be put in place through those principles, which are disallowable instruments. The principles are disallowable instruments by provision of section 96-1(2) of the Aged Care Act 1997 in that regard. This bill provides an opportunity for the fee structure or framework to certainly be scrutinised by senators in the future.
The impact of aged care services paying a fee will not be a burden. Indeed, there are distinct financial advantages in marketing that accrue to residential care facilities that receive accreditation. The fees will be comparatively modest. I take issue with the point raised by Senator Denman with regard to the new 
 resident funding system. It certainly did not reduce funding. A quite separate study by the Centre for Independent Economics found an increase of over $160 million a year.
The passing of this bill by parliament will enable the agency to fulfil its charter of providing a residential aged care accreditation system that ensures that frail older Australians enjoy a quality of care and a quality of life they deserve. It is important to always recognise that we are in a period of change and this does impact on the elderly in the community. But, importantly, change in technology or efficiency that brings improvement of standards and a quality of care for seniors is certainly something that is a high priority of the Howard government. This forms an important part of the government's policy in putting into place the framework for ensuring that older Australians have quality of life throughout their life. I certainly look forward to the support of the Senate with regard to this legislation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-12-02,"—I rise today to speak about the tremendous amount of good news coming to the Hunter Valley because of the actions of the Howard Liberal government. The Senate will recall, as I have reported on it on a number of occasions, the assistance given by the federal government to Newcastle and the Hunter Valley with the shutdown of BHP's 
 steel-making operations. The Senate will recall that the federal government contributed $10 million to a special fund to create projects that were to lead to further employment.
There has been a very thorough investigation of quite a number of projects. Most of these are infrastructure based projects that will actually go on to generate far more jobs than the initial infrastructure. There was some unwarranted criticism from Mr Horne, the member for Paterson, of the $7.1 million that has already been allocated. What Mr Horne has to realise is that we have a situation in Newcastle where not one job has been lost at this point from the downsizing of BHP. The work force has gone down from 2,700 to 2,300 because of people leaving for other employment.
I would like to put on the record in the Senate that BHP is actually producing more steel with 2,300 workers than they did with 2,800, and they are producing more steel than they did 15 years ago with 11,000 workers. So it is very highly productive at this point in time. But the real crunch for the work effects of the downsizing of BHP will not be felt until September next year, almost a full year away. Therefore, the federal government is taking great care in the projects that it selects to make sure that they are absolutely viable projects, that they will generate initial employment through construction and then much larger multiples of employment through the private infrastructure and the private firms that are set up as a result of the allocation of this $7.1 million.
It gave me great pleasure two weeks ago, together with the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, to launch one of these projects in the $10 million fund. This was the Maitland transport hub. It involved an investment of $1.5 million which the government plans to commit. To show you the job generating effect of that, the prospects are in store, once that transport hub is operational, for $30 million to be spent by the private sector and 600 to be jobs created. This is from an initial investment of $1.5 million.
It is in an area where there is a junction of major roads: the F3 Freeway coming from 
 Sydney, the Pacific Highway going to Brisbane, the New England Highway going north up the valley and the main road into Newcastle. This transport hub is in the centre of all that. It is also on a major section of the northern branch rail line, and these projects will create a hub of rail and road transport businesses in that area and the nearby Holmewood Business Park.
Blue Ribbon and Mercedes-Benz Freightliner have already signed up for this project as part of that $600 million worth of investment. It is terrific to have Mercedes-Benz Freightliner on board. This is an international company that is now relocating into the Hunter Valley because of the Hunter Advantage Fund money allocated by this federal government—and there are many others about to come on board. It does show the commitment of this government to employment within the Hunter Valley region.
The minister who came to launch the project also moved out to the F3 Freeway to launch that section of road. This was done at the same time and I would like the Senate to record that, over the last few years, this government has allocated the money to finish the road at a much faster pace. It is great for those of us that use that road that this section is now open and the eight kilometres of nightmarish upgraded local road that the previous government left us with for the last seven years, on which there were many deaths and many accidents, is now a thing of the past as part of the national highway system. We now have a proper six-lane freeway on that last eight kilometre section that links the former end of the F3 through to the New England Highway. The Christmas road accident rate will drop because of that terrific improvement in the road.
The other major development in that region—and again, this is an area near the end of the F3, and the upgrade of the F3 will actually extend the businesses in the area—is the Holmewood Business Park development. Right near that hub of transport that I mentioned before at the end of the F3 there is a whole range of new businesses going in. It is interesting to note that a lot of these businesses are actually manufacturing businesses and 
 in the Maitland region we have a situation where manufacturing is actually going up as a percentage of the work force, quite counter to the trend nation wide.
I had the opportunity recently to go with the Newcastle Business Chamber to Holmewood Business Park, where Newcastle Newspapers, a branch of the Fairfax group, has set up a major production plant for high speed printing of newspapers, not only the Newcastle Herald but a range of other newspapers as well. This high tech facility has been located right near this transport hub. So what we have developing at the end of the F3, near Maitland and between Newcastle and Maitland, is a major new region for the development of small businesses. With the downsizing of BHP, small businesses are going to be the saviour of the future.
I would like in this place to compliment BHP on the way they have handled the proposed downsizing, the fact that they put in place personal case management plans for the futures of the 2,700 employees. They have tracked those people, they have counselled them, they have provided assistance, they have provided training and funded training at the university and the local TAFE so these people can move on to further employment. Those are the people who have not already been re-deployed within other parts of BHP's operations.
So it is a model to the rest of the business community on how downsizing can be handled. This federal Liberal government—totally outside the $10 million Hunter Advantage Fund—has allocated other moneys to assist in that process. Projects include the business incubators that are being set up in Maitland, the Lake Macquarie area and Newcastle to help these people take the skills they developed at BHP through into other business ventures.
We have allocated funding such as $500,000, for example, to the Lake Macquarie Business Park. Two weeks ago I was out in Lake Macquarie launching that business park. An enormous number of business leaders from the community came along to have a look at that program. It is estimated that, with the business incubator in Lake Macquarie, 
 over the next five years 500 jobs will be generated. Again, that is from an initial investment by this government of $500,000.
I would like to compliment BHP on its role in that, too, because they put in $200,000 as well. They have shown themselves to be very responsible corporate citizens. The government is strategically locating these business incubators in those areas of the Hunter region which are going to be mainly affected by the downsizing of BHP. People tend to think it is a Newcastle problem, but about a third of the BHP work force live in the City of Newcastle, about another third live in the City of Lake Macquarie and another third live in the City of Maitland.
With about 800 people affected in each of those areas, it is very important for us to set up these sorts of programs. The federal government has been right behind this. The former Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, took part in the launch of a number of these projects in Newcastle when she was the minister. That process is continuing. So for Bob Horne, the member for Paterson, to claim that this government is doing little about the downsizing of BHP is an absolute nonsense.
What I have put on the record in the Senate today about these matters shows that this federal government has taken a very responsible attitude to the downsizing of BHP. The Prime Minister came into the region, he talked to the people, he set up consultative committees and he committed funds. That funding is now going to support job improvements in other areas that are not in the area of steel making.
The Hunter region has a marvellous future. It is an area with tremendous resources. At this time of industrial shift it needs special assistance from the government. We have provided that assistance. The future for the Hunter, as these new jobs are generated in the region, looks rosy.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Employment: Hunter Valley</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-02,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion and at the request of Senator Lees, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Lees moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 10.
It is my understanding that other members of the chamber, other than Senator Colston, will support this motion, and I understand his reasons. I would like to suspend standing orders to enable the motion to be passed and also to enable Senator Colston to express his reasons if he so wishes.",SENATE,<title>SEXUALITY DISCRIMINATION</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—I support Senator Bartlett's motion. Of course, this matter should be debated and of course it should be voted on. I would like to have heard from Senator Colston, as Senator Bartlett did, as to why he does not think that is the case. He has effectively blocked a vote on this motion. I think therefore he owes it to the Senate to get up and say why he has taken that action. It is not good enough to just sit in his chair and not respond to Senator Bartlett's request for a log of reasons. We have not seen this happen in the Senate for many months now. It is getting near to the end of the year, and Senator Colston will be as aware as any other senator that matters that do not get voted on now are likely not to get treatment for many months.
Senator Bartlett gave notice of this motion a few weeks ago—a motion concerning discrimination against gay people. The motion is consequent upon the murder of a young gay man, Matthew Shepherd, in the United States in October. This murder raised international furore. In fact, it was featured on the front of Time magazine around the world. Subsequent to that, incidents, including at 
 least one in Western Australia in relation to vilification of people because of their sexuality,  came to the fore. It is some small respite from that trajectory of events that we read in today's West Australian that there has been a court case in favour of people who have been mistreated because of their sexuality in that state.
But we all know—and particularly people who are in the gay community know—that discrimination is rampant, that people who are ostensibly gay or who make that component of themselves clear face vilification, and that it is a very injurious thing for those people to have to endure that, particularly young people.
This is a serious matter. It deserves debate in the Senate. It is an urgent matter for those people living with discrimination. It occurs to them out of the blue when they are least expecting it. They deserve to have the knowledge at least that the parliament is on their side and that there are actions being taken to—as Senator Bartlett's motion says—`condemn discrimination, vilification and violence against all persons'. Surely, Senator Colston cannot disagree with that sentiment. That is the active component of this motion: that the Senate should condemn `discrimination, vilification, and violence against all persons'. Is that too hard to make up one's mind on? Is that too complicated for us to have resolved?
—Be a bit honest in your argument.
—Get up and say what you mean. You are a gutless individual. You rat.
—You useless liar.
—Senator Faulkner and Senator Colston! Senator Brown, address the chair please.
—Senator Colston said `You useless liar'; I don't know whether that is to me or to somebody else. But he did say, `Be a bit honest in your argument.' There is nothing more dishonest in this place than to fail to get to your feet and defend a move to truncate somebody else's right to speak on a matter like this. The challenge to Senator 
 Colston is to get to his feet and say why he does not condemn `discrimination, vilification and violence against all persons'. I would like to hear that.",SENATE,<title>SEXUALITY DISCRIMINATION</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1

I actually spoke to Senator Bartlett about this and indicated to him why I was not satisfied that the motion should go ahead the way it was. The reason I gave him was that I do not think it is appropriate for an unfortunate incident that happened overseas to be used to bolster an argument in relation to Australia. If it were just the last part of the notice of motion that Senator Brown read, there is no objection to that; it is what comes before it that I have an objection to.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-02,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the signing of the WA Regional Forest Agreement to be deferred and the urgent need for an immediate moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests, until after the conclusion of an accord process involving all stakeholders and until the WA Environment Protection Authority has had the opportunity to assess the draft RFA that arises from that accord process.
Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague Senator Brown and the Democrats for their support in this very important motion. It is the kind of motion that, when you put it into the computer, comes up in green because it is a long sentence, but all the 
 elements of the sentence are very important, and during our contributions today you will see why.
There are several aspects to this motion. The first is that the signing of the Western Australia Regional Forest Agreement should be deferred. Why? Because the process to date has been an unmitigated disaster and has failed to acknowledge the interests of all stakeholders. Conservation groups agreed to be part of the RFA process until they, along with the tourism industry and local government, were blocked from participating in the steering committee. The steering committee determined much of the research to be undertaken and the direction in which the Regional Forest Agreement would go and was dominated by those committed to maintaining logging in high conservation value forests. So it was set up to come to a certain conclusion, and it is no wonder that it lost credibility at an early stage.
There needs to be a moratorium on the logging of high conservation value old growth forests until the Regional Forest Agreement, or the alternative accord or agreement process that has been proposed, is finalised. Why is that necessary? Because the Department of Conservation and Land Management is currently undertaking a massive logging program in the hope that any area of disputed conservation value will not be there by the time the deal is finalised. Conservation and Land Management's arrogant disregard for the process is outrageous. A recent trip I took to the area near Northcliffe confirmed this frenetic activity. Walking along a road going into the area, not a forest road, was actually the cause of police officers and CALM officers following individuals, including me and a staff member.
An alternative accord process involving all stakeholders should be established so that we can reach consensus on this crucial issue rather than perpetuate the conflict that has existed for so many years. The Western Australian Environment Protection Authority should formally assess any draft RFA that arises from that alternative process. I remember an answer that Senator Hill gave me—if I recall correctly—that he believed that would 
 happen. This is consistent with the commitments already contained in the scoping agreement for the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement. The draft RFA should be released for public comment.
At the outset, I need to stress that the Greens agree that the best method of resolving a long running dispute about the management of forests is to bring all stakeholders together so that we can move towards a consensus solution. The crash through approach which has been characteristic of the RFA process to date is as unsustainable as the forest management regime promoted by CALM. There are genuine win-win solutions in relation to forest management. The Western Australian Forest Alliance produced a very professionally researched proposal for a comprehensive, adequate and represented forest conservation reserve system and sustainable timber production in Western Australia. While that proposal points out in its introduction that only 15 per cent of Western Australia's original old growth forest remains, they have proposed that 60 per cent of existing state native forests would remain available for sustainable log production. Those issues and proposals deserve serious consideration. So far, they have not been properly taken into consideration.
The Western Australian Forest Alliance also proposes pulp and paper mills for downstream processing, an increased plantation and agroforestry industry, valued added enterprises in furniture and fine wood craft and the use of structural adjustment funding to assist in the development of a truly sustainable timber industry in Western Australia. Industries such as tourism should not be forgotten. We are looking at 10,000 people employed in the south west of Western Australia, compared with ABS statistics in 1997 which show a total of 2,290 people directly employed in the native forest timber industry.
The role of CALM is also crucial in any debate around the Western Australian RFA. The unanimous all party report of the Western Australian ecologically sustainable development committee processed by the legislative council standing committee stated in its recommendations that the Department of 
 Premier and Cabinet be given the lead agency status for the remaining stages of the RFA process. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Western Australia Regional Forest Agreement</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-12-02,"—Today we are debating the urgency motion by Senator Margetts basically calling for a moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests. I make the point early in this debate that Senator Margetts seems to have overlooked or forgotten that a deferred forest agreement is in place. The deferred agreement does not allow logging in forests that might be necessary for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and is, in all but name, a moratorium on those areas of high conservation value that might be required for conservation reasons. It is also important to state that the RFA process is in its final stage of negotiations and follows a very comprehensive scientific and consultative process over the past two years. So this is not something that has just come up now and is being rushed through.
To do what Senator Margetts is suggesting today would certainly lead to a greater degree of uncertainty and would disadvantage those communities that are looking for the long-term security that the RFA will deliver. I do not think that the concern of people about old growth forests should be underestimated. This is not something that is being taken lightly.
The background to the RFA process is worth noting. The hallmark of the RFA process in all states, including Western Australia, is the rigorous scientific assessment of the full range of forest values—environmental, natural and cultural heritage, economic and social values—giving rise to the title `Comprehensive regional assessment'. The development of the RFAs is based therefore on this particular assessment.
While the RFA is being developed, and during the conduct of these assessments, areas that may be required for the reserve system are protected through the deferred forest agreement and, effectively, a moratorium on logging of areas of potentially high conservation values. That is once again a reason why there is some degree of misunderstanding—I would put it that way—in what Senator 
 Margetts is saying. There is virtually a moratorium in place at the moment. At the commencement of the RFA process in Western Australia, a series of public meetings were conducted in regional centres through to Perth to inform people of the proposed approach to the process and to seek their views on how it should be conducted.
My other Western Australian colleagues in the coalition speaking today will of course expand on the fact that in Western Australia the environmental heritage assessments were progressed in a very comprehensive fashion. They will also talk about the specific examples of how the environmental heritage assessments were conducted. One of the things that I would like to mention is the work that was done by Dr Libby Mattiske in her undertaking of vegetation mapping within the region. That particular work by Dr Mattiske as an independent consultant actually won a national mapping award. So I do not think, as just one part of that assessment that has been made, that it could ever be said to be inadequate in any sense.
More than 30 assessment reports on the values of the forest have been made available to the public, including the scientific community, along with an overview report—the comprehensive regional assessment report—which was released in January of this year. Based on the outcomes of these reports, both governments have been involved in integrating all of the assessments—environmental, heritage, economic and social—to develop the draft RFA.
An important stage of this part of the process has been the release of the consultation document titled Towards a regional forest agreement for the south-west forest region of Western Australia. That was released in May this year and it details the current situation, the objectives of the RFA and some possible approaches that could lead to a balanced RFA outcome. A critical element of the RFA process has been the consultation and participation in the process by the stakeholders, the scientific experts and the communities likely to be affected by the outcomes of the eventual Western Australian RFA.  
Once again, I say that I do not think it is fair or reasonable to suggest that there has not been considerable consultation with all those interested stakeholders. The formal process for hearing the view of stakeholders has been through the stakeholder reference group: the Noongar action group and the State Agreement Acts committee. All stakeholders were invited to participate in the reference group which was established to facilitate direct stakeholder input to the RFA steering committee, allowing more than 60 stakeholder groups long-term input into the RFA process. The stakeholder reference group comprises a broad range of stakeholders, including representatives from the tourism, mining and timber industries, local conservation groups, shire councils, Western Australian government agencies, indigenous groups and forest product industries such as seed collecting, bee keeping and wildflower picking.
All RFA material has been made available to the public at 20 display centres scattered throughout the region. Major reports have also been made available on the Internet. The CRA report and public consultation paper, along with key assessment reports such as the national estate report, were mailed out to a broad range of stakeholders, academics and individuals. All reports are available on request.
There was also a two-month public consultation period from the end of May to the end of July on the contents of the public consultation paper, supported by a series of open days, an RFA info-line and a network of information centres throughout the south-west. Some 30,000 submissions were received during the consultation period and each submission has been carefully analysed and taken into account during the finalisation of the RFA.
During the entire RFA process, there has been a series of newsletters produced which provided information on the process and opportunities for public input. It is also relevant to note that Commonwealth and state officials are available to discuss issues pertaining to the RFA with stakeholder groups and individuals as required. I also think it is fair to say that the government is somewhat 
 disappointed that the peak conservation groups, the Western Australian Conservation Council and the Wilderness Society, have chosen not to participate in the process and the government continues to encourage their involvement. It is a shame because I think if there is a sense of goodwill this can be resolved in an amicable climate. But if you do not have parties prepared to come to the table for consultation and briefing, then that makes that process all that much more difficult.
I simply say to the Senate that there are many things that have been done, and continue to be done, which time does not allow me to cover—but I know my colleagues will. The role of the Western Australian EPA and the Commonwealth statutory responsibilities have been equally important. The report by the Western Australian Legislative Council standing committee is most significant, and there are a number of other issues. I think it is important that it is recognised by all the stakeholders on both sides of the fence that this is not something that has just been dreamt up overnight. It is not something that is taken lightly; it is something where the consultation process has been completely and utterly open to all participants, but also open to scrutiny.
I think that is a most significant thing as well because too often people might claim, in one form or another, that the thing has not been open to scrutiny by all the stakeholders and that much of the information has not been shared. It is for that reason that it does disturb the government that there has been a lack of willingness by the WA Conservation Council and the Wilderness Society to participate in the process because we certainly do want to have their input. They have had the opportunity to do so and I certainly hope that they acknowledge their input is required and come to the table sooner rather than later.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Western Australia Regional Forest Agreement</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-02,"—The ALP will support the urgency motion, with the change of one word. We do not want to embrace the concept of a new accord process, a formal sort of process. If Senator Margetts is prepared to change the word `accord' to `consultation', I do not think it will change the resolution all that much in 
 its meaning and effect, but it will be more attractive to us. We would support it with that amendment.
There is a number of reasons the opposition is concerned about what is happening in Western Australia. Senator Knowles presents a glowing picture of the scenery over there as she sees it, but the fact of the situation in WA is that there is enormous concern, widespread concern, from the general public as to what is happening to Western Australian forests. Public opinion polls taken in that state indicate that over 80 per cent of the electorate of Western Australia do not want old-growth forests to be logged for woodchipping. Over 70 per cent want a fair and sustainable balance to be struck with logging over there, and they do not believe they are getting it at the moment under the process that is being pursued by the WA government and CALM.
I believe we in the Senate need to be concerned for two reasons. Firstly, we need to be concerned about the actual process and outcomes in Western Australia. But, secondly, we also need to be concerned about the attitude of the federal government in this place. We have two responsible ministers in this area. We have Minister Tuckey, whose attitudes have become increasingly more well known and, as they become increasingly well known, people are more and more concerned about them. This is the minister who, in the West Australian just two weeks ago, was quoted as saying that, as far as he was concerned, he will allow planned logging of all the old-growth forests over time—apart from pristine ones. When asked, in respect of `pristine ones', what he was talking about, his bottom line basically was that he did not think there were all that many pristine ones around anyway. The minister in charge of this area does not believe in sustainable development and preservation in this area.
—Where did you get that from?
—That is just rubbish.
—He has had a chat to the public. He has had a chat to the media. He has made it very well known. This is a minister who believes in planned logging, over time, of all old-growth forests.
—That is not his position, and it is not our position either.
—We have got the hoons over there saying it is not his position. I refer you to the West Australian  newspaper where he boasted very strongly about that being his position.
But the other concern I have is that we have an environment minister in this place who does not, in any sense at all, show he has the backbone to stand up to the likes of Wilson Tuckey. Senator Hill has a responsibility which is different to Mr Tuckey's. He has got a responsibility as environment minister to ensure those principles of sustainability, those principles of ensuring old-growth forests are protected, are factored into the process. What is Senator Hill's response? Senator Hill's response is basically to say, `Look, I congratulate Wilson Tuckey because he brings knowledge and exposure of the issues to the task.' At a time when he should be standing up against Wilson Tuckey, he greets him into the fold and says, `This bloke knows what he is doing.' It is no wonder that the concern in Western Australia is widespread and growing.
The Labor Party is committed to the RFA process, but we believe that, in this particular case, the process has gone wrong and has not been based on scientific assessment. We are concerned, as are the public of Western Australia, as to the process. I mentioned the West Australian, but a recent editorial in the Sunday Times is also worth placing on the record in this place. It argued:
The state government must put more emphasis on the establishment and cutting of plantation timber, not devastating old forests. The state and federal government should accept that most reasonable Western Australians don't want any more old-growth forests cut down. Clear-felling of these magnificent trees—a wonderful tourist attraction in their own right—has been a disaster. If it continues, the only old-growth forests eventually will be in national parks.
This is from the Sunday Times , and it reflects the mood of Western Australia; a mood that was reflected by the WA Legislative Council Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development in a unanimous report condemning the process.
If that is not enough, let us also put on the record the view of the National Party in WA. It is important to put this view on the record now, before we get to a vote, because I think it is incumbent on the Nationals on this place to listen to their state colleagues. The Nationals in this place always claim to be the defenders of state rights. They always claim to be listening closely to the grassroots of their organisation. The grassroots of the National Party organisation in Western Australia could not be any more clear. They have issued a press release and they have issued a document. I will seek leave later on to incorporate the document in Hansard.
It is a document that condemns, in a whole range of ways, the WA RFA process. For instance, it says that the release of a draft RFA for public comment and assessment by the Environment Protection Authority is necessary. It says that what is also required as an outcome is a reduction in the first and second grade jarrah sawlog cut to no more than 2,080 cubic metres per year. It demands the protection of local areas of high conservation value. It demands assistance to the timber industry to encourage greater value adding and the maintenance of employment levels. It demands a review of CALM's funding sources and requirements. It is interesting to go through that document.
The National Party in Western Australia is of a view that it remains concerned that, as the RFA process draws to a conclusion, a number of significant issues are still to be openly and publicly addressed. They are concerned about the forest estate viability and the timber industry's economic growth. But they say the public deserves comprehensive explanations, before the RFA is concluded, of the way in which the RFA and the state government will ensure responsible management.
They are concerned about the logging of standard first grade jarrah. They are concerned that such logging could lead the public to conclude that the jarrah forest is being over cut over a shorter rotation period to ensure timber royalty income is maintained at optimum levels at the expense of sawn-off quality.  
They are particularly concerned about the role of CALM. They say of CALM that it appears that large sections of the community believe, rightly or wrongly, that CALM's financial interests in forest management place public interests at a disadvantage.
The National's concern is that the agency's business structure, from which it derives royalties from timber companies on behalf of the state and which is used to fund its forest management conservation operations, leaves it open to the question of the possibility that timber companies may be contracted by CALM to purchase quantities of logs greater than the level of market demand. That is a consistent concern that you hear across Western Australia. It is a concern that did not just come from the WA Nationals; it was also reflected in the Western Australian Sunday Times newspaper.
Senator Knowles says, `Well, it's not going on. The process is continuing, but do not think that the logging is continuing.' It is continuing. There is some concern at officer level in the federal government, but it is not concern that has been reflected by the minister. Apparently in WA there is concern being expressed by Commonwealth officials—as I said, ignored by their minister—that the Western Australian minister for the environment be notified. In fact the Commonwealth officials have informed the WA minister for the environment of their concerns about the current logging of the interim-listed Wattle Block near Northcliffe on Western Australia's south coast. They are concerned about that. They are concerned about current logging and their concerns have been raised with the WA minister. They are concerned that this particular forest block is on the Interim Register of the National Estate. It has high conservation values. Despite that, the RFA process is allowing that particular area to continue to be logged.
The opposition are concerned about a process in WA that we feel is not sufficiently scientifically based. We are concerned about a process that does not provide for the respect and recognition of the principles of sustainability. It is a process that does not provide sufficient protection. It is a process 
 that has seen two ministers here basically taking the attitude of `I know nothing and I see nothing'.
As I said, with the amendment that I have suggested, the opposition will support the motion by Senator Margetts before the Senate this afternoon. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the press statement and the issues statement of the National Party of Western Australia.
Leave granted.

NATIONALS DEMAND EXPLANATIONS ON FOREST MANAGEMENT
The National Party today asked the state government to give the community a comprehensive response to concerns about significant forest management issues raised as a result of party policy research during the past 12 months.
Nationals' director Jamie Kronborg said an `issues statement' on forest management and conservation prepared by the party highlighted a number of potential conflicts between government commitments to forest management and current or possible practice in the future.
Mr Kronborg said the party's primary concern centred on the complex question of the jarrah forest's continuing ability to yield sawn timber of sufficient quality and volume to meet the demands of the timber industry in perpetuity and, at the same time, to provide forest reserves for local conservation, tourism or community needs.
`For the timber industry, the possible outcomes of the proposed Regional Forest Agreement set out in papers published as part of that process detail the implications that a change in the size of the conservation estate will have on first and second-grade jarrah sawlog production,' Mr Kronborg said.
`This is clearly the proper approach because the jarrah forest is still being logged principally, in value terms, for the production of first and second-grade sawlogs and the timber industry's primary requirement is for the supply of these sawlogs.
`However, the Conservation and Land Management Department has claimed in a recent, separate paper that the current sawlog specification has become irrelevant.
`In its place it is suggesting a switch to a different harvesting specification known as whole bole logging, which CALM believes could enable the timber industry to extract greater yields of timber from a tree than is now possible using the sawlog specification.
`But the Nationals are very concerned that if the key forest harvesting measure known as the sawlog 
 specification has become `irrelevant', as CALM claims, then it would appear that some of the most important conclusions in the RFA public consultation paper, in which the outcomes are based entirely on impacts on sawlog yield, could be called into question.'
Mr Kronborg said the Nationals' issues statement also challenged the government to provide comprehensive explanations about:
the ways in which the quality of the jarrah forest resource would be maintained if a different harvesting specification was to be introduced
the reason why the area of jarrah forest cut for logging in the past six years had almost doubled to more than 20,000 hectares
the reasons for apparent change over time in the size and quality of a standard first-grade jarrah sawlog
the reason for changes in silvicultural practice which have prevented the timely thinning of regrowth karri and jarrah
`There is a high level of public interest in future management of WA's public native forests and, for this reason alone, the government must ensure that the quality of the resource is maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of many industry and community interests, including the tourism industry,' Mr Kronborg said.
`Everyone in the community needs to ensure that the state takes a responsible approach to forest management, given that the RFA will determine the size of the conservation estate for the next 20 years.
`The additional information which the Nationals are seeking to have placed on the public record will aid the RFA process and help to clarify some significant community concerns.'
Mr Kronborg said the party had already released details of the outcomes it expected from the RFA process.
These included:
the release of a draft RFA for public comment and assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority
a reduction in the first and second-grade jarrah sawlog cut to no more than 280,000 cubic metres per year
protection for local areas of high conservation value
assistance to the timber industry to encourage greater value-adding and the maintenance of employment levels
encouragement for the further development of the plantation timber resource, and 

a review of CALM's funding sources and requirements

ISSUES STATEMENT
Number of pages: 1/11
FOREST MANAGEMENT POLICY
AND THE REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENT PROCESS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Background
The National Party in Western Australia has conducted a comprehensive review of forest management since February 1998.
The party has consulted widely with local communities, conservation, tourism and timber industry interests, and senior officers of relevant public agencies and environment ministries.
This has taken place during the Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) process. The RFA is an agreement between the Commonwealth and state governments which is designed to define `the range of economic and environmental obligations which each government has regarding the long-term management and protection of forest values in specific regions'.
The RFA process in WA's south west forest region should:
identify areas within the region that both governments believe are required for the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative forest reserve system, and provide for the conservation of these areas;
provide for the ecologically-sustainable management and use of forested areas in the region; and
provide for the long-term stability of the forest and forest-based industries.
The Nationals recognise that the overriding intention of the proposed RFA in WA is to deliver general community agreement on the utilisation of WA's public native forests for the next 20 years. The party concurs with the objective inherent in this process and in a public statement in September announced its support for the principle of the RFA process.
However, finding the `common ground' in the complex forest debate is an extremely difficult task, which the Nationals recognise. The community places a diverse range of values on native forest and consequently there are a number of conflicts 
 dividing interest groups on forest management principles and practices.
This is aggravated by the differing community values placed particularly on old-growth native forest ranging across economic, cultural, social, environmental or ecological and aesthetic values.
As a result, and despite the genuine commitment of many people and organisations to the RFA process since July 1996, the nationals remain concerned, as the process draws to a conclusion, that a number of significant issues are still to be openly and publicly addressed.
Jarrah: the forest's ability to sustain yields for sawn timber production
The Nationals' primary concern centres on the complex question of the jarrah forest's continuing ability to yield sawn timber of sufficient quality and volume to meet the demands of the timber industry in perpetuity.
Despite ministerial directions by the environment minister in 1993 expressly designed to encourage greater utilisation of lower grade timber, and claims to the contrary, sawlogs of varying grades remain the principle quality product for which the jarrah forest is logged.
The outcomes of a range of possible changes to the current forest reserve system that could follow the conclusion of the RFA, which are set out in a `paper to assist public consultation' published in July 1998, detail a range of effects on future sawlog volume that would be available to the timber industry.
For example, `Approach A', which would reserve the greatest area of forest for conservation under any of the three approaches, is forecast to reduce the current volume of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs that would be available for timber harvesting by up to 36,500 cubic metres per year.
The current allowable cut of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs is 490,000 cu/m per year. This was authorised by environment minister Kevin Minson in 1993 following the report of Meagher Committee. This committee noted that a long-term sustainable yield for first grade and second grade jarrah sawlogs was 300,000 cu/m per year. An allowable cut of 490,000 cu/m per year was set for a 10-year period to enable the industry to restructure its activities to account for a reduction in allowable cut to 300,000 cu/m from the year 2003.
The graph which follows depicts the difference between the Meagher committee's recommended long-term sustainable yield of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs, the allowable cut, the actual cut (1996-97) and the levels of cut under the three approaches outlined in the RFA public consultation paper.   

Due to the quality of documentation supplied, the graph cannot be reproduced in the Hansard.
The Conservation & Land Management Department's recent annual report shows a total of 374,600 cu/m of jarrah sawlogs was harvested in 1997-98. Of this, about 302,000 cu/m were classified as first-grade sawlogs. Given this, the actual cut appears to have fallen considerably (but we are not able to graph the cut of second-grade sawlogs because the volume has not been defined in the report).
In this context, and in view of the RFA public consultation paper's various conclusions about the implications of the future size of the conservation estate on sawlog production, the Nationals are concerned about CALM's recent claim, in a separate paper, that the sawlog specification `has become irrelevant'.
. . . for the future. . . the current sawlog specification has become irrelevant with the smaller dimension sawn timber now being produced to meet the demand of the future and architectural feature markets. Also, given the higher value of the output, it is now possible to make greater economic use of the tree bole.
The `tree bole' describes the quantity of timber available in a single tree from the base of the trunk to the crown. The RFA public consultation paper acknowledges that the future adoption of `whole bole' logging methods, generally in place of the current sawlog specification, will enable the timber industry to extract greater yields of timber from a tree bole than is now possible using the sawlog specification. With an uptake in lower grade logs it is anticipated that the sustainable supply of sawlogs for jarrah may vary between 410,000 and 480,000 cu/m per year'1.
To the Nationals' knowledge, no detailed information about the whole bole-logging and sawing trials conducted in 1997 has been made available to the public, although a total of 6000 tonnes of logs were supplied to 14 sawmillers for the trials. In response to a recent question about this issue, CALM said five trials of whole bole-logging in the jarrah forest had been conducted and that `initial results from the logging perspective are promising'. However, anecdotal evidence from at least one major miller who participated in a trial suggests there was a range of difficulties in handling and processing whole bole-logs at the mill.
Evidence to the Legislative Council of Western Australia's Standing Committee on Ecological Sustainable Development given by the Forest Industries Federation of WA also raised concerns about whole bole logging:
The concept of whole bole logging is that the tree is cut at the base and the crown, and what is left is the whole bole. If technically feasible 
 it is transported to a mill, otherwise it must be cut into shorter lengths. If it is not straight enough it may need to be cut. That is a different log production system from the current system which involves grading of logs in the forest. The industry and CALM are doing some trials on the concept of whole bole logging, and the main objective is to increase the overall utilisation of the timber resource. However, early indications from the trials are that we are just transferring a waste product from the forest to the mill at a fairly great expense2.
From the Nationals' research, the issue is whether it is fair to suggest and then to expect that the timber industry and the public should accept the argument that the sawlog specification will become `irrelevant' because of the future adoption of whole bole-logging and a further refinement of sawing technologies, as proposed in the RFA public consultation paper, when:
1.	 the jarrah forest is still being logged for the production of first and second grade sawlogs as the principal `quality' products
2.	 the RFA public consultation paper `approaches' detail the implications for the sawlog industry of committing additional forest to the conservation estate
3.	 and, there is a dearth of information available to the public about the viability of bole-logging and processing
The Legislative Council's standing committee recently examined sawlog yields in relation to achieving ecologically-sustainable forest management. A senior RFA official admitted in evidence to the committee that jarrah sawlog yields were irrelevant to biological sustainability.
1	Comprehensive Regional Assessment, 1998 p.42
2	 Report of the Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development—The Regional Forest Agreement Process, August 1998.
The committee responded with the following statement:
The Committee does not accept that it is self-evident that the first and second grade jarrah sawlog harvest levels are irrelevant to achieving ecologically-sustainable forest management. The currently applicable parameters for timber harvest levels in the state, determined by the Minister for the Environment and applied by CALM through the Forest Management Plan are given in terms of first and second grade sawlog harvest levels. If (as the witness suggests) the RFA process has abandoned this key indicator without discussion or justification, this appears to be a serious flaw in the RFA process1. 

The Nationals believe the matter of maintaining sustainable yield in perpetuity is central to the future of the forest estate's viability and the timber industry's economic growth. The public deserves comprehensive explanations before the RFA is concluded of the ways in which the RFA and the state government will ensure responsible management of this important community resource.
Expressing jarrah harvest levels in terms of gross bole volume (gbv) felled rather than sawlog volume removed.
Former environment minister Kevin Minson said in his 1993 statement of forest management:
I recognise that the regulation of the allowable harvest by sawlog volume is really only an indicator of gross bole volume felled—fundamental measure of forest production and sustainability. Fixing set sawlog levels has inherent disincentives to making the fullest possible use of timber felled. I therefore believe it is desirable to develop a system of yield regulation based on gross bole volume felled rather than sawlog volume removed. Once such a system is developed, harvest levels should be expressed in terms of gross bole volume felled at the maximum level equal to the gross bole increment—thus ensuring both forest sustainability and optimum log utilisation2.
The RFA Comprehensive Regional Assessment report also claimed:
Because definitions of what constitutes a sawlog will change over time as milling technology and other factors change, the gross bole volume (gbv) is used to provide an estimate of the maximum resource available over time.
The Nationals believe CALM must explain to the public how it intends to regulate and account for the quality of the resource, in the context of its forest structural goals, when `gbv felled' descriptions and whole-bole logging methods are implemented, assuming whole-bole logging proves a viable and more efficient harvesting specification than the sawlog specification.
This would help to alleviate some of the community's concerns that a switch to `gbv felled' may create a more juvenile forest, making it difficult for industry maintenance and development to be based on solid sawn timber production.
CALM and industry need to justify to the wider community that a switch to `gbv-felled' to express jarrah harvest levels and the adoption of whole bole-logging methods are in the best interests of the timber industry and the forest sustainability.
The need for industry to plan its restructuring
As already reported, the Meagher committee determined the volume of the long-term, non- 
 declining yield of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs to be 300,000 cu/m per year.
The RFA public consultation paper suggests that this decline may be partially offset by:
an increase in the uptake of lower grade jarrah logs
the future adoption of whole tree-bole logging methods
the further refinement of sawing technologies to enable lower grade logs to be sawn
However, details of whole tree-bole logging trials have not been disclosed and there has been little uptake of lower grade material since Minson's 1993 statement.
This would suggest that the timber industry is still focused on sawlogs as the primary quality source of timber.
If Approaches A and B outlined in the RFA public consultation paper can be described as having a negative impact on employment in the timber industry and employees' quality of life, access to social and physical infrastructure and community viability, then a reduction in allowable cut to 300,000 cu/m for first and second grade jarrah sawlogs per year from 2003 will be of significant concern to the timber industry.
As the Legislative Council standing committee's recent report on the RFA process notes:
It is disappointing that the `approaches' do not propose levels for jarrah first and second grade sawlog harvest which are in the vicinity of CALM's estimated level of 300,000 cu/m per year. . . This will significantly affect timber businesses and workers currently reliant on the jarrah resource. . . Given the intention of the RFA process to cater for employment and community needs, it is somewhat surprising that options such as these are not canvassed in the public consultation paper.
The Nationals have similar concerns. Until there is any evidence to support whole-bole logging methods and a significant uptake in lower grade logs, it would seem the industry is relying heavily on sawlogs for sawn timber production. Therefore, plans for industry restructuring are vital given a forecast drop in supply in the year 2003.
Forest management and silvicultural treatment for timber production in the jarrah forest
The Nationals are concerned about a lack of information generally available to the public, and hence a lack of public debate, about the implications of forest management in relation to silvicultural practice.
In 1991-92 the area of jarrah forest `treated' by CALM to meet contemporary log supply contracts and to ensure future supply availability totalled 
 10,550 hectares. This area has steadily increased since 1991-92 to a total of 20,190 ha in 1996-97.
What is of concern is that CALM told the Environmental Protection Authority in 1993 that silvicultural practice would generally be limited to certain silvicultural treatments, each expressed as a percentage of the total area to be `treated'.
However, there have been some significant differences in the actual use of these various treatments, with a marked increase in the area treated as:
1.	 `shelterwood', in which a forest stand is cut, but not cleared, to encourage seedfall and the production of jarrah lignotubers, and
2.	 `selective', in which stands of marginal forest are cut
In a written response to a series of questions about these silvicultural treatments, CALM told the Nationals the increased area cut to shelterwood in recent years `is an indication that a more precautionary approach is being taken to ensure that sufficient growing stock is available for release. Shelterwood cutting has only been introduced since the late 1980s and forest officers and silviculturists have been learning how best to apply this treatment to various forest types'.
It is also of concern to the timber industry that the size and quality of a standard first-grade jarrah sawlog, for example, has changed significantly over time. This could lead the public to conclude that the jarrah forest is being over-cut, over a shorter rotation length to ensure government timber royalty income is maintained at optimum levels at the expense of sawlog quality.
None of these issues has been canvassed in the current public debate, nor in the RFA public consultation paper. The Nationals believe it is appropriate, given the high level of public interest in forest management issues, that comprehensive explanations of the reasons for the apparent changes in silvicultural treatments and reported changes in sawlog quality should be placed on the public record.
Silvicultural treatments in the karri forest
The government's current forest management plan required 2000 ha per year of regrowth karri to be thinned to ensure that its viability as a future source of sawn timber is maintained at an optimum level.
However, in the four years to 1996-97, a total of just 140 ha of regrowth karri was thinned despite a requirement that this treatment should have taken place in about 8000 ha of forest. CALM claims that in the past four to five years it has been required to reschedule logging into areas of karri forest previously cut under a selection-logging prescription in the 1950s and 1960s `because of Commonwealth government processes and litigation which 
 have deferred logging in other old-growth karri areas'.
In response to a question about this marked reduction in thinning treatment, CALM told the Nationals that `short-term delays in thinning schedules will not significantly affect future sawlog availability'. CALM continued: `Also, karri is a self-thinning species. The future sawlog crop trees will continue to grow and develop without intervention by thinning.'
Again, the Nationals believe it is appropriate that a comprehensive explanation of the reason for this change in silvicultural practice should be placed on the public record.
The role and responsibilities of the public forest management agency
The Conservation and Land Management Department (CALM) is the principal agency responsible for public native forest management in Western Australia.
For a number of years some sections of the community have perceived an inherent conflict of interest in CALM's administrative charter, centred on the agency's responsibility to ensure the proper management of the public native forest estate but which requires both the conservation and exploitation of the forest resource.
The Nationals expect the government to conduct a comprehensive, independent study of CALM's administrative responsibilities beyond the issues raised by the report of the independent expert advisory group on the assessment of ecologically-sustainable forest management which was conducted as part of the RFA process.
The public has a right to expect that government agencies responsible for the management of any public property, and especially `property' as sensitive as a limited native forest resource of which a significant part has been acknowledged as `not (being) in a steady state', will discharge its responsibilities entirely in the public interest. However, it appears that large sections of the community believe, rightly or wrongly, that CALM's financial interest in forest management places the public interest at a disadvantage.
The Nationals are also concerned that the agency's business structure, by which it derives royalties from timber companies on behalf of the state and which are used to fund its forest management and conservation operations, leaves open to question the possibility that timber companies may be contracted by CALM to purchase quantities of logs greater than the level of market demand.
The Nationals believe the significant public interest in these matters should be addressed.
Report of the Legislative Council of Western Australia's Standing Committee on Ecologically 
 Sustainable Development (ESD)—The Regional Forest Agreement Process
The Western Australian Legislative Council's all-party select committee inquiring into ecologically sustainable development in Western Australia has delivered an unanimous interim report on the RFA process.
The committee has recommended that the Department of Premier and Cabinet assume responsibility from CALM as the lead agency for the rest of the RFA process and that an accord process be developed between industry, conservation, government and other interests in an effort to reduce the level of conflict surrounding forest management.
Recommendations include:
development of an accord process to determine an acceptable definition of old growth forests
flexible application of JANIS criteria to ensure protection of local conservation needs
recognition be given to community support for more reservation of the main belt karri forest
consideration by the proposed accord process about how the implementation of the long-term sustainable jarrah sawlog harvest is to be achieved
The committee has also reinforced a view that the RFA does not have to be finalised until the year 2000 and that the intent of the scoping agreement for the RFA process be honoured by the State Government by releasing a draft RFA for public comment and assessment by the WA Environmental Protection Authority.
Environmental Protection Authority's Report on CALM's 1997 progress and compliance on the implementation of the 1994-2003 Forest Management Plan (subject to ministerial conditions)
An advisory committee to the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority, which has been examining CALM's progress and compliance report with its implementation of the current forest management plan, subject to certain ministerial conditions, is expected to present its report to the EPA in the near future.
CALM is of the view that the RFA and the EPA advisory committee review are two separate processes, which is obvious. In a written response to a question about the EPA review, CALM told the Nationals it did not believe the review could have a bearing on any aspect of the RFA's outcome.
Given the scope and timeliness of these two separate and independent inquiries, the Nationals believe it is imperative that the ESD Committee's and EPA committee's findings are considered before any determination is made to conclude the RFA.  

RFA Scoping Agreement
A scoping agreement signed by the Commonwealth and state governments in July 1996 confirmed the government's intentions to proceed with the negotiation of a Regional Forest Agreement for the south-west forest region of Western Australia.
While the Nationals recognise that this agreement has no legal capacity, it has had the effect of creating a public expectation that any draft RFA should be the subject of an environmental impact assessment by the Western Australian EPA before the RFA is concluded.
There is a significant public interest in this matter, with some sections of the community now of the view that such an assessment would be likely to provide further protection of the public's interest in comprehensive forest management.
The Nationals believe the government, as a `decision-making authority' under the terms of the EPA Act, is at best required to refer any draft RFA to the EPA for assessment. It at least has a moral obligation to do so. This has been reiterated in the ESD Committee's report.
Local conservation needs
Forest areas of `high conservation value' have been identified by local communities. These include, for example, Jane, Giblett, Hawke, Sharpe and Hilliger, all of which are now well known in the public arena.
As the ESD standing committee's recent report highlighted:
The difficulty the RFA process poses for people interested in reservations in a particular location is that JANIS criteria percentage targets for reservation could be met without the claims for reservation of a particular location having even been considered.
The committee also recommended:
. . . the flexibility provisions in the JANIS criteria be used to promote local conservation and recreation needs and to improve the distribution of reserved areas, particularly in areas where little old growth is identified by the Comprehensive Regional Assessment.
A concern of the Nationals is that nearly  all areas of high conservation value, according to maps of the forest estate published during the RFA process, correspond with the areas of highest significance for sustained timber yield for the next 40 years.
It is apparent that there is a conflict as to how these areas should be managed and this may require an independent assessment to examine the values of these areas, including tourism's economic potential.

—Senator Bolkus, you also require leave to move the amendment.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-02,"—I rise to support Senator Margetts's motion to defer the signing of the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement. As my colleague Senator Murray has indicated on many previous occasions, we support the concept of RFAs, but certainly not the process of this one. Public consultation on this RFA has been grossly inadequate. I think the role of the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management in overseeing the process has been comprehensively discredited. Frankly, we would probably be only a little worse off if the Forest Industries Association were steering the RFA process.
The level of government secrecy has been such that we should fear the worst from this RFA. Independent scientists, the community, tourist concerns and government departments unlikely to toe the Court government line have all been excluded from the RFA's steering committee. Taxpayers are being forced to subsidise the enormous environmental vandalism sanctioned by the Court government, and they are not even allowed to know what they are in for. The Court government has refused to submit the draft RFA to the Environment Protection Authority for assessment, so there goes one of the very few mechanisms that the public has to call the government to account over this kind of dealing.
This issue is taking on Franklin Dam proportions. More than 80 per cent of submissions to the steering committee opposed logging the remaining 10 per cent of Western 
 Australia's old-growth forests. Polling by AMR Quantum Harris research has revealed that 87 per cent of Western Australians do not want these forests clear-felled.	It was extremely heartening to see the AFL football coach Mick Mathouse—
Government senators interjecting—
—Sorry, Mick Malthouse—in the Weekend Australian  last month defending Western Australia's forests. In the Senate one is supposed to know about football but obviously not about forests. Public figures who lend their presence to campaigns such as this are doing incredibly valuable work. At a time when conservation issues are consistently considered to be off the national agenda, and especially off our commercial television screens, we do need prominent people to be up there speaking out.
The logging companies have been spending buckets of money trying to convince us that mainstream Australia—whatever that is—has no environmental conscience, yet the students and the so-called `ferals' who have so ardently defended our forests at blockades are just the tip of the iceberg of opposition. These people are no doubt far more representative of mainstream Australia than are the timber company executives who are magnificently remunerated in their work of trashing our national heritage.
Even the National Party, as Senator Bolkus has said, has come out against the decimation of jarrah forests. When the National Party comes out against logging, surely the right thing for the Court government to do is to shut up and listen just for a change. If Premier Court were here today, I would ask him to remember his father's words. Sir Charles Court promised exactly 20 years ago that half of the West's sawlog material would come from plantation timber by the year 2000. By the year 2010, it would be two-thirds. Of course, 1998 has almost come and gone and only 31 per cent is derived from plantation sources.
It makes no environmental sense and no economic sense to turn these precious natural assets into woodchips. Most of us, I think, reject the idea that magnificent stands of jarrah and karri should be wasted on tooth 
 picks and railway sleepers or, worse, paper. Isn't it strange that economic rationalist politicians work themselves into something of a lather over things like graffiti, which the artistic drives of some young people are channelled into, yet they actively encourage the greater vandalism of woodchipping old-growth forests. The environmental vandalism engaged in by the Court government deserves a three strikes and you are out approach in our view—summary justice of the sort that they are so fond of meting out.
In this chamber this week a motion co-sponsored by the Democrats, the Greens and the ALP was defeated. It would have adopted the recommendations of the WA Legislative Council Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development. The motion called for the replacement of CALM as the lead agency for the RFA. It also called for the release of the draft RFA for public comment, its submission to the EPA for assessment and its finalisation through an accord process. The refusal of the Howard government and the Court government to countenance any of these measures is in direct contravention of the RFA scoping agreement. Logging continues in such sensitive areas as Wattle Block and Dombakup 24, contravening the 1992 National Forest Policy.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-12-02,"—I hope that in the time I have to speak on this urgency motion I can dispel some of the misinformation and nonsense that has been peddled in this place. Senator Margetts, Senator Allison and Senator Bolkus have all come in here regurgitating their speeches that we heard when the Tasmanian RFA and the Victorian RFA were dealt with. No doubt when we get to the next one we will hear speeches containing the same words with a few small changes. They refuse to acknowledge that this process is a scientific one. It is not and never has been—and nor should it be—a PR process. It is a public consultation process.
The first thing that I will say about the consultation that has occurred in this process is that not only have the Green groups, represented on a de facto basis in Western Australia by Senator Margetts, steadfastly 
 refused to participate in the RFA consultation process but also they have chosen instead to block the lawful activities of the timber industry. They have denied the industry their rights, through protest actions which endanger themselves and the forest workers—not only their jobs but also their lives. You should think about that. These protests have been exacerbated by the conflicts in south-west communities and remove any potential for a future accord.
The Conservation Council of WA and the WA Forest Alliance never took the opportunity to involve themselves in the process. They refused to join in. They now seek to have an accord put in place. They could join in today if they wanted to do so. Yet they never took the opportunity to be included from day one. They never exercised their democratic rights: they ignored the process. I find it very hypocritical that we now have a representative from WA coming in here and saying, `We want to get involved now.' Let us think about that. They had the opportunity but they denied themselves that opportunity. That is their problem.
It is essential to deal with some of the events that have taken place. I refer to the moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forest. The deferred forest agreement, signed by the Prime Minister and the Western Australian Premier, dealt with this issue. Areas of forest that may be required for a future conservation reserve system were deferred from timber harvesting until the RFA was completed. That is fact.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—Senator Brown from Tasmania can jump up and down all he likes. If he would deal with the facts for once in this place, he would find out what is going on. Additionally, the Western Australian Minister for the Environment subsequently nominated other areas of forest that may be required for a conservation reserve system so that these areas would also not be logged until completion of the RFA.
—And then they will be logged. 
—No, not necessarily. How wrong you can be. How little you know. Regarding the accord process, consultation processes for the RFA have included—and listen to this very carefully, Madam Acting Deputy President, because it is absolutely crucial to getting the truth on the table—two series of public meetings in towns throughout the region; a stakeholder reference group, which has held nine meetings in both city and country locations; a Noongar action group, which has held at least five meetings; a state agreements act committee, which has held five meetings; a series of 10 community heritage workshops; a series of seven Aboriginal community workshops; surveys and interviews to develop a regional social profile; surveys and interviews to gather information on the full range of forest based industries, including timber, mining, tourism, apiary, craft, specialty timber, firewood, wildflower picking and seed collection; surveys and interviews of sawmill industry employees; more than 120 meetings with individuals or groups of stakeholders; eight local discussion group workshops to assist with social impact assessment; reports made available for public comment and feedback; specific public comment and feedback requested for two major reports on assessment of ecologically sustainable forest management in the south-west forest region of Western Australia and the public consultation paper Towards a regional forest agreement for the south west forest region of Western Australia.
That is a very comprehensive list of the consultation that has occurred. There is still an opportunity for these groups to join in, if they so choose. The time I have to speak is unfortunately short. There is a lot of information that can be put on the table and it needs to be recognised in its proper context.
I have heard some criticism of CALM. No department or environmental institution has done more to control feral animals in a state, region or forest than CALM. No organisation has done more to rehabilitate and increase the population of native animals.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—You should go down and have a look at it and open your eyes 
 occasionally. I emphasise that very strongly. For political purposes some people have now changed their position, but I think it was in about 1992 that CALM's plan in Western Australia for management of its forests was heralded as world's best practice but, in fact, it became the springboard for even more demands to close down forest areas. But remember who supported that at that time. Remember a West Australian Labor premier called Carmen Lawrence? Remember a leader of the Democrats called John Coulter? They both supported it, as did a number of other prominent people throughout Australia. It is very important that we deal with this aspect on its merit.
In the time remaining to me, I would like to say a little about the change of wording suggested by Senator Bolkus. He suggested that `accord' should be changed to `consultation'. He is trying to play a clever trick. There is a great difference between `consultation' and `accord'. He is trying to put in place what could occur now if these people were to wake up, join the process and make a contribution. They are welcome to make a contribution. In fact, we on our side of politics want them to make a contribution. They make a contribution in many areas, not least in the Landcare program, which I have discussed with them often and consistently. There is still time for them to get involved in the RFA process.
Lastly, I want to say something about forest plantations. Senator Allison made some comment about this. Regardless of the current process, the plantation development, of which I am very proud, having been involved in getting it off the ground, is far ahead of that in any other state in Australia. It is increasing at an enormous rate. I do not have time today to go into the details, but I will avail myself of another opportunity to put on the public record the position with regard to the enormous amount of plantation development on both public and private land in Western Australia and the contribution that is being made by a variety of sectors.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I rise to support the proposal with the alteration to the wording suggested 
 by Senator Bolkus. Indeed, having listened to the last speaker, Senator Crane, I am sure people would be wondering whether he even listened to any of the contributions made by earlier speakers.
I understand that Senator Crane has his hands full at the moment. After all, he has the job of trying to repair the damage that is being inflicted upon rural and regional Australia by his ministerial colleagues in the other place, whether it be in the wool industry or in other areas of agriculture or forestry. Having listened to Senator Crane a moment ago, you could be forgiven for wondering whether he has even canvassed the intent of this proposal.
The proposal calls for a deferral of the process of signing the RFA pending certain things happening. In particular, we would suggest there is a need to improve the consultation process. That is something that is not just being called for by green groups or conservation groups, as you might refer to them, Senator Crane; you have ignored the fact that this is a call that is coming from right across the spectrum. For instance, as Senator Bolkus pointed out—and I will come back to this point in a moment—there are very strong calls from your coalition colleagues, the Nationals, to halt this process and try to get it back on track.
I use those words `back on track' because, in answer to a question from Senator Margetts on the 25th of this month on this very issue, what did we get from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in this place, Senator Hill? There was fulsome praise for Mr Tuckey—Chainsaw Tuckey—and there was an attack upon the New South Wales government. We then had this throwaway line:
Having said that, the progress on an RFA for Western Australia, whilst it is a little slower than I would have liked, remains on track.
The concession is there. If Senator Hill had told the full story, he would have said that not only is it not on track or slowed down, but it is right off the rails.
Government senators interjecting—
—I remind senators opposite that when Senator Hill and Mr 
 Tuckey, the minister in the other place, tried to turn the attack back upon the New South Wales government with respect to the recent RFA situation in that state, their own coalition colleagues in the upper house in New South Wales endorsed the very agreements negotiated by the Carr government, because they adopted the process of consultation. Whilst we recognise that in this debate it will never be the case that all sides will be completely satisfied, we had a satisfactory outcome.
But we do not have that situation in Western Australia; far from it. Senator Knowles said, `Well, we must have had consultation because 30,000 people lodged submissions.' I would have thought that the fact that 30,000 submissions came in was indicative of the fact that there were real issues to be dealt with here and that maybe some of the major players in the process should be given a little more recognition than has been given to them by the Western Australian government.
I refer, for instance, to the Western Australian Municipal Association—the association that represents local government in Western Australia. They have been very critical of this process. They have pointed out that the RFA steering committee does not represent all of the stakeholders. They are calling for the process to be deferred so that their interests can be recognised.
Senator Lightfoot interjecting—
—I remind Senator Lightfoot that these are not people or organisations that are generally in the camp supporting the Labor Party or the Greens, and the same can be said about the media interests that Senator Bolkus referred to. There is the Western Australian Forest Alliance; no doubt their views have been put adequately by the Greens here. As Senator Bolkus said, there are also the Western Australian Nationals. If you are not prepared to listen to us or to conservation groups, why don't you at least listen to those people who are closest to you in ideology—your own coalition colleagues? On 18 November, they issued a media statement. I will quote from this media statement and, at the end of my speech, I will also seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard . I will provide a copy to the government. I point 
 out that this media statement is a document that goes with the issues statement that was incorporated earlier. This is what the Nationals put in their media statement:
The National Party today asked the state government to give the community a comprehensive response to concerns about significant forest management issues raised as a result of party policy research during the past 12 months.
Nationals' director Jamie Kronborg said an `issues statement' on forest management and conservation prepared by the party highlighted a number of potential conflicts between government commitments to forest management and current or possible practice in the future.
Mr Kronborg said the party's primary concern centred on the complex question of the jarrah forest's continuing ability to yield sawn timber of sufficient quality and volume to meet the demands of the timber industry in perpetuity and, at the same time, to provide forest reserves for local conservation, tourism or community needs.
Later on in the media statement Mr Kronborg highlights a range of issues. The media statement finishes with:
""There is a high level of public interest in future management of WA's public native forests and, for this reason alone, the government must ensure that the quality of the resource is maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of many industry and community interests, including the tourism industry,"" Mr Kronborg said.
""Everyone in the community needs to ensure that the state takes a responsible approach to forest management, given that the RFA will determine the size of the conservation estate for the next 20 years . . .
Attached to that media statement was the issues statement that Senator Bolkus referred to. I would like to quote extensive sections of that document but it has already been incorporated in the Hansard . The National Party says in it, for instance, that:
. . . finding the `common ground' in the complex forest debate is an extremely difficult task, which the Nationals recognise. The community places a diverse range of values on native forest and consequently there are a number of conflicts dividing interest groups on forest management principles and practices.
This is aggravated by the differing community values placed particularly on old-growth native forest ranging across economic, cultural, social, environmental or ecological and aesthetic values. As a result, and despite the genuine commitment 
 of many people and organisations to the RFA process since July 1996, the Nationals remain concerned, as the process draws to a conclusion, that a number of significant issues are still to be openly and publicly addressed.
They go on to identify the issues in that issues statement. For instance, they refer, as Senator Bolkus pointed out, to the report of the Legislative Council standing committee which looked at the issue of sawlog yields. They particularly point out the problem of conflict of interest that exists within CALM, the Conservation and Land Management Department, and how that issue needs to be addressed. They refer to proposed changes in respect of measuring gross bole volume felled, rather than sawlog volume removed. The statement states:
CALM and industry need to justify to the wider community that a switch to `gbv felled' to express jarrah harvest levels and the adoption of whole bole-logging methods are in the best interests of the timber industry and the forest sustainability.
This is not a conservation group; this is the Western Australian National Party saying to the Western Australian government and all those involved in the process that they have got to put up the scientific and other justification required for that process. I would ask honourable senators and the ministers in this government this: if you cannot listen to anyone else because of your ideological blinkers, why don't you at least listen to those people who sit next to you on your own side, who are saying to you and who are saying publicly in this very extensive issues statement—
—Order! The honourable senator's time has expired. Could I just say that we will have the same arrangement. Senator Forshaw sought leave. He has to provide the document and you can indicate whether or not leave is granted at a later stage.
—I don't think we need to incorporate it, Madam Acting Deputy President, because it has all been read.
—I did not read the entire document. I would seek leave to incorporate it. As I explained, it is actually the 
 media statement that accompanies the document that has already been incorporated.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
NATIONALS DEMAND EXPLANATIONS ON FOREST MANAGEMENT
The National Party today asked the state government to give the community a comprehensive response to concerns about significant forest management issues raised as a result of party policy research during the past 12 months.
Nationals' director Jamie Kronborg said an `issues statement' on forest management and conservation prepared by the party highlighted a number of potential conflicts between government commitments to forest management and current or possible practice in the future.
Mr Kronborg said the party's primary concern centred on the complex question of the jarrah forest's continuing ability to yield sawn timber of sufficient quality and volume to meet the demands of the timber industry in perpetuity and, at the same time, to provide forest reserves for local conservation, tourism or community needs.
`For the timber industry, the possible outcomes of the proposed Regional Forest Agreement set out in papers published as part of that process detail the implications that a change in the size of the conservation estate will have on first and second-grade jarrah sawlog production,' Mr Kronborg said.
`This is clearly the proper approach because the jarrah forest is still being logged principally, in value terms, for the production of first and second-grade sawlogs and the timber industry's primary requirement is for the supply of these sawlogs.'
`However, the Conservation and Land Management Department has claimed in a recent, separate paper that the current sawlog specification has become irrelevant.'
`In its place it is suggesting a switch to a different harvesting specification known as whole bole logging, which CALM believes could enable the timber industry to extract greater yields of timber from a tree than is now possible using the sawlog specification.'
`But the Nationals are very concerned that if the key forest harvesting measure known as the sawlog specification has become `irrelevant', as CALM claims, then it would appear that some of the most important conclusions of the RFA public consultation paper, in which the outcomes are based entirely on impacts on sawlog yield, could be called into question.'
Mr Kronborg said the Nationals' issues statement also challenged the government to provide comprehensive explanations about: 

	 the ways in which the quality of the jarrah forest resources would be maintained if a different harvesting specification was to be introduced
	 the reason why the area of jarrah forest cut for logging in the past six years had almost doubled to more than 20,000 hectares
	 the reasons for apparent change over time in the size and quality of a standard first-grade jarrah sawlog
	 the reason for changes in silvicultural practice which have prevented the timely thinning of regrowth karri and jarrah.
`There is a high level of public interest in future management of WA's public native forests and, for this reason alone, the government must ensure that the quality of the resource is maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of many industry and community interests, including the tourism industry,' Mr Kronborg said.
`Everyone in the community needs to ensure that the state takes a responsible approach to forest management, given that the RFA will determine the size of the conservation estate for the next 20 years.'
`The additional information which the Nationals are seeking to have placed on the public record will aid the RFA process and help to clarify some significant community concerns.'
Mr Kronborg said the party had already released details of the outcomes it expected from the RFA process.
These included:
	 the release of a draft RFA for public comment and assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority
	 a reduction in the first and second-grade jarrah sawlog cut to no more than 280,000 cubic metres per year
	 protection for local areas of high conservation value
	 assistance to the timber industry to encourage greater value-adding and the maintenance of employment levels
	 encouragement for the further development of the plantation timber resource, and
	 a review of CALM's funding sources and requirements.

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1998-12-02,"—I rise to reject the motion put forward by Senator Dee Margetts this afternoon. There are two parts to it and I will give 
 the reasons why I reject it. As for the first part, I find the deceit of the motion quite disturbing. Senator Margetts's motion spoke, inter alia, of the need `for an immediate moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests.' It just happens to be—and I do not know whether Senator Margetts knew this or not when she put this motion up—that the moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests actually exists. She seems to have forgotten that.
She has forgotten that there was a deferred forest agreement—and that is the one that is still in place—which does not allow logging in forests that might be necessary for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. That agreement is in all but name a moratorium on those areas of high conservation value that might be required for conservation reasons. That superimposes on what Senator Margetts said, so that part of it is already in place.	In the second part she concludes:
. . . until the WA Environment Protection Authority has had the opportunity to assess the draft RFA that arises from that accord process.
Again, there must apparently be some deceit, or perhaps Senator Margetts might want to clear that up when she gets up to rebut what I have said. But the last part of the motion is also rebutted by the RFA being subject to the legislative obligations of both the Western Australian and the Commonwealth governments. This means that changes to the reserve system as a result of the RFA, under current WA legislation, would require assessment by the EPA as part of the development of the new forest management plan. That will be the means of implementing much of the regional forest agreement.
—Dishonest!
—It is in effect dishonest. Perhaps Senator Margetts can clear that up, because I think it is a very serious thing to put up an urgency motion of this nature, only to have it rebutted. That is from the office of the Minister for Conservation and the Environment in Western Australia.
—That wouldn't be honest then, would it?
—I think, Senator Brown, that that is a very unkind thing to say about one of the best ministers that this nation has ever seen with respect to the environment and conservation—a very objective lady indeed in her portfolio. So I think that that is rather unfair. Senator Allison said in her read speech—obviously prepared by someone else, and I think that's another form of deceit—that the consultation process was grossly inadequate. And yet it has been going for two years.
The south-west of Western Australia, from which all of our timber is commercially harvested with the exception of some sandalwood that is pulled from the rest of the state, goes from Gingin in the north of Perth—in a generic sense—down to and including Denmark. The area is roughly bounded by the Albany Highway to Point Naturaliste and out to the coast that faces the Indian Ocean.
The RFA contained certain forest statistics based on the industry, but that industry is not based purely on the harvesting of timber—or, as someone said, on the mining of timber, and no doubt some timber is mined in the sense that it is not replaced. It also contains a significant area of mining worth about $2.68 billion to the state in the last fiscal year. That includes bauxite—incidentally, there are reserves of bauxite for 70 years, 2,600 million tonnes of it—tantalum, lithium, tin, 2.4 million tonnes of coal mined annually within that area that I just described, mineral sands, and gold.
That of course entails employment. This is what this is all about. This is not just about conservation of timber, the preservation of certain areas; it is about the whole process that is encompassed by this area. It includes tourism as well. You come in here and try to destroy industries but you offer no solutions to unemployment. That industry employs 8,118 people in that area.
—Sorry? What? It does not.
—But there are five times that number  who are dependent indirectly on that area. Where is your solution for that, Senator Margetts? And what is the Greens' record on unemployment? Not good. 
 You never offer anything for that. You destroy but don't offer some solution to it. That means that 40,000 jobs are at risk if you destroy that area. Not only is there $2.68 billion coming out of that area; there is a further $3.3 billion for Western Australia, and it is equivalent to $4.68 million nationally. That does not include payroll tax, royalties, regional revenues and local purchases that mining companies and others, such as the timber industry, put into the district. We know there are competing industries. We try to take into account industries such as nature conservation and water catchment—200,000 million litres of water come from that area to serve Bunbury and that area between Bunbury and Perth.
I want to say something to defend someone who was a very prominent Labor man, Dr Syd Shea. We are very lucky to have him in Western Australia. He is one of the most brilliant scientists that has ever been in the west and employed by the west. He has great feeling and a great natural empathy for that area that he is currently managing.
—He is an agent of destruction.
—He is not, and it is very unfair of you to say that. I will defend Dr Sydney Shea. I do not often see eye to eye with him politically but he is a great man for the job that he does for CALM and the job that he does for Western Australia.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-02,"—I am very pleased to be able to refute some of the arguments made today. It is interesting that the coalition was not prepared to give more time for the Greens and the Democrats to put their arguments. The government has given 25 minutes. Their arguments are very easy to refute.
The moratorium has been cited as existing. Let me tell you that the moratorium as it was originally set up included a halting of logging in all National Estate listed forests. That includes the Wattle Block, where people are desperately trying to halt the destruction and vandalism of those important ecological systems and forest areas. The moratorium was basically taken by the coalition and stripped 
 of most of its power—most of the areas that had been listed on the  National Estate. So, basically, it means nothing much at all under the coalition. Senator Knowles said that the deferred forest agreement is being taken into consideration. In fact, it is being ignored.
Rigorous scientific assessment requires peer review. Again and again the Department of Conservation and Land Management have refused to have their scientific papers peer reviewed. Why? It is because they are afraid of what real scientific analysis will do to their sham scientific assessments. They will not get them peer reviewed and they cannot be classified as scientific assessments unless they undergo proper peer review.
Senator Knowles mentions vegetation mapping. She clearly forgot to mention the satellite pictures from the Landsat images by the CSIRO. They are shocking pictures which show the reality of what is happening to Western Australian forests. A lot of people were set back on their heels to see those images of what was really happening—the real picture in Western Australia.
Since this sham RFA started in 1996, 50,000 hectares of high conservation forests have been cut. What kind of protection or moratorium is that? Senator Knowles said that if you do not have parties prepared to come to the table for consultation the process becomes so much more difficult. Yes. The strong work, the enormous work, that Dr Christine Sharpe has done on the ecologically sustainable committee has for the first time got all parties together and made sure that they make progress—talking to workers, industry, conservationists and government bodies and getting them together to work their way through issues of structural adjustment, employment and how the industry can be sustainable in the future.
Is it sustainable? There have been various comments made about what Western Australia does. In the Australian magazine of 21-22 November on page 21 the indications are that other states are doing much better. Western Australia is still 68 per cent dependent on hardwood whereas New South Wales is 36 per cent dependent, Victoria 38 per cent and Queensland has got to 21 per cent because 
 they are using more plantations. We are not being smart with our forest management; we are not being smart with employment.
Let us talk about public meetings. I went to the one in Mundaring. It was a sham until the people who wanted to protect the forest actually hijacked the meeting in a very creative way and got people talking to each other and checking the information. Instead of having a one-to-one discussion where people can be fed nonsense, they opened up the meeting. The majority of those at the meeting said that it was a great idea. Something useful was actually done. The rest of it was a sham. The consultation processes were not public meetings, they were shams.
The misinformation and nonsense is often coming from the people who should be taking responsible decisions. Green groups have chosen to take a responsible view because they found that the steering committees—the people who were forming the process—cut out all of those people, including the people in the tourism industry, who had the majority of jobs at risk as a result of the processes taking place.
We know the figures given by Senator Lightfoot are incorrect in terms of direct employment. In my first contribution to this debate I gave the real figures for direct employment—comparing the forest industry and the tourism industry—let alone the indirect employment in the other small industries that rely on the forest remaining as old growth forest and resources for the future. It is no good CALM simply breeding animals if their habitat is being destroyed. I seek leave to amend the motion by replacing the word `accord', wherever occurring, with the word `consultation'.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-02,"—On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I present the eighth annual statement to parliament on Australia's Development Cooperation Program. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Eighth Annual Statement to Parliament on Australia's Development Cooperation Program.
Mr Speaker, when I delivered last year's Annual Statement I tabled  Better Aid for a Better Future.  It represented a fundamental realignment of Australia's aid program to the clear objective of ""advancing Australia's national interest by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development"" . It outlined new priorities for the aid program and set the framework for their implementation.
Since that time, the regional economic crisis has placed urgent demands on Australia's assistance. Our capacity to respond to these events has been due, in no small measure, to the changes put in place in Better Aid for a Better Future.  Today I will outline: 

.	 how we have responded to the crisis in our region, including increased support for governance and resumed growth;
.	 the role of human rights in the aid program;
.	 our progress in implementing the policy directions I announced a year ago; and
.	 the emphasis placed on involving the Australian community in our aid efforts
REGIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
The regional economic crisis has been compounded by a series of natural disasters including droughts across South East Asia and the Pacific. These events have thrown millions of people back into poverty and threatened thirty years of development progress. In Indonesia, for example, widespread and increasing unemployment and poverty, food shortages, and children leaving school mean not only that people are suffering now, but that impacts will be felt across generations. And, as the social and economic impacts intensify, the capacity of regional governments to respond is diminishing.
Australia is playing an active and leading role in helping these countries deal with the impacts of the crisis. Our response, through the aid program, has been targeted at a number of levels.
First, we have been using our influence in international forums to ensure active participation by other donors, including the international agencies, in responding to the crisis. In March I travelled to Washington to meet the President of the World Bank and to urge the bank to take a lead role in coordinating assistance. I also met the Managing Director of the IMF and stressed the importance of ensuring that the social costs of the crisis were not overlooked in pursuing economic reforms. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Trade and I have engaged in extensive consultations with affected governments—encouraging them to adopt appropriate policies and offering practical assistance.
It is critical that we maintain the momentum of an effective international response. For this reason, early next year I plan to convene a meeting of Ministers from major donor and recipient countries in the region
The meeting will focus on the long-term development challenges facing the region and what needs to be done to restore growth. I expect it will result in greater international coordination and a high level political commitment to address the economic and social impacts of the crisis.
Through the aid program, Australia has provided additional resources to the worst affected countries including Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. In Indonesia alone we have increased total aid flows by 25% compared to last year. Much of this has focussed on helping people cope 
 with the crisis by providing food aid and essential medicines.
The social and economic impacts of the crisis are not going to be short-lived. Our aid response must therefore also focus on helping regional countries return to sustained growth and limit the potential for recurrence of the crisis. Crucial to this is an increased emphasis on governance, which was identified as a key sectoral priority in Better Aid for a Better Future.  To this end, Australia is supporting partner countries to
.	 deal with systemic problems in the banking/finance sectors;
.	 strengthen corporate, legal, judicial and institutional frameworks; and
.	 improve public administration.
At the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the Prime Minister announced a major package of economic and financial management assistance for APEC developing economies affected by the crisis. The package, which exceeds $50 million over three years, targets priority areas identified in the Australian-commissioned APEC Economic Governance Capacity Building Survey.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The increased emphasis on governance is not limited to economic and financial management issues. It also includes a strong emphasis on human rights. Regional governments increasingly accept that getting their economic fundamentals correct is only part of the task. Australia's aid program is seeking to build on this recognition that sustainable development is strengthened where human rights are genuinely protected and exercised.
Sustainable development and human rights are inter-related in a myriad of ways. The whole aid program in one form or another contributes to human rights by addressing the needs of the world's disadvantaged.
I am aware that many of my fellow Parliamentarians share my interest in promoting and protecting human rights through Australia's aid program. Last June the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delivered its report Australia's regional dialogue on human rights . Having considered the Committee's views, today I would like to outline a clear framework for supporting human rights through the aid program. It will form part of the Government's full response to the Committee's report, which will be provided in due course.
The framework consists of six key principles.
.	 Human rights are a high priority for the Government. Civil and political rights are ranked equally with economic, social and cultural rights 

.	 The aid program will continue to undertake activities that directly address specific economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. A particular emphasis will be on the creation of durable institutional capacity to promote and protect human rights.
.	 The emphasis is on the practical and the attainable. AusAID, as the Government's aid agency, will pursue practical aid activities in support of human rights. These activities complement and build on high-level dialogue on human rights. Dialogue on human rights and representations about individual human rights cases will normally be carried out through diplomatic channels.
.	 The aid program will develop activities primarily as a result of consultations and cooperation with partner countries on human rights initiatives. Regional and multilateral activities will also be undertaken.
.	 Considerable care will continue to be applied to the use of aid sanctions associated with human rights concerns. The Government will consider such sanctions on a case-by-case basis. Aid conditionality based on human rights concerns would only be used in extreme circumstances since it can jeopardise the welfare of the poorest and it may be counterproductive.
.	 AusAID will continue to link closely with other arms of the Australian Government on governance and human rights issues. AusAID will also liaise with NGOs and human rights organisations in Australia.
Practical action based on these principles means that the aid program will continue to focus on its objective of assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. These principles will underpin our strong support for civil and political rights throughout our aid work. The aid program will seek to maximise the benefits for human rights in all development assistance activities. To support implementation of these principles, AusAID will develop practical guidance for program managers, contractors and recipient government counterparts.
The new framework I have outlined today is an elaboration of the basic principles set out last year in Better Aid for a Better Future.  It will take the aid program another step forward as a practical, vigorous and evolving expression of Australians' concerns that people everywhere get a fair go.
IMPLEMENTING BETTER AID FOR A BETTER FUTURE
I would also like to take this opportunity to report to the Parliament on other key achievements in implementing Better Aid for a Better Future. Better Aid for a Better Future  outlined the importance of focusing our assistance in regions and countries to better achieve lasting improvements in people's 
 lives. It called for the development of comprehensive strategies, developed in partnership with developing countries. It also required the aid program to be able to provide rapid relief in cases of emergencies and respond to changing pressures. This approach is no more apparent than in our program of assistance in Papua New Guinea. During the past twelve months we have responded very effectively to changing pressures: rehabilitation of agriculture after the 1997 drought, responding to the tsunami tragedy, and contributing to peace and reconstruction in Bougainville. In April this year I was privileged to be a witness to the peace signing ceremony in Bougainville, which was yet another step in the path to ending the 9-year civil war which has ravaged that Province
Reviewing the Treaty on Development Cooperation with Papua New Guinea has been a key issue over the past year. The review will set in place arrangements to ensure that Australian aid to PNG reaches those most in need and makes a real difference to living standards. It is expected that the review will be completed in the first half of 1999.
Another key achievement during 1998 has been the development, for the first time, of a Pacific wide comprehensive strategy with clear objectives and outcomes and incorporating country specific strategy statements. I will be launching this strategy later this month during my visit to the Pacific. Australia's assistance to the Pacific during 1998 has placed a strong emphasis on improving policy and management reform and on assisting countries deal with the impacts of the regional economic crisis.
Of course, adopting a more targeted approach to aid delivery is not limited to the funding provided in partnership with countries. Considerable work has been put into developing a new framework to ensure our aid dollars are only directed to those multilateral organisations which are effective and efficient in pursuing our priorities.
In Better Aid  for A Better Future , I announced that AusAID would develop a formal statement of principles outlining the role of Non Government Organisations (NGOs) in the aid program. This policy statement is currently being developed in consultation with the NGO community and I look forward to announcing it early next year. 1998 also marked a year where NGOs made a special contribution in areas such as civil society, humanitarian relief and small-scale development at the local level. Our partnership with them is based on solid foundations—the depth of community support for their work and the quality of the assistance they provide.
Better Aid  for a Better Future  outlined five key sectors of health, agriculture and rural development, education, governance and infrastructure. These sectors are taken into account in the development of country strategies. 

Specific policies for each sector have also either been or are being prepared:
.	 Australia's Gender and Development policy has been operational since March 1997,
.	 the Education and Training Policy has been in place since August 1996;
.	 a new Health policy has been approved and will be released shortly;
.	 a policy for Agricultural and Rural Development will follow a major review due to be completed by the end of November 1998 ; and
.	 work is well underway on a comprehensive Private Sector Development Strategy, which will include the plans for increasing support for small enterprises.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Another major initiative during 1998 has been the significant focus on involving the Australian community in Australia's aid program.
In Better Aid  for a Better Future  we outlined our intention to research public attitudes towards overseas aid. In July I published the results of that research. A comprehensive survey demonstrated that the vast majority—84 per cent—of Australians support overseas aid and that they are motivated by humanitarian concerns. This support was vividly demonstrated in the Australian community's overwhelming response to the tragic tsunami disaster in Papua New Guinea and more recently, the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.
In the past year we have placed a high priority on informing Australians about the aid program and involving them both in its delivery and development—to demonstrate that Australian taxpayer's dollars are spent effectively and to improve the quality of our aid efforts.
We have commenced a program of community outreach activities to inform Australians better about how their overseas aid program works. This has included a range of seminars hosted by my Parliamentary Secretary, Kathy Sullivan; displays at agricultural shows; enhancing AusAID's internet site and our publications.
In August, I introduced the Certificates of Appreciation Program to recognise the efforts of Australian overseas volunteers. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Parliamentary colleagues from both sides of the House for their participation. Australians from all walks of life have been working as volunteers to help people in other countries for many years. In addition to acknowledging the valuable contribution volunteers have made, the Certificates of Appreciation Program increases community knowledge of the role of volunteers in Australia's aid program. For me, meeting some of these Australians has been one of the highlights of the year. 

During the past year I have also launched the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program. The Program will place five hundred young Australians on development projects in the region over the next two years. I am pleased to say that the response to the program's first round of placements has been overwhelming, with around 700 young, highly skilled Australians applying. I look forward to farewelling many of these talented young Australians in February. The work done by these young people will be very valuable. I believe a great benefit will also come through the forging of lasting relationships with the region, thus helping to strengthen mutual understanding between Australia and our neighbours.
In May I appointed eleven distinguished Australians to the Aid Advisory Council. I have greatly appreciated the Council's contributions to the planning and delivery of Australia's aid program. The Council helps ensure the aid program reflects the values of the wider Australian community and plays an important role in opening the aid program up to new ideas and approaches to development.
There can be no doubt that 1998 was a challenging year full of many achievements. Ensuring our aid efforts remain as responsive and relevant as possible, making a difference to the lives of the poor, is a continuing demand. We must also build on Australian community support for our aid efforts. I firmly believe that even as a relatively small nation, we can continue to make an important contribution to our region and to development cooperation worldwide.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1

He will be here very shortly to deal with these matters and I am sure he will be able to indicate very clearly an answer to your question. This is something that in my former life as Senator Hill's parliamentary secretary I was very much aware of and I am aware that this bill does something that is desperately needed within Australia. It relates to environment protection measures and it is a bill that I know Senator Hill has consulted on very widely. I am aware that he has spoken at length with our colleagues around the states. He is very familiar with it all. Now that Senator Hill has arrived, perhaps you can reask the question along those lines.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—I do not want to embarrass the minister further than he has been by not being here when his bill was brought on. It seems to me the minister very often is missing when it gets to important environmental questions, missing not only in time but in content. I will have to accept the fact that he is late yet again. The question I did ask, for the benefit of the committee and the minister, was: is the intention to sign this legislation into law one which is tied to the much more comprehensive change of laws which the minister has mooted, by which he is devolving his responsibilities for the environment back to the states, going back to the pre-1972 situation effectively, or does he anticipate that if this legislation passes the Senate it will be brought into law before that much more comprehensive and damaging set of environmental laws that he intends to bring before the Senate when we resume sittings in February?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—I cannot think of any immediate 
 connection. This is a process that started, as I said earlier when those who were interested in the subject were in the chamber, Senator Brown, as an agreement that was reached in 1992 between the Commonwealth and the states and that required legislative implementation by each. Each of the states has passed law to do so and the Commonwealth is now seeking to meet its share of that responsibility.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—As the minister was not answering the question, let me give the connection. This legislation is of the lowest common denominator. It means that we bring into national application the standards on which all states and territories agree. So it is lowest common denominator legislation. That is the connection with the legislation that the minister has foreshadowed for next year on a much wider plane, where he wants to devolve responsibilities for the environment—responsibilities which have been built up by serial governments, particularly since the Whitlam government and the disastrous Lake Pedder affair in 1972—so that governments would have national responsibility for nationally important items of the environment. Here we have a minister who wants to shed those responsibilities back to governments, including maverick state governments which do not care a hoot about the environment, and to introduce not the precautionary principle to environmental prudence on behalf of this great nation of ours but the lowest common denominator principle. As such, the minister is continuing on his way of abandoning proper environmental responsibility and principle. But that is a matter for the public to judge. The simple question I ask is whether the minister is going to bring this into law if it passes the Senate before the much wider suite of laws which he wants the Senate to deal with in February are dealt with?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—There is obviously a misunderstanding by Senator Brown. This is designed to produce consistent national standards that obviously have great benefit and, within our federation, the best way to do that is through 
 a cooperative scheme. This is a cooperative arrangement—there is no doubt about that—but it does not necessarily lead to lowest common denominator outcomes; it leads to outcomes that are agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. If we look at those that we have debated at length and implemented, such as ambient air quality, I am quite confident I can say that it is not a lowest common denominator outcome. In relation to bringing it into law, we would want to do that as soon as possible. As I said, it does not have a link as such with our other environmental reform legislation which we intend to have debated in the new year.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-02,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendment No. 1:
(1)	 Clause 3, page 2 (lines 7 to 11), omit the clause, substitute:
3 Objects of Act
	 (1)	 The objects of this Act are:
		 (a)	 to make provision for the implementation of national environment protection measures in respect of certain activities carried on by or on behalf of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities; and
		 (b)	 to protect, restore and enhance the quality of the environment in Australia, having regard to the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development; and
		 (c)	 to ensure that the community has access to relevant and meaningful information about pollution; and
		 (d)	 to rationalise, simplify and strengthen the regulatory framework for environment protection; and
		 (e)	 to improve the efficiency of administration of environment protection laws.
	 (2)	 For the purposes of this Act, ecologically sustainable development requires the effective integration of economic and environmental considerations in decision-making processes, through the implementation of the following principles and programs:
		 (a)	 the precautionary principle, namely, that if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing meas 
 uring to prevent environmental degradation;
		 (b)	 inter-generational equity, namely, that the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations;
		 (c)	 conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity;
		 (d)	 improved valuation and pricing of environmental resources.
The Democrats propose this amendment which expands on the current objectives of the act, in line with the second reading speech of the government, to acknowledge that this is a significant milestone in the development of environment protection in Australia and represents a commitment of the Commonwealth and the states to work cooperatively, et cetera. The minister's second reading speech says:
It bears repeating that the objectives of national environment protection measures are to ensure that people, wherever they live in Australia, enjoy the benefit of equivalent protection from air, water, soil pollution and noise and secondly, to ensure that decisions by business are not distorted and markets are not fragmented by variations between jurisdictions in relation to the adoption or implementation of major environment protection measures.
The objectives that we have put forward in this amendment will tighten up the act and give it some focus in line with the very many pieces of Commonwealth and state legislation that now encompass the principles of environmentally sustainable development. We feel it is important to put these into the act both for reasons of continuity with so many other pieces of legislation and to make the act sensible in the context of what it says it is trying to do. I think that there is nothing extraordinary, nothing radical, about these objectives, and I commend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I indicate at this stage that the opposition cannot accept the totality of amendment No. 1. Our starting point is, as I mentioned in the earlier debate, that we introduced a bill in 1996, and the object of that bill was, as the government claims is the object of this bill, to ensure that state rules, regulations and 
 legislation apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities. We do not look to impose through this particular bill a broader spectrum of environmental responsibilities than currently exists under the state legislation that would apply either through the common law or the application of this legislation.
I have indicated to the Democrats that the opposition are not able to accept the whole of their amendment No.1 because of the broad nature and the new principles it applies in some respects. They are principles that were not primarily in the initial 1996 legislation. Although we do have problems with the totality of the Democrats' amendment No. 1, we can, if the Democrats were inclined to move their amendment in amended form, accept subclause (1), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the amendment. I put that to Senator Allison—she may be able to accommodate that request. Were she to proceed with amendment No. 1 as: `3 Objects of Act', subclause (1) `The objects of this Act are (a), (b) and (c)', then the Labor Party would be prepared to support such an amendment.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-02,"—The Democrats would be prepared to do that. I must say that it is a bit disappointing. These are, in fact, comparable to state legislation and, if you like, give the highest common denominator benchmarks to the bill. The ALP instituted the ESD process at the Rio summit, and I would have thought these were in line with those. Nonetheless, we are very keen to see the objects of the act expanded and I am happy to move subclause (1)(a), (b) and (c) and not move the rest of that amendment.
—Senator Allison, are you seeking leave to amend your amendment?
—Yes, Mr Temporary Chairman. I seek leave to amend Democrat amendment No. 1 by omitting subparagraphs (1) (d) and (e) and paragraph (2).
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—I do not think it is a matter of great consequence, but I do think you will end up with a product that is a touch misleading in 
 those two pieces of legislation that make up the whole package. The NEPC Bill, which was passed in 1994, establishes the council and the scheme and in fact sets out these objects within its schedule. That is where I would respectfully suggest they should be.
The bill we are debating now is simply to implement measures that are passed pursuant to the scheme, which has these objects inherently within the existing legislation. That is why the object of this act—being the bill that we are debating now—is to make provision for the implementation of national environment protection measures in respect of activities carried on by or on behalf of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities.
If instead you want to say that the object of this bill we are debating today is to make provision for the implementation of national environment protection measures in respect of certain acts, the point I am making is that in effect you have the scheme set up and you have these principles set up within the existing legislation. What you are simply doing now is looking for a tool whereby you can apply the measures that are determined by the ministerial council within Commonwealth law. Thus, what I am suggesting is that the objects you are seeking to include are better placed in the first act, which is exactly where they currently exist.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-02,"—Minister, that might be the case if this were just about implementation. But we realised when we looked at this bill very closely that it is in fact about exemptions for implementation. So that makes the necessity for the objects of the act to be expanded to go into things like `protecting, restoring and enhancing the quality of the environment in Australia,' having regard to the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development to ensure the community has access to relevant and meaningful information about pollution. These seem to me to be very important matters to have in the objects clause, given that this is not just about implementation. As I said, this is about exemptions and about the Commonwealth avoiding obligations.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—While the minister is getting information, I will just add to that. I question whether these aims, which include giving the act the object of protecting, restoring and enhancing the quality of environment in Australia, will extend to forests, for example. I ask that question because just today we have had news from Victoria that a court has ruled that logging under the Victorian state government was proceeding illegally in the Otways.
I was involved in a court case just a couple of months ago where it was determined that the state government had effectively been logging illegally in East Gippsland, in Goolengook. What we are talking about here is National Estate forests. We are talking about regions that the Commonwealth has agreed should have their high conservation values protected. But the state government has twice been caught out, not just by citizens but by the courts of law, for illegally breaching its obligation to protect the environmental values.
Is that what the minister is aiming to achieve: to give governments like the Kennett government in Victoria—which has now been found repeatedly to be an illegal logger of forests of high environmental value—the responsibility that the minister has not got himself? Of course, in Western Australia and Tasmania illegal logging of National Estate or high conservation value forests has been found to occur as well. I do not know about New South Wales, but I have no doubt—as this is broadcast day—that people will call me up to say the same about that state.
The question for the minister is: are the objects that we are now dealing with—that, because of Senator Allison's move, the Senate may be writing in here to `protect, restore and enhance the quality of environment in Australia'—really going to be a sham because of this government's derelict attitude to its obligations to the forests and, in particular, this minister's behaviour?
On the record—not just of those people who might have an opinion but of the courts of law—twice in a matter of months at least one state government has allowed illegal logging of the people's high conservation 
 value forests. How does the minister respond to that situation? What assurance can the minister possibly give that governments that can do that are going to do the right thing by the environment of the people of Australia?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—I appreciate the opportunity to reflect further upon the revised Democrats amendment. I would be prepared to accept it in the hope that we might move on. I do not see that there is any particular downside to it. I believe it is superfluous, but there is probably a lot of superfluous stuff in Commonwealth legislation. Senator Brown, no, the forests are not listed as one of the areas for NEPMs under section 14(1) of the previous act.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—Why are they not listed? The minister has been at the front of moves to have the states take control of the forests—which should be his responsibility—as an environmental amenity. He has given the country assurance that high conservation value forests and the wildlife that live in our wild forests will be protected. He is saying that through regional forest agreements in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia the Commonwealth is doing the right thing by giving the states control.
I am saying that he is utterly wrong. I am saying that we have now had the clearest example of where that is wrong. We have had, for example, the Kennett government breaking the law, its own law. It cannot uphold its own laws on protecting the forests. Why should we be giving approval to this minister to devolve more of the ability to determine the nation's standards to such governments? That is the question. Has the minister any answer in this committee to that reprehensible behaviour of the Kennett government and its logging authorities in Victoria? Why should we disregard that as a really important barometer of the direction in which he is taking this country as far as environmental standards are concerned?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—I guess because those who debated the bill of 1994 did not choose to include it. All 
 we are seeking to do today is to provide a mechanism to implement that previous legislation. I am reminded, however, that there is planned to be a review of the early legislation in 1999. Perhaps we should ensure that Senator Brown's views are taken into account on that occasion.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—Yes, put it off. The minister cannot think of anything better to do at the moment. Let me try this one: there is, Mr Temporary Chairman, as you will know, mounting evidence that the destruction of forests is one of the most potent forms of the production of greenhouse gases around the world. But this is particularly pronounced in Australia where studies by CSIRO and others have indicated that a quarter or more of the greenhouse gas production in this country is coming out of removal of native vegetation and forests. I ask the minister: what is there in this legislation which has the lowest common denominator factor built into it—any state standards will do—that will put a lid on this prodigious production of pollutants into the atmosphere from the destruction of forests?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—There is not anything in this bill. As I said, the 1994 bill sets out areas in which, through a cooperative scheme, the Commonwealth and the states are to determine national environment protection measures. The purpose of this legislation is to enable those measures to be enforced within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. As I said a moment or two ago, forests was not included as one of those measures.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—But I had moved from forests to air pollution. The production of greenhouse gases is pollution of the atmosphere. Of course, it has not only a pretty awesome potential destructive capacity for the living environment on this planet but also, potentially, a great destructive capacity economically. What I was asking the minister was this: does this legislation cater for air pollution of the global warming variety—the production of greenhouse gases? Does it standardise, for example, the allocation of greenhouse gas production potential to 
 the states and territories? Is there any means whereby the minister, through this legislation, can ensure that state by state, territory by territory, some lid is put on the production of global warming gases from this country, which is now under international agreement following his trip to Kyoto last year?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—There is no measure or proposed measure in relation to greenhouses gases. Certainly, one of the measures that was carried a little time ago was a national pollutant inventory. This will have the effect of bringing those provisions into force under the Commonwealth jurisdiction. The issue of meeting our Kyoto obligations and addressing the issue of greenhouse gas emissions is one that the government is seeking to address through other means.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—I ask the minister: what efforts are being made by the government to assess the production of greenhouse gases through the logging, harvesting, destruction of forests? I mean here the commercial activity of bringing down wild forests in Australia.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—Again, it does not relate to this bill because this bill is to provide a mechanism to bring into force within the Commonwealth measures that have been agreed under the 1994 bill. Certainly, forestry does lead to emissions. They were included within our inventory and they will be included within the targets that we will need to meet under the Kyoto protocol. So we are addressing that in a comprehensive way, looking at both sources and sinks. It will require considerable changes in practice to achieve that goal but, as I said, the government is seeking to implement that goal through other means.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—Can the minister tell the committee which bill is going to deal with greenhouse gases because the other legislation does not either? Is he going to have legislative ability to deal with Australia's international obligations on greenhouse gas production and is he going to have legislative ability to deal with those 
 states or territories that do not want to contribute, that want to ride on the back of those states and territories that do the right thing? Can he ensure that those businesses that do the right thing are not disadvantaged by businesses such as the coal industry and the logging industry that are prodigious greenhouse gas producers and have done precious little to contribute to the national and international obligation to cut down on the quantity of global warming gases coming out of this country?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—Again, it is not relevant to the bill before the chamber. The other bill to which Senator Brown refers does include greenhouse gases, as I recall, as a matter of national environmental significance. However, the approach of the government in dealing with this issue, as it applies between governments, has been to seek a cooperative response. The latest manifestation of that was in the national greenhouse statement that was put out last week, which is a cooperative scheme between governments which will be implemented by action plans in the months and years ahead.
In relation to particular industries, Senator Brown would be aware that in the Prime Minister's statement of November last year there were certain requirements upon industries. Preference has been to achieve those requirements through voluntary means, but in a number of instances we have said that if that is unsuccessful we will require them to be achieved through mandatory methods. All of that is yet to come in the years ahead as we fulfil the commitment that we made in Kyoto.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—It is germane to this piece of legislation because this is one of the opportunities we have to amend and legislate with regard to global warming gases. Can the minister tell the committee what form of mandatory reduction in global warming gases he has in mind. From the shape of that word, it will obviously require legislation to be considered in this place. It will therefore presumably help to make up the shortfall in this piece of legislation. Maybe the minister could indicate 
 to the committee what his schedule is for bringing in mandatory restrictions on the production of global warming gases, how they are going to be implemented and what sort of penalties he is looking at for infractors.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—It is quite imaginative to say that it is relevant to this bill, because it is not included in this bill. Having said that, the statement by the Prime Minister in November last year was a public statement. It reviewed a whole range of industry sectors and it indicated where we would require mandatory outcomes if they could not be achieved on a voluntary basis. Just to recall a few of those, one was in relation to building codes, where I think it is well accepted that Australia's energy standards could be significantly improved. Another one was in relation to the compulsory purchase of renewable energy, and there were a number of others. As I said, our preference in achieving the goal of Kyoto is through a cooperative scheme because we do not believe in lowest common denominators, and we think that through cooperation you can do better than a regulatory outcome. That is the way in which we are proceeding.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—I want to pursue this matter with the minister a little further because it is germane to this legislation. There is the opportunity to amend this legislation to cover global warming and the responsibilities of the states where the Commonwealth wants to shed responsibilities, as it is generally doing through this legislation. I will not delay the committee, but this is very vital information which the committee should have. Can the minister tell the committee what the process is by him or his government to quantify the amount of greenhouse gases coming out of the native forests of Australia as they are being logged?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-02,"—Again, Senator Brown says it is relevant because he might want to amend the bill to include it. But as I said before, this bill is all about implementing measures that are enacted pursuant to the 1994 piece of legisla 
 tion, which does not include what Senator Brown is talking about.
However, having said that, in a cooperative spirit, Senator Brown would also be aware that we have within our national inventory estimates of emissions from the forestry sector, as we have from other land use. There is a considerable degree of error at the moment. We are seeking to reduce that degree of error through continual scientific research and evaluation. We are doing that in a domestic sense and we are also doing it in an international sense in the form of major studies that have been conducted by the IPCC, which will report in about 18 months time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-02,"—I understand that the error which the minister is talking about has been, unfortunately, an error of way underestimating the amount of global warming gases coming out of forests that have been cut down, not only here but right around the world. That is an error that will weigh very much against our ability to meet our international obligations.

Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1998-12-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to point out to the Senate some information contained in the report of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy. Page 1 of the report says that there have been 24,408 new bankruptcies in 1997-98, which represents an increase of 11.8 per cent over the figure for the previous year. The figure for the previous year, 1996-97, was 26 per cent higher than the figure for 1995-96.
The report also says that the highest increase was in Victoria, with 19 per cent. The most significant aspect of the Inspector- 
 General's report to the parliament is this comment:
The significant rise in new bankruptcies over the past five years has therefore been in the non-business, or consumer, bankruptcy category.
If you go to page 11 of the report, you will see it has defined the categories of bankruptcies as:
(a) business related  bankruptcies—where an individual's bankruptcy is directly related to his or her proprietary interest in a business or company; and
(b) non-business related  bankruptcy—where the bankrupt's occupation and cause of bankruptcy is not related to any proprietary interest in a business or company.
The definitions of the circumstances that have caused a number of men and women in this country to go into bankruptcy in that non-business related area are listed as eight points. Significant ones are unemployment; excessive use of credit facilities, including pressure selling; losses on repossessions and high interest payments; domestic discord; absence of health insurance or extensive ill health; adverse litigation; liabilities incurred on guarantees; gambling; speculation; extravagance in living and `other causes'.
Tonight I want to briefly touch on how sad it is that over the last five years, as commented on by the Inspector-General, a number of families in this country have gone to the wall because of unemployment, because they have not been able to manage their incomes, or because of domestic discord. I know this from personal experience. I have seen some pretty unscrupulous people in the finance industry who have got people to commit themselves to levels of debt which they know full well the people are not capable of repaying. The people get themselves into a state where they see millions of dollars, stars and all the rest of it. But a lot of people know that in the end sometimes people are not in a position to be able to repay those debts and they go into bankruptcy.
If you look, further in the report, at the table of categories of people that go into bankruptcy, there are two large groups that stand out. The first is, unfortunately, `labourers'. They comprise a significant number of the people in this country that have 
 gone into insolvency as a result of overcommitments, domestic discord or, unfortunately, unemployment. The other group consists of people who work in the road transport industry, who comprise a significant group of men and women who have gone into bankruptcy. All I wish to say, in commenting on this report, is that I think it is sad that this has occurred in this area over the last five years, and obviously the biggest sector is unemployment.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Inspector-General in Bankruptcy</title>,Documents,30,1

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-12-02,"—Bank mergers have become an issue of late. Last week ANZ shares jumped on the expectation that the government would allow mergers between the big four banks. Where this forlorn hope began can only be known to the brokers who recommended buying shares. However, by the close of trade on Monday, ANZ shares had slipped back to their original 
 pre-surge price, no doubt inflicting losses on investors who believed the rumour.
Neither the government nor the parliament can be blamed for the actions of this overanxious market. Since the election, the matter of bank mergers has not been an issue on this government's agenda. To make it clear, the Treasurer said on Sunday, 29 November, that the Federal Government would rule out big bank mergers until it was convinced that competition had improved in that particular area, and we remain wholly unconvinced. The matter was further put to rest when the Prime Minister stated on Monday that the ban would stay because parts of the banking industry were still not as competitive as they could be. He said, `They'—the banks—`are a long way short of providing the sort of competition the Australian public requires.' That is where the matter stands for the coalition government. If mergers of the big four are allowed, the big four will soon become the big two, for it is conceded that if the mooted merger of the National and ANZ banks takes place then just as quickly Westpac and the Commonwealth will merge so as to remain competitive.
That would mean that the four banks presently controlling 66 per cent of the market would become two banks controlling 66 per cent of the market, and on the rise. The market domination by the two banks would inevitably lead to a reduction in competition, having an adverse effect on customers. Professor Alan Fels from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission stated:
. . . the more competition is reduced, the less incentive there is for the merged companies to pass on the benefits.
The case for mergers is not strong. That case is as follows. The big banks are relatively small by world standards. Australia's largest bank, the NAB, is ranked 38th. To enable a successful venture into the international arena, a merger between the NAB and, say, the ANZ would create a bank controlling one-third of the Australian market. A bank of this proportion would certainly have sufficient critical mass to rival the big banks of the United Kingdom and the United States. Don Argus, 
 the NAB managing director, said in the Financial Review  on 13 September 1996:
Australian companies had to acquire critical mass in domestic markets if they were to become big enough to compete internationally.
However, banks like the NAB are already operating successfully in the international market, without the so-called `domestic critical mass'. For example, the NAB has successful operations in America and Ireland.
The second reason major banks seek mergers is to achieve economies of scale, which would be a natural consequence of merging two like operations into one. What the banks consider as economy of scale others would consider market domination. That is not to say that, over the past decade, bank mergers have not been successful and necessary to stimulate competition within the marketplace. For example, in 1991 the Commonwealth Bank took over an ailing State Bank of Victoria. In 1995, the Challenge Bank was taken over by Westpac, and the Advance Bank acquired the Bank of South Australia, followed by a merger between St George Bank and the Advance Bank. The most recent merger has been between Westpac and the Bank of Melbourne. But each merger was scrutinised on its merits and marked against a set of rules and conditions, ensuring no loss of competition.
The ACCC takes the view that for a major bank and a regional bank to merge there must be an alternative strong regional bank operating within the state. It is true to say that in the past three years there has been an encouraging increase in competition between the big four banks. The home loan market is more competitive than ever before, with institutions such as Registered Australian Mortgage Securities—RAMS—and Aussie Home Loans undercutting home loan contracts of the big four banks and offering reduced fees and other incentives to customers to change their allegiances.
However, as the Treasurer pointed out, more can be done, particularly in the area of business loans. The big four still have a vice grip on business lending. New entrants into the market like AMP, who recently took out a banking licence, Citibank—a notable busi 
 ness lender—or credit unions, who have recently been given the power to issue cheques and take up banking like activities, will all have a big effect on the market share of business lending.
There is an argument that time needs to be given for these new entrants to establish themselves, and there must be more entrants before the market is fully competitive and ready for a merger of the big four. But I would like to take it a step further. While this is fair argument, it is not going to happen—at least not in the very foreseeable future. The Australian market is too small to attract or sustain entrants that will match the size of the big four.
I believe the issue of big four mergers should be off government and bank agendas. The reasons as stated are: that the big four will become the big two, therefore reducing competition in the market; new entrants and smaller banks will be knocked out by the new merged entities; small business and farm loans will become increasingly difficult to access; and further branch closures in rural and regional areas will occur.
There is also the question of the perception of the worst of bank culture being enhanced if the big four merge into two. We are only too aware of the adverse effects the past bank culture has had on the rural and regional areas of Australia. It has brought about a fear of what a superbank would do to rural communities. I therefore cannot conceive of any reason in the foreseeable future to support the merging of any of the big four banks.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Banking: Mergers</title>,Adjournment,31,1
