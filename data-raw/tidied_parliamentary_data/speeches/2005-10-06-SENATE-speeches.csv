Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is obviously an important matter and it has received some coverage in today’s newspapers. I think it is something that deserves more thorough examination and more appropriate comment by the Senate and that should be noted when it is tabled. The circumstances surrounding this case have been the subject of a lot of public debate and speculation and deservedly require a lot of investigation.
I am not someone who likes to pronounce sentence on individual public servants and demand that people be sacked or charged or whatever, but I do think that circumstances like this raise extraordinarily serious questions. The wider issue, of course, is not just this individual case but what things can be done and have been done to ensure, as much as is humanly possible, that it has not happened elsewhere and that it does not happen again. Those questions, I think, are still not fully answered. We do have a Senate committee inquiry of course at the moment which was established on my motion and is an attempt to look at the wider issues: whether we actually need to change the act or make other administrative changes to improve the administration of this whole area. I think in that respect there is more that still needs to be done.
This is an issue that should be examined, as much as possible, in a dispassionate way. We all have our policy and philosophical views on this area, but in many respects this goes to the heart of good public administration. Regardless of your overall broader policy view, that policy—any policy—must be administered properly, efficiently, fairly and with basic human decency. All of those things have fallen over here and we need to do a lot more to really ensure that any wrongdoing is properly identified and addressed, certainly, and also that whatever changes can be made are made to prevent this sort of thing from continuing to happen. We have talked a lot about culture change; that is good, but there needs to be a lot more than just talk. We need to look fairly thoroughly at the detail of it and that is something that the Democrats certainly will continue to do.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Tabling</title>,Documents,7,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I rise to also take note of the report. Obviously, as the report has just been tabled, I do not have it in front of me at this time. The government fortunately, or unfortunately, only provided one copy. That will obviously come up this afternoon or this evening and I will make a further contribution then. If not, I will seek leave at some later stage to do that, if the government permits.
There is a report on the Alvarez inquiry in the Australian today, which is interesting given the government has only just tabled the report now. So it appears that the government—it may have been the government—or others have already provided some of the information to the Australian, maybe to take some heat out of the issue. The article, by Elizabeth Colman, says:
Three middle-ranking immigration officials have been blamed for covering up the wrongful removal of Australian citizen Vivian Alvarez and could face the sack.
It goes on:
A damning report into the Immigration Department’s handling of the affair by Victoria’s former police commissioner Neil Comrie has cited three public servants …
I will not go any further, but the article then talks about, and blames, a culture in the immigration department that developed under former Minister Ruddock and has continued under Senator Amanda Vanstone. That seems to be the theme running through first the Palmer report and now the Comrie report.
Just separating those two for the moment, the Palmer report also damned the department for its culture, administration and organisation but stopped short of the ministers. That of course looked into the very sad case of Cornelia Rau and how this government and the immigration department treated her. The second report that came to light referred to the Vivian Alvarez matter. It is similarly damning and provides a terrible tale of an Australian citizen who had been treated shockingly by this government and was deported or ‘removed’, as the department prefers to say, to the Philippines. That particular case was referred by the acting minister at the time, Mr McGauran, to Mr Palmer and, effectively, Mr Comrie to report on. We have spoken a lot about that issue. We have also had an inquiry into that. That inquiry is still continuing. It has provided an interim report and there will be a follow-up now that the Comrie report has been tabled and we are able to digest its contents.
The report also seems to blame the culture within the immigration department. Mr Metcalfe has provided the new broom, so to speak, to sweep through the department. Of course, he has a big task ahead of him. We hope that it is not simply going to be a cosmetic change that he is going to wrought within the department because, in this instance, what we have really called for is a royal commission with the ability to sweep the minister aside as well. The department needs a complete clean-out to ensure that the problems that were encountered in the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez do not happen again. Of course, another 200 cases have been referred to the Comrie report which we have not been able to examine as yet. We need to ensure that the immigration department does not deport an Australian citizen and does not lock up an Australian resident for 10 months, as was the case with Cornelia Rau. We need to ensure that the department not only changes its culture but also changes the way it approaches these issues and the way it approaches its legislation. In fact, one wonders why there cannot be a complete review of the entire legislation while a commission is inquiring into it.
I will be corrected if I am wrong, but the Comrie report appears to begin to sheet home some of the blame to where it should lie—that is, with the ministers responsible for the department. Having sat on the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the Solon matter, having sat through the immigration inquiry, estimates and a range of hearings with the immigration department, it seems clear to me that that culture that has been reported is not from the bottom-up. It is not a culture that starts at low- or middle-ranking bureaucrats and spreads out and around; it has been identified by Mr Comrie as a culture that starts from the top. It starts from the attitude and the way that the department is being handled.
With regard to the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez, it seems clear that if the culture did start with Mr Ruddock and Senator Amanda Vanstone then it is their responsibility to acknowledge that and step aside. That is what they should do. They should recognise that they are part of the problem. It is not good enough for them to blame the middle-ranking bureaucrats and the undersecretary—they already sacked the executive—bring in a new Mr Metcalfe and say: ‘That’s all right. We’ve tied all that up. We can move on.’ It is simply not sustainable to do that. I think Mr Comrie has belled the cat in this instance. He has sheeted home where the blame should be—that is, at the ministers’ feet. That is where the blame with regard to this matter should rest.
If you go back over the circumstances of this, you see that it is not only about a department that has been inculcated with a culture that is black but it is also about mismanagement and incompetence by the ministers concerned. One of the significant issues that we came across during the inquiry into the Alvarez matter was the inability of the department to produce and search reasonable and timely records that would enable them to conclude, ‘This person is an Australian citizen who should not be deported or removed but who in fact needs help.’ In her case, it was a relatively short period of a couple of months between when they first became aware of Ms Solon and when they then removed her to the Philippines.
A number of questions kept coming up, such as: why did it not go further? Why were inquiries not made? Why did the Australian Federal Police or the missing persons bureau not become involved in these issues? Why did they not search their records, not only for the names that they had but more broadly? Why did they not talk more with DFAT? There is a whole list of unanswered questions in my mind about how this department should have been more responsible in ensuring that these things were not going to happen, could not happen and did not happen.
Even when the records about what they did were provided by the department to the committee, they showed that there was no coordinated way of dealing with these issues. There was no coordinated way of ensuring that there were proper checks and balances put in the system. Even in the case of Ms Solon, there was no final check and no examination of the file before they decided to remove her. The legislation says that, if under section 189 you determine that she is an unlawful non-citizen and you come to that conclusion, you have to remove her under the following provisions. But, even then, they do have a ministerial series of instructions which say that you should at least have a bit of a check before you remove someone.
It is interesting that they could not find that checklist. This is a department that handles a whole range of important matters and they could not find that checklist. I have asked the question: ‘Why couldn’t you find it? Would it demonstrate that perhaps you shouldn’t have removed it?’ I do not know. It is a question that we may never find the answer to. In this instance, I think this report is well overdue. The department should take cognisance of it, and the minister should give it close scrutiny, do the right thing and remove herself. Without Senator Vanstone gone, I am not convinced that the culture in this department will in fact change.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Tabling</title>,Documents,7,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-06,"—It is very difficult to talk to a report that we have not received, but that is the opportunity that we are given. All we have to go off is a report in one of today’s newspapers about what may or may not be in the report that the government has tabled—and we do not have a copy of that report. The newspaper report talks about three middle-ranking immigration officials being blamed for covering up the wrongful removal of Australian citizen Vivian Alvarez and notes that they could face the sack. The media report says that the officers could face dismissal, suspension or other disciplinary action under recommendations contained in the report, which was written with the office of the Ombudsman. The only idea we have of what is in the report—because we cannot access the report—is that blame is being sheeted home to three middle-ranking officials within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and that they will suffer consequences as a result of this.
I do not know if it is in the report, but where is the indication from the government about the responsibility that they will take? I do not know if this is an opportunity to choose three middle-ranking department of immigration officials and put the blame on them, leaving the government and the minister able to wash their hands and say, ‘It was those three middle-ranking officials in the department of immigration.’ That is not the way that this government should be taking responsibility for the deportation of an Australian citizen—and that is what we are talking about. We need the government and the minister to take responsibility for their actions which have resulted in this deportation.
As Senator Ludwig said, 200 other cases of wrongful deportation were also looked at in this inquiry. We do not have the information in front of us yet because we do not have the report about those circumstances. I now have a copy of the report. It is very hard to talk to something that you have just been given while you are talking to it. We do know the stories of other people’s experiences of deportation, the way it damages and ruins people’s lives. It creates major tragedies in people’s lives. We have not seen, to date, the minister or the government taking responsibility for the way in which they have damaged these people’s lives. That is what we need to see. We now have the opportunity to look through the report and the government responses. But all we have had so far in the media report is the blaming of three middle-ranking department of immigration officials. It is not good enough. It is a systemic failure from the department. The government and the minister need to take responsibility.
In a recent immigration inquiry, which we were involved in just last week, we were hearing about whether there has been any cultural change or shift in the department of immigration as a result of the recommendations from the Palmer inquiry. We heard numerous examples. People appeared before the committee and talked about cases from the last couple of weeks in which they have been involved and in which they have not seen any shift in the culture of the department. The changes that were put forward by the Palmer recommendations were described as putting more ambulances at the bottom of the cliff rather than building a fence at the top of the cliff. That, of course, relates to putting more psychiatric staff at Baxter detention centre to help. Psychiatrists who have worked in this detention centre say that it does not matter how many psychiatrists you put there, it is the detention environment itself that is toxic and creating the problem.
There have been announcements, which came out of the Palmer recommendations, that hockey fields will be built at Baxter detention centre. Building a hockey field does not change the circumstances for somebody in detention. Their greatest concern is the indefinite nature of their detention. This government went to the High Court to defend its right to indefinitely detain people in our immigration detention centres. It wants to be able to say, out of the Palmer recommendations, ‘But we’ll build them a hockey field.’ Detaining people indefinitely and building them a hockey field is not good enough. How is that going to change the circumstances and the mental health consequences of those people? This government went to the High Court to defend its right to indefinitely detain people in the community. That is what we have seen so far and that is what we heard from witnesses last week in the immigration inquiry public hearings. Those witnesses told us about the changes that they have seen as a result of the Palmer recommendations.
We now have the opportunity to look at the recommendations in the report on Vivian Alvarez. We shall wait and see what people in the community dealing with these cases say are the consequences of the actions that occur on the ground after these recommendations come into play. However, we will continue to operate, unless we see some significant change from the government, in an environment in which they take no responsibility. The government and the minister take no responsibility. We hear that three public servants are being blamed for the circumstances of Vivian Alvarez’s deportation. Where is the ministerial responsibility in that? It is absolutely absent. Where is Senator Vanstone and her responsibility for the operations of her department in that? It is a big blank. We do not know. We have heard nothing. She is not in here. We cannot hear from her. We wait to see the minister take responsibility for the actions of her department in the deportation of an Australian citizen. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Tabling</title>,Documents,7,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Export of Live-stock to Saudi Arabia) Order 2005 [F2005L01580], made under section 17 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997, be disallowed.
This motion seeks to disallow the instrument that recommenced the export of livestock to Saudi Arabia. Disallowances are always a blunt instrument. It is all or nothing—keep it all going as is or knock everything out—but it is the only instrument that the Senate has available to it. It is a rare occasion that the Senate has even this blunt instrument to use in the area of live exports. Despite it having been an area of such controversy to the Australian community for so many years, it is very rare that there is actually any direct action the parliament and the Senate can take in the form of making a decision to pass or not pass a particular motion or action of the government.
It was over 20 years ago now that a Senate committee report unanimously found that, if an assessment was made solely on animal welfare grounds, the live sheep trade should come to an end. Of course, there are grounds other than animal welfare, as the report acknowledged—there are social and economic grounds—and it was felt that, when they were taken into account, the trade should be continued for the time being. But certainly the fact is that, 20 years on, the trade has not only continued but has actually massively expanded. It has done this with the support of governments of both political persuasions.
The simple fact and the undeniable truth that was found by the Senate committee inquiry over 20 years ago has basically been put to one side. The extreme animal cruelty involved in the trade has been seen as unfortunate: it is something that we can try to mitigate a bit here and there, but it is just the way it is and we have to accept that because there are jobs and money at stake. That is the basic argument. There have been changes made over the course of those 20 years, usually in response to major disasters—and there has been a litany of disasters in the live export trade, particularly to Saudi Arabia, over those 20 years. After each one, there is an inquiry, there is a report, there are recommendations, there are changes and we are all assured that it will all be fine.
The Democrats’ view is that enough is enough. We have had more than 20 years to fix up these problems and to address the inherent cruelty in the trade, and that has not been able to be done satisfactorily. The most recent inquiry, the Keniry inquiry, after the Cormo Express debacle, is another example. There was an initial report that was based on narrow terms of reference that did not even go to the heart of many of the animal cruelty problems. It looked at only one part of things. Even that narrow report was only partly adopted. It was not fully examined.
The other thing we did not know 20 years ago is just how extreme the cruelty is. We can no longer use the excuse that we do not know. Footage has been taken and has been screened on Australian television programs, including 60 Minutes and others, showing the extraordinary, unbelievable cruelty that Australian animals exported to some of these places are routinely subjected to. We cannot pretend we do not know. We either accept it as it is and say that we are willing to be part of that degree of cruelty because of the economic gain, or we say that it is not satisfactory for Australia to be part of, supporting and indeed trying to expand incidents of that extreme cruelty.
Of course, the other thing that we now know much more clearly is that the live export trade in many respects, even when you look at the economic and social aspects, also costs Australia jobs. There has been widespread loss of Australian jobs in abattoirs and meat-processing facilities around the country—not all of it due to the live export trade, but some of it quite clearly due to it. In my own state of Queensland, the abattoir in Rockhampton simply was unable to operate because it was not able to source the animals because people were putting them on ships to send them off shore, still alive, because the producer got more money for it. It is a totally understandable economic response from the producer but it is clearly costing Australia jobs.
The facts are now clear that this not only involves extreme and undeniable cruelty to literally millions of animals but it also costs Australia jobs. The government likes to point to a report called the Hassall report, commissioned by the industry body LiveCorp, which said that the live export trade provides 9,000 jobs. Those jobs included people like farmers and transport drivers, who would be doing the same work if they were providing the animals to facilities in Australia rather than to facilities for export. The fact is, of course, that not only was the Hassall report commissioned by LiveCorp but it was done by a company that had a director who was the chairman of LiveCorp at the time.
There was a separate report that I believe needs to be given much more attention. That was a report commissioned by the Australian Meat Processor Corporation, undertaken by SG Heilbron Pty Ltd. Dr Selwyn Heilbron is a senior business economist and corporate consultant with specialist expertise in Australian and international agribusiness. He has served as a research consultant with the World Bank and a senior economist with the department of trade in Canberra. He is not, as far as I know, a bleeding-heart animal rights activist but a hard-nosed economist. His report suggested, among other things, that the live export trade could be costing Australia around $1½ billion in lost GDP and around 10,500 lost jobs. The primary factor driving the profitability of the live export trade is market distortions in favour of live animals. If it were not for these factors, the rising demand for meat in importing countries would have been met by exports of chilled and frozen meats.
It also made clear that the live animal export trade is not complementary to the chilled meat trade in most respects. There is a small amount of overlap but, in most respects, it directly competes for the same export market. It has been the government bias towards the live export trade that has allowed the live export sector to grow and expand at the cost of the chilled meat trade—costing Australia jobs and, of course, along the way involving those animals being subjected to an extreme and extraordinary degree of cruelty.
It is fairly fashionable amongst some senators in this place to be very dismissive about animal welfare issues and the people that advocate animal welfare. We have seen in recent times a ramping up of that rhetoric, whereby people who dare to even try to highlight these issues and present a point of view about them are publicly attacked and vilified by the government. We have seen the taxpayer-funded company Australian Wool Innovation deciding to take Australian activists to court under the Trade Practices Act solely for attempting to encourage Australians to choose for themselves to not be associated with a practice that they believe is cruel.
We have seen reports in the last few days that the RSPCA—again, hardly an extremist animal rights organisation—are at the top of the government’s hit list in regard to tax deductible status because they dared to run a campaign against live animal exports during the last election. That campaign, I might add, was not directed at voting against the government. The live export trade has been supported by both major parties for a long time, so, inasmuch as it was critical, it was critical of all parties that have been supporting the live export trade. It certainly did not advocate a vote for the Democrats, even though we have been campaigning against the trade for decades. It simply put out the facts and encouraged people to make their views known and to express their concerns. For the trouble of running a campaign against live animal exports, the RSPCA are told that their tax deductibility status is at risk. This is the state our country has come to: people who hold a strongly held and valid view based on ample evidence, evidence not terribly different from what a unanimous Senate committee itself reported on 20 years ago, are threatened.
We have government ministers calling some of these organisations ‘terrorists’. That might sound like farcical political rhetoric, but in these days, when we have talk of wide-ranging changes to the law to give massive powers to various government bodies and offices through so-called antiterrorism legislation, when you get labelled by government ministers as a terrorist, it is not much of a step to wonder whether some of these new laws will get used against you. In fact, it is no step at all—that is what is happening in the United States, where industry are responding to consumer campaigns by trying to bring people within the ambit of those sorts of laws. And that is happening here in Australia, with the taxpayer-funded wool body taking Australians to court over such campaigns. The evidence is that the degree of intimidation and extreme attacks from government and industry people against those who simply want to speak out has got worse in the last two decades.
Let it not be forgotten that this concerns a large section of the Australian community. The response that we continually get—that people who are concerned about these issues are wild-eyed extremists who should be discounted—is basically slandering hundreds of thousands of Australians. By far the largest petition tabled in this chamber in the last couple of years was on this very issue, with over 100,000 people signatories to the petition expressing concern about the live export trade. Are all of those people extremists? Should all of those people just be dismissed as ratbags and radicals?
During the period when the trade to Saudi Arabia was suspended there was a corresponding dramatic increase in exports to the Middle East, including to Saudi Arabia, of frozen carcasses and chilled and processed meat. For many years the lie has been peddled that we have to export these animals live because people there will not buy the product if it is killed here in Australia—that it has to be killed locally for some cultural, social, economic or religious reason. That is simply a lie, and the statistics and the facts show that. We have also had the lie that the animals have to be killed in a certain way for religious reasons and that they will not buy it from anywhere else—that is again completely false. There are Halal-accredited slaughterhouses in Australia and in other countries like New Zealand. There are certainly problems with those from time to time but, if we put even a 10th of the energy, effort and government assistance into developing Halal-accredited slaughterhouses in Australia, we could be dramatically expanding that value-adding market.
It is the same as any other area. Even though we are talking about living, breathing, sentient creatures, people want to treat this solely as an economic debate in which the suffering of those animals does not matter. Just look at the economics. This is a product, albeit living and breathing, that is exported in its rawest possible form, and the value adding is done overseas. Value adding can and is being done in Australia and, if it had the sort of support that the live export market had, it would be happening a lot more.
There is ample evidence that the trade involves extraordinary and extreme cruelty. There is enough suffering involved in the enormous distances that the animals have to be trucked from all around Australia to the various ports. Then there is the loading, offloading and reloading of them onto some of these ships that carry enormous numbers, tens of thousands, of animals on voyages, lasting a further number of weeks, to many parts of the globe. There is no doubt that there have been improvements in some of their conditions. But small, incremental improvements in the face of widespread suffering are simply not sufficient. On top of that, we simply cannot disassociate ourselves from the extraordinary and unbelievable cruelty that those animals are subjected to at the other end. There is now ample evidence of that. Going back to my comment before about this being an issue of concern to the public, I know that, when those issues have been raised on 60 Minutes and other programs, they have received some of the largest public responses of all of the topics that continually get screened on those sorts of shows.
This is not an issue that is going to make many people change their vote. Very few people would change their vote or the government on the basis of an issue like this, but that should not be interpreted as meaning that people do not care about the issue, that they do not feel strongly about it or that they do not believe something should be done about it. We now know far more than we did 20 years ago about the level of suffering involved. It is now clear that the industry, in many respects, costs Australian jobs and costs Australia money. Of course, if you closed the live export industry down tomorrow, it would cost some people money and jobs. That is why I have always advocated that we should be looking at a transition from one industry to the other. It is one of those cases where we are fortunate that there is a clear alternative, and if there was some genuine political will then we could make a transition from one to the other that would minimise the hardship and difficulty for some of the people affected. But it would also, it has to be said, increase economic opportunities for a whole range of other people. It would provide jobs in many areas where people are looking for them and where jobs have disappeared.
Whether you look at the economic argument or the animal welfare argument, the facts make it pretty clear that this trade is harming Australia’s economy and is making us complicit in an extraordinary degree of cruelty as well. Either way, when you look at both arguments together, there is no excuse for continuing down this path other than a lack of political will and vested interests who do not want change. I can understand why some people do not want change, but this is an area where change will, overall, bring net economic benefits to people and will also mean a significant reduction in extreme cruelty.
If people are going to support the trade continuing, then they simply have to say that they are willing to accept that degree of extreme cruelty. I do not, the Democrats do not, and we have campaigned for decades—from Don Chipp’s time—against this sort of extreme cruelty. The campaigns of many people around the country, and indeed around the world, against this trade have led to some incremental improvements in particular factors, but they clearly cannot address the cruelty that is intrinsic in this area.
This is an issue that has been the subject of international campaigns. I am not one of those people who suggest that Australia should immediately fall into line every time somebody overseas complains, but in a broader economic interest argument there are clearly going to be factors that are not going to go away. Simply responding to those people who express their concerns that highlight the facts with abuse, threats of legal action and labels like ‘terrorists’ will not help anybody. It will not help the industry to be put into a trench warfare situation. It does not help the taxpayer who has their money diverted towards court actions and those sorts of things when it could be spent on assisting people to address some of the legitimate issues that are raised.
This is the only mechanism that the Senate has to put these issues on the record and try to force this issue. As I said at the start of my speech, disallowances are blunt instruments, but they are the only instrument available. In the face of decades of a total lack of willingness by governments to acknowledge some of these basic facts, it is the least that can be done to put these issues on the record and try to hold governments to account for what they are doing. That effort will certainly continue and the facts surrounding this issue will continue to be put out in the public arena, regardless of the intimidation from those who seek to oppose it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2005-10-06,"—I am absolutely puzzled as to what Senator Bartlett is trying to do today. We are debating a disallowance motion of some regulations. Those regulations were, quite importantly, put in place to fundamentally improve the live sheep trade, but in Senator Bartlett’s speech today I did not hear him refer to those regulations. All I heard him talk about was shutting down the trade. So, on the one hand, he is trying to disallow regulations which, if they were to be passed, would return the industry to a worse state of animal welfare than we had before—arguably to the dark days of the Cormo Express that we all admit were inappropriate and very unfortunate—and, on the other hand, he is talking about shutting the entire trade down.
The regulations that Senator Bartlett is moving to disallow today are in place to facilitate improved travel for animals involved in live export. So why on earth would Senator Bartlett move to disallow regulations that do that? It is only when you carefully listen to his speech that you find he is opposed to the entire trade. He wants to shut the entire trade down, even though he knows—I am sure he knows because the rest of Australia knows—that Middle East customers do not want frozen carcasses. They want live meat. They want halal killing and they want fresh meat. So, for us to arrogantly say to these countries, ‘You will have it the way we give it to you, the way Senator Bartlett wants it given, or you won’t have it at all,’ is just an arrogant dismissal of a customer’s set of criteria and demands. It is quite curious, to say the least.
As a South Australian, I know the importance of the live export trade to rural and regional South Australia and the impact that any such ban as suggested by Senator Bartlett this morning would have on farmers and rural industries not only in South Australia but in other states as well. Following the 2004 Keniry report into Australia’s live export trade, a range of very important measures were put in place so that another incident like the Cormo Express could never happen again. As a result of the changes to the live sheep export industry after the release of the Keniry report, each ship carrying livestock to the Middle East now has a vet and stockmen on board to care for the sheep. Each sheep has food and water on demand and can lie down to rest. The air on board is changed twice as often as on a commercial airliner, and there are special pens for sick animals to receive special veterinary care. It sounds better than some of the airlines that we travel on!
In response to one of the recommendations of the Keniry review, legislation was introduced by the government last year to increase regulatory control of this industry. The competency of licence holders is now assessed directly by government rather than by the industry. Livestock export licence holders are required to meet the new standards to obtain approval to export each consignment of animals. As well as the new administrative arrangements, the Australian government has signed memorandums of understanding with the major importers of Australian livestock in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Those memorandums detail the conditions under which the livestock are to be exported and include the provision that in the event of a dispute concerning health, such as we had with the Cormo Express, animals will be unloaded into a quarantine station rather than being left on the vessel to drift around the Middle East.
I ask Senator Bartlett whether, in moving a disallowance of these regulations, he truly wants to go back to the pre-Keniry reform days when there were far higher mortality rates, far less scrutiny on the industry and far less support for the animals. Which part of the regulations does Senator Bartlett object to—or is it the case that he simply wants to shut the trade down? If he wants to shut the trade down, he should not move the disallowance of these regulations, because that would return us to the bad old days before Keniry; he should simply move to shut it down.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Senator Bartlett did concede that the disallowance is a blunt instrument in response to a regulatory measure by the government. He did not really address many of the specifics about the particular regulations, which are about reopening the trade with Saudi Arabia; indeed he indicated support for a much more drastic measure, which is to close down the live export industry. Whilst we are debating a motion to disallow a regulation that allows the export of livestock to Saudi Arabia, we actually heard Senator Bartlett propose a case for closing down live exports.
In relation to Senator Bartlett’s motion, Labor’s position is that we will not be supporting it. Our view is that this trade is important in terms of the sheep and cattle sectors, and we do not propose to support its closure. We have heard no reasons why the particular regulation, expressed in the terms of Senator Ferris, to require more humane practices is not an improvement, and we would be very loath to oppose it. It is fair to say that this trade is an important alternative market for sheep and cattle producers, but it is in need of significant reform to ensure that appropriate animal welfare standards are met by the industry. That is not to say that other trade in animal carcasses, frozen or otherwise, ought not be expanded—the government ought to be putting as much effort as possible into expanding those trades—but we are not of the view that this trade ought to be closed down.
We do have a strong view that the government should continue to work with this industry, with animal welfare agencies and with the countries that take our animals, to improve animal welfare practices. The reality is that Labor was a driver of reform in this industry. It was the Labor Party and this Senate that forced a reluctant government to address key problems with the live export sector. Prior to the last election, I released a detailed policy that went to the key areas of this industry that required reform. The administration of this important industry was nothing short of a disaster, and who could forget the Cormo Express fiasco?
As senators would recall, this government received a number of independent reports on the need to reform animal welfare practices in the live export sector between 2000 and 2002, but it did nothing. The former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, failed to act to reform this sector, despite a number of reports calling on him to do so. The Howard government had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to develop and implement an appropriate regulatory regime to enforce animal welfare standards for the live export sector. Labor continues to support the industry, but that support is only on the basis of ongoing significant reform to lift animal welfare standards to an acceptable level and that the industry is accountable for the manner in which it runs its business. Those reforms and that accountability are key to our continued support.
We will not be supporting this motion. We do not believe it is appropriate at this time to support a closure of the sector, which is the real intent of the motion. We do support the improvement of animal welfare standards in the sector. We do not believe that Saudi Arabia should be excluded from the trade if there are appropriate measures in place. These regulations make it clear that the government now has to accept responsibility for the maintenance of those standards, and on that basis we will support them. If those standards deteriorate, it will be the responsibility of this government, and we will be making sure the government is held to account.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2005-10-06,"—I too am amazed at Senator Bartlett’s move to disallow these regulations. These regulations have certainly improved conditions under which livestock are transported, and Senator Ferris has described that. As a Western Australian farmer I am very annoyed at the rhetoric levelled at those involved in the live export trade. The live export trade is crucial to farmers, pastoralists and livestock transport operators who live and work in rural and remote areas of Western Australia.
Western Australian producers supply approximately 80 per cent of Australia’s total live exports. In 2004 Western Australia provided 43.3 per cent of Australian live cattle exports, which amounted to 600,000 head. Most of these cattle are produced in the north-west, and without the live export market many pastoralists would have to leave their properties. Eighty-three per cent of Australian sheep exports, which amounts to 2.7 million sheep, are produced in the mid-west, the goldfields, the Great Southern wheat belt and the south-eastern areas of Western Australia. Most of these sheep leave from the port of Fremantle and spend two weeks on feedlots before they are loaded to enable them to get used to the specially produced pellets which they will be fed on their 12-day trip to the Middle Eastern markets and to Saudi Arabia. Sixty-one per cent of Australia’s goat exports, which amounts to 23,000 head, come from the pastoral rangeland area of Western Australia. With the downturn in the wool industry and the loss of sheep to wild dogs, a number of pastoralists have been able to remain on their properties due to the export trade available for feral goats.
Last week, in the Western Australian parliament, the Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, the Hon. Kim Chance, was asked the following question:
Would the minister and the Labor Government be prepared to publicly support the shipping of live exports from Western Australia on a continuous basis that would allow confidence in investment in this industry both here and overseas?
His reply:
Yes … The government supports the humane trade of animals within, or from, Western Australia and notes that the live export industry provides substantial economic and employment benefits, particularly in rural areas. The government recognises the importance of the live export trade to livestock producers and others involved in the industry and notes the lack of capacity in existing abattoirs to process all the livestock currently exported from Western Australia. In terms of continuity of live exports, the government recognises that the trade is subject to the pressures of worldwide supply and demand, and the decisions of importing countries, which may vary from time to time. The government also recognises that animals are exported from Australia under the provisions and legislation of the Australian government. The Australian government is negotiating with trading partners with regard to security of access of livestock shipments. The Australian government has also recently introduced the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock as a further component in ensuring that livestock exports meet trade and community expectations in relation to animal health and welfare.
It is very satisfying to me that the Western Australian government is prepared to stand up and be counted on such an important issue for rural and remote producers and transport operators. Indeed, it is very interesting to note that at this point in time Western Australian abattoirs do not have the capacity to process the sheep that are produced in Western Australia should the live export trade be disrupted or ceased.
Recently I had the pleasure of attending a conference hosted by the Great Southern Area Consultative Committee, which was a great success but served to highlight the difficulties of running a business in a rural area where there are not enough skilled people around. One abattoir operator in the area spoke of 100 current vacancies at their operation in the Great Southern. One hundred is a staggering number of vacancies for any business, let alone one involved in the food-processing industry, where speed and output are the basis of a profitable operation. So there is no way in the world the meat-processing industry in Western Australia could cope if live exports were stopped.
I know that there are some people in this country, and some in this chamber—we have heard that today—who deplore live exports, but let me tell you that the industry has made huge improvements in recent years. Legislation introduced last year has increased government regulatory control of the industry, as recommended by the Keniry review. Senator Ferris has described that. In addition to the new administrative arrangements, which improve sourcing, selection and preparation practices, the government has signed memorandums of understanding with the major importers of Australian livestock in the Middle East, including Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Jordan and, of course, Saudi Arabia, which is the country these regulations are about. These MOUs detail the conditions under which livestock are exported and include the provision that, in the event of a dispute concerning health, the animals will be unloaded into a quarantine station rather than left on the vessel.
As I mentioned earlier, there are some in our community and elsewhere, and even some in this chamber, who do not support the live sheep trade and may even want to see it banned. We have heard that today. The United States pressure group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, PETA, is one organisation that would like to see the trade banned altogether. As a farmer, I find this very difficult. We look after our sheep, as do any other people who export live sheep. As far as we are concerned, the criticism that is levelled at us is just not acceptable. Our transport operators have quality assurance systems they have to comply with. I just think it is unfair. We do our best. We are improving all the time and we do look after our animals and ensure that when they arrive at their destination the people receiving them are getting a quality product.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-10-06,"—The live exportation of any animal for the purposes of human consumption is cruel and unnecessary. While I appreciate that this order looks at addressing the conditions under which live animal export is conducted, I stand in support of Senator Bartlett’s motion to disallow it, as I believe that, no matter what conditions or requirements are put around it, the exporting of live animals should not take place under any conditions, least of all under a set of regulations that can be applied at the discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. While live sheep export plays a significant role at the moment in both pastoral and farming activities—and as an agricultural person from Western Australia I understand that role—you cannot say that pastoral or farming activity is truly sustainable on the basis of triple bottom line if it is based on cruelty to animals. That is not ethical and it is not sustainable, to my mind.
A lot of animals die unnecessarily on every live sheep export that leaves our shores—that is undeniable. In addition to these deaths, many animals suffer illness or injury but survive—for example, sheep are susceptible to eye irritations and infections due to dusty conditions on board and many suffer eye problems that can cause blindness even during the two weeks of the trip on board the ship. Once Australian animals arrive in the importing countries they are entirely subject to the customs and practices of that country. None of the countries to which Australia sends our sheep for slaughter have equivalent animal welfare protection standards and the vast majority, particularly in the Middle East, have no such laws or they are inadequate or they do not enforce their standards. Slaughter methods that animals endure in the majority of importing countries would be illegal in Australia.
Since Australia suspended trade to Saudi Arabia as a result of the Cormo Express rejection, Saudi live animal requirements have been sourced from neighbouring North African countries—local sheep used to local conditions. During the previous ban on live sheep and cattle from Australia to Saudi Arabia, there was a threefold increase in exports of chilled and frozen mutton and lamb to that market—clear evidence that customers in the Middle East will accept meat from animals killed in Australia. Why then do we need to export live animals? If Australia banned the live export of animals it would bring to the fore Australia’s valued international disease-free meat status, which adds immense potential to further market growth, and would extend our current exports of chilled meat to this region.
Importantly, an Australian ban on live export on welfare grounds would provide a powerful ethical precedent that other countries would have difficulty ignoring. Australian and major international welfare groups could continue to highlight the unacceptable nature of long distance transportation which, strengthened by an Australian ethical stand, would influence other countries. The OIE, effectively the World Animal Health Organisation, has made long distance sea transportation of animals one of its four priorities and has commenced the task of developing an international standard which will in due course have an effect on standards used by any country that seeks to undertake this ill-advised and unacceptable activity.
It is a fallacy, I believe, to think that there is a lack of refrigeration or refrigerated trucks in many of the Middle Eastern countries we export to. These countries do distribute chilled or frozen meat. Many customers already buy their meat from supermarkets similar in size to those found in Australia. Indeed, at least 70 per cent of Australian sheep sent live to the Middle East already enter the wholesale market chain, being killed and then distributed chilled to butchers for sale. The current major importer of live Australian sheep into the Middle East markets on its web site frozen microwavable meals and a wide variety of processed products from Australian sheep.
We need to deal with the issue of cultural requirements. Australia has certified halal slaughterhouses with the slaughter of each animal overseen by Muslim officials who are licensed by importing countries. The animals are slaughtered here and then the carcasses are exported chilled or frozen. In Australia, Islamic leaders have approved the pre-stunning of sheep prior to the slitting of throats because electrical stunning is reversible. The animal is not injured, and therefore the practice is consistent with Islamic requirements. During the recent investigation by Animals Australia and Compassion in World Farming, it was found that Australian sheep being killed in the main Kuwaiti abattoir were not being killed according to halal requirements. Similar inconsistencies have been reported by independent observers in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries in recent years.
There is a claim that about 9,000 people are employed in the live sheep export industry; however, independent observers have suggested that a lot of these people are already employed in the industry as sheep farmers, stock hands, stock transport drivers, shearers et cetera. While it is true that there are people employed additionally in this industry, we put to you that more people would be employed if we had not had a series of regional abattoirs close down as a direct result of the live sheep export trade.
A major economic report researched and written in the year 2000 on the impacts of the live export trade by respected agricultural economists Dr Heilbron and Terry Larkin provided a very different perspective. The Heilbron report found that the live sheep export industry directly competes in the Middle East market with Australian chilled or frozen sheep meat industry products. The report also concludes that, if the sheep and cattle currently exported were instead processed in Australia, a further approximately $1.5 billion would be added to Australia’s gross domestic product, there would be around $250 million more in household income and around 10,500 full-time jobs would be created.
There are also major concerns that the disaster riddled live sheep industry has the ability to negatively impact on the reputation of Australia’s broader and more valuable rural exports—a fact that has been recognised by many members of the farming lobby and by the recent Keniry report, which we understand was paramount in New Zealand’s decision to severely restrict its live export trade.
The Australian Meat Industry Employees Union has opposed the live sheep trade for many years due to the closure of abattoirs throughout regional Australia. The union claims that 70 abattoir closures and the loss of up to 20,000 jobs are directly attributable to the live export trade. The closure of abattoirs has occurred due to inadequate supplies of sheep and cattle, competition for animals with the live export industry buyers and thus higher prices, which make local slaughter uncompetitive. It is a shame that it is claimed that there are now not enough employees or local abattoirs to process sheep with abattoirs closing due to the live sheep export business. Local abattoir closures do not only affect individual abattoir workers. The loss of employment created by the closure of a major industry, with the resultant departure of families forced to leave to seek employment elsewhere, affects the viability of all local businesses in small rural and regional towns.
Importantly, as the Heilbron report and a 2004 West Australian government task force report concludes, live export competes directly with Australia’s meat export trade into the same markets. The animals could be killed and processed here under strict Australian regulations prior to export. Historically, the live export trade has been fraught with disasters; the Cormo Express disaster was just one in a long series of disasters. It provides farmers with uncertainty, not security, and has the potential to impact negatively on Australia’s international reputation and rural export industries.

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—


(Senator Forshaw)—Order! The debate has been conducted without interruption so far.

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—

—Order, Senator Campbell!
—Clearly, far greater long-term security for both Australian farmers and Australian workers in meat processing industries in Australia could be created through vigorous marketing of Australian chilled disease-free meat to importing countries. While Australia offers live animals, which provides to importing countries the added incentive of job creation and value-added products through local killing and processing of animals, the full potential of Australia’s chilled carcass trade will never be explored or realised. Even the adoption of the recent recommendations of the Keniry review has not led to substantial changes for Australian animals during and after live export. The Keniry review terms of reference only related to the preparation, selection, loading and shipboard phase of the live export process. While the report has made a number of very good recommendations, the inherent nature of transportation stress, congregations of large numbers of animals and transportation to another hemisphere, particularly for all sheep, with the inherent and persistent dangers of the sea, implementation of the—
—Can we have a bit of vigorous debate in this chamber?
—Order, Senator Campbell! Would you refrain from interjecting. The debate, as I said, has been conducted appropriately and in accordance with the standing orders so far. All speakers, including government senators, have been heard in silence. You should give the same courtesy to other senators in this chamber.
—It is not in accordance with standing orders.
—Senator Campbell, would you stop interjecting.
—Implementation of the report recommendations cannot substantially reduce nor eliminate the current unacceptable suffering and mortalities that occur. Significantly, the Keniry review had no brief nor provided any recommendations in relation to the treatment of our animals in importing countries.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. You just said that this debate is being conducted in accordance with the standing orders. Standing order 187, headed ‘Speeches not to be read’, at page 92 of the standing orders says quite clearly:
A senator shall not read a speech.
This senator is reading a speech. That is against standing orders.
—On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: the minister himself frequently reads speeches in this place.
—I do not.
—You do.
—I do not.
—Order! Address your remarks through the chair, Senator Brown.
—The last time I read a speech was in May 1990.
—Order, Senator Campbell! You were just heard in silence when you raised a point of order. Have the decency to give other senators the same courtesy. Senator Brown, would you direct your comments on the point of order to the chair.
—As you will recognise, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is no point of order.
—I am aware of the contents of the standing order. I am also aware that senators do regularly refer to copious notes when making their speeches. There is no point of order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order—
—I have just ruled on the point of order. There is no point of order.
—There is a difference between reading copious notes and reading a speech.
—I have just ruled on the point of order. Resume your seat.
—I have almost finished, in any case.
—The last time I read a speech was in May 1990. Never let the truth get in the way of anything.
—Order, Senator Campbell! I have called you to order on a number of occasions. I would ask you to at least have some respect for the chair and for the chamber and to allow Senator Siewert to complete her speech in silence.
—In conclusion, while I acknowledge that the regulations may make conditions slightly better for the sheep that are being transported, we do not believe that we should be supporting the live sheep export trade or any live export of animals. We should be looking to how we can better value-add and support our farmers in this country through the processing of these animals in this country, which will support farmers and regional Australia in the long term much better.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2005-10-06,"—As a New South Wales farmer, I find it absolutely incredible that the Democrats and the Greens have such a naive and simplistic view of this whole issue. I cannot agree more with my colleagues who spoke previously, Senator Ferris and Senator Adams. If Senator Bartlett is so concerned about this industry and so concerned about this issue, why would he be moving to disallow an order that is there to improve the industry? It makes no sense and I completely agree with my colleagues’ comments earlier.
The live export trade earns around $750 million a year. We supply cattle, sheep and goats to some 30 destinations throughout the world, predominantly in the Middle East and South-East Asian countries. The live export trade increases competition and provides a viable alternative market for our cattle, sheep and goat industries that could not be serviced otherwise. Certainly as a farmer I am very aware of this, as are many thousands of farmers across this nation. Those who seek to shut down this industry, such as the Democrats and Greens in this place, refuse to work proactively to improve the industry in the national interest. I note Senator Bartlett said in this place on 20 June this year that the live export industry is:
... an industry I believe should never have got off the ground.
He said:
The live export trade has never been appropriately managed, monitored or enforced, and now grows worse with every passing day.
All I can say, Senator Bartlett, is that the facts say it very differently. Since 2000, mortality rates throughout the industry have significantly improved. Across the board the mortality rate for cattle, sheep and goats has at least halved. I think perhaps these particular facts might be of interest. For cattle voyages of less than 10 days duration, the number of shipments with reportable mortalities has dropped from 12 in 2000 to three in 2004. This year, I am advised, there have no reported incidents to date—hardly ‘now grows worse with every passing day’. For cattle voyages of 10 days duration or more, there were just nine voyages with reportable mortalities in 2000. This year, I am advised there have been no reported incidents to date. Again, a situation that is hardly growing worse with every passing day. I am advised also that sheep voyages with reportable mortalities have fallen from eight in 2002 to none last year. The average mortality for goats has also halved in recent years.
The Australian live export industry operates within a regime of strict standards and conducts itself in a manner that provides the least impact on the livestock. Last year, the government increased live export regulatory control, as those sitting on the other side of the chamber would know. New Australian standards were introduced on 1 December 2004. Competency of licence holders is now assessed directly by government. Export licence holders are required to meet the new standards to obtain approval to export each consignment of livestock. This government has also signed memorandums of understanding, MOUs, with the major Middle East importers of Australian livestock: Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. These MOUs detail the conditions under which livestock is exported. They include a provision that, in the event of a dispute concerning health, the animals will be unloaded into a quarantine station within 36 hours rather than left on the vessel. We all want to see improvement in this industry, and we are seeing it.
Despite the views of some in this place, this government maintains its commitment to supporting this vital industry. This support is balanced by ensuring that the live export industry is held to high standards of animal welfare. This government is committed to working with the live export industry to continue to improve practices and reduce the mortality rate on livestock voyages.
Senator Bartlett said earlier that it was costing Australian jobs. I beg to differ. The Australian live export industry provides an estimated 9,000 jobs in rural and regional Australia—rural and regional communities like the one I come from where jobs are so very important. Supporting those jobs is what we do. According to LiveCorp and Meat and Livestock Australia, for every job generated in the live export chain another 1½ jobs are created—jobs for ancillary suppliers and services such as livestock agents, transport operators, exporters, stevedores and shipping companies. Live export also benefits feedlot operators, fodder and chemicals suppliers, veterinarians, saleyards, stockmen, port authorities, helicopter mustering services and the finance and insurance sectors. These are all the people who live out in the regions of this country of ours.
Senator Bartlett might say there is no need for live export, but I can certainly remind the senator that demand certainly exists in the global marketplace for livestock. It is fanciful for him to say that, if Australia stopped its live export trade, it would be taken up by Australian export meats. The demand for live animals is quite different from the demand for meat. If we stop live exports, our supply would most certainly be replaced by other countries in the region who have minimal desire or ability to effect animal handling changes. I ask Senator Bartlett this: would he prefer to see live exports supplied by another country which may not operate on the same strict basis as Australia? Would he like to see 9,000 jobs permanently lost from the Australian work force? How would he suggest that we make up the almost $750 million shortfall to the Australian economy in lost export earnings? We have MOUs with our major Middle East importers of Australian livestock, we have improved animal welfare and we have improvements in this government’s legislative requirements to ensure better operation of the industry—all contributing to improving this industry, which is so vital to farmers and so vital to this nation as a whole.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—In conclusion, I do need to correct the record, unfortunately, of a lot of false statements that were made by a range of government speakers in regard to this issue. It is symptomatic of the problem with this debate. There is simply not an interest in listening to the arguments that are put forward. There is not an interest in actually acknowledging the facts. All you get are the same distortions and falsehoods, repeated time after time again. The simple fact is that there is an alternative market. We heard the statements made by a number of speakers that if the live animal trade was phased out, it would not be replaced by processed meat and frozen meat products. That is simply not true. We saw that just in the short period of time when the trade to Saudi Arabia was suspended: the exports from Australia in frozen meat and in chilled carcasses increased dramatically. The statement that we heard from Senator Ferris that these countries will not buy frozen meat is simply wrong. It was probably always wrong and it is certainly wrong now.
All we get are these puerile insults: ‘City slickers. They wouldn’t know. They don’t care about the farmers.’ If you want to turn this into an issue that generates a divide between city people and country people, then I do not think that is in the interests of farmers or country people. It is a simple fact—and I referred to this in my initial comments, which were clearly not listened to—that there is a large number of jobs that have been lost in Australia as a result of the live export trade. In my comments, I said that of course there are jobs that are dependent on in it but there are jobs that have been lost from it as well. You cannot simply talk about one part and then pretend the consequences do not exist on the other side. Why do some jobs in rural Australia matter but not other jobs in rural Australia? A bit of consistency would go a long way in trying to actually get a rational debate around this issue.
I remind the Senate of the report on this matter. It is not me making all these comments and these claims, as Senator Nash suggested. It is people like Dr Heilbron and Mr Larkin—agricultural economists. They are the ones who are saying that the live export trade will be costing about $1½ billion in lost GDP, around $270 million in extra household income and around 10½ thousand lost jobs—and the vast majority of those 10½ thousand lost jobs would be in rural communities. So don’t come in here and say, ‘You don’t care about farmers’ jobs and we are the only ones that care.’ The facts are there.
The suggestion from Senator Ferris is that there is this secret and I actually want to close down the trade. Of course I am opposed to the trade. The Democrats have been opposed to the trade for decades. I have also argued many times that it is quite feasible and would be more responsible, rather than to continue this trench warfare, to provide the same sort of encouragement to the alternative trades that the government currently provides to the live trade. You would then be able to get the sort of transition without some of the hardships that go along the way with any change. Some of those things may be forced on rural communities in any case.
Frankly, to continue to turn a blind eye to the economic opportunities in the alternative trade and just stubbornly insist on the most basic non-value-added approach, of live export, is actually leaving rural communities more exposed because markets disappear from time to time. We are seeing with the live cattle trade, at the moment, significant fluctuations in that market. We had a report just last week, on 28 September—I think it was on the ABC—of cattle being trucked more than 3,000 kilometres from the Kimberley region that Senator Adams was talking about, all the way across to Roma in my home state of Queensland—and Roma is not that far from the coast. And they were trucked all that distance because the owners were getting a better price in the saleyards there than they were for the live trade, for a range of reasons including fuel prices and that sort of stuff. There are a range of other factors that can come into play here. But that is in a situation where we actually have market distortions in favour of the live trade—market distortions, and active government discrimination—
—You know nothing about the market economy.
—that act against the opportunities there—
—Do you know why the Canning Stock Route was built?

(Senator Forshaw)—Order!
—I realise that it is probably a waste of time, in terms of some of the senators in the chamber, to actually try to put the facts on the table, because all they give is abuse—
—People have moved cattle around Australia since settlement.

Senator Lightfoot interjecting—

—Order! Would senators on my right please cease interjecting and allow Senator Bartlett to—
—I’ll send you some Banjo Patterson.
—Senator Campbell, would you stop, firstly, interjecting and, secondly, talking through—

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Order, all senators. Has everybody finished?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I think interjecting on the speaker is one thing, but continually interjecting on the chair is extremely disorderly.
—I was about to make that point, Senator Bartlett, before I was further interrupted—by somebody on my left, as well! Proceed, Senator Bartlett.
—Let us just go to the basics of this regulation we are debating here today. The suggestion that this regulation actually enables nicer travel conditions—and that, if it were disallowed, we would go back to the bad travel conditions—is simply not true. A range of regulations, on which I have not touched, have been put in place that address travel conditions and the like—minor improvements here and there. But this regulation enables trade to be reopened to Saudi Arabia and, even if the travel conditions are slightly better for the animals, they will still endure those conditions if the trade is reopened and, I might say, the conditions and torture that they get at the other end.

Senator Ferris interjecting—

—We have had comments, and we had another interjection just then, about it being first-class travel—Senator Ferris said, I realise somewhat in jest, that these are better than the conditions in which some of us travel in planes. Apart from the fact that these are voyages lasting more than a week rather than a few hours, the conditions on the ships can be imagined, with animals in numbers that, I might say, go beyond 100,000 in some cases. To say, ‘It is a wonderful thing; the sheep can now lie down to rest’—although I guess it is better if they can do that than if they can’t—or to suggest that somehow or other this is the lap of luxury, is just farcical. And, to use the analogy of air travel, I have not noticed one per cent of people on air travel around the country dying along the way, which is what happens to the sheep as a routine matter on these voyages.
Senator Nash was talking about a drop in ‘no reportable mortalities’. What that means is that, unless a certain number die, they do not even bother talking about it, and it is only once they get to a certain percentage that they become ‘reportable mortalities’. These are the sorts of nice phrases that are used to make it sound like everything is okay. But the fact is that there are still significant mortalities. The numbers have dropped; I agree with that. And, obviously, that is welcome. But that is one part. And the other aspect that people can no longer ignore is what happens to these animals at the other end.
—They get eaten.
—Well, they do get eaten; you are right. That is very insightful, Senator; but they can also get eaten if they are slaughtered here, without having to go through all that suffering. And, as part of that process, they are subjected to extraordinary cruelty in offloading and in being slaughtered in those countries, and we cannot say that that has nothing to do with us.
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Bartlett, direct your remarks through the chair please.
—I am not sure I would say that that is something we can totally wash our hands of and say that it is the responsibility of a higher power. I think it is something that we do have to acknowledge we play a part in. That footage has been screened on Australian television. Now people know what happens. I understand the sensitivity that farmers have with this: they feel that they are always been criticised as being cruel. I am certainly not saying, as Senator Adams might be inferring, that farmers mistreat their animals but, once they leave the farm, those animals sure as hell go through a lot. People can decide that they do not care about that and that they just want that short-term economic opportunity. That is fine. But they should at least acknowledge that that happens rather than continue to pretend that it does not. The refusal to even acknowledge that it happens is part of why people continue to get so—
Government senators interjecting—
—Well, if you think that the sorts of conditions that have been screened regularly on Australian television as to what happens to those animals are satisfactory then you should say so. And, if that is the position of the government, then it would be useful to a more fully informed debate that those things were on the record, rather than just occasional platitudes about gradual improvements in animal welfare.
There is one other factor in this that needs to be emphasised. There is clearly an alternative trade and there has clearly been an expansion of that trade just in the last year. In August, exports to the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, were up 87 per cent on last year. These countries buy frozen meat that is slaughtered in Australia and exported to them. If we removed some of the market distortions that currently favour the live export trade they would buy more of that product. To continue to turn our backs on that market is quite bizarre. This obsession with the short-term status quo not only continues to allow a lot of unnecessary suffering but also is economically unwise.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—We are talking about job opportunities for rural Australians, Senator, and we are talking about economic opportunities for Australia. I am not against trade—I am not commenting on other parties. I do believe trade is in many cases a very valuable thing, but we cannot look at just one aspect, the benefits, and ignore all of the other consequences. The regulation I have moved to disallow today enables this trade to be reopened with Saudi Arabia. That means that the suffering that is part of that trade will continue as well.
—The suffering of the sheep?
—Yes, the suffering of the sheep; they suffer rather a lot, Senator. Some people are concerned about that. As I have said, there are also ample economic arguments that indicate that the blind adherence to this particular trade ignores economic opportunities for rural Australia in particular. The willingness of many in the community to endeavour to engage in developing those opportunities should not just be buried beneath the usual avalanche of falsehoods and abuse that happens whenever anyone wants to raise the issue of animal welfare and animal cruelty. The only other comment I would make is that this disallowance motion is specifically about the trade with Saudi Arabia, but of course there are still plenty of live animal exports to other parts of the Middle East and the South-East Asia region.
State governments have a responsibility here as well. The Western Australian government took a very long time and dragged its feet in relation to a very clear-cut and simple instance of an apparent breach of its own WA animal welfare laws. That is now finally before the courts, after more than two years. Ensuring that animal welfare laws at the state level are complied with, even in parts of the trade that relate to Australia, is something that state governments have been honouring when they are breached more than when they are enforced. In the absence of any attempt on the part of governments—state and federal and Labor and Liberal—to engage in an open and honest way with these issues, there will just continue to be more community concern and community pressure to get existing laws properly enforced and ensure that the public are made more aware of the facts.
That puts producers in rural communities in a position where they are more likely to be pulled into trench warfare, which I do not believe is in their interests. We are seeing that at the moment with the bizarre and very aggressive approach of Australian Wool Innovation to Australian activists as well as international activists, chewing up enormous amounts of money with court action and with a range of threats simply to try and intimidate people who just want to get the facts onto the public record and ask people to act on a matter if it is one that concerns them.
If it is not something that concerns people, that is fine. It is not the position that I would take, but it is a position that people as individuals, as industries and as governments can choose to take—but they should at least do so openly and in a way that acknowledges that some people have legitimate concerns about these issues. If others do not, well, so be it. But I am certainly concerned about the unnecessary suffering of animals and I am certainly concerned about lost economic opportunities for rural communities. I think it is shame that others in this chamber do not seem to share that view.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bartlett’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY (EXPORT OF LIVE-STOCK TO SAUDI ARABIA) ORDER 2005</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report by 25 November 2005:
The matter of overtime and shift allowances, with particular reference to:
the effectiveness of shift allowances and overtime in achieving their original purpose (i.e. enabling workers to achieve a balance between paid work and family responsibilities and to participate in their communities by discouraging employers from employing them outside or beyond normal hours);
the cost impact of shift allowances on employers who are unable to afford to operate for as long as they would like because of having to pay shift allowances;
the extent to which overtime has become a means for employers to compensate workers for low pay;
whether overtime and shift allowances are sufficiently effective in achieving their original purpose, and if not, what other measures could be adopted to achieve this objective now; and
if the payment of overtime and shift allowances ceased to be mandatory, what mechanism would be used to compensate those workers who rely on overtime as an essential part of their take home pay.
This motion is about having a Senate inquiry into penalty rates—overtime and shift allowances. It is important to note that these penalty rates were one of the first paid work-family initiatives. They were designed to discourage employers from requiring workers to work antisocial hours and to promote a good balance between paid work and family and community life. The question is: are penalty rates still achieving the original purpose of maintaining that balance between work and family and community life?
At a time when the government is overhauling the workplace relations system, it is even more important to consider this matter. This is an ideal opportunity for the Senate to look at this issue and to have an inquiry into how in the 21st century we can move forward to achieve a paid work and family balance that will genuinely help families, the community and employers.
Retaining the ideal eight-hour day is extremely important to ensure the balance between work and family and community life. We need to examine new ideas and ways for achieving the purposes for which penalty rates, overtime and shift allowances were originally designed. The government’s changes will no longer require employers to pay penalty rates. This is such an important issue that an inquiry needs to be held about getting the right balance between work and family.
The original design of penalty rates has been corrupted over a period of time so that sometimes penalty rates are used to compensate for low pay, which is an issue in itself. So, the original design, which was intended to achieve a balance between work and family, is no longer effective and, in actual fact, is sometimes being used to compensate for low pay. In highly capitalised industries, how employers pay penalty rates is not such an important issue and, therefore, it can compensate low pay as well.
Those affected are people like cleaners, who need a decent wage. They often rely on penalty rates. With the government’s potential changes, new workers or people changing jobs will find themselves potentially receiving different amounts. Small businesses will need to grapple with maybe having employees on two wages, with some getting penalty rates and some not. There may be some guarantee for those workers already receiving penalty rates, but those workers changing jobs or coming into the work force will no longer be guaranteed those allowances. So you may have this problem with small businesses grappling with having people on two different wages who are employed to do the same job. I think this would cause immense problems, even though small businesses would sometimes find that penalty rates are a disincentive for them to grow their business. I am not sure that having employees on two different types of wages will solve it. I think it would be very difficult for them to manage.
The system is broken. As I said before, the original purpose of penalty rates was to act as a disincentive for making people work antisocial hours. That is not as effective as it was originally. But, after a hundred years, I do not believe in going backwards and just removing it. I do not think that really is progress at all. In the interest of families, in the interest of the community and in the interest of small businesses and workers, as we move forward into this century, I think it is quite right that the Senate take time to look, through an inquiry, at how we can achieve the original purpose for which penalty rates were designed. We need to look at how we can move forward to make sure that we get a balance between paid work and family and community life.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-10-06,"—I indicate that the government will not be supporting this motion. We believe that the issues that Senator Fielding has quite accurately referred to are issues that are integral to the government’s industrial relations reform agenda that will be brought before the parliament in a very short period of time. They will be available for the parliament to see what the government has in mind in terms of the legislative provisions. The parliamentary consideration of those legislative provisions should await the arrival of the legislation, which I expect to be introduced into the other place in a short period of time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting Senator Fielding’s committee reference. I want to make a number of comments, both about his contribution and the indication from the government that they will be opposing this. In his comments in support of this reference, Senator Fielding reminded us of the eight-hour day, and some of the thinking behind shift allowances, penalty and overtime rates more generally, from the working family perspective. It is a perspective that, unfortunately, in today’s employment arena, has not had sufficient attention. This government has been talking, for quite a number of years now, about work and family. They have done a lot of talking on it but they really have delivered very little on an issue which is of pressing concern to the many Australians who are struggling to maintain a balance between the demands of their work and their family responsibilities and the need to actually spent time with family.
Senator Fielding referred to the eight-hour day. It is often good in this place to remember a bit of history, particularly at a time when the government seems intent on bashing anything to do with trade unions. It was trade unions in this country that first argued for an eight-hour day. One of the reasons for that was to ensure that people actually had adequate time for rest and also adequate time for their families and for their communities—something that, unfortunately, the government wants to disregard.
We support this motion. We did raise an issue with Senator Fielding about the inclusion of occupational health and safety consequences of shiftwork and overtime. Our preference would have been to have that in the motion, but certainly the motion as it stands is something we support.
This is a test for the government—one that, as Senator Ian Campbell has indicated quite clearly, they are not going to respond to in a positive way. It is part of the continuing test as to how this government uses its Senate mandate and to what extent it wants to avoid scrutiny and consideration of policy and political issues which are relevant to the Australian community. If you talk to most Australians about the issue of work and family, they do not think it is an esoteric issue. They do not think that it is an issue that is simply about a piece of legislation here or a piece of legislation there. This is about people’s lives.
It seems to us on this side of the parliament that it is a very reasonable proposition that an issue that is of such relevance to Australian workers should be considered with the fullness of a reference committee inquiry that enables a range of policy considerations to be looked at. Senator Ian Campbell’s response is, ‘We’ve got the legislation coming in.’ Senator Campbell, that is going to be an inquiry on the government’s agenda. Yes, we want that. We hope that the government will actually have a proper inquiry and will allow scrutiny of what are billed as being and are likely to be some of the most wide-ranging reforms to Australian workplaces in many years which will affect millions of Australian workers. Yes, we do want a proper inquiry into that, but we do not want an inquiry that is only on the government’s agenda. There are broader policy issues here, and policy issues which, frankly, this parliament is well behind on. We are well behind where the community is at in terms of discussion in this place and certainly in terms of government policy on the issue of work and family.
Most Australians want this to be considered and addressed. They want to have a look at how in today’s world, when many people have jobs which demand so much of their time, we can balance the various responsibilities and the various desires we have in life to spend time with family as well as to achieve a reasonable level of economic security. This is a test for the government. This is a test about whether they are prepared to be subject to scrutiny and whether they are prepared to allow this chamber, through its committee process, to engage in a consideration of policy options on issues relevant to the Australian community. As I said, this is something on which there is broad-ranging concern in the community.
One final issue I wanted to raise—and Senator Fielding raised a very good point about this—was about low-paid workers and the role that penalty rates now play in many low-paid workers’ working lives. In my previous profession, I represented quite a number of cleaners and other people in such industries. Senator Fielding is correct—and this is something the Labor Party has been saying for some time: unfortunately, we have a situation in Australia where there are some workers who are on such low hourly rates or who have such intermittent hours of work that they are forced to work longer shifts in order to get the overtime payments because they simply cannot afford not to. That is a very relevant issue. It might be an issue the government wants to duck and walk away from, particularly with its plans to undermine the minimum wage in this country, but it is a very real issue for many Australians.
So we support the inquiry. We say that if the government proceed, as they intend, to vote this down then it is simply another demonstration that they are not interested in work and family issues. Despite the government talking about it for many years and despite the Prime Minister saying, ‘This is the barbecue stopper; it’s part of our agenda,’ we have seen very little movement on it, very little policy on it and certainly very little addressing of the concerns of Australians and their families. We will also see that the government yet again does not want this chamber, through its committee process, to actually go out to the community to discuss issues which are of concern to them. It would be yet another use—or misuse, in our view—of the government’s mandate to shut down discussion, to shut down debate and to shut down inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-10-06,"—The Greens also support this motion on a committee reference, although we do have an amendment which I will put forward in a moment. We are deeply concerned about the government’s agenda for the so-called reform of the industrial relations system in this country and the impact that will have on workers and their families. My concern with this motion is that we do not believe that it articulates quite well enough the need to look at the impact of the overtime and shift provisions on employees and their families. That is why we want to amend it a bit further.
We agree that there is an urgent need to look at these issues. We believe that changes to overtime and penalty rates will impact hardest on those most disadvantaged in our community: women; younger workers; those in low-skilled, low-paid jobs. As has already been articulated in this place, many workers in lower paying jobs currently rely very heavily on overtime payments, on working late shifts, to make enough money to support their families. For some, the loss of overtime and penalty rates will be the final straw that drives them just over the line of having to default on simple things like being able to pay their mortgage. Many families do rely on these penalty rates to support them and keep them out of poverty. Workers do make the difficult choice to work night shifts, to work overtime, to work outside regular hours. That is time that they have away from their families. They make that decision—a very hard decision—in exchange for earning a bit of extra money to improve their living standards. They are now potentially being asked to give up that time and not get that additional overtime pay. They have already given up a lot to work overtime and now they are being asked to give up more.
If you look at the case of students, who are now facing such heavy bills to get their education, they are having to work overtime, night shifts and outside regular hours and do casual work so that they can support themselves in their studies. Reducing the penalty rates they receive for working outside normal hours will either mean they have to work longer hours to make the money they currently do, or they will have to give up their studies, or they will compromise their studies even further by working much longer hours.
Looking at the increase in the amount of casual work that is already happening in this country: between August 1994 and August 2003, the number of casual employees rose by 44.8 per cent while the number of full-time employees grew by only 10.8 per cent. In other words, there is a shift in our employment from full-time to casual work; therefore, a greater number of people are relying on overtime and penalty rates. These people are going to be significantly disadvantaged. There is a fallacy that Australia is the land of the long weekend. On average, Australian employees work 1,855 hours per year, compared to those in other developed countries, who work an average of 1,643. In Norway, for example, they work only an average of 1,376 hours per year. The hours that our workers in Australia work is increasing. Again, they are going to be significantly disadvantaged by the changes.
There is continual carping about the need to lower our wage bill. But, looking at the economics, the proportion of our gross domestic product spent on wages has dropped 10 per cent while the proportion of GDP taken as corporate profits has increased 10 per cent. The line being run that we need to reduce wages to make our industries and businesses more profitable is nonsense when you look at the facts. That is why we support the proposal to look at the role of overtime and shift allowances. We think it is very timely. I agree with Senator Wong that it is absolutely fundamental that we look at these changes outside the government’s proposals, because that way we can have a broader discussion. But we do think that we need to look at the effect overtime and shift allowances have on families and employees. That is why I am proposing an amendment to Senator Fielding’s motion. I move:

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-06,"—I will start with the Greens amendment to Senator Fielding’s motion. Senator Fielding’s motion is one that the Australian Democrats are happy and keen to support. We certainly think the Greens amendment to that is a worthy addition. Having said that, if it does not get up, I do not think that anything in Senator Fielding’s motion precludes a discussion or examination of the issues that have been put in the amendment by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Greens. I indicate that the Greens will have the support of the Democrats on that amendment, as I think those issues deserve consideration.
I endorse the comments that have been made by the speakers before me. However, I am disappointed at the government’s decision not to support this inquiry. It is a good inquiry. It is a basic, important inquiry that ties in with the government’s purported commitment to work and family issues and, in particular, to striving to work out some kind of work and family balance—and aren’t we all?
What is the government concerned about? Is it really a process question? The government has a raft of legislation in relation to workplace relations that we are all anticipating and some of us are very apprehensive about. This stands alone from many of the debates. Of course, work and family balance will be an integral part of the debates, but, regardless of whether or not we have access to that legislation, this issue is here and now. In fact, as people have said, it is not only timely, it is long overdue.
I make the point—and I am sure Senator Fielding understands this—that no one party in this place has a monopoly on caring for families or caring for the needs, the roles and the rights of workers and working families in Australia. I would argue that all senators in this place have a commitment to that concept. We may have differing views as to how to achieve or maintain a work and family balance, but this is a great opportunity for us to examine some specific issues.
Speakers before me have talked about some of the phenomena that we have experienced in this country. Yes, we are one of the hardest working nations on earth. We have this extraordinary experience now where, on the one hand, we have people unemployed or underemployed and, on the other hand, many workers in Australia, regardless of what workplace they are involved in, are working harder than ever before. One of the most comprehensive surveys was a research paper done by the ACTU—I think, and I will check my facts, more than a year ago—where workers were asked, ‘What do you want?’ and they said, ‘More time with family.’ It is a bit of a no-brainer. If I polled the chamber, I am pretty confident most people would say, ‘More time with family.’ I would be very concerned about those who said, ‘More time in parliament.’ It is an issue for all of us, whether we are members of parliament or whether we are working or not working.
The other issue which I want us to examine at some point in this place, because we seem to have stopped talking about it, is that of underemployment and unemployment. We seem to be accepting that five or six per cent is an acceptable target for unemployment. It is not, for a variety of reasons. We are forgetting the experiences and the difficulties of those people who are unemployed or underemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed in Australia—and the numbers are not going down; that is a significant part of our community—as well as those young people, particularly in regional, remote and rural areas, who are still experiencing incredibly high levels of unemployment. They are the issues we need to look at. Why did we stop talking about unemployment targets? Why aren’t we talking about new industries and new types of employment? Pertinent to this inquiry that Senator Fielding has suggested is the issue of casualisation which other colleagues have brought up—the high level of part-time and casual jobs, again not married with a high level of full-time, sustainable, long-term, and in many cases meaningful, jobs for Australians. These are the issues we really do need to target.
This is a specific area of debate, and an important one, but we have to remember that if we are going to talk about achieving a meaningful work and life or work and family balance, or to overcome what Dr Barbara Pocock has termed the ‘work/life collision’, then we need to examine and consider a suite of reforms. That includes looking at everything from overtime—in 2001 the Democrats proposed a fair hours fund to convert some overtime positions into jobs, and that is only one idea; France and other European countries have also looked at this—and those kinds of ideas right through to some of those supports that families want and need such as child care and parental leave. Certainly, maternity leave is a priority. All of those issues are part of the work and family debate. It is time that we had that debate. This is a small but important first step in that debate, and I commend the motion to the chamber. I hope that the government will reconsider its position, because if we are committed to debating these issues, even if we do not all agree on the solutions, and the government has indicated that it is—it is a barbecue stopper—then this is the time to vote for it. I hope this vote does not go down.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—The support the Greens have for this inquiry is in line with the very strong role that the Greens have played over more than a decade in wanting workers to get a better deal in this country where serially, under Labor and particularly in the last 10 years of Australian workplace agreements, the rights of workers and the ability of unions to defend the rights of workers have been eroded. An obvious outcome of that has been two things. Those who engage in difficult labour, such as in manufacturing and in infrastructure, often get very poorly paid whereas those who are involved in what can be called manipulation of the way in which society works—for example, trading on stock exchanges in such esoteric things as the currencies—get enormous incomes for no contribution whatever to society in terms of benefit to families or benefit to the country.
We are going from bad to worse in this direction. The loss of amenity for workers to be assured that they would be paid overtime, for example, is much greater than it appears on the face of it, simply because so many people are casualised and so many people are part-time workers. They lose not only a dinkum income but their right to adequate leave, to ensured overtime and to a whole range of rights that ought to have been theirs. We are about to see a massive further move to the extreme right, to the philosophy that the market rules—
—And women in the home.
—and, as Senator Stott Despoja says, women in the home, which is part of the extreme right philosophy that says leave it to the market and let those who have the least power—that is, the least money—be left to their own devices. In a sense, and we hear it coming from several ministers, this government’s philosophy is, ‘It is your own fault if you are working long hours and you are getting low pay; somehow or other that is your lot in life.’ It harks back to early industrial age thinking.
It is up to parliament to make and keep this a fair country, but what we are hearing from the government is that they do not want an inquiry into this—of course they do not, because the government is in the employ of the big end of town, of the big corporations, very often the big employers like the supermarket chains and the fast food outlets which do not treat their employees adequately for the work they do in ensuring these very profitable chains provide the services that they do. And who gets the profit? The already wealthy do.
We have seen serial changes to the tax operations in this country which favour the rich over the poor. We are about to see the industrial relation changes come through. What is more, the minister said, ‘No, we do not want an inquiry now; it can wait until then.’ Really? Would that be like the inquiry we saw the government afford on the Telstra legislation, which was fast-forwarded, guillotined and gagged in this Senate chamber just a couple of weeks ago when there was six hours spent on it on the Friday? No. That the government is pulling the rug from under Family First and Senator Fielding on this inquiry is indicative of the fact that it is going to push that legislation through with the minimum of inquiry.
There will be no opportunity for the community to adequately debate it, let alone time for busy workers and parents to adequately work out the impact the industrial relations changes will have on their families. Sure, the business organisations will know about it. After all, they are helping to draft the legislation. But will the average family, parent or worker who sustains this country? No, they will not. Will they have input? No, they will not. And the vote by the government today is simply thumbing its nose at Family First and saying, ‘If you want to come in and do what the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party have been doing for years in this period of government’—that is, trying to defend the right of families to get a fair go at the cake of this wealthy nation of ours—‘post election we are not going to support that.’
You have to be consistent about these things. If you are going to support the interests of families, you have to do it consistently, as the Greens do. We have had two motions this morning. One was from Senator Milne about the enormous impact that global warming is going to have on everybody, not least families. It talked about 8,000 to 15,000 Australians potentially dying each year from heat related illnesses by the end of this century. It also talked about dengue reaching as far south as Sydney. That is breakbone fever. The motion also states ‘climate change is likely to exacerbate poverty and may lead to large scale population displacement throughout the Asia Pacific region’. The motion sensibly called on the government to do a number of things which governments elsewhere are already doing to defend families—our grandchildren—in this country from that awesome impact. Senator Fielding and Family First voted against that motion. I do not understand how that could be.
Senator Siewert’s motion calls for Australian servicepeople to be protected from depleted uranium munitions used by the US in such things as joint training exercises. Depleted uranium is a dangerous material which impacts on the health of servicepeople. It changes their whole lives. We ought to ensure that our defence personnel are not exposed to depleted uranium. But what did Senator Fielding do? He voted against that motion. There may be some explanation for this. I do not understand it.
A few weeks ago, Senator Milne moved for a family impact statement on the privatisation of Telstra, which we know is going to have not only an impact on communications but also a financial impact on every family in this country. Where was the family impact statement? Not only did the Senate not get the family impact statement but Family First and Senator Fielding voted against the Greens motion to have that statement here before the legislation was dealt with. They voted against it.
The question here is: where is the philosophy of Family First? It resides with the Greens and with the other parties on this side of the House. Senator Fielding may be sitting on the other side of the parliament, and he is getting dudded on this motion today, but if you were to ask where the consistency is in a presentation of the interests of families I would say it is manifestly missing. It is not just slipshod; it is erratic and unable to be defined. Already in the short time that Family First has been in this parliament, it has voted against the interests of families in this country. So it is good to see a motion coming forward which, on the face of it, is to inquire into the impact on families—although it has been left to Senator Siewert to move an amendment which specifically gets down to that impact.
Senator Siewert’s amendment is that the inquiry should look at ‘the impact on employees and their families of low wages and the need to work long hours of overtime’. It is a very specific amendment which says, ‘Let’s look at what these changes are going to mean for families.’ Let us be straight about it, if that is our intent—and, indeed, it is the intent here. It is an important amendment. It concentrates the mind of the proposed inquiry clearly on the impact on families of the very clear fact that in this country—even before the industrial relations package we are about to see—families are being disrupted and driven into poverty. There is a growing gap between the power and the money of the haves and the disempowerment and the lack of money of the have nots, and the lack of ability to get union backing, because of laws that have already gone through the parliament—the disability of the disempowered and the poor to have a fair say in what goes on.
It is a commendable motion from Senator Fielding. It will be improved by the amendment of Senator Siewert, but the government stands indicted through its refusal to have this inquiry. We are on course to see the government cut across the necessary public debate in the industrial relations field with the legislation that is about to be dumped on this parliament and, again, gagged and guillotined through here in the coming weeks. That is how this government operates. The fact is that the government has the numbers. It is going to be a very complex suite of legislation. If the government were supporting Senator Fielding’s motion, it would put some doubt in the asseveration that the government is going to dump the legislation on the Senate, dump it on the House of Representatives, dump it on the parliament and put it through with a minimum of investigation.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-10-06,"—Under standing order 191, I make it quite clear that Senator Brown has misrepresented, misquoted and quite clearly misunderstood what I said in my speech. By his very words and his reference to his colleague’s amendment to Senator Fielding’s motion—he refers to the impact of the government’s legislation on families—he seeks to make my case. That was simply and clearly that the matters that Senator Fielding refers to—and this is what I said in my speech which has been misunderstood or misquoted and, I would say, misrepresented—
—Is this a speech or a point of order?
—I refer you to standing order 191. Standing order 191 specifically allows a senator to get to his or her feet and make an explanation of a speech where he or she has been misquoted or misunderstood. I have been misquoted and I do not intend allowing Senator Brown to verbal me on two occasions on the one day. Previously he said that I regularly read speeches. I think the last speech I read in this chamber was actually on 16 May 1990.
In relation to Senator Fielding’s motion, I made the very clear point that there is a lot of merit—and the government will vote in accordance with that merit—in waiting for the industrial relations legislation to be here. Senator Brown chose to misquote me on this. I also suggest, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you look closely at what Senator Brown said in his speech about reflecting on votes on two or three entirely unrelated issues. It was an attack on Senator Fielding’s voting record. Mr Acting Deputy President, I think you will find it is in contravention of standing order 193—reflecting on a vote of the Senate.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Campbell is addressing the Senate under standing order 191. Clearly he has gone way outside the realms of that standing order and is now introducing new debatable matters into the debate. That is inappropriate and you should bring him to order.

(Senator Watson)—Senator Campbell, you have a right to raise your concern but you do not have a right to debate it. I think Senator Marshall is concerned that perhaps you are now debating the issue.
—I think Senator Marshall has a good point. I think I should sit down under standing order 191. I have stuck to the standing order.
—Senator Ian Campbell.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I now rise on a point of order. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to look very closely at standing order 193, which says that senators should not reflect on any vote of the Senate. I think you will find, if you read Senator Bob Brown’s contribution, that although he sought to make a political attack on Senator Fielding, by reflecting on how Senator Fielding voted on a number of other Greens motions this morning or in recent times, in fact what Senator Brown was doing was reflecting on a vote of the Senate. I ask that you and perhaps the President look closely at Senator Brown’s contribution to the debate and see whether he was in fact breaching standing order 193. I do not seek an immediate ruling on that.
—On the same point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: I would not normally recommend a move that is going to waste your time, but I think I would support Senator Ian Campbell’s move that you do look at what I had to say, because you will find that it was entirely within standing orders and quite proper.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-10-06,"—I would like to sum up but, before I do, I want to say that I have had some conversation with Senator Siewert about her amendment to the motion. At the moment her amendment substitutes paragraph (b) with a new paragraph (b). We discussed adding that substitute paragraph to the amendment rather than substituting paragraph (b)—in other words, leaving the motion as it is and actually adding the new paragraph to the end of the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Before Senator Fielding sums up and the debate is closed, I would like to indicate our position on the amendment. We are happy to support the Greens amendment from this side of the chamber. I want to make two comments about Senator Ian Campbell’s contributions. If the government are going to vote this down and not allow this matter to go to inquiry, will the minister give an indication as to the type, scope et cetera of inquiry the government will be permitting on their wide-ranging industrial relations legislation? In particular, if the government vote this down, are they going to give an undertaking today—because they say, ‘We are voting this down because we’re going to have another inquiry’—
—I didn’t say that. You should listen to what I said.
—As I understood you, Senator Campbell—and I am happy to go back—the government’s position is that you are going to oppose this motion because you are going to have an inquiry into the industrial relations legislation.
—No. I said that twice.
—Okay. That is fine. Can we make it clear that, on the industrial relations legislation, which is going to have a wide-ranging impact on millions of Australian workers, the government is not going to give an undertaking to have an inquiry, nor will it give an undertaking it will not have another Telstra debacle style inquiry of a single day to inquire into legislation that is very important—
—That was on a vote of the Senate. You are reflecting on the Senate.
—Senator Abetz is making another contribution. Is the government going to give an undertaking it will allow a proper inquiry into the industrial relations legislation?
—It’s up to the Senate.
—Perhaps if you could stop interrupting, Minister Abetz, we might actually finish this debate. Is the government going to give an undertaking—
—Why don’t you address your remarks through the Acting Deputy President? You are in breach of standing orders.
—Are you going to shout at me for the entirety of this debate?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: the opposition senator on her feet is staring across the table and asking me questions. There is a fundamental rule of debate in this place that actually makes it work—that is, that the remarks of a senator need to be addressed to the chair and through the chair. If senators do not want interjections, they should not stare across at the front bench of the government and ask questions directly of ministers, which, quite frankly, intuitively invite me to respond by way of interjection. I would be happy to seek your call when the senator resumes her seat, but she cannot have it both ways.

(Senator Watson)—I would ask Senator Wong to address the chair but, at the same time, I say: all interjections are disorderly.
—I am very happy to address my remarks through the chair. I did not realise the government was so concerned about scrutiny that Senator Campbell would get so sensitive about me looking at him during the debate and saying that perhaps he should give an undertaking. He might take a point of order about me looking at him, but he is quite happy to have Minister Abetz and himself interject on the opposition when we are putting a point of view.
There is a very simple proposition: Senator Fielding is seeking an inquiry into overtime and shift allowances, a matter that goes to the heart of the work and family balance that has broad support across every party in this chamber except the government. The government have indicated they do not want this inquiry. They made reference to the industrial relations legislation they are proposing to bring into this place shortly. What I am asking is: if the government vote this down because they say their legislation is coming in, will the government give an undertaking that their industrial relations legislation, which will impact on millions of Australian workers and their families, will be the subject of a proper inquiry by this Senate before it is voted on? If the government do not in the context of this vote give that undertaking, it will be very clear to everyone in this chamber and to the Australian community that this government do not want scrutiny of their radical industrial relations agenda.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-10-06,"—This is an important issue—and I think we should get back to the core of it—for Australians and it is an important issue for Family First. It has great impact on families and small businesses. Each senator would know how important family and work balance is, and I do not think we should be paying lip-service to such an important inquiry. Regardless of the legislation that may be coming through, this is an issue of the day that needs quality time spent on it.
We hear a lot about family and work-life balance. The Australian Institute of Family Studies revealed that financial affairs are important in people’s consideration of having children. The institute also found that male partners’ jobs and job security are key concerns. Issues about penalty rates will impact a lot of Australians and Australian families, and this is a very big concern. Some workers are forced by economic circumstances to rely on penalty rates. They rely on them to boost their home pay and to make ends meet. The concern about whether penalty rates may or may not be there in the future will impact negatively upon families.
The whole issue about penalty rates is being raised because the original design of that issue has been corrupted today. This is a concern about making sure that we have got the right work and family balance. The eight-hour day is important, and we want to make sure that moving forward we look at this issue and give it due time and consideration. I ask each senator as they think about this issue in the coming minutes to really think about this: are they paying this nation and the Senate total regard when they look at how they vote on this particular issue? I appeal to the government to look at this issue and vote for this motion, as it gets to the heart of the issue about getting a good work and family balance.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—Briefly on this issue, in one way—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: chances are leave might be granted, but I thought Senator Fielding had closed the debate.
—by leave—I think Senator Fielding now realises his motion is going to go down. Firstly, I want to make the point that the issues of family and work that he is concerned with can be picked up on the current Democrat initiated inquiry into agreement making. I would urge him and any of his constituency to make submissions to that inquiry. Secondly, I am advised that the government will agree to an inquiry into the workplace bills that are coming up and I would assume that that will be a proper, not a clayton’s, inquiry. We should follow up this issue with these matters being fully addressed in that forum. But it is an important lesson you are learning here, Senator Fielding: the government will decide what is in the government’s interest and it is not sympathetic to the views you are expressing.

(Senator Forshaw)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.
A division having being called and the bells being rung—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I suggest that you call the division off.
—We will put the question again, so that it is clear. I am putting the question that the amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
The Senate ought not to let go the way in which Mr Parkin was arrested and deported from our country. I will briefly go through the facts of the matter. Mr Parkin, who I understand is a 33-year-old American citizen, has been a long-time advocate for the peaceful resolution of human affairs. He is opposed to war. He is opposed to violence. He is very much in favour of the resolution of our differences around the world through peaceful means. As such, he is in the tradition of Martin Luther King, the great American peace advocate and achiever of civil liberties for the American people, and, before that, Mahatma Gandhi and, indeed, right to back to HD Thoreau in the United States in the 1840s.
As part of his advocacy he has been opposed to the illegal invasion of Iraq and the motivation for that invasion. He has talked quite a deal about those who stood to gain, not least Halliburton, the huge US corporation and armaments manufacturer which is making billions of dollars out of the invasion and occupation of Iraq. The former CEO of Halliburton is now the Vice-President of the United States. He is the deputy to George W Bush—that is, Mr Dick Cheney. There is no doubt that Scott Parkin has been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration and Halliburton and its former CEO.
Mr Parkin came to Australia. He was granted a visa. There was some delay, but he was given a visa after all the due vetting by the Australian authorities. He attended a protest outside the Opera House. It was a gathering of the rich in the name of the Forbes corporation, and it included some US business interests. He went on to have talks with Australians interested in peace and global affairs, and he set up some further talks about peace, what it really means and, of course, the fact that it needs to be understrapped by a much fairer world. I am given to believe that about a week before he was arrested he was called by ASIO and asked to undertake an interview. I am also given to believe that he asked if this was necessary and was told, ‘No, it’s not.’ It was a voluntary thing, so he declined and went about his peaceful organisation. Then one Saturday, the Federal Police arrived and Mr Parkin was arrested. Within days he was deported, his visa having been withdrawn.
A number of important questions arise here, of course. How could it be that, in our democracy where our Prime Minister goes around the world—very often hand-in-hand with President George W Bush—advocating democracy and liberty, somebody who advocates peace in a tradition that goes back beyond Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago could be arrested in our country and deported with no other explanation to the public? How could that be, particularly in view of the fact that the Australian government had given him a visa just some weeks before?
I have a theory—because you have to look for some explanation—and that is that the Bush administration does not like Mr Parkin. For some reason, it did not get engaged fast enough but did get involved in the publicity that Mr Parkin was generating in Australia; maybe the US embassy picked up on that and did not like it. And, in communication with the government of our Prime Minister John Howard, the Bush administration decided that his visa should be withdrawn—and this is an Australian visa, not an American visa—and that he should be sent back to America. The consequent impact will very likely be, of course, that Mr Parkin will have a record—not for anything he has done, but because of these government moves—which will make it difficult for him to get visas to travel to other countries as well.
At least I know this: there is no way an American citizen would be deported from our country, under this government, without extensive consultations between Washington and Canberra, between the Bush administration and the Howard prime ministerial office. That means, of course, that both Prime Minister Howard and President Bush approved of this American having his visa withdrawn and being deported under these circumstances.
Consequent to Mr Parkin’s deportation, we awoke one morning to find a story on the front page of the Australian newspaper, which is so often the recipient of information from the government that the government wants to put out into the public arena. The story alleged that Mr Parkin had been deported because he was going to—not because he had, but because he was going to—make statements or encourage people to roll marbles under the hooves of horses in protests in Australia and, indeed, give techniques by which people who were arrested by the police could be taken out of custody.
There are a couple of problems with this ASIO information, which stood uncontested on the front page of the Australian newspaper. The first is that Mr Parkin has never advocated anything remotely like that. In fact, it is contrary to what he has advocated consistently in his pursuit of peaceful means for human beings to interact with each other. The second is that, when he was questioned about this, having been deported with a security officer on either side of him in the plane crossing the Pacific and then furnished with a bill for $11,000 by the Australian government, in the consequent interview he made it very clear that not only had he never advocated such things but that he never would. He is opposed to any form of gratuitous animal cruelty, and ditto to affronting the police in the way that was advocated. I point out again that the accusation was not that he had advocated such things—and it appears an ASIO operative or informant must have been at some of the meetings, and public meetings at that, that he had been attending in Australia—but that he was going to.
What country are we in? Surely the Inquisition is behind us. Surely the Salem witchcraft trials were some centuries ago. Surely Joan of Arc was put to the stake before our own more enlightened times. Even the McCarthy period of the 1950s in the United States at its apogee, we had hoped, had gone back into history. But no; in the year 2005, this peaceful man, advocating peace in our peace-loving democracy, is picked up in a police state operation, has his visa removed—by decision of the Attorney-General, effectively: the chief law-maker of this country—and is deported, his rights taken away without any due reason being given at all.
And then we see a fit-up, a false track from ASIO, appear on the front page of a newspaper, to try to justify that which is not only unjustifiable but which must be totally repugnant to any person who believes in a fair go in this country. This is the Howard government, in cahoots with the Bush administration, showing what it can do under the laws it wants to bring in in this country in the name of security. It can take away the rights of a peace activist, for goodness sake, on political grounds.
What happened here was that a political decision was made by Prime Minister Howard and by the chief law-maker of this country, the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, acting as a court. With no evidence extant, with no ability for the defendant to defend his position—indeed, with no charge; certainly with no legal representation or cross-examination—he was found guilty, sentenced and deported.
These are all the hallmarks of a police state activity. We must not be frightened of saying that, because that is what it is. If we are going to defend the rule of law—but, more particularly, justice—in this country then we have to confront injustice when we see it, particularly politically motivated injustice by a government which dominates both houses of the parliament. We have to be fearless in doing that.
Here is the Greens motion saying: let us have an inquiry into this matter. Let us get the ministers and the representatives to come forward and put their point of view. Let us have ASIO explain to senators—in camera if necessary if there is some national security factor at stake here—before a Senate inquiry, because Senate inquiries are so important as a watchdog on the government.
But there are two problems. The first is that the government is going to vote against it because it has got the numbers in this place. The second is that the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, sought an ASIO briefing on the arrest and deportation of Mr Parkin and after that briefing said publicly that he agreed with the government’s actions and no further explanation was required. Incidentally, I made a request for the same briefing and was refused. That is a government decision, but it is an absolute affront that any member of parliament should be refused such a briefing; we are all elected equal into this parliament by the people of Australia. When matters as important as this are at stake the justification should be forthcoming and, if it is going to be in camera, let it be so. I am no less capable of recognising the security of this country, which I love, than are Mr Beazley, Mr Howard, Mr Ruddock or anybody else. The very fact that I was denied that briefing indicates that the government does not and cannot stand by the decision that it took.
My understanding is that the opposition is not going to support this inquiry either. That is not just a pity; it is a failure by the Labor opposition and in particular by the Leader of the Opposition, who took the decision to support the Howard government in deporting Mr Parkin and to stand by that decision. Here are the two big parties saying: ‘We will make these decisions in camera, out of public view, and we will not have them inquired into by our fellow senators. We do not want them to look in behind this curtain where these decisions are being made.’ I put it to you, Acting Deputy President Forshaw, those decisions were wrong, cannot be justified and are an affront to the justice system that we hold dear in this country. I cannot believe that Labor is not going to support this motion. I cannot believe it. But there we have it. So the constructive opposition on this matter is left to the crossbench and to the Greens in moving this motion. Thank God we are here.
Everywhere I have been in the country in the last couple of weeks people have come up to me and said: ‘How could this happen in our country? How could this peace activist from the United States, of all places, be denied such a comprehensive range of rights?’ The answer is: it cannot be justified and it must not be allowed. Who is next to be removed from our midst because the government politically disagrees with them? Who is next on the Prime Minister’s list of people he does not want around in our country because they do not fit to his political comfort? This is very dangerous.
Of course we can all say: ‘No, we cannot have what happens in other countries happening in Australia. We are different—we are in some way superior in our ethics and a bulwark of democracy and justice to other people elsewhere around the world.’ That in itself is a grand mistake. We do have a parliament here which is a watchdog on executive government and which must be strong in using those watchdog powers. But I suspect today that that is going to be left to the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats, and that must be a worry in itself.
This is an extremely important motion. It is asking for an inquiry. It is not a motion to say, ‘Bring Scott Parkin back to Australia; pay his $11,000 debt; give a public explanation as to why he was deported on a farrago of misinformation and concocted claims.’ No, this is a motion to say, ‘Let us inquire into those things. Let us see if Senator Brown is wrong and that there is some other information out there that we do not know about.’ A Senate inquiry can look at that. If there is some security reason that it cannot come into the public arena, a Senate committee can deal with that in camera. It is a very important inquiry. It is a very important motion. I appeal again to the Labor Party to support it—and to the government for that matter. If they are right, support this for goodness sake.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Senator Brown is clear on what the Labor Party’s position is in respect of this matter. We are not going to support the reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee that he has proposed. Senator Brown has ranged widely over the issue, but I am not going to deal substantively with it, because, in principle, what we have before us is procedural in that it is a proposal for a reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee, as Senator Brown knows, has a chair and deputy chair. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has spoken to the deputy chair, but I am aware that he has not spoken to the chair about bringing a reference forward. The usual process that people in this place adopt is to consult with the minister and, usually, the shadow minister of the particular area, and with either the chair or deputy chair, or both, to get references up. It is not easy to get references up in this place, as Senator Brown clearly knows. At the end of the day he may have been unsuccessful even if he had gone through those processes. But I am unaware of whether or not he has.
The other question of course is whether or not the Legal and Constitutional References Committee is the appropriate committee to in fact deal with the issue. There is a joint committee, the ASIO-DSD committee, which could deal with this issue in a more practical manner. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has written to that committee and asked them to look into the matter. That committee is equipped to deal with these sorts of security sensitive issues. I think the Labor Party made the point last time Senator Brown moved a motion in respect of a similar matter that we did not think it was appropriate, and we have concluded again that it is not appropriate that references be sent to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee about such matters.
Also, Senator Brown will have the opportunity to ventilate this matter in estimates, which is coming up shortly, when ASIO appears as an agency. Senator Brown can pursue the matter at that time, and see how far he can progress it. The difficulty he will strike is that a references committee is usually used for a wide-ranging inquiry into a more general matter. They usually take submissions on and deal with particularly broad issues and then produce a report. From listening to his submission it appears that Senator Brown is asking for a rather short, sharp examination of ASIO, perhaps in camera. The difficulty that I suspect he will find is that ASIO may or may not provide the information he requests, in which case it would become a moot point as to whether or not the references committee would in fact advance Senator Brown’s arguments or produce the information that he is seeking. If Senator Brown has been unsuccessful in obtaining a briefing from ASIO I suggest that an alternative is to pursue reference of the matter for inquiry by letter to the relevant committee. That may or not provide him with any joy.
As happened last time in relation to a similar matter, Labor has requested and received a briefing, as correctly pointed out by Senator Brown. Our leader, Mr Kim Beazley, and the shadow minister for homeland security, Mr Arch Bevis, received a briefing in relation to the Scott Parkin matter. As a consequence of having received those briefings, Labor does not support the details of sensitive security operations being disclosed in an open forum. The difficulty of holding a references committee inquiry is of course that it could end up with ASIO informing the committee that it was not prepared to provide information in either an open forum or in camera. Unfortunately, as Senator Brown knows, in camera evidence, once provided, can be released by individual senators. We are all aware that that can happen sometimes—although I know that Senator Brown would not do that in any event—and my guess is that that would bear on ASIO’s ability to provide information. It might be the case that it would provide it to the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and that is a matter that you could explore. But, in terms of the direction that you are seeking to take today, Labor does not think that it should be supported in the way that Senator Brown has gone about it. So we will not be supporting the motion, as I have said. The matter that you have aired is obviously a matter of concern to you, and we encourage you to take every available opportunity to pursue it in the way that you wish to. Labor has pursued it in the way that we have decided to. We have received private briefings and we are satisfied with those private briefings.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-06,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as spokesperson for matters concerning the Attorney-General and foreign affairs, to support the motion before us. In the last 15 minutes I have become incredibly conscious of the basic and fundamental rights and freedoms that I think we as Australians, and those people who visit our country, should enjoy. I feel as though they have died away. My wrath, while directed so strongly at the government, today finds another home with the Labor opposition. It is extraordinary that any spokesperson would suggest that the Democrats apply for or get a briefing. There is no statutory obligation to inform or brief members of the crossbenches on an issue of so-called national security such as this, on a security threat or indeed on an issue of national interest, which I believe this issue is. If we break this matter down to the basics, Senator Brown is asking for us to know as a parliament—that is, as representatives of the people of Australia—what happened. Why was Scott Parkin deported? The government and the opposition do not want to tell us that. I am the first to acknowledge that there is information and classified briefings that should not necessarily be available to all members of parliament or indeed to the community at large. I accept that. But, even if you will not tell us, why won’t you tell the person who was deported? That is the extraordinary thing here, and it amounts to an absolute abuse of basic human rights. People might disrespect or dismiss this issue because it does not involve an Australian citizen. But surely they still believe that the person at the heart of this scandal has the right to know why his visa was revoked or, if he does not, that perhaps his legal representatives have the right to know.
We have revoked a visa that was legally and appropriately obtained in the first place, as I understand it. We have arrested a man, thrown him into jail and into solitary confinement, deported him, given him a bill for the pleasure, failed to tell him why and then encouraged him, as I understand it, not to challenge the reasons for the revocation of that visa—that is, the implication was, ‘If you don’t challenge this, you’ll be deported faster.’ Of course, at the time you would have presumed that leaving faster was not an unsatisfactory outcome because, if Mr Parkin had stayed any longer, albeit in solitary confinement, he would have incurred more costs and a higher bill. These are the circumstances with which we are dealing.
What strikes me about this is that it strikes at the heart of some basic freedoms and principles that we hold dear—or at least I thought we did: that people would know what they were being arrested for, charged with if they are charged and detained for. I understand that we have made changes to laws in recent times and we all anticipate further changes to laws in the name of countering terrorism—an objective with which we all agree—but the impact of those laws in terms of some of these basic freedoms and principles, civil rights and human rights, is going to be extraordinary, because if this does not even raise a whimper from Her Majesty’s opposition then we are in trouble, folks.
If the government do not want to tell me the specifics I will accept that, grudgingly, but I will accept it. If the government will not give me classified briefings on material, I do not like it but I accept it. But if they will not tell the lawyer and the individual who is being deported after getting a legal visa in the first place then something has gone wrong with our society.
This motion is basic and simple. It calls for an inquiry into these issues. It says:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
That does not entail the disclosure of certain material and information if the government so chooses, and certainly it can be in camera. There is surely some information that senators can be given so that there is some understanding. The argument must be that, if we are going to make decisions on this and debate these issues, we deserve a little more information.
As to the issues of which committee and the process that has been pursued, I do not know if I am even going to dignify that with too much comment. Suffice to say, if the Labor Party are not happy with this committee, I certainly am happy to work with them—and I am sure Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens would be too—to find an appropriate committee. I suspect that there are parliaments around the world that would find a committee. They would find a select committee or they would find a royal commission. They would do whatever has to be done in order to find out why we arrest, put in solitary confinement, deport and charge, financially speaking, a person at the heart of an issue like this and then fail to tell them and their lawyers why. I am all ready to hear the information; I am all ready to be convinced that there was an issue of a threat to national security. I am quite happy to listen to that information and presumably be satisfied by it, but what we have instead is a situation where we can pick and choose people, albeit from other countries, and deport them. We do not even have to let them in—we know that—but once they get here legally we can deport them.
There is no evidence. No-one is charged with a crime and no evidence is provided of a crime having been committed. In fact, as I understand it, when Mr Parkin returned to America the FBI was not waiting for him at the doorstep or at the airport. So we have no evidence of what this man has done or is alleged to have done, except, as has been pointed out, what we must presume is a leak to our national daily paper—on the front page, I might add—that suggests that he was going to do something—

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—Senator Brown suggests that this is reminiscent of Salem and burning witches at the stake. I think it is more reminiscent of the futuristic film Minority Report—that we are actually anticipating what people are going to do, even though we have no evidence that that was going to take place. In fact, we may arguably have evidence to the contrary.
I want an inquiry because I am not sure how else, as a citizen, let alone a legislator, I am going to be satisfied that we have not become some kind of Stasi land where people just disappear if we do not like what they are saying about us or our allies. I strongly recommend Anna Funder’s book, because it got a bit too close to the bone for me, especially in a period when we are talking about national ID cards and removing people and putting them in detention for up to 14 days without charge. Come on. We are seriously skating close to an erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country like never before and if people are kidding themselves that we do not have a problem more fool them.
So when Senator Brown talks about talking to Australians—average punters, people who care about their community, their constitution, their politics or whatever; wherever people are on that spectrum—it means that people are concerned. You listen to talkback radio, you get the emails—
—Have you once in this chamber acknowledged the war on terror?
—Yes, I had a dear friend who died in it. How dare you!

(Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Stott Despoja, I would ask you—
—Then you should—
—Senator McGauran, cease interjecting.
—Senator McGauran, will you apologise and withdraw?
—Then don’t say our—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Cease interjecting. Every other speaker in this debate has been heard in silence, and Senator Stott Despoja is entitled to—
—She should—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Do not interrupt the chair while the chair is addressing the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it would be appropriate—though I do not know whether he has the bigness to do it—for Senator McGauran to withdraw his distasteful remarks.
—Senator Brown, I do not recall precisely the remarks that Senator McGauran made, but he does recall them. I do not think that a point of order was actually raised, but I am happy to have the issue reviewed. Senator Stott Despoja has not asked for the remarks to be withdrawn, so I will rule there is no point of order.
—Thank you. Perhaps the interjection epitomises the level of this debate. How dare anyone suggest that we do not care about terrorism or the war on terror! And especially, how dare Senator McGauran make those remarks when a close friend of mine was in the World Trade Centre—but Senator McGauran knows that. It makes me all the more determined to get justice, not revenge, and in the process not let terrorism change the lives of my fellow countrymen and countrywomen.
I do not want people to be under attack. I do not want terrorists to succeed—of course not. But I do not want to lose the basic principles that I hold dear as a citizen. I genuinely believe that these rights are under attack, and any objective commentator recognises this. Of course we have to strike a balance. Of course we have to work together and be strong in the face of terrorism and fear. But we have to make clear that the things that we are fighting for—that we all agree are worth fighting for—are protected, too.
I do not know Scott Parkin from a piece of wood. I know very little about this man. What I am asking for is information and enlightenment so I as a legislator can make an informed decision on this. I have not challenged our statutory obligations under the ASIO Act. I have not suggested that the information provided to the opposition is inadequate. I think the crossbenches have the right to that information, too. As I said in the intelligence services debate yesterday, one option put forward by the Democrats is that of extending the mandate and the composition—that is, the number of representatives on the new joint standing committee on the intelligence services—to include the crossbenches.
There are questions that we need to know the answers to. We need to know why ASIO made a security assessment of American peace activist Scott Parkin based on matters relating to ‘politically motivated violence, including violent protest activity’. Are there specific guidelines? We need to know what exactly constitutes, in the eyes of the Attorney-General and others, a ‘violent protest activity’. We need to know who makes the final judgment in that process. We need to know when the Attorney-General became aware that Mr Parkin represented a serious threat to Australian national security. We need to know if Mr Parkin has acted in any way contrary to Australian laws while he has been in Australia.
If Mr Parkin posed a serious threat to national security, why was he granted a visa? He was granted a visa. Senator Brown points out that it may have been longer in the processing than otherwise you would expect. But why was a visa granted to him and then revoked without explanation? I want to know who or what prompted initial serious concerns that Mr Parkin posed or constituted a serious threat to Australian national security. I want to know when this occurred. Surely this is not all classified information. Surely our Attorney-General can inform us of some of these things.
Senator Brown talks about a leak to the Australian newspaper. I am not suggesting that the journalist should give up their source—not at all. Most of us in this place would recognise the important role that journalists play. They need that trust—that relationship—between them and their sources, from wherever they may come. I am certainly not accusing anyone of being responsible for that leak. But I want to know how that information—more information than I have been able to get my hands on—ended up in the newspaper.
In the current climate, the government acts with alacrity when they hear of a leak that may have sprung from government sources—it may be journalists; it may be public servants. Look at their methods. Look at the extent that they have gone to to investigate certain complaints. We are at the point where we have two journalists, as I understand it, facing the consequences—which may involve prison time—of not revealing their sources. So why is the government so tardy in looking into this issue? I acknowledge that the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence is looking into this issue, but that is not at the behest—as I understand it, Senator Bob Brown, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—of the government.
These are some of the questions that we have. If our laws currently as they are composed allow for this kind of unjust treatment—because until we have information to the contrary, it is unjust and un-Australian, to invoke that phrase—to happen, then I do not know what is going to be acceptable and allowable under changes that are being considered. But I will not stand idly by while these changes take place or these kinds of methods are employed by government or anyone else.
Even if the opposition feel satisfied with that classified briefing to which they have been privy, I appeal to them and say that this is line in the sand stuff. Even if you feel that your leaders have enough information, this is the time when you as legislators need to acknowledge that we all need more information. We cannot stand by and let this kind of activity take place without challenge. The Democrats will be supporting the motion before us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-10-06,"—The government opposes Senator Bob Brown’s referral of this matter to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I think we have witnessed another self-indulgent display by Senator Brown. Senator Brown is well aware that the Australian government has a longstanding practice of not revealing security information, and I am not going to get into personal comments about Mr Parkin, a United States citizen. That is why the government has expert security advisors. I also understand that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been briefed satisfactorily on this matter.
Senator Brown’s suggestion that the circumstances surrounding Mr Parkin’s deportation be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee demonstrates his ongoing disregard for the consequences of publishing security sensitive material. Senator Brown has previously demanded that ASIO provide security information to the Senate regarding the detention of this United States citizen, Scott Parkin. Senator Brown was essentially asking for details of the security assessment that formed the basis for cancelling Mr Parkin’s visa, as we have heard. Today’s motion simply seeks the same information in another way. The government is simply not about to compromise security sensitive material to make Senator Brown happy.
ASIO discharges its increasingly difficult functions in protecting the Australian community from all sorts of politically motivated violence in a highly professional and accountable manner. All our security agencies do this in a whole range of ways. ASIO is subject to scrutiny in the form of administrative, judicial and ministerial review. ASIO is also subject to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—a committee that I was very pleased to be able to serve on before I became a parliamentary secretary—and to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS.
As Senator Brown is aware, the inspector-general will be conducting an inquiry into ASIO’s involvement in Mr Parkin’s affair. I make the point, from Senator Stott Despoja’s comment, that the inspector-general does not need to investigate process or matters as instructed by the government. He has a wide-ranging remit as a statutory officer and is able to self-initiate the sorts of inquiries that he thinks are appropriate. He is totally independent, highly professional and not answerable to the government. Clearly, the inspector-general provides independent oversight of ASIO, and the inspector-general’s investigation should satisfy Senator Brown.
Very clearly, the government opposes Senator Brown’s opportunism, but this is a reminder, and the Senate should be aware, that Senator Brown will use every opportunity to take a swipe at the United States. He appears to have a burning dislike and mistrust of the United States. Luckily, it is not a view that is shared by this side of the chamber or substantially by the other side of the chamber, nor in fact by the great majority of Australians. We do not like the opportunity taken by Senator Brown to always be critical of the United States in every shape, way and form. The government opposes this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I stand to be corrected, but I suspect I am the only member of parliament amongst current members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who has been deported from a country, so I have some personal knowledge of what that means and what that experience entails. At the time, I was destined to be the next president of the National Union of South African Students, I was a strong supporter of human rights—as I still am—I supported the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and I definitely supported the right of all black people throughout Africa to have the vote, both in my own home country of Rhodesia, as it was then, and in the apartheid ruled regime of South Africa.
Of course, it is no news to the Senate that those sorts of views were regarded very unfavourably in South Africa. In fact, those who supported the National Party, which ran the South African government, commonly referred to people like me as kaffir lovers—in Afrikaans, kaffir boetjies—as liberals, which was quite interesting; as communists—een van die rooi gevaar in Afrikaans—and so on. I was not into violence. However, to the great credit of that awful regime, when they deported me, they did tell me and everybody else why they deported me, and they did make it very clear under what laws and for what reasons they were deporting me. So I think I was accorded a little more respect than Mr Parkin was in these circumstances.
In Rhodesia I was refused the right to teach children—I had intended to become a teacher—because I supported the right of people to vote. It was hard for me to make a livelihood. I and my mother were followed by the secret police, had our mail opened, had our phones tapped and so on. I suspect—as I said, I stand to be corrected—I am the only member of the present parliament who has experienced the full weight of a very ugly state apparatus.
But Rhodesia was an extraordinary place. I am also very much against those who seek to pursue their aims by violence, so I volunteered for the Rhodesian armed forces. That must have caused some consternation in some quarters, but they accepted me and I spent nine years in and out of a war in which I nearly lost my life once and in which I saw things I never want to see again. The point of that story is that you can be a great supporter of human rights and universal human values and still oppose things like the ugliness of terrorism—in my case, very identifiably and vigorously so. The two are not in contrast and those who seek to put the argument in that way do themselves and members of parliament a disservice. It is a great shame to hear that expressed in a citadel of great democracy such as the Australian parliament.
The message we need to take from the Parkin episode is manifold. But, most of all, it is that, as much as possible, you need to keep the Australian people in touch with the facts and reassure them that there is no abuse or misuse of power. The difficulty we all face in these matters is that we are asked to take matters on trust. The difficulty with that is that you get three categories of problem with taking things on trust. The first category is that of the small minority of people who lie. The second category is that of the small minority of people who are so immoral as to abuse and misuse power in a way which furthers their own ends. The third category is that of the vast majority of human beings, amongst whom I number, who make mistakes and just get it wrong.
I look at somebody like Tony Blair, for instance—he is a powerful, interesting, charismatic, forceful and strong leader in a great democracy—and see that he got it absolutely wrong. Like a number of other leaders I can think of, he said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He got it absolutely wrong. I do not necessarily put him into either of the first two categories I just outlined. The point is that if you were to accept that you should take on trust his belief, which he said was based on intelligence, you would have been misled into a war which has had immense consequences.
Do we know or are we able to know that the intelligence given surrounding Mr Parkin was accurate? My own experience in Rhodesia was that the Rhodesian intelligence forces, which were extremely adept and extremely skilled, got it entirely wrong about Mr Mugabe and how well he would do in winning an election. Intelligence is a very difficult business. I hear that the Leader of the Opposition has been given a briefing. How does he know on what basis that briefing is founded? How does he know what the foundations of it are? We are not dealing here with a person reputed to be at the centre of a vigorous bombing ring or anything—even the government does not allege that. We have not heard anything of that sort. Mr Parkin is just apparently a person of some concern to the government. That may be, but there is a problem if you do not tell us about the lower order of people and we are suspicious of your motives and reasoning, or there may be a mistake of assessment. We just do not know.
I do not know anything about Mr Parkin. I am always fearful of a state, wherever the state is and whoever the state is, that says, ‘Trust me; we always know what you don’t know and you have to trust us.’ My personal experience is that you have to be wary of that. I say to the government that, if you asked the 76 senators in this place and the 150 House of Representatives members, not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to deport people who are a threat to our country and not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to refuse entry to this country to someone who is inimical to the national interest of this country. I cannot imagine there is one such member. But I would suggest to you that if you went and took an accurate poll on conscience of every individual senator and member they would always say, ‘Tell us why.’
It does not matter that it is Senator Brown who is moving this motion. It does not matter that sometimes Senator Brown gets right up your nose and right up everybody else’s nose—including mine now and again, and I return the compliment. That is not the issue. He has raised an issue of fundamental importance and that is that in a democracy you must keep the Australian people and the Australian parliament, which represents the Australian people, properly informed. Otherwise, because people will use and abuse power and will make mistakes, you will lead on to injustices. That is not acceptable from the government, many of whom I count as good friends and good people. It is just not acceptable. I want you to take away from this debate the thought in your heads to think more carefully about this. I say to the opposition—and I make this challenge to the opposition senators—that you have got to not step backwards. If the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘Trust me, chaps—I have had a briefing, I know all about it,’ do not trust him either. You do not know if he has been conned or misled by somebody who has made a mistake in intelligence gathering or assessment. We rely on you and you have to carry the flag with us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2005-10-06,"—I rise today to support the motion that the circumstances surrounding the deportation of Scott Parkin be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am doing so because, as other speakers have said, and I am not going to go into those arguments, it is a matter of justice and fairness that the Australian people know why somebody was plucked off the street and deported from this country, with no questions asked of the rest of the community. We are standing here today asking those questions.
I was in Europe last week, and I came back through the UK on the day when an 82-year-old man was thrown out of the UK Labour Party conference because he dared to interject and say that Jack Straw was a liar after Jack Straw had said that the only reason that the British were in Iraq was to provide democracy to the Iraqi people. The old man was challenging that view because Tony Blair had said, as this government has said, that they went into Iraq over weapons of mass destruction. Another person stood up and said, ‘Leave the old man alone.’ He, too, was thrown out, and they were both detained under the new terrorism act in the UK. That old man was a refugee from Nazi Germany and had been a Labour Party member since before Tony Blair was born. That is how the terror laws are being used in the UK: to shield the government from criticism.
The crisis of confidence that is being shown here in Australia at the moment is that the Australian people have lost trust and confidence in their government. They simply do not believe them anymore. John Howard, the Prime Minister, was shown to have lied about the ‘children overboard’ affair. As to the issue of the war in Iraq, quite clearly the weapons of mass destruction were not there. Then we have the issue of the SIEVX. For a long time the government insisted that the SIEVX had gone down in international waters. And now that has been changed—quietly changed—to say, ‘These days we’re not sure where the SIEVX went down.’ That is why people in Australia are very suspicious of and have little trust in what the government do. I would also like to correct Senator Sandy Macdonald’s statement that Senator Bob Brown hates the United States.
—It is not true.
—It is not true, just as the simplistic accusation concerning the war on terror was not true. It is not the people of the United States or, indeed, the land itself; it is the actions of the Bush administration.
—If Senator Milne wishes to pick me up on things I said, I would like to raise a point of order. She accused the Prime Minister of lying. The Prime Minister does not lie. That is unparliamentary language.

(Senator Watson)—Be careful, Senator Milne, with the language that you might attribute to the Prime Minister.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—On a similar point of order to that of Senator Macdonald: I did hear Senator Milne accuse the Prime Minister of lying, thus it is worthy of a withdrawal.
—If you said that he lied, you have to withdraw that, but I am not sure that you actually said that, Senator Milne. You did use the word, but not in that particular form of words.
—I cannot recall the exact form of words, but that was clearly the intent of what I said. I withdraw it to the extent of saying that matters pertaining to the ‘children overboard’ affair showed that the Prime Minister was wrong in relation to the circumstances surrounding children being put overboard, as had been stated by the Prime Minister at the time.
I go on to say that, in the circumstances in the UK, people are shocked. Stickers have started appearing all over the UK, saying, ‘I love my country but fear my government.’ That is pretty frightening stuff in a democracy. It is pretty frightening when people are starting to lose so much confidence in their authorities that they are saying that they love their country but are becoming frightened of their government because of the excesses of power in terms of taking away people’s civil liberties. And that is the point that we are debating here today. Like other senators who have spoken, I do not know Scott Parkin, but I do know that people have basic human rights and basic civil liberties, and one of those is that, if they are plucked off the street, they have a right to be told what it is that they are accused of. Their lawyers have a right to be told what they are accused of.
I find the tawdry excuses of the Labor opposition absolutely unbelievable. It actually demonstrates the truth of what was said in recent media publications about the Labor Party not standing for anything anymore. What we have heard here is that the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had a briefing and was satisfied, and was apparently also satisfied that the person who was deported was not told why they were deported and that their lawyers were provided with no information. Apparently that is satisfactory to the Labor opposition in this country. Is not satisfactory to the Greens and it is not satisfactory to the Democrats. We want to stand here and know that people in this country are afforded justice. If we are elected as senators, the very basic things that we ought to be able to guarantee to every single Australian and every person who is here with a visa that was legally acquired are the justice they deserve, the fairness they deserve and an explanation for whatever occurs to them.
It seems to me that Mr Parkin was issued with a visa quite legally, which means that when the investigation took place about giving the visa he was not found to be a security risk. So something occurred between when he came to the country and when he was grabbed off the street that suddenly gave people the understanding that he was something of a threat to this country, even though every single thing he had said at meetings had showed that he was a peace activist and opposed to violence. The only thing that he had been talking about that may have been objectionable to the Bush administration, and hence the Howard government, is the relationship between Mr Cheney, Halliburton, the war in Iraq, the influence of oil companies and the way that certain companies like Halliburton have benefited enormously from the war in Iraq. If that poses a security risk to Australia then there is real cause for concern about what is going on. If that is not the case then the people deserve to know, or else the Scott Parkin matter is going to go into the same category as the ‘children overboard’ affair, the war in Iraq and the SIEVX. It is a basic, absolutely fundamental matter in this democracy.
I see opposition senators shaking their heads. I heard accusations of opportunism. I heard the demonisation, if you like, of people who do not agree. Suddenly we are accused of being extreme, a minority and so on. Yes, we are a minority, but we are also courageous enough to stand up for what is right. It is about time in this Senate that people did stand up and ask questions and not just go along with private briefings. If the briefing was suitable for the Leader of the Opposition, why was it not suitable for the Democrats and the Greens? It might well be that we have a healthier degree of scepticism about the explanation than the Leader of the Opposition does.
I want to put on the record my strong support for this motion. It should be going to a Senate inquiry. The government is on notice. It can vote us down here, as can the Labor Party, but the fact of the matter is that people in Australia are now unnerved by the abuse of absolute power. You have control over both houses, you can do as you like and you are doing as you like in this circumstance, with the support of the Labor Party. That is a matter of grave concern for Australians and people are feeling unnerved. Do not be surprised if people meet you in the street and say, ‘I love my country but I fear my government.’",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-06,"—Senator Milne is right when she says that people in this country are uncertain as a result of what the government has done on the issue of Scott Parkin. A week after Scott Parkin was deported by this government, on the basis of an adverse security assessment that appears to have been leaked to a government friendly journalist writing for the Australian, I received an email at my office from somebody who is planning to get married here in Australia. Like Scott Parkin, many of the guests that they have invited to their wedding are involved in the nonviolence movement in the United States. For his wedding here in Australia, this guy has invited a whole lot of peace activists from America. He sent me an email saying: ‘I’m really frightened. What do I tell them now? Do I tell my friends not to come to my wedding?’ The track record of this government is to deport somebody who is from America and who is involved in that nonviolent, peaceful action. That is where Scott Parkin comes from. The entire history of his involvement in political action has been to advocate nonviolence. So I received this email from someone living in Australia saying: ‘What do I do? Do I tell my friends not to come because what I have as an example of the way in which the government may treat them is that they may deport them?’
Scott Parkin was not only deported but also held in a cell in Melbourne for the days before he was deported. When the immigration inquiry that I am a part of was in Melbourne, it heard from one of the lawyers about the cell that Scott Parkin was held in before he was deported. It is inside a police headquarters in Melbourne. It is a cell that is usually used only for a couple of hours when people are held before they are transported elsewhere. No light comes into the cell. The lawyer, who has been involved with many people who have been held in that cell on the basis of criminal conviction, said that no light comes into it and he described it as a dungeon. That is where Scott Parkin was held. Scott Parkin was held in a dungeon—described as such by a lawyer who has had dealings with people who have been held there; he has seen the cell—and not told anything. Scott Parkin has still not been told why he was deported. His lawyers have still not been told why he was deported. The only person that the government say they are prepared to tell is the Leader of the Opposition. So they are not telling the guy or his lawyers why he was deported, but they are happy to tell the Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition then said, ‘That’s okay; you can deport Scott Parkin.’
A Scott Parkin peace lecture, which I was involved in, was held here at Parliament House. It was a nonviolence workshop like the ones that Scott Parkin had held. One of the participants in that workshop was Andrew Wilkie, the former ONA analyst. At that workshop and in his book Andrew Wilkie talked about ASIO briefings for leaders of the opposition that he has sat in on where there has been selective divulgence of information. He did not say that there had been any lying; he said that bits of information that supported the government’s case were provided to the Leader of the Opposition in those ASIO briefings and that other bits of information which did not support the government’s political case were not provided. I would be surprised if the Leader of the Opposition was not aware of the statements that Andrew Wilkie has made, but clearly the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to hear the concerns of someone who has sat in on these ASIO briefings; rather, he just takes the word of ASIO that it is okay to deport Scott Parkin. I call on the Senate to support the motion that has been moved by the Greens. We need an inquiry into why Scott Parkin was deported.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report by 25 November 2005:
The matter of overtime and shift allowances, with particular reference to:
the effectiveness of shift allowances and overtime in achieving their original purpose (i.e. enabling workers to achieve a balance between paid work and family responsibilities and to participate in their communities by discouraging employers from employing them outside or beyond normal hours);
the cost impact of shift allowances on employers who are unable to afford to operate for as long as they would like because of having to pay shift allowances;
the extent to which overtime has become a means for employers to compensate workers for low pay;
whether overtime and shift allowances are sufficiently effective in achieving their original purpose, and if not, what other measures could be adopted to achieve this objective now; and
if the payment of overtime and shift allowances ceased to be mandatory, what mechanism would be used to compensate those workers who rely on overtime as an essential part of their take home pay.
This motion is about having a Senate inquiry into penalty rates—overtime and shift allowances. It is important to note that these penalty rates were one of the first paid work-family initiatives. They were designed to discourage employers from requiring workers to work antisocial hours and to promote a good balance between paid work and family and community life. The question is: are penalty rates still achieving the original purpose of maintaining that balance between work and family and community life?
At a time when the government is overhauling the workplace relations system, it is even more important to consider this matter. This is an ideal opportunity for the Senate to look at this issue and to have an inquiry into how in the 21st century we can move forward to achieve a paid work and family balance that will genuinely help families, the community and employers.
Retaining the ideal eight-hour day is extremely important to ensure the balance between work and family and community life. We need to examine new ideas and ways for achieving the purposes for which penalty rates, overtime and shift allowances were originally designed. The government’s changes will no longer require employers to pay penalty rates. This is such an important issue that an inquiry needs to be held about getting the right balance between work and family.
The original design of penalty rates has been corrupted over a period of time so that sometimes penalty rates are used to compensate for low pay, which is an issue in itself. So, the original design, which was intended to achieve a balance between work and family, is no longer effective and, in actual fact, is sometimes being used to compensate for low pay. In highly capitalised industries, how employers pay penalty rates is not such an important issue and, therefore, it can compensate low pay as well.
Those affected are people like cleaners, who need a decent wage. They often rely on penalty rates. With the government’s potential changes, new workers or people changing jobs will find themselves potentially receiving different amounts. Small businesses will need to grapple with maybe having employees on two wages, with some getting penalty rates and some not. There may be some guarantee for those workers already receiving penalty rates, but those workers changing jobs or coming into the work force will no longer be guaranteed those allowances. So you may have this problem with small businesses grappling with having people on two different wages who are employed to do the same job. I think this would cause immense problems, even though small businesses would sometimes find that penalty rates are a disincentive for them to grow their business. I am not sure that having employees on two different types of wages will solve it. I think it would be very difficult for them to manage.
The system is broken. As I said before, the original purpose of penalty rates was to act as a disincentive for making people work antisocial hours. That is not as effective as it was originally. But, after a hundred years, I do not believe in going backwards and just removing it. I do not think that really is progress at all. In the interest of families, in the interest of the community and in the interest of small businesses and workers, as we move forward into this century, I think it is quite right that the Senate take time to look, through an inquiry, at how we can achieve the original purpose for which penalty rates were designed. We need to look at how we can move forward to make sure that we get a balance between paid work and family and community life.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-10-06,"—I indicate that the government will not be supporting this motion. We believe that the issues that Senator Fielding has quite accurately referred to are issues that are integral to the government’s industrial relations reform agenda that will be brought before the parliament in a very short period of time. They will be available for the parliament to see what the government has in mind in terms of the legislative provisions. The parliamentary consideration of those legislative provisions should await the arrival of the legislation, which I expect to be introduced into the other place in a short period of time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting Senator Fielding’s committee reference. I want to make a number of comments, both about his contribution and the indication from the government that they will be opposing this. In his comments in support of this reference, Senator Fielding reminded us of the eight-hour day, and some of the thinking behind shift allowances, penalty and overtime rates more generally, from the working family perspective. It is a perspective that, unfortunately, in today’s employment arena, has not had sufficient attention. This government has been talking, for quite a number of years now, about work and family. They have done a lot of talking on it but they really have delivered very little on an issue which is of pressing concern to the many Australians who are struggling to maintain a balance between the demands of their work and their family responsibilities and the need to actually spent time with family.
Senator Fielding referred to the eight-hour day. It is often good in this place to remember a bit of history, particularly at a time when the government seems intent on bashing anything to do with trade unions. It was trade unions in this country that first argued for an eight-hour day. One of the reasons for that was to ensure that people actually had adequate time for rest and also adequate time for their families and for their communities—something that, unfortunately, the government wants to disregard.
We support this motion. We did raise an issue with Senator Fielding about the inclusion of occupational health and safety consequences of shiftwork and overtime. Our preference would have been to have that in the motion, but certainly the motion as it stands is something we support.
This is a test for the government—one that, as Senator Ian Campbell has indicated quite clearly, they are not going to respond to in a positive way. It is part of the continuing test as to how this government uses its Senate mandate and to what extent it wants to avoid scrutiny and consideration of policy and political issues which are relevant to the Australian community. If you talk to most Australians about the issue of work and family, they do not think it is an esoteric issue. They do not think that it is an issue that is simply about a piece of legislation here or a piece of legislation there. This is about people’s lives.
It seems to us on this side of the parliament that it is a very reasonable proposition that an issue that is of such relevance to Australian workers should be considered with the fullness of a reference committee inquiry that enables a range of policy considerations to be looked at. Senator Ian Campbell’s response is, ‘We’ve got the legislation coming in.’ Senator Campbell, that is going to be an inquiry on the government’s agenda. Yes, we want that. We hope that the government will actually have a proper inquiry and will allow scrutiny of what are billed as being and are likely to be some of the most wide-ranging reforms to Australian workplaces in many years which will affect millions of Australian workers. Yes, we do want a proper inquiry into that, but we do not want an inquiry that is only on the government’s agenda. There are broader policy issues here, and policy issues which, frankly, this parliament is well behind on. We are well behind where the community is at in terms of discussion in this place and certainly in terms of government policy on the issue of work and family.
Most Australians want this to be considered and addressed. They want to have a look at how in today’s world, when many people have jobs which demand so much of their time, we can balance the various responsibilities and the various desires we have in life to spend time with family as well as to achieve a reasonable level of economic security. This is a test for the government. This is a test about whether they are prepared to be subject to scrutiny and whether they are prepared to allow this chamber, through its committee process, to engage in a consideration of policy options on issues relevant to the Australian community. As I said, this is something on which there is broad-ranging concern in the community.
One final issue I wanted to raise—and Senator Fielding raised a very good point about this—was about low-paid workers and the role that penalty rates now play in many low-paid workers’ working lives. In my previous profession, I represented quite a number of cleaners and other people in such industries. Senator Fielding is correct—and this is something the Labor Party has been saying for some time: unfortunately, we have a situation in Australia where there are some workers who are on such low hourly rates or who have such intermittent hours of work that they are forced to work longer shifts in order to get the overtime payments because they simply cannot afford not to. That is a very relevant issue. It might be an issue the government wants to duck and walk away from, particularly with its plans to undermine the minimum wage in this country, but it is a very real issue for many Australians.
So we support the inquiry. We say that if the government proceed, as they intend, to vote this down then it is simply another demonstration that they are not interested in work and family issues. Despite the government talking about it for many years and despite the Prime Minister saying, ‘This is the barbecue stopper; it’s part of our agenda,’ we have seen very little movement on it, very little policy on it and certainly very little addressing of the concerns of Australians and their families. We will also see that the government yet again does not want this chamber, through its committee process, to actually go out to the community to discuss issues which are of concern to them. It would be yet another use—or misuse, in our view—of the government’s mandate to shut down discussion, to shut down debate and to shut down inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-10-06,"—The Greens also support this motion on a committee reference, although we do have an amendment which I will put forward in a moment. We are deeply concerned about the government’s agenda for the so-called reform of the industrial relations system in this country and the impact that will have on workers and their families. My concern with this motion is that we do not believe that it articulates quite well enough the need to look at the impact of the overtime and shift provisions on employees and their families. That is why we want to amend it a bit further.
We agree that there is an urgent need to look at these issues. We believe that changes to overtime and penalty rates will impact hardest on those most disadvantaged in our community: women; younger workers; those in low-skilled, low-paid jobs. As has already been articulated in this place, many workers in lower paying jobs currently rely very heavily on overtime payments, on working late shifts, to make enough money to support their families. For some, the loss of overtime and penalty rates will be the final straw that drives them just over the line of having to default on simple things like being able to pay their mortgage. Many families do rely on these penalty rates to support them and keep them out of poverty. Workers do make the difficult choice to work night shifts, to work overtime, to work outside regular hours. That is time that they have away from their families. They make that decision—a very hard decision—in exchange for earning a bit of extra money to improve their living standards. They are now potentially being asked to give up that time and not get that additional overtime pay. They have already given up a lot to work overtime and now they are being asked to give up more.
If you look at the case of students, who are now facing such heavy bills to get their education, they are having to work overtime, night shifts and outside regular hours and do casual work so that they can support themselves in their studies. Reducing the penalty rates they receive for working outside normal hours will either mean they have to work longer hours to make the money they currently do, or they will have to give up their studies, or they will compromise their studies even further by working much longer hours.
Looking at the increase in the amount of casual work that is already happening in this country: between August 1994 and August 2003, the number of casual employees rose by 44.8 per cent while the number of full-time employees grew by only 10.8 per cent. In other words, there is a shift in our employment from full-time to casual work; therefore, a greater number of people are relying on overtime and penalty rates. These people are going to be significantly disadvantaged. There is a fallacy that Australia is the land of the long weekend. On average, Australian employees work 1,855 hours per year, compared to those in other developed countries, who work an average of 1,643. In Norway, for example, they work only an average of 1,376 hours per year. The hours that our workers in Australia work is increasing. Again, they are going to be significantly disadvantaged by the changes.
There is continual carping about the need to lower our wage bill. But, looking at the economics, the proportion of our gross domestic product spent on wages has dropped 10 per cent while the proportion of GDP taken as corporate profits has increased 10 per cent. The line being run that we need to reduce wages to make our industries and businesses more profitable is nonsense when you look at the facts. That is why we support the proposal to look at the role of overtime and shift allowances. We think it is very timely. I agree with Senator Wong that it is absolutely fundamental that we look at these changes outside the government’s proposals, because that way we can have a broader discussion. But we do think that we need to look at the effect overtime and shift allowances have on families and employees. That is why I am proposing an amendment to Senator Fielding’s motion. I move:
Omit paragraph (b), substitute:
            “(b)    the impact on employees and their families of low wages and the need to work long hours of overtime”.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-06,"—I will start with the Greens amendment to Senator Fielding’s motion. Senator Fielding’s motion is one that the Australian Democrats are happy and keen to support. We certainly think the Greens amendment to that is a worthy addition. Having said that, if it does not get up, I do not think that anything in Senator Fielding’s motion precludes a discussion or examination of the issues that have been put in the amendment by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Greens. I indicate that the Greens will have the support of the Democrats on that amendment, as I think those issues deserve consideration.
I endorse the comments that have been made by the speakers before me. However, I am disappointed at the government’s decision not to support this inquiry. It is a good inquiry. It is a basic, important inquiry that ties in with the government’s purported commitment to work and family issues and, in particular, to striving to work out some kind of work and family balance—and aren’t we all?
What is the government concerned about? Is it really a process question? The government has a raft of legislation in relation to workplace relations that we are all anticipating and some of us are very apprehensive about. This stands alone from many of the debates. Of course, work and family balance will be an integral part of the debates, but, regardless of whether or not we have access to that legislation, this issue is here and now. In fact, as people have said, it is not only timely, it is long overdue.
I make the point—and I am sure Senator Fielding understands this—that no one party in this place has a monopoly on caring for families or caring for the needs, the roles and the rights of workers and working families in Australia. I would argue that all senators in this place have a commitment to that concept. We may have differing views as to how to achieve or maintain a work and family balance, but this is a great opportunity for us to examine some specific issues.
Speakers before me have talked about some of the phenomena that we have experienced in this country. Yes, we are one of the hardest working nations on earth. We have this extraordinary experience now where, on the one hand, we have people unemployed or underemployed and, on the other hand, many workers in Australia, regardless of what workplace they are involved in, are working harder than ever before. One of the most comprehensive surveys was a research paper done by the ACTU—I think, and I will check my facts, more than a year ago—where workers were asked, ‘What do you want?’ and they said, ‘More time with family.’ It is a bit of a no-brainer. If I polled the chamber, I am pretty confident most people would say, ‘More time with family.’ I would be very concerned about those who said, ‘More time in parliament.’ It is an issue for all of us, whether we are members of parliament or whether we are working or not working.
The other issue which I want us to examine at some point in this place, because we seem to have stopped talking about it, is that of underemployment and unemployment. We seem to be accepting that five or six per cent is an acceptable target for unemployment. It is not, for a variety of reasons. We are forgetting the experiences and the difficulties of those people who are unemployed or underemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed in Australia—and the numbers are not going down; that is a significant part of our community—as well as those young people, particularly in regional, remote and rural areas, who are still experiencing incredibly high levels of unemployment. They are the issues we need to look at. Why did we stop talking about unemployment targets? Why aren’t we talking about new industries and new types of employment? Pertinent to this inquiry that Senator Fielding has suggested is the issue of casualisation which other colleagues have brought up—the high level of part-time and casual jobs, again not married with a high level of full-time, sustainable, long-term, and in many cases meaningful, jobs for Australians. These are the issues we really do need to target.
This is a specific area of debate, and an important one, but we have to remember that if we are going to talk about achieving a meaningful work and life or work and family balance, or to overcome what Dr Barbara Pocock has termed the ‘work/life collision’, then we need to examine and consider a suite of reforms. That includes looking at everything from overtime—in 2001 the Democrats proposed a fair hours fund to convert some overtime positions into jobs, and that is only one idea; France and other European countries have also looked at this—and those kinds of ideas right through to some of those supports that families want and need such as child care and parental leave. Certainly, maternity leave is a priority. All of those issues are part of the work and family debate. It is time that we had that debate. This is a small but important first step in that debate, and I commend the motion to the chamber. I hope that the government will reconsider its position, because if we are committed to debating these issues, even if we do not all agree on the solutions, and the government has indicated that it is—it is a barbecue stopper—then this is the time to vote for it. I hope this vote does not go down.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—The support the Greens have for this inquiry is in line with the very strong role that the Greens have played over more than a decade in wanting workers to get a better deal in this country where serially, under Labor and particularly in the last 10 years of Australian workplace agreements, the rights of workers and the ability of unions to defend the rights of workers have been eroded. An obvious outcome of that has been two things. Those who engage in difficult labour, such as in manufacturing and in infrastructure, often get very poorly paid whereas those who are involved in what can be called manipulation of the way in which society works—for example, trading on stock exchanges in such esoteric things as the currencies—get enormous incomes for no contribution whatever to society in terms of benefit to families or benefit to the country.
We are going from bad to worse in this direction. The loss of amenity for workers to be assured that they would be paid overtime, for example, is much greater than it appears on the face of it, simply because so many people are casualised and so many people are part-time workers. They lose not only a dinkum income but their right to adequate leave, to ensured overtime and to a whole range of rights that ought to have been theirs. We are about to see a massive further move to the extreme right, to the philosophy that the market rules—
—And women in the home.
—and, as Senator Stott Despoja says, women in the home, which is part of the extreme right philosophy that says leave it to the market and let those who have the least power—that is, the least money—be left to their own devices. In a sense, and we hear it coming from several ministers, this government’s philosophy is, ‘It is your own fault if you are working long hours and you are getting low pay; somehow or other that is your lot in life.’ It harks back to early industrial age thinking.
It is up to parliament to make and keep this a fair country, but what we are hearing from the government is that they do not want an inquiry into this—of course they do not, because the government is in the employ of the big end of town, of the big corporations, very often the big employers like the supermarket chains and the fast food outlets which do not treat their employees adequately for the work they do in ensuring these very profitable chains provide the services that they do. And who gets the profit? The already wealthy do.
We have seen serial changes to the tax operations in this country which favour the rich over the poor. We are about to see the industrial relation changes come through. What is more, the minister said, ‘No, we do not want an inquiry now; it can wait until then.’ Really? Would that be like the inquiry we saw the government afford on the Telstra legislation, which was fast-forwarded, guillotined and gagged in this Senate chamber just a couple of weeks ago when there was six hours spent on it on the Friday? No. That the government is pulling the rug from under Family First and Senator Fielding on this inquiry is indicative of the fact that it is going to push that legislation through with the minimum of inquiry.
There will be no opportunity for the community to adequately debate it, let alone time for busy workers and parents to adequately work out the impact the industrial relations changes will have on their families. Sure, the business organisations will know about it. After all, they are helping to draft the legislation. But will the average family, parent or worker who sustains this country? No, they will not. Will they have input? No, they will not. And the vote by the government today is simply thumbing its nose at Family First and saying, ‘If you want to come in and do what the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party have been doing for years in this period of government’—that is, trying to defend the right of families to get a fair go at the cake of this wealthy nation of ours—‘post election we are not going to support that.’
You have to be consistent about these things. If you are going to support the interests of families, you have to do it consistently, as the Greens do. We have had two motions this morning. One was from Senator Milne about the enormous impact that global warming is going to have on everybody, not least families. It talked about 8,000 to 15,000 Australians potentially dying each year from heat related illnesses by the end of this century. It also talked about dengue reaching as far south as Sydney. That is breakbone fever. The motion also states ‘climate change is likely to exacerbate poverty and may lead to large scale population displacement throughout the Asia Pacific region’. The motion sensibly called on the government to do a number of things which governments elsewhere are already doing to defend families—our grandchildren—in this country from that awesome impact. Senator Fielding and Family First voted against that motion. I do not understand how that could be.
Senator Siewert’s motion calls for Australian servicepeople to be protected from depleted uranium munitions used by the US in such things as joint training exercises. Depleted uranium is a dangerous material which impacts on the health of servicepeople. It changes their whole lives. We ought to ensure that our defence personnel are not exposed to depleted uranium. But what did Senator Fielding do? He voted against that motion. There may be some explanation for this. I do not understand it.
A few weeks ago, Senator Milne moved for a family impact statement on the privatisation of Telstra, which we know is going to have not only an impact on communications but also a financial impact on every family in this country. Where was the family impact statement? Not only did the Senate not get the family impact statement but Family First and Senator Fielding voted against the Greens motion to have that statement here before the legislation was dealt with. They voted against it.
The question here is: where is the philosophy of Family First? It resides with the Greens and with the other parties on this side of the House. Senator Fielding may be sitting on the other side of the parliament, and he is getting dudded on this motion today, but if you were to ask where the consistency is in a presentation of the interests of families I would say it is manifestly missing. It is not just slipshod; it is erratic and unable to be defined. Already in the short time that Family First has been in this parliament, it has voted against the interests of families in this country. So it is good to see a motion coming forward which, on the face of it, is to inquire into the impact on families—although it has been left to Senator Siewert to move an amendment which specifically gets down to that impact.
Senator Siewert’s amendment is that the inquiry should look at ‘the impact on employees and their families of low wages and the need to work long hours of overtime’. It is a very specific amendment which says, ‘Let’s look at what these changes are going to mean for families.’ Let us be straight about it, if that is our intent—and, indeed, it is the intent here. It is an important amendment. It concentrates the mind of the proposed inquiry clearly on the impact on families of the very clear fact that in this country—even before the industrial relations package we are about to see—families are being disrupted and driven into poverty. There is a growing gap between the power and the money of the haves and the disempowerment and the lack of money of the have nots, and the lack of ability to get union backing, because of laws that have already gone through the parliament—the disability of the disempowered and the poor to have a fair say in what goes on.
It is a commendable motion from Senator Fielding. It will be improved by the amendment of Senator Siewert, but the government stands indicted through its refusal to have this inquiry. We are on course to see the government cut across the necessary public debate in the industrial relations field with the legislation that is about to be dumped on this parliament and, again, gagged and guillotined through here in the coming weeks. That is how this government operates. The fact is that the government has the numbers. It is going to be a very complex suite of legislation. If the government were supporting Senator Fielding’s motion, it would put some doubt in the asseveration that the government is going to dump the legislation on the Senate, dump it on the House of Representatives, dump it on the parliament and put it through with a minimum of investigation. But it is not.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-10-06,"—Under standing order 191, I make it quite clear that Senator Brown has misrepresented, misquoted and quite clearly misunderstood what I said in my speech. By his very words and his reference to his colleague’s amendment to Senator Fielding’s motion—he refers to the impact of the government’s legislation on families—he seeks to make my case. That was simply and clearly that the matters that Senator Fielding refers to—and this is what I said in my speech which has been misunderstood or misquoted and, I would say, misrepresented—
—Is this a speech or a point of order?
—I refer you to standing order 191. Standing order 191 specifically allows a senator to get to his or her feet and make an explanation of a speech where he or she has been misquoted or misunderstood. I have been misquoted and I do not intend allowing Senator Brown to verbal me on two occasions on the one day. Previously he said that I regularly read speeches. I think the last speech I read in this chamber was actually on 16 May 1990.
In relation to Senator Fielding’s motion, I made the very clear point that there is a lot of merit—and the government will vote in accordance with that merit—in waiting for the industrial relations legislation to be here. Senator Brown chose to misquote me on this. I also suggest, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you look closely at what Senator Brown said in his speech about reflecting on votes on two or three entirely unrelated issues. It was an attack on Senator Fielding’s voting record. Mr Acting Deputy President, I think you will find it is in contravention of standing order 193—reflecting on a vote of the Senate.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Campbell is addressing the Senate under standing order 191. Clearly he has gone way outside the realms of that standing order and is now introducing new debatable matters into the debate. That is inappropriate and you should bring him to order.

(Senator Watson)—Senator Campbell, you have a right to raise your concern but you do not have a right to debate it. I think Senator Marshall is concerned that perhaps you are now debating the issue.
—I think Senator Marshall has a good point. I think I should sit down under standing order 191. I have stuck to the standing order.
—Senator Ian Campbell.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I now rise on a point of order. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to look very closely at standing order 193, which says that senators should not reflect on any vote of the Senate. I think you will find, if you read Senator Bob Brown’s contribution, that although he sought to make a political attack on Senator Fielding, by reflecting on how Senator Fielding voted on a number of other Greens motions this morning or in recent times, in fact what Senator Brown was doing was reflecting on a vote of the Senate. I ask that you and perhaps the President look closely at Senator Brown’s contribution to the debate and see whether he was in fact breaching standing order 193. I do not seek an immediate ruling on that.
—On the same point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: I would not normally recommend a move that is going to waste your time, but I think I would support Senator Ian Campbell’s move that you do look at what I had to say, because you will find that it was entirely within standing orders and quite proper.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-10-06,"—I would like to sum up but, before I do, I want to say that I have had some conversation with Senator Siewert about her amendment to the motion.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Before Senator Fielding sums up and the debate is closed, I would like to indicate our position on the amendment. We are happy to support the Greens amendment from this side of the chamber. I want to make two comments about Senator Ian Campbell’s contributions. If the government are going to vote this down and not allow this matter to go to inquiry, will the minister give an indication as to the type, scope et cetera of inquiry the government will be permitting on their wide-ranging industrial relations legislation? In particular, if the government vote this down, are they going to give an undertaking today—because they say, ‘We are voting this down because we’re going to have another inquiry’—
—I didn’t say that. You should listen to what I said.
—As I understood you, Senator Campbell—and I am happy to go back—the government’s position is that you are going to oppose this motion because you are going to have an inquiry into the industrial relations legislation.
—No. I said that twice.
—Okay. That is fine. Can we make it clear that, on the industrial relations legislation, which is going to have a wide-ranging impact on millions of Australian workers, the government is not going to give an undertaking to have an inquiry, nor will it give an undertaking it will not have another Telstra debacle style inquiry of a single day to inquire into legislation that is very important—
—That was on a vote of the Senate. You are reflecting on the Senate.
—Senator Abetz is making another contribution. Is the government going to give an undertaking it will allow a proper inquiry into the industrial relations legislation?
—It’s up to the Senate.
—Perhaps if you could stop interrupting, Minister Abetz, we might actually finish this debate. Is the government going to give an undertaking—
—Why don’t you address your remarks through the Acting Deputy President? You are in breach of standing orders.
—Are you going to shout at me for the entirety of this debate?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: the opposition senator on her feet is staring across the table and asking me questions. There is a fundamental rule of debate in this place that actually makes it work—that is, that the remarks of a senator need to be addressed to the chair and through the chair. If senators do not want interjections, they should not stare across at the front bench of the government and ask questions directly of ministers, which, quite frankly, intuitively invite me to respond by way of interjection. I would be happy to seek your call when the senator resumes her seat, but she cannot have it both ways.

(Senator Watson)—I would ask Senator Wong to address the chair but, at the same time, I say: all interjections are disorderly.
—I am very happy to address my remarks through the chair. I did not realise the government was so concerned about scrutiny that Senator Campbell would get so sensitive about me looking at him during the debate and saying that perhaps he should give an undertaking. He might take a point of order about me looking at him, but he is quite happy to have Minister Abetz and himself interject on the opposition when we are putting a point of view.
There is a very simple proposition: Senator Fielding is seeking an inquiry into overtime and shift allowances, a matter that goes to the heart of the work and family balance that has broad support across every party in this chamber except the government. The government have indicated they do not want this inquiry. They made reference to the industrial relations legislation they are proposing to bring into this place shortly. What I am asking is: if the government vote this down because they say their legislation is coming in, will the government give an undertaking that their industrial relations legislation, which will impact on millions of Australian workers and their families, will be the subject of a proper inquiry by this Senate before it is voted on? If the government do not in the context of this vote give that undertaking, it will be very clear to everyone in this chamber and to the Australian community that this government do not want scrutiny of their radical industrial relations agenda.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-10-06,"—This is an important issue—and I think we should get back to the core of it—for Australians and it is an important issue for Family First. It has great impact on families and small businesses. Each senator would know how important family and work balance is, and I do not think we should be paying lip-service to such an important inquiry. Regardless of the legislation that may be coming through, this is an issue of the day that needs quality time spent on it.
We hear a lot about family and work-life balance. The Australian Institute of Family Studies revealed that financial affairs are important in people’s consideration of having children. The institute also found that male partners’ jobs and job security are key concerns. Issues about penalty rates will impact a lot of Australians and Australian families, and this is a very big concern. Some workers are forced by economic circumstances to rely on penalty rates. They rely on them to boost their home pay and to make ends meet. The concern about whether penalty rates may or may not be there in the future will impact negatively upon families.
The whole issue about penalty rates is being raised because the original design of that issue has been corrupted today. This is a concern about making sure that we have got the right work and family balance. The eight-hour day is important, and we want to make sure that moving forward we look at this issue and give it due time and consideration. I ask each senator as they think about this issue in the coming minutes to really think about this: are they paying this nation and the Senate total regard when they look at how they vote on this particular issue? I appeal to the government to look at this issue and vote for this motion, as it gets to the heart of the issue about getting a good work and family balance.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—Briefly on this issue, in one way—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: chances are leave might be granted, but I thought Senator Fielding had closed the debate.
—by leave—I think Senator Fielding now realises his motion is going to go down. Firstly, I want to make the point that the issues of family and work that he is concerned with can be picked up on the current Democrat initiated inquiry into agreement making. I would urge him and any of his constituency to make submissions to that inquiry. Secondly, I am advised that the government will agree to an inquiry into the workplace bills that are coming up and I would assume that that will be a proper, not a clayton’s, inquiry. We should follow up this issue with these matters being fully addressed in that forum. But it is an important lesson you are learning here, Senator Fielding: the government will decide what is in the government’s interest and it is not sympathetic to the views you are expressing.

(Senator Forshaw)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.
A division having being called and the bells being rung—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I suggest that you call the division off.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
The Senate ought not to let go the way in which Mr Parkin was arrested and deported from our country. I will briefly go through the facts of the matter. Mr Parkin, who I understand is a 33-year-old American citizen, has been a long-time advocate for the peaceful resolution of human affairs. He is opposed to war. He is opposed to violence. He is very much in favour of the resolution of our differences around the world through peaceful means. As such, he is in the tradition of Martin Luther King, the great American peace advocate and achiever of civil liberties for the American people, and, before that, Mahatma Gandhi and, indeed, right to back to HD Thoreau in the United States in the 1840s.
As part of his advocacy he has been opposed to the illegal invasion of Iraq and the motivation for that invasion. He has talked quite a deal about those who stood to gain, not least Halliburton, the huge US corporation and armaments manufacturer which is making billions of dollars out of the invasion and occupation of Iraq. The former CEO of Halliburton is now the Vice-President of the United States. He is the deputy to George W Bush—that is, Mr Dick Cheney. There is no doubt that Scott Parkin has been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration and Halliburton and its former CEO.
Mr Parkin came to Australia. He was granted a visa. There was some delay, but he was given a visa after all the due vetting by the Australian authorities. He attended a protest outside the Opera House. It was a gathering of the rich in the name of the Forbes corporation, and it included some US business interests. He went on to have talks with Australians interested in peace and global affairs, and he set up some further talks about peace, what it really means and, of course, the fact that it needs to be understrapped by a much fairer world. I am given to believe that about a week before he was arrested he was called by ASIO and asked to undertake an interview. I am also given to believe that he asked if this was necessary and was told, ‘No, it’s not.’ It was a voluntary thing, so he declined and went about his peaceful organisation. Then one Saturday, the Federal Police arrived and Mr Parkin was arrested. Within days he was deported, his visa having been withdrawn.
A number of important questions arise here, of course. How could it be that, in our democracy where our Prime Minister goes around the world—very often hand-in-hand with President George W Bush—advocating democracy and liberty, somebody who advocates peace in a tradition that goes back beyond Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago could be arrested in our country and deported with no other explanation to the public? How could that be, particularly in view of the fact that the Australian government had given him a visa just some weeks before?
I have a theory—because you have to look for some explanation—and that is that the Bush administration does not like Mr Parkin. For some reason, it did not get engaged fast enough but did get involved in the publicity that Mr Parkin was generating in Australia; maybe the US embassy picked up on that and did not like it. And, in communication with the government of our Prime Minister John Howard, the Bush administration decided that his visa should be withdrawn—and this is an Australian visa, not an American visa—and that he should be sent back to America. The consequent impact will very likely be, of course, that Mr Parkin will have a record—not for anything he has done, but because of these government moves—which will make it difficult for him to get visas to travel to other countries as well.
At least I know this: there is no way an American citizen would be deported from our country, under this government, without extensive consultations between Washington and Canberra, between the Bush administration and the Howard prime ministerial office. That means, of course, that both Prime Minister Howard and President Bush approved of this American having his visa withdrawn and being deported under these circumstances.
Consequent to Mr Parkin’s deportation, we awoke one morning to find a story on the front page of the Australian newspaper, which is so often the recipient of information from the government that the government wants to put out into the public arena. The story alleged that Mr Parkin had been deported because he was going to—not because he had, but because he was going to—make statements or encourage people to roll marbles under the hooves of horses in protests in Australia and, indeed, give techniques by which people who were arrested by the police could be taken out of custody.
There are a couple of problems with this ASIO information, which stood uncontested on the front page of the Australian newspaper. The first is that Mr Parkin has never advocated anything remotely like that. In fact, it is contrary to what he has advocated consistently in his pursuit of peaceful means for human beings to interact with each other. The second is that, when he was questioned about this, having been deported with a security officer on either side of him in the plane crossing the Pacific and then furnished with a bill for $11,000 by the Australian government, in the consequent interview he made it very clear that not only had he never advocated such things but that he never would. He is opposed to any form of gratuitous animal cruelty, and ditto to affronting the police in the way that was advocated. I point out again that the accusation was not that he had advocated such things—and it appears an ASIO operative or informant must have been at some of the meetings, and public meetings at that, that he had been attending in Australia—but that he was going to.
What country are we in? Surely the Inquisition is behind us. Surely the Salem witchcraft trials were some centuries ago. Surely Joan of Arc was put to the stake before our own more enlightened times. Even the McCarthy period of the 1950s in the United States at its apogee, we had hoped, had gone back into history. But no; in the year 2005, this peaceful man, advocating peace in our peace-loving democracy, is picked up in a police state operation, has his visa removed—by decision of the Attorney-General, effectively: the chief law-maker of this country—and is deported, his rights taken away without any due reason being given at all.
And then we see a fit-up, a false track from ASIO, appear on the front page of a newspaper, to try to justify that which is not only unjustifiable but which must be totally repugnant to any person who believes in a fair go in this country. This is the Howard government, in cahoots with the Bush administration, showing what it can do under the laws it wants to bring in in this country in the name of security. It can take away the rights of a peace activist, for goodness sake, on political grounds.
What happened here was that a political decision was made by Prime Minister Howard and by the chief law-maker of this country, the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, acting as a court. With no evidence extant, with no ability for the defendant to defend his position—indeed, with no charge; certainly with no legal representation or cross-examination—he was found guilty, sentenced and deported.
These are all the hallmarks of a police state activity. We must not be frightened of saying that, because that is what it is. If we are going to defend the rule of law—but, more particularly, justice—in this country then we have to confront injustice when we see it, particularly politically motivated injustice by a government which dominates both houses of the parliament. We have to be fearless in doing that.
Here is the Greens motion saying: let us have an inquiry into this matter. Let us get the ministers and the representatives to come forward and put their point of view. Let us have ASIO explain to senators—in camera if necessary if there is some national security factor at stake here—before a Senate inquiry, because Senate inquiries are so important as a watchdog on the government.
But there are two problems. The first is that the government is going to vote against it because it has got the numbers in this place. The second is that the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, sought an ASIO briefing on the arrest and deportation of Mr Parkin and after that briefing said publicly that he agreed with the government’s actions and no further explanation was required. Incidentally, I made a request for the same briefing and was refused. That is a government decision, but it is an absolute affront that any member of parliament should be refused such a briefing; we are all elected equal into this parliament by the people of Australia. When matters as important as this are at stake the justification should be forthcoming and, if it is going to be in camera, let it be so. I am no less capable of recognising the security of this country, which I love, than are Mr Beazley, Mr Howard, Mr Ruddock or anybody else. The very fact that I was denied that briefing indicates that the government does not and cannot stand by the decision that it took.
My understanding is that the opposition is not going to support this inquiry either. That is not just a pity; it is a failure by the Labor opposition and in particular by the Leader of the Opposition, who took the decision to support the Howard government in deporting Mr Parkin and to stand by that decision. Here are the two big parties saying: ‘We will make these decisions in camera, out of public view, and we will not have them inquired into by our fellow senators. We do not want them to look in behind this curtain where these decisions are being made.’ I put it to you, Acting Deputy President Forshaw, those decisions were wrong, cannot be justified and are an affront to the justice system that we hold dear in this country. I cannot believe that Labor is not going to support this motion. I cannot believe it. But there we have it. So the constructive opposition on this matter is left to the crossbench and to the Greens in moving this motion. Thank God we are here.
Everywhere I have been in the country in the last couple of weeks people have come up to me and said: ‘How could this happen in our country? How could this peace activist from the United States, of all places, be denied such a comprehensive range of rights?’ The answer is: it cannot be justified and it must not be allowed. Who is next to be removed from our midst because the government politically disagrees with them? Who is next on the Prime Minister’s list of people he does not want around in our country because they do not fit to his political comfort? This is very dangerous.
Of course we can all say: ‘No, we cannot have what happens in other countries happening in Australia. We are different—we are in some way superior in our ethics and a bulwark of democracy and justice to other people elsewhere around the world.’ That in itself is a grand mistake. We do have a parliament here which is a watchdog on executive government and which must be strong in using those watchdog powers. But I suspect today that that is going to be left to the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats, and that must be a worry in itself.
This is an extremely important motion. It is asking for an inquiry. It is not a motion to say, ‘Bring Scott Parkin back to Australia; pay his $11,000 debt; give a public explanation as to why he was deported on a farrago of misinformation and concocted claims.’ No, this is a motion to say, ‘Let us inquire into those things. Let us see if Senator Brown is wrong and that there is some other information out there that we do not know about.’ A Senate inquiry can look at that. If there is some security reason that it cannot come into the public arena, a Senate committee can deal with that in camera. It is a very important inquiry. It is a very important motion. I appeal again to the Labor Party to support it—and to the government for that matter. If they are right, support this for goodness sake.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Senator Brown is clear on what the Labor Party’s position is in respect of this matter. We are not going to support the reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee that he has proposed. Senator Brown has ranged widely over the issue, but I am not going to deal substantively with it, because, in principle, what we have before us is procedural in that it is a proposal for a reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee, as Senator Brown knows, has a chair and deputy chair. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has spoken to the deputy chair, but I am aware that he has not spoken to the chair about bringing a reference forward. The usual process that people in this place adopt is to consult with the minister and, usually, the shadow minister of the particular area, and with either the chair or deputy chair, or both, to get references up. It is not easy to get references up in this place, as Senator Brown clearly knows. At the end of the day he may have been unsuccessful even if he had gone through those processes. But I am unaware of whether or not he has.
The other question of course is whether or not the Legal and Constitutional References Committee is the appropriate committee to in fact deal with the issue. There is a joint committee, the ASIO-DSD committee, which could deal with this issue in a more practical manner. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has written to that committee and asked them to look into the matter. That committee is equipped to deal with these sorts of security sensitive issues. I think the Labor Party made the point last time Senator Brown moved a motion in respect of a similar matter that we did not think it was appropriate, and we have concluded again that it is not appropriate that references be sent to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee about such matters.
Also, Senator Brown will have the opportunity to ventilate this matter in estimates, which is coming up shortly, when ASIO appears as an agency. Senator Brown can pursue the matter at that time, and see how far he can progress it. The difficulty he will strike is that a references committee is usually used for a wide-ranging inquiry into a more general matter. They usually take submissions on and deal with particularly broad issues and then produce a report. From listening to his submission it appears that Senator Brown is asking for a rather short, sharp examination of ASIO, perhaps in camera. The difficulty that I suspect he will find is that ASIO may or may not provide the information he requests, in which case it would become a moot point as to whether or not the references committee would in fact advance Senator Brown’s arguments or produce the information that he is seeking. If Senator Brown has been unsuccessful in obtaining a briefing from ASIO I suggest that an alternative is to pursue reference of the matter for inquiry by letter to the relevant committee. That may or not provide him with any joy.
As happened last time in relation to a similar matter, Labor has requested and received a briefing, as correctly pointed out by Senator Brown. Our leader, Mr Kim Beazley, and the shadow minister for homeland security, Mr Arch Bevis, received a briefing in relation to the Scott Parkin matter. As a consequence of having received those briefings, Labor does not support the details of sensitive security operations being disclosed in an open forum. The difficulty of holding a references committee inquiry is of course that it could end up with ASIO informing the committee that it was not prepared to provide information in either an open forum or in camera. Unfortunately, as Senator Brown knows, in camera evidence, once provided, can be released by individual senators. We are all aware that that can happen sometimes—although I know that Senator Brown would not do that in any event—and my guess is that that would bear on ASIO’s ability to provide information. It might be the case that it would provide it to the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and that is a matter that you could explore. But, in terms of the direction that you are seeking to take today, Labor does not think that it should be supported in the way that Senator Brown has gone about it. So we will not be supporting the motion, as I have said. The matter that you have aired is obviously a matter of concern to you, and we encourage you to take every available opportunity to pursue it in the way that you wish to. Labor has pursued it in the way that we have decided to. We have received private briefings and we are satisfied with those private briefings.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-06,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as spokesperson for matters concerning the Attorney-General and foreign affairs, to support the motion before us. In the last 15 minutes I have become incredibly conscious of the basic and fundamental rights and freedoms that I think we as Australians, and those people who visit our country, should enjoy. I feel as though they have died away. My wrath, while directed so strongly at the government, today finds another home with the Labor opposition. It is extraordinary that any spokesperson would suggest that the Democrats apply for or get a briefing. There is no statutory obligation to inform or brief members of the crossbenches on an issue of so-called national security such as this, on a security threat or indeed on an issue of national interest, which I believe this issue is. If we break this matter down to the basics, Senator Brown is asking for us to know as a parliament—that is, as representatives of the people of Australia—what happened. Why was Scott Parkin deported? The government and the opposition do not want to tell us that. I am the first to acknowledge that there is information and classified briefings that should not necessarily be available to all members of parliament or indeed to the community at large. I accept that. But, even if you will not tell us, why won’t you tell the person who was deported? That is the extraordinary thing here, and it amounts to an absolute abuse of basic human rights. People might disrespect or dismiss this issue because it does not involve an Australian citizen. But surely they still believe that the person at the heart of this scandal has the right to know why his visa was revoked or, if he does not, that perhaps his legal representatives have the right to know.
We have revoked a visa that was legally and appropriately obtained in the first place, as I understand it. We have arrested a man, thrown him into jail and into solitary confinement, deported him, given him a bill for the pleasure, failed to tell him why and then encouraged him, as I understand it, not to challenge the reasons for the revocation of that visa—that is, the implication was, ‘If you don’t challenge this, you’ll be deported faster.’ Of course, at the time you would have presumed that leaving faster was not an unsatisfactory outcome because, if Mr Parkin had stayed any longer, albeit in solitary confinement, he would have incurred more costs and a higher bill. These are the circumstances with which we are dealing.
What strikes me about this is that it strikes at the heart of some basic freedoms and principles that we hold dear—or at least I thought we did: that people would know what they were being arrested for, charged with if they are charged and detained for. I understand that we have made changes to laws in recent times and we all anticipate further changes to laws in the name of countering terrorism—an objective with which we all agree—but the impact of those laws in terms of some of these basic freedoms and principles, civil rights and human rights, is going to be extraordinary, because if this does not even raise a whimper from Her Majesty’s opposition then we are in trouble, folks.
If the government do not want to tell me the specifics I will accept that, grudgingly, but I will accept it. If the government will not give me classified briefings on material, I do not like it but I accept it. But if they will not tell the lawyer and the individual who is being deported after getting a legal visa in the first place then something has gone wrong with our society.
This motion is basic and simple. It calls for an inquiry into these issues. It says:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
That does not entail the disclosure of certain material and information if the government so chooses, and certainly it can be in camera. There is surely some information that senators can be given so that there is some understanding. The argument must be that, if we are going to make decisions on this and debate these issues, we deserve a little more information.
As to the issues of which committee and the process that has been pursued, I do not know if I am even going to dignify that with too much comment. Suffice to say, if the Labor Party are not happy with this committee, I certainly am happy to work with them—and I am sure Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens would be too—to find an appropriate committee. I suspect that there are parliaments around the world that would find a committee. They would find a select committee or they would find a royal commission. They would do whatever has to be done in order to find out why we arrest, put in solitary confinement, deport and charge, financially speaking, a person at the heart of an issue like this and then fail to tell them and their lawyers why. I am all ready to hear the information; I am all ready to be convinced that there was an issue of a threat to national security. I am quite happy to listen to that information and presumably be satisfied by it, but what we have instead is a situation where we can pick and choose people, albeit from other countries, and deport them. We do not even have to let them in—we know that—but once they get here legally we can deport them.
There is no evidence. No-one is charged with a crime and no evidence is provided of a crime having been committed. In fact, as I understand it, when Mr Parkin returned to America the FBI was not waiting for him at the doorstep or at the airport. So we have no evidence of what this man has done or is alleged to have done, except, as has been pointed out, what we must presume is a leak to our national daily paper—on the front page, I might add—that suggests that he was going to do something—

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—Senator Brown suggests that this is reminiscent of Salem and burning witches at the stake. I think it is more reminiscent of the futuristic film Minority Report—that we are actually anticipating what people are going to do, even though we have no evidence that that was going to take place. In fact, we may arguably have evidence to the contrary.
I want an inquiry because I am not sure how else, as a citizen, let alone a legislator, I am going to be satisfied that we have not become some kind of Stasi land where people just disappear if we do not like what they are saying about us or our allies. I strongly recommend Anna Funder’s book, because it got a bit too close to the bone for me, especially in a period when we are talking about national ID cards and removing people and putting them in detention for up to 14 days without charge. Come on. We are seriously skating close to an erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country like never before and if people are kidding themselves that we do not have a problem more fool them.
So when Senator Brown talks about talking to Australians—average punters, people who care about their community, their constitution, their politics or whatever; wherever people are on that spectrum—it means that people are concerned. You listen to talkback radio, you get the emails—
—Have you once in this chamber acknowledged the war on terror?
—Yes, I had a dear friend who died in it. How dare you!

(Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Stott Despoja, I would ask you—
—Then you should—
—Senator McGauran, cease interjecting.
—Senator McGauran, will you apologise and withdraw?
—Then don’t say our—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Cease interjecting. Every other speaker in this debate has been heard in silence, and Senator Stott Despoja is entitled to—
—She should—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Do not interrupt the chair while the chair is addressing the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it would be appropriate—though I do not know whether he has the bigness to do it—for Senator McGauran to withdraw his distasteful remarks.
—Senator Brown, I do not recall precisely the remarks that Senator McGauran made, but he does recall them. I do not think that a point of order was actually raised, but I am happy to have the issue reviewed. Senator Stott Despoja has not asked for the remarks to be withdrawn, so I will rule there is no point of order.
—Thank you. Perhaps the interjection epitomises the level of this debate. How dare anyone suggest that we do not care about terrorism or the war on terror! And especially, how dare Senator McGauran make those remarks when a close friend of mine was in the World Trade Centre—but Senator McGauran knows that. It makes me all the more determined to get justice, not revenge, and in the process not let terrorism change the lives of my fellow countrymen and countrywomen.
I do not want people to be under attack. I do not want terrorists to succeed—of course not. But I do not want to lose the basic principles that I hold dear as a citizen. I genuinely believe that these rights are under attack, and any objective commentator recognises this. Of course we have to strike a balance. Of course we have to work together and be strong in the face of terrorism and fear. But we have to make clear that the things that we are fighting for—that we all agree are worth fighting for—are protected, too.
I do not know Scott Parkin from a piece of wood. I know very little about this man. What I am asking for is information and enlightenment so I as a legislator can make an informed decision on this. I have not challenged our statutory obligations under the ASIO Act. I have not suggested that the information provided to the opposition is inadequate. I think the crossbenches have the right to that information, too. As I said in the intelligence services debate yesterday, one option put forward by the Democrats is that of extending the mandate and the composition—that is, the number of representatives on the new joint standing committee on the intelligence services—to include the crossbenches.
There are questions that we need to know the answers to. We need to know why ASIO made a security assessment of American peace activist Scott Parkin based on matters relating to ‘politically motivated violence, including violent protest activity’. Are there specific guidelines? We need to know what exactly constitutes, in the eyes of the Attorney-General and others, a ‘violent protest activity’. We need to know who makes the final judgment in that process. We need to know when the Attorney-General became aware that Mr Parkin represented a serious threat to Australian national security. We need to know if Mr Parkin has acted in any way contrary to Australian laws while he has been in Australia.
If Mr Parkin posed a serious threat to national security, why was he granted a visa? He was granted a visa. Senator Brown points out that it may have been longer in the processing than otherwise you would expect. But why was a visa granted to him and then revoked without explanation? I want to know who or what prompted initial serious concerns that Mr Parkin posed or constituted a serious threat to Australian national security. I want to know when this occurred. Surely this is not all classified information. Surely our Attorney-General can inform us of some of these things.
Senator Brown talks about a leak to the Australian newspaper. I am not suggesting that the journalist should give up their source—not at all. Most of us in this place would recognise the important role that journalists play. They need that trust—that relationship—between them and their sources, from wherever they may come. I am certainly not accusing anyone of being responsible for that leak. But I want to know how that information—more information than I have been able to get my hands on—ended up in the newspaper.
In the current climate, the government acts with alacrity when they hear of a leak that may have sprung from government sources—it may be journalists; it may be public servants. Look at their methods. Look at the extent that they have gone to to investigate certain complaints. We are at the point where we have two journalists, as I understand it, facing the consequences—which may involve prison time—of not revealing their sources. So why is the government so tardy in looking into this issue? I acknowledge that the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence is looking into this issue, but that is not at the behest—as I understand it, Senator Bob Brown, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—of the government.
These are some of the questions that we have. If our laws currently as they are composed allow for this kind of unjust treatment—because until we have information to the contrary, it is unjust and un-Australian, to invoke that phrase—to happen, then I do not know what is going to be acceptable and allowable under changes that are being considered. But I will not stand idly by while these changes take place or these kinds of methods are employed by government or anyone else.
Even if the opposition feel satisfied with that classified briefing to which they have been privy, I appeal to them and say that this is line in the sand stuff. Even if you feel that your leaders have enough information, this is the time when you as legislators need to acknowledge that we all need more information. We cannot stand by and let this kind of activity take place without challenge. The Democrats will be supporting the motion before us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-10-06,"—The government opposes Senator Bob Brown’s referral of this matter to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I think we have witnessed another self-indulgent display by Senator Brown. Senator Brown is well aware that the Australian government has a longstanding practice of not revealing security information, and I am not going to get into personal comments about Mr Parkin, a United States citizen. That is why the government has expert security advisors. I also understand that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been briefed satisfactorily on this matter.
Senator Brown’s suggestion that the circumstances surrounding Mr Parkin’s deportation be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee demonstrates his ongoing disregard for the consequences of publishing security sensitive material. Senator Brown has previously demanded that ASIO provide security information to the Senate regarding the detention of this United States citizen, Scott Parkin. Senator Brown was essentially asking for details of the security assessment that formed the basis for cancelling Mr Parkin’s visa, as we have heard. Today’s motion simply seeks the same information in another way. The government is simply not about to compromise security sensitive material to make Senator Brown happy.
ASIO discharges its increasingly difficult functions in protecting the Australian community from all sorts of politically motivated violence in a highly professional and accountable manner. All our security agencies do this in a whole range of ways. ASIO is subject to scrutiny in the form of administrative, judicial and ministerial review. ASIO is also subject to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—a committee that I was very pleased to be able to serve on before I became a parliamentary secretary—and to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS.
As Senator Brown is aware, the inspector-general will be conducting an inquiry into ASIO’s involvement in Mr Parkin’s affair. I make the point, from Senator Stott Despoja’s comment, that the inspector-general does not need to investigate process or matters as instructed by the government. He has a wide-ranging remit as a statutory officer and is able to self-initiate the sorts of inquiries that he thinks are appropriate. He is totally independent, highly professional and not answerable to the government. Clearly, the inspector-general provides independent oversight of ASIO, and the inspector-general’s investigation should satisfy Senator Brown.
Very clearly, the government opposes Senator Brown’s opportunism, but this is a reminder, and the Senate should be aware, that Senator Brown will use every opportunity to take a swipe at the United States. He appears to have a burning dislike and mistrust of the United States. Luckily, it is not a view that is shared by this side of the chamber or substantially by the other side of the chamber, nor in fact by the great majority of Australians. We do not like the opportunity taken by Senator Brown to always be critical of the United States in every shape, way and form. The government opposes this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I stand to be corrected, but I suspect I am the only member of parliament amongst current members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who has been deported from a country, so I have some personal knowledge of what that means and what that experience entails. At the time, I was destined to be the next president of the National Union of South African Students, I was a strong supporter of human rights—as I still am—I supported the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and I definitely supported the right of all black people throughout Africa to have the vote, both in my own home country of Rhodesia, as it was then, and in the apartheid ruled regime of South Africa.
Of course, it is no news to the Senate that those sorts of views were regarded very unfavourably in South Africa. In fact, those who supported the National Party, which ran the South African government, commonly referred to people like me as kaffir lovers—in Afrikaans, kaffir boetjies—as liberals, which was quite interesting; as communists—een van die rooi gevaar in Afrikaans—and so on. I was not into violence. However, to the great credit of that awful regime, when they deported me, they did tell me and everybody else why they deported me, and they did make it very clear under what laws and for what reasons they were deporting me. So I think I was accorded a little more respect than Mr Parkin was in these circumstances.
In Rhodesia I was refused the right to teach children—I had intended to become a teacher—because I supported the right of people to vote. It was hard for me to make a livelihood. I and my mother were followed by the secret police, had our mail opened, had our phones tapped and so on. I suspect—as I said, I stand to be corrected—I am the only member of the present parliament who has experienced the full weight of a very ugly state apparatus.
But Rhodesia was an extraordinary place. I am also very much against those who seek to pursue their aims by violence, so I volunteered for the Rhodesian armed forces. That must have caused some consternation in some quarters, but they accepted me and I spent nine years in and out of a war in which I nearly lost my life once and in which I saw things I never want to see again. The point of that story is that you can be a great supporter of human rights and universal human values and still oppose things like the ugliness of terrorism—in my case, very identifiably and vigorously so. The two are not in contrast and those who seek to put the argument in that way do themselves and members of parliament a disservice. It is a great shame to hear that expressed in a citadel of great democracy such as the Australian parliament.
The message we need to take from the Parkin episode is manifold. But, most of all, it is that, as much as possible, you need to keep the Australian people in touch with the facts and reassure them that there is no abuse or misuse of power. The difficulty we all face in these matters is that we are asked to take matters on trust. The difficulty with that is that you get three categories of problem with taking things on trust. The first category is that of the small minority of people who lie. The second category is that of the small minority of people who are so immoral as to abuse and misuse power in a way which furthers their own ends. The third category is that of the vast majority of human beings, amongst whom I number, who make mistakes and just get it wrong.
I look at somebody like Tony Blair, for instance—he is a powerful, interesting, charismatic, forceful and strong leader in a great democracy—and see that he got it absolutely wrong. Like a number of other leaders I can think of, he said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He got it absolutely wrong. I do not necessarily put him into either of the first two categories I just outlined. The point is that if you were to accept that you should take on trust his belief, which he said was based on intelligence, you would have been misled into a war which has had immense consequences.
Do we know or are we able to know that the intelligence given surrounding Mr Parkin was accurate? My own experience in Rhodesia was that the Rhodesian intelligence forces, which were extremely adept and extremely skilled, got it entirely wrong about Mr Mugabe and how well he would do in winning an election. Intelligence is a very difficult business. I hear that the Leader of the Opposition has been given a briefing. How does he know on what basis that briefing is founded? How does he know what the foundations of it are? We are not dealing here with a person reputed to be at the centre of a vigorous bombing ring or anything—even the government does not allege that. We have not heard anything of that sort. Mr Parkin is just apparently a person of some concern to the government. That may be, but there is a problem if you do not tell us about the lower order of people and we are suspicious of your motives and reasoning, or there may be a mistake of assessment. We just do not know.
I do not know anything about Mr Parkin. I am always fearful of a state, wherever the state is and whoever the state is, that says, ‘Trust me; we always know what you don’t know and you have to trust us.’ My personal experience is that you have to be wary of that. I say to the government that, if you asked the 76 senators in this place and the 150 House of Representatives members, not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to deport people who are a threat to our country and not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to refuse entry to this country to someone who is inimical to the national interest of this country. I cannot imagine there is one such member. But I would suggest to you that if you went and took an accurate poll on conscience of every individual senator and member they would always say, ‘Tell us why.’
It does not matter that it is Senator Brown who is moving this motion. It does not matter that sometimes Senator Brown gets right up your nose and right up everybody else’s nose—including mine now and again, and I return the compliment. That is not the issue. He has raised an issue of fundamental importance and that is that in a democracy you must keep the Australian people and the Australian parliament, which represents the Australian people, properly informed. Otherwise, because people will use and abuse power and will make mistakes, you will lead on to injustices. That is not acceptable from the government, many of whom I count as good friends and good people. It is just not acceptable. I want you to take away from this debate the thought in your heads to think more carefully about this. I say to the opposition—and I make this challenge to the opposition senators—that you have got to not step backwards. If the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘Trust me, chaps—I have had a briefing, I know all about it,’ do not trust him either. You do not know if he has been conned or misled by somebody who has made a mistake in intelligence gathering or assessment. We rely on you and you have to carry the flag with us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2005-10-06,"—I rise today to support the motion that the circumstances surrounding the deportation of Scott Parkin be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am doing so because, as other speakers have said, and I am not going to go into those arguments, it is a matter of justice and fairness that the Australian people know why somebody was plucked off the street and deported from this country, with no questions asked of the rest of the community. We are standing here today asking those questions.
I was in Europe last week, and I came back through the UK on the day when an 82-year-old man was thrown out of the UK Labour Party conference because he dared to interject and say that Jack Straw was a liar after Jack Straw had said that the only reason that the British were in Iraq was to provide democracy to the Iraqi people. The old man was challenging that view because Tony Blair had said, as this government has said, that they went into Iraq over weapons of mass destruction. Another person stood up and said, ‘Leave the old man alone.’ He, too, was thrown out, and they were both detained under the new terrorism act in the UK. That old man was a refugee from Nazi Germany and had been a Labour Party member since before Tony Blair was born. That is how the terror laws are being used in the UK: to shield the government from criticism.
The crisis of confidence that is being shown here in Australia at the moment is that the Australian people have lost trust and confidence in their government. They simply do not believe them anymore. John Howard, the Prime Minister, was shown to have lied about the ‘children overboard’ affair. As to the issue of the war in Iraq, quite clearly the weapons of mass destruction were not there. Then we have the issue of the SIEVX. For a long time the government insisted that the SIEVX had gone down in international waters. And now that has been changed—quietly changed—to say, ‘These days we’re not sure where the SIEVX went down.’ That is why people in Australia are very suspicious of and have little trust in what the government do. I would also like to correct Senator Sandy Macdonald’s statement that Senator Bob Brown hates the United States.
—It is not true.
—It is not true, just as the simplistic accusation concerning the war on terror was not true. It is not the people of the United States or, indeed, the land itself; it is the actions of the Bush administration.
—If Senator Milne wishes to pick me up on things I said, I would like to raise a point of order. She accused the Prime Minister of lying. The Prime Minister does not lie. That is unparliamentary language.

(Senator Watson)—Be careful, Senator Milne, with the language that you might attribute to the Prime Minister.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—On a similar point of order to that of Senator Macdonald: I did hear Senator Milne accuse the Prime Minister of lying, thus it is worthy of a withdrawal.
—If you said that he lied, you have to withdraw that, but I am not sure that you actually said that, Senator Milne. You did use the word, but not in that particular form of words.
—I cannot recall the exact form of words, but that was clearly the intent of what I said. I withdraw it to the extent of saying that matters pertaining to the ‘children overboard’ affair showed that the Prime Minister was wrong in relation to the circumstances surrounding children being put overboard, as had been stated by the Prime Minister at the time.
I go on to say that, in the circumstances in the UK, people are shocked. Stickers have started appearing all over the UK, saying, ‘I love my country but fear my government.’ That is pretty frightening stuff in a democracy. It is pretty frightening when people are starting to lose so much confidence in their authorities that they are saying that they love their country but are becoming frightened of their government because of the excesses of power in terms of taking away people’s civil liberties. And that is the point that we are debating here today. Like other senators who have spoken, I do not know Scott Parkin, but I do know that people have basic human rights and basic civil liberties, and one of those is that, if they are plucked off the street, they have a right to be told what it is that they are accused of. Their lawyers have a right to be told what they are accused of.
I find the tawdry excuses of the Labor opposition absolutely unbelievable. It actually demonstrates the truth of what was said in recent media publications about the Labor Party not standing for anything anymore. What we have heard here is that the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had a briefing and was satisfied, and was apparently also satisfied that the person who was deported was not told why they were deported and that their lawyers were provided with no information. Apparently that is satisfactory to the Labor opposition in this country. Is not satisfactory to the Greens and it is not satisfactory to the Democrats. We want to stand here and know that people in this country are afforded justice. If we are elected as senators, the very basic things that we ought to be able to guarantee to every single Australian and every person who is here with a visa that was legally acquired are the justice they deserve, the fairness they deserve and an explanation for whatever occurs to them.
It seems to me that Mr Parkin was issued with a visa quite legally, which means that when the investigation took place about giving the visa he was not found to be a security risk. So something occurred between when he came to the country and when he was grabbed off the street that suddenly gave people the understanding that he was something of a threat to this country, even though every single thing he had said at meetings had showed that he was a peace activist and opposed to violence. The only thing that he had been talking about that may have been objectionable to the Bush administration, and hence the Howard government, is the relationship between Mr Cheney, Halliburton, the war in Iraq, the influence of oil companies and the way that certain companies like Halliburton have benefited enormously from the war in Iraq. If that poses a security risk to Australia then there is real cause for concern about what is going on. If that is not the case then the people deserve to know, or else the Scott Parkin matter is going to go into the same category as the ‘children overboard’ affair, the war in Iraq and the SIEVX. It is a basic, absolutely fundamental matter in this democracy.
I see opposition senators shaking their heads. I heard accusations of opportunism. I heard the demonisation, if you like, of people who do not agree. Suddenly we are accused of being extreme, a minority and so on. Yes, we are a minority, but we are also courageous enough to stand up for what is right. It is about time in this Senate that people did stand up and ask questions and not just go along with private briefings. If the briefing was suitable for the Leader of the Opposition, why was it not suitable for the Democrats and the Greens? It might well be that we have a healthier degree of scepticism about the explanation than the Leader of the Opposition does.
I want to put on the record my strong support for this motion. It should be going to a Senate inquiry. The government is on notice. It can vote us down here, as can the Labor Party, but the fact of the matter is that people in Australia are now unnerved by the abuse of absolute power. You have control over both houses, you can do as you like and you are doing as you like in this circumstance, with the support of the Labor Party. That is a matter of grave concern for Australians and people are feeling unnerved. Do not be surprised if people meet you in the street and say, ‘I love my country but I fear my government.’",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-06,"—Senator Milne is right when she says that people in this country are uncertain as a result of what the government has done on the issue of Scott Parkin. A week after Scott Parkin was deported by this government, on the basis of an adverse security assessment that appears to have been leaked to a government friendly journalist writing for the Australian, I received an email at my office from somebody who is planning to get married here in Australia. Like Scott Parkin, many of the guests that they have invited to their wedding are involved in the nonviolence movement in the United States. For his wedding here in Australia, this guy has invited a whole lot of peace activists from America. He sent me an email saying: ‘I’m really frightened. What do I tell them now? Do I tell my friends not to come to my wedding?’ The track record of this government is to deport somebody who is from America and who is involved in that nonviolent, peaceful action. That is where Scott Parkin comes from. The entire history of his involvement in political action has been to advocate nonviolence. So I received this email from someone living in Australia saying: ‘What do I do? Do I tell my friends not to come because what I have as an example of the way in which the government may treat them is that they may deport them?’
Scott Parkin was not only deported but also held in a cell in Melbourne for the days before he was deported. When the immigration inquiry that I am a part of was in Melbourne, it heard from one of the lawyers about the cell that Scott Parkin was held in before he was deported. It is inside a police headquarters in Melbourne. It is a cell that is usually used only for a couple of hours when people are held before they are transported elsewhere. No light comes into the cell. The lawyer, who has been involved with many people who have been held in that cell on the basis of criminal conviction, said that no light comes into it and he described it as a dungeon. That is where Scott Parkin was held. Scott Parkin was held in a dungeon—described as such by a lawyer who has had dealings with people who have been held there; he has seen the cell—and not told anything. Scott Parkin has still not been told why he was deported. His lawyers have still not been told why he was deported. The only person that the government say they are prepared to tell is the Leader of the Opposition. So they are not telling the guy or his lawyers why he was deported, but they are happy to tell the Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition then said, ‘That’s okay; you can deport Scott Parkin.’
A Scott Parkin peace lecture, which I was involved in, was held here at Parliament House. It was a nonviolence workshop like the ones that Scott Parkin had held. One of the participants in that workshop was Andrew Wilkie, the former ONA analyst. At that workshop and in his book Andrew Wilkie talked about ASIO briefings for leaders of the opposition that he has sat in on where there has been selective divulgence of information. He did not say that there had been any lying; he said that bits of information that supported the government’s case were provided to the Leader of the Opposition in those ASIO briefings and that other bits of information which did not support the government’s political case were not provided. I would be surprised if the Leader of the Opposition was not aware of the statements that Andrew Wilkie has made, but clearly the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to hear the concerns of someone who has sat in on these ASIO briefings; rather, he just takes the word of ASIO that it is okay to deport Scott Parkin. I call on the Senate to support the motion that has been moved by the Greens. We need an inquiry into why Scott Parkin was deported.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
The Senate ought not to let go the way in which Mr Parkin was arrested and deported from our country. I will briefly go through the facts of the matter. Mr Parkin, who I understand is a 33-year-old American citizen, has been a long-time advocate for the peaceful resolution of human affairs. He is opposed to war. He is opposed to violence. He is very much in favour of the resolution of our differences around the world through peaceful means. As such, he is in the tradition of Martin Luther King, the great American peace advocate and achiever of civil liberties for the American people, and, before that, Mahatma Gandhi and, indeed, right to back to HD Thoreau in the United States in the 1840s.
As part of his advocacy he has been opposed to the illegal invasion of Iraq and the motivation for that invasion. He has talked quite a deal about those who stood to gain, not least Halliburton, the huge US corporation and armaments manufacturer which is making billions of dollars out of the invasion and occupation of Iraq. The former CEO of Halliburton is now the Vice-President of the United States. He is the deputy to George W Bush—that is, Mr Dick Cheney. There is no doubt that Scott Parkin has been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration and Halliburton and its former CEO.
Mr Parkin came to Australia. He was granted a visa. There was some delay, but he was given a visa after all the due vetting by the Australian authorities. He attended a protest outside the Opera House. It was a gathering of the rich in the name of the Forbes corporation, and it included some US business interests. He went on to have talks with Australians interested in peace and global affairs, and he set up some further talks about peace, what it really means and, of course, the fact that it needs to be understrapped by a much fairer world. I am given to believe that about a week before he was arrested he was called by ASIO and asked to undertake an interview. I am also given to believe that he asked if this was necessary and was told, ‘No, it’s not.’ It was a voluntary thing, so he declined and went about his peaceful organisation. Then one Saturday, the Federal Police arrived and Mr Parkin was arrested. Within days he was deported, his visa having been withdrawn.
A number of important questions arise here, of course. How could it be that, in our democracy where our Prime Minister goes around the world—very often hand-in-hand with President George W Bush—advocating democracy and liberty, somebody who advocates peace in a tradition that goes back beyond Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago could be arrested in our country and deported with no other explanation to the public? How could that be, particularly in view of the fact that the Australian government had given him a visa just some weeks before?
I have a theory—because you have to look for some explanation—and that is that the Bush administration does not like Mr Parkin. For some reason, it did not get engaged fast enough but did get involved in the publicity that Mr Parkin was generating in Australia; maybe the US embassy picked up on that and did not like it. And, in communication with the government of our Prime Minister John Howard, the Bush administration decided that his visa should be withdrawn—and this is an Australian visa, not an American visa—and that he should be sent back to America. The consequent impact will very likely be, of course, that Mr Parkin will have a record—not for anything he has done, but because of these government moves—which will make it difficult for him to get visas to travel to other countries as well.
At least I know this: there is no way an American citizen would be deported from our country, under this government, without extensive consultations between Washington and Canberra, between the Bush administration and the Howard prime ministerial office. That means, of course, that both Prime Minister Howard and President Bush approved of this American having his visa withdrawn and being deported under these circumstances.
Consequent to Mr Parkin’s deportation, we awoke one morning to find a story on the front page of the Australian newspaper, which is so often the recipient of information from the government that the government wants to put out into the public arena. The story alleged that Mr Parkin had been deported because he was going to—not because he had, but because he was going to—make statements or encourage people to roll marbles under the hooves of horses in protests in Australia and, indeed, give techniques by which people who were arrested by the police could be taken out of custody.
There are a couple of problems with this ASIO information, which stood uncontested on the front page of the Australian newspaper. The first is that Mr Parkin has never advocated anything remotely like that. In fact, it is contrary to what he has advocated consistently in his pursuit of peaceful means for human beings to interact with each other. The second is that, when he was questioned about this, having been deported with a security officer on either side of him in the plane crossing the Pacific and then furnished with a bill for $11,000 by the Australian government, in the consequent interview he made it very clear that not only had he never advocated such things but that he never would. He is opposed to any form of gratuitous animal cruelty, and ditto to affronting the police in the way that was advocated. I point out again that the accusation was not that he had advocated such things—and it appears an ASIO operative or informant must have been at some of the meetings, and public meetings at that, that he had been attending in Australia—but that he was going to.
What country are we in? Surely the Inquisition is behind us. Surely the Salem witchcraft trials were some centuries ago. Surely Joan of Arc was put to the stake before our own more enlightened times. Even the McCarthy period of the 1950s in the United States at its apogee, we had hoped, had gone back into history. But no; in the year 2005, this peaceful man, advocating peace in our peace-loving democracy, is picked up in a police state operation, has his visa removed—by decision of the Attorney-General, effectively: the chief law-maker of this country—and is deported, his rights taken away without any due reason being given at all.
And then we see a fit-up, a false track from ASIO, appear on the front page of a newspaper, to try to justify that which is not only unjustifiable but which must be totally repugnant to any person who believes in a fair go in this country. This is the Howard government, in cahoots with the Bush administration, showing what it can do under the laws it wants to bring in in this country in the name of security. It can take away the rights of a peace activist, for goodness sake, on political grounds.
What happened here was that a political decision was made by Prime Minister Howard and by the chief law-maker of this country, the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, acting as a court. With no evidence extant, with no ability for the defendant to defend his position—indeed, with no charge; certainly with no legal representation or cross-examination—he was found guilty, sentenced and deported.
These are all the hallmarks of a police state activity. We must not be frightened of saying that, because that is what it is. If we are going to defend the rule of law—but, more particularly, justice—in this country then we have to confront injustice when we see it, particularly politically motivated injustice by a government which dominates both houses of the parliament. We have to be fearless in doing that.
Here is the Greens motion saying: let us have an inquiry into this matter. Let us get the ministers and the representatives to come forward and put their point of view. Let us have ASIO explain to senators—in camera if necessary if there is some national security factor at stake here—before a Senate inquiry, because Senate inquiries are so important as a watchdog on the government.
But there are two problems. The first is that the government is going to vote against it because it has got the numbers in this place. The second is that the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, sought an ASIO briefing on the arrest and deportation of Mr Parkin and after that briefing said publicly that he agreed with the government’s actions and no further explanation was required. Incidentally, I made a request for the same briefing and was refused. That is a government decision, but it is an absolute affront that any member of parliament should be refused such a briefing; we are all elected equal into this parliament by the people of Australia. When matters as important as this are at stake the justification should be forthcoming and, if it is going to be in camera, let it be so. I am no less capable of recognising the security of this country, which I love, than are Mr Beazley, Mr Howard, Mr Ruddock or anybody else. The very fact that I was denied that briefing indicates that the government does not and cannot stand by the decision that it took.
My understanding is that the opposition is not going to support this inquiry either. That is not just a pity; it is a failure by the Labor opposition and in particular by the Leader of the Opposition, who took the decision to support the Howard government in deporting Mr Parkin and to stand by that decision. Here are the two big parties saying: ‘We will make these decisions in camera, out of public view, and we will not have them inquired into by our fellow senators. We do not want them to look in behind this curtain where these decisions are being made.’ I put it to you, Acting Deputy President Forshaw, those decisions were wrong, cannot be justified and are an affront to the justice system that we hold dear in this country. I cannot believe that Labor is not going to support this motion. I cannot believe it. But there we have it. So the constructive opposition on this matter is left to the crossbench and to the Greens in moving this motion. Thank God we are here.
Everywhere I have been in the country in the last couple of weeks people have come up to me and said: ‘How could this happen in our country? How could this peace activist from the United States, of all places, be denied such a comprehensive range of rights?’ The answer is: it cannot be justified and it must not be allowed. Who is next to be removed from our midst because the government politically disagrees with them? Who is next on the Prime Minister’s list of people he does not want around in our country because they do not fit to his political comfort? This is very dangerous.
Of course we can all say: ‘No, we cannot have what happens in other countries happening in Australia. We are different—we are in some way superior in our ethics and a bulwark of democracy and justice to other people elsewhere around the world.’ That in itself is a grand mistake. We do have a parliament here which is a watchdog on executive government and which must be strong in using those watchdog powers. But I suspect today that that is going to be left to the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats, and that must be a worry in itself.
This is an extremely important motion. It is asking for an inquiry. It is not a motion to say, ‘Bring Scott Parkin back to Australia; pay his $11,000 debt; give a public explanation as to why he was deported on a farrago of misinformation and concocted claims.’ No, this is a motion to say, ‘Let us inquire into those things. Let us see if Senator Brown is wrong and that there is some other information out there that we do not know about.’ A Senate inquiry can look at that. If there is some security reason that it cannot come into the public arena, a Senate committee can deal with that in camera. It is a very important inquiry. It is a very important motion. I appeal again to the Labor Party to support it—and to the government for that matter. If they are right, support this for goodness sake.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Senator Brown is clear on what the Labor Party’s position is in respect of this matter. We are not going to support the reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee that he has proposed. Senator Brown has ranged widely over the issue, but I am not going to deal substantively with it, because, in principle, what we have before us is procedural in that it is a proposal for a reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee, as Senator Brown knows, has a chair and deputy chair. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has spoken to the deputy chair, but I am aware that he has not spoken to the chair about bringing a reference forward. The usual process that people in this place adopt is to consult with the minister and, usually, the shadow minister of the particular area, and with either the chair or deputy chair, or both, to get references up. It is not easy to get references up in this place, as Senator Brown clearly knows. At the end of the day he may have been unsuccessful even if he had gone through those processes. But I am unaware of whether or not he has.
The other question of course is whether or not the Legal and Constitutional References Committee is the appropriate committee to in fact deal with the issue. There is a joint committee, the ASIO-DSD committee, which could deal with this issue in a more practical manner. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has written to that committee and asked them to look into the matter. That committee is equipped to deal with these sorts of security sensitive issues. I think the Labor Party made the point last time Senator Brown moved a motion in respect of a similar matter that we did not think it was appropriate, and we have concluded again that it is not appropriate that references be sent to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee about such matters.
Also, Senator Brown will have the opportunity to ventilate this matter in estimates, which is coming up shortly, when ASIO appears as an agency. Senator Brown can pursue the matter at that time, and see how far he can progress it. The difficulty he will strike is that a references committee is usually used for a wide-ranging inquiry into a more general matter. They usually take submissions on and deal with particularly broad issues and then produce a report. From listening to his submission it appears that Senator Brown is asking for a rather short, sharp examination of ASIO, perhaps in camera. The difficulty that I suspect he will find is that ASIO may or may not provide the information he requests, in which case it would become a moot point as to whether or not the references committee would in fact advance Senator Brown’s arguments or produce the information that he is seeking. If Senator Brown has been unsuccessful in obtaining a briefing from ASIO I suggest that an alternative is to pursue reference of the matter for inquiry by letter to the relevant committee. That may or not provide him with any joy.
As happened last time in relation to a similar matter, Labor has requested and received a briefing, as correctly pointed out by Senator Brown. Our leader, Mr Kim Beazley, and the shadow minister for homeland security, Mr Arch Bevis, received a briefing in relation to the Scott Parkin matter. As a consequence of having received those briefings, Labor does not support the details of sensitive security operations being disclosed in an open forum. The difficulty of holding a references committee inquiry is of course that it could end up with ASIO informing the committee that it was not prepared to provide information in either an open forum or in camera. Unfortunately, as Senator Brown knows, in camera evidence, once provided, can be released by individual senators. We are all aware that that can happen sometimes—although I know that Senator Brown would not do that in any event—and my guess is that that would bear on ASIO’s ability to provide information. It might be the case that it would provide it to the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and that is a matter that you could explore. But, in terms of the direction that you are seeking to take today, Labor does not think that it should be supported in the way that Senator Brown has gone about it. So we will not be supporting the motion, as I have said. The matter that you have aired is obviously a matter of concern to you, and we encourage you to take every available opportunity to pursue it in the way that you wish to. Labor has pursued it in the way that we have decided to. We have received private briefings and we are satisfied with those private briefings.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-06,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as spokesperson for matters concerning the Attorney-General and foreign affairs, to support the motion before us. In the last 15 minutes I have become incredibly conscious of the basic and fundamental rights and freedoms that I think we as Australians, and those people who visit our country, should enjoy. I feel as though they have died away. My wrath, while directed so strongly at the government, today finds another home with the Labor opposition. It is extraordinary that any spokesperson would suggest that the Democrats apply for or get a briefing. There is no statutory obligation to inform or brief members of the crossbenches on an issue of so-called national security such as this, on a security threat or indeed on an issue of national interest, which I believe this issue is. If we break this matter down to the basics, Senator Brown is asking for us to know as a parliament—that is, as representatives of the people of Australia—what happened. Why was Scott Parkin deported? The government and the opposition do not want to tell us that. I am the first to acknowledge that there is information and classified briefings that should not necessarily be available to all members of parliament or indeed to the community at large. I accept that. But, even if you will not tell us, why won’t you tell the person who was deported? That is the extraordinary thing here, and it amounts to an absolute abuse of basic human rights. People might disrespect or dismiss this issue because it does not involve an Australian citizen. But surely they still believe that the person at the heart of this scandal has the right to know why his visa was revoked or, if he does not, that perhaps his legal representatives have the right to know.
We have revoked a visa that was legally and appropriately obtained in the first place, as I understand it. We have arrested a man, thrown him into jail and into solitary confinement, deported him, given him a bill for the pleasure, failed to tell him why and then encouraged him, as I understand it, not to challenge the reasons for the revocation of that visa—that is, the implication was, ‘If you don’t challenge this, you’ll be deported faster.’ Of course, at the time you would have presumed that leaving faster was not an unsatisfactory outcome because, if Mr Parkin had stayed any longer, albeit in solitary confinement, he would have incurred more costs and a higher bill. These are the circumstances with which we are dealing.
What strikes me about this is that it strikes at the heart of some basic freedoms and principles that we hold dear—or at least I thought we did: that people would know what they were being arrested for, charged with if they are charged and detained for. I understand that we have made changes to laws in recent times and we all anticipate further changes to laws in the name of countering terrorism—an objective with which we all agree—but the impact of those laws in terms of some of these basic freedoms and principles, civil rights and human rights, is going to be extraordinary, because if this does not even raise a whimper from Her Majesty’s opposition then we are in trouble, folks.
If the government do not want to tell me the specifics I will accept that, grudgingly, but I will accept it. If the government will not give me classified briefings on material, I do not like it but I accept it. But if they will not tell the lawyer and the individual who is being deported after getting a legal visa in the first place then something has gone wrong with our society.
This motion is basic and simple. It calls for an inquiry into these issues. It says:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
That does not entail the disclosure of certain material and information if the government so chooses, and certainly it can be in camera. There is surely some information that senators can be given so that there is some understanding. The argument must be that, if we are going to make decisions on this and debate these issues, we deserve a little more information.
As to the issues of which committee and the process that has been pursued, I do not know if I am even going to dignify that with too much comment. Suffice to say, if the Labor Party are not happy with this committee, I certainly am happy to work with them—and I am sure Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens would be too—to find an appropriate committee. I suspect that there are parliaments around the world that would find a committee. They would find a select committee or they would find a royal commission. They would do whatever has to be done in order to find out why we arrest, put in solitary confinement, deport and charge, financially speaking, a person at the heart of an issue like this and then fail to tell them and their lawyers why. I am all ready to hear the information; I am all ready to be convinced that there was an issue of a threat to national security. I am quite happy to listen to that information and presumably be satisfied by it, but what we have instead is a situation where we can pick and choose people, albeit from other countries, and deport them. We do not even have to let them in—we know that—but once they get here legally we can deport them.
There is no evidence. No-one is charged with a crime and no evidence is provided of a crime having been committed. In fact, as I understand it, when Mr Parkin returned to America the FBI was not waiting for him at the doorstep or at the airport. So we have no evidence of what this man has done or is alleged to have done, except, as has been pointed out, what we must presume is a leak to our national daily paper—on the front page, I might add—that suggests that he was going to do something—

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—Senator Brown suggests that this is reminiscent of Salem and burning witches at the stake. I think it is more reminiscent of the futuristic film Minority Report—that we are actually anticipating what people are going to do, even though we have no evidence that that was going to take place. In fact, we may arguably have evidence to the contrary.
I want an inquiry because I am not sure how else, as a citizen, let alone a legislator, I am going to be satisfied that we have not become some kind of Stasi land where people just disappear if we do not like what they are saying about us or our allies. I strongly recommend Anna Funder’s book, because it got a bit too close to the bone for me, especially in a period when we are talking about national ID cards and removing people and putting them in detention for up to 14 days without charge. Come on. We are seriously skating close to an erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country like never before and if people are kidding themselves that we do not have a problem more fool them.
So when Senator Brown talks about talking to Australians—average punters, people who care about their community, their constitution, their politics or whatever; wherever people are on that spectrum—it means that people are concerned. You listen to talkback radio, you get the emails—
—Have you once in this chamber acknowledged the war on terror?
—Yes, I had a dear friend who died in it. How dare you!

(Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Stott Despoja, I would ask you—
—Then you should—
—Senator McGauran, cease interjecting.
—Senator McGauran, will you apologise and withdraw?
—Then don’t say our—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Cease interjecting. Every other speaker in this debate has been heard in silence, and Senator Stott Despoja is entitled to—
—She should—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Do not interrupt the chair while the chair is addressing the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it would be appropriate—though I do not know whether he has the bigness to do it—for Senator McGauran to withdraw his distasteful remarks.
—Senator Brown, I do not recall precisely the remarks that Senator McGauran made, but he does recall them. I do not think that a point of order was actually raised, but I am happy to have the issue reviewed. Senator Stott Despoja has not asked for the remarks to be withdrawn, so I will rule there is no point of order.
—Thank you. Perhaps the interjection epitomises the level of this debate. How dare anyone suggest that we do not care about terrorism or the war on terror! And especially, how dare Senator McGauran make those remarks when a close friend of mine was in the World Trade Centre—but Senator McGauran knows that. It makes me all the more determined to get justice, not revenge, and in the process not let terrorism change the lives of my fellow countrymen and countrywomen.
I do not want people to be under attack. I do not want terrorists to succeed—of course not. But I do not want to lose the basic principles that I hold dear as a citizen. I genuinely believe that these rights are under attack, and any objective commentator recognises this. Of course we have to strike a balance. Of course we have to work together and be strong in the face of terrorism and fear. But we have to make clear that the things that we are fighting for—that we all agree are worth fighting for—are protected, too.
I do not know Scott Parkin from a piece of wood. I know very little about this man. What I am asking for is information and enlightenment so I as a legislator can make an informed decision on this. I have not challenged our statutory obligations under the ASIO Act. I have not suggested that the information provided to the opposition is inadequate. I think the crossbenches have the right to that information, too. As I said in the intelligence services debate yesterday, one option put forward by the Democrats is that of extending the mandate and the composition—that is, the number of representatives on the new joint standing committee on the intelligence services—to include the crossbenches.
There are questions that we need to know the answers to. We need to know why ASIO made a security assessment of American peace activist Scott Parkin based on matters relating to ‘politically motivated violence, including violent protest activity’. Are there specific guidelines? We need to know what exactly constitutes, in the eyes of the Attorney-General and others, a ‘violent protest activity’. We need to know who makes the final judgment in that process. We need to know when the Attorney-General became aware that Mr Parkin represented a serious threat to Australian national security. We need to know if Mr Parkin has acted in any way contrary to Australian laws while he has been in Australia.
If Mr Parkin posed a serious threat to national security, why was he granted a visa? He was granted a visa. Senator Brown points out that it may have been longer in the processing than otherwise you would expect. But why was a visa granted to him and then revoked without explanation? I want to know who or what prompted initial serious concerns that Mr Parkin posed or constituted a serious threat to Australian national security. I want to know when this occurred. Surely this is not all classified information. Surely our Attorney-General can inform us of some of these things.
Senator Brown talks about a leak to the Australian newspaper. I am not suggesting that the journalist should give up their source—not at all. Most of us in this place would recognise the important role that journalists play. They need that trust—that relationship—between them and their sources, from wherever they may come. I am certainly not accusing anyone of being responsible for that leak. But I want to know how that information—more information than I have been able to get my hands on—ended up in the newspaper.
In the current climate, the government acts with alacrity when they hear of a leak that may have sprung from government sources—it may be journalists; it may be public servants. Look at their methods. Look at the extent that they have gone to to investigate certain complaints. We are at the point where we have two journalists, as I understand it, facing the consequences—which may involve prison time—of not revealing their sources. So why is the government so tardy in looking into this issue? I acknowledge that the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence is looking into this issue, but that is not at the behest—as I understand it, Senator Bob Brown, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—of the government.
These are some of the questions that we have. If our laws currently as they are composed allow for this kind of unjust treatment—because until we have information to the contrary, it is unjust and un-Australian, to invoke that phrase—to happen, then I do not know what is going to be acceptable and allowable under changes that are being considered. But I will not stand idly by while these changes take place or these kinds of methods are employed by government or anyone else.
Even if the opposition feel satisfied with that classified briefing to which they have been privy, I appeal to them and say that this is line in the sand stuff. Even if you feel that your leaders have enough information, this is the time when you as legislators need to acknowledge that we all need more information. We cannot stand by and let this kind of activity take place without challenge. The Democrats will be supporting the motion before us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-10-06,"—The government opposes Senator Bob Brown’s referral of this matter to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I think we have witnessed another self-indulgent display by Senator Brown. Senator Brown is well aware that the Australian government has a longstanding practice of not revealing security information, and I am not going to get into personal comments about Mr Parkin, a United States citizen. That is why the government has expert security advisors. I also understand that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been briefed satisfactorily on this matter.
Senator Brown’s suggestion that the circumstances surrounding Mr Parkin’s deportation be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee demonstrates his ongoing disregard for the consequences of publishing security sensitive material. Senator Brown has previously demanded that ASIO provide security information to the Senate regarding the detention of this United States citizen, Scott Parkin. Senator Brown was essentially asking for details of the security assessment that formed the basis for cancelling Mr Parkin’s visa, as we have heard. Today’s motion simply seeks the same information in another way. The government is simply not about to compromise security sensitive material to make Senator Brown happy.
ASIO discharges its increasingly difficult functions in protecting the Australian community from all sorts of politically motivated violence in a highly professional and accountable manner. All our security agencies do this in a whole range of ways. ASIO is subject to scrutiny in the form of administrative, judicial and ministerial review. ASIO is also subject to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—a committee that I was very pleased to be able to serve on before I became a parliamentary secretary—and to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS.
As Senator Brown is aware, the inspector-general will be conducting an inquiry into ASIO’s involvement in Mr Parkin’s affair. I make the point, from Senator Stott Despoja’s comment, that the inspector-general does not need to investigate process or matters as instructed by the government. He has a wide-ranging remit as a statutory officer and is able to self-initiate the sorts of inquiries that he thinks are appropriate. He is totally independent, highly professional and not answerable to the government. Clearly, the inspector-general provides independent oversight of ASIO, and the inspector-general’s investigation should satisfy Senator Brown.
Very clearly, the government opposes Senator Brown’s opportunism, but this is a reminder, and the Senate should be aware, that Senator Brown will use every opportunity to take a swipe at the United States. He appears to have a burning dislike and mistrust of the United States. Luckily, it is not a view that is shared by this side of the chamber or substantially by the other side of the chamber, nor in fact by the great majority of Australians. We do not like the opportunity taken by Senator Brown to always be critical of the United States in every shape, way and form. The government opposes this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I stand to be corrected, but I suspect I am the only member of parliament amongst current members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who has been deported from a country, so I have some personal knowledge of what that means and what that experience entails. At the time, I was destined to be the next president of the National Union of South African Students, I was a strong supporter of human rights—as I still am—I supported the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and I definitely supported the right of all black people throughout Africa to have the vote, both in my own home country of Rhodesia, as it was then, and in the apartheid ruled regime of South Africa.
Of course, it is no news to the Senate that those sorts of views were regarded very unfavourably in South Africa. In fact, those who supported the National Party, which ran the South African government, commonly referred to people like me as kaffir lovers—in Afrikaans, kaffir boetjies—as liberals, which was quite interesting; as communists—een van die rooi gevaar in Afrikaans—and so on. I was not into violence. However, to the great credit of that awful regime, when they deported me, they did tell me and everybody else why they deported me, and they did make it very clear under what laws and for what reasons they were deporting me. So I think I was accorded a little more respect than Mr Parkin was in these circumstances.
In Rhodesia I was refused the right to teach children—I had intended to become a teacher—because I supported the right of people to vote. It was hard for me to make a livelihood. I and my mother were followed by the secret police, had our mail opened, had our phones tapped and so on. I suspect—as I said, I stand to be corrected—I am the only member of the present parliament who has experienced the full weight of a very ugly state apparatus.
But Rhodesia was an extraordinary place. I am also very much against those who seek to pursue their aims by violence, so I volunteered for the Rhodesian armed forces. That must have caused some consternation in some quarters, but they accepted me and I spent nine years in and out of a war in which I nearly lost my life once and in which I saw things I never want to see again. The point of that story is that you can be a great supporter of human rights and universal human values and still oppose things like the ugliness of terrorism—in my case, very identifiably and vigorously so. The two are not in contrast and those who seek to put the argument in that way do themselves and members of parliament a disservice. It is a great shame to hear that expressed in a citadel of great democracy such as the Australian parliament.
The message we need to take from the Parkin episode is manifold. But, most of all, it is that, as much as possible, you need to keep the Australian people in touch with the facts and reassure them that there is no abuse or misuse of power. The difficulty we all face in these matters is that we are asked to take matters on trust. The difficulty with that is that you get three categories of problem with taking things on trust. The first category is that of the small minority of people who lie. The second category is that of the small minority of people who are so immoral as to abuse and misuse power in a way which furthers their own ends. The third category is that of the vast majority of human beings, amongst whom I number, who make mistakes and just get it wrong.
I look at somebody like Tony Blair, for instance—he is a powerful, interesting, charismatic, forceful and strong leader in a great democracy—and see that he got it absolutely wrong. Like a number of other leaders I can think of, he said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He got it absolutely wrong. I do not necessarily put him into either of the first two categories I just outlined. The point is that if you were to accept that you should take on trust his belief, which he said was based on intelligence, you would have been misled into a war which has had immense consequences.
Do we know or are we able to know that the intelligence given surrounding Mr Parkin was accurate? My own experience in Rhodesia was that the Rhodesian intelligence forces, which were extremely adept and extremely skilled, got it entirely wrong about Mr Mugabe and how well he would do in winning an election. Intelligence is a very difficult business. I hear that the Leader of the Opposition has been given a briefing. How does he know on what basis that briefing is founded? How does he know what the foundations of it are? We are not dealing here with a person reputed to be at the centre of a vigorous bombing ring or anything—even the government does not allege that. We have not heard anything of that sort. Mr Parkin is just apparently a person of some concern to the government. That may be, but there is a problem if you do not tell us about the lower order of people and we are suspicious of your motives and reasoning, or there may be a mistake of assessment. We just do not know.
I do not know anything about Mr Parkin. I am always fearful of a state, wherever the state is and whoever the state is, that says, ‘Trust me; we always know what you don’t know and you have to trust us.’ My personal experience is that you have to be wary of that. I say to the government that, if you asked the 76 senators in this place and the 150 House of Representatives members, not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to deport people who are a threat to our country and not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to refuse entry to this country to someone who is inimical to the national interest of this country. I cannot imagine there is one such member. But I would suggest to you that if you went and took an accurate poll on conscience of every individual senator and member they would always say, ‘Tell us why.’
It does not matter that it is Senator Brown who is moving this motion. It does not matter that sometimes Senator Brown gets right up your nose and right up everybody else’s nose—including mine now and again, and I return the compliment. That is not the issue. He has raised an issue of fundamental importance and that is that in a democracy you must keep the Australian people and the Australian parliament, which represents the Australian people, properly informed. Otherwise, because people will use and abuse power and will make mistakes, you will lead on to injustices. That is not acceptable from the government, many of whom I count as good friends and good people. It is just not acceptable. I want you to take away from this debate the thought in your heads to think more carefully about this. I say to the opposition—and I make this challenge to the opposition senators—that you have got to not step backwards. If the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘Trust me, chaps—I have had a briefing, I know all about it,’ do not trust him either. You do not know if he has been conned or misled by somebody who has made a mistake in intelligence gathering or assessment. We rely on you and you have to carry the flag with us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2005-10-06,"—I rise today to support the motion that the circumstances surrounding the deportation of Scott Parkin be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am doing so because, as other speakers have said, and I am not going to go into those arguments, it is a matter of justice and fairness that the Australian people know why somebody was plucked off the street and deported from this country, with no questions asked of the rest of the community. We are standing here today asking those questions.
I was in Europe last week, and I came back through the UK on the day when an 82-year-old man was thrown out of the UK Labour Party conference because he dared to interject and say that Jack Straw was a liar after Jack Straw had said that the only reason that the British were in Iraq was to provide democracy to the Iraqi people. The old man was challenging that view because Tony Blair had said, as this government has said, that they went into Iraq over weapons of mass destruction. Another person stood up and said, ‘Leave the old man alone.’ He, too, was thrown out, and they were both detained under the new terrorism act in the UK. That old man was a refugee from Nazi Germany and had been a Labour Party member since before Tony Blair was born. That is how the terror laws are being used in the UK: to shield the government from criticism.
The crisis of confidence that is being shown here in Australia at the moment is that the Australian people have lost trust and confidence in their government. They simply do not believe them anymore. John Howard, the Prime Minister, was shown to have lied about the ‘children overboard’ affair. As to the issue of the war in Iraq, quite clearly the weapons of mass destruction were not there. Then we have the issue of the SIEVX. For a long time the government insisted that the SIEVX had gone down in international waters. And now that has been changed—quietly changed—to say, ‘These days we’re not sure where the SIEVX went down.’ That is why people in Australia are very suspicious of and have little trust in what the government do. I would also like to correct Senator Sandy Macdonald’s statement that Senator Bob Brown hates the United States.
—It is not true.
—It is not true, just as the simplistic accusation concerning the war on terror was not true. It is not the people of the United States or, indeed, the land itself; it is the actions of the Bush administration.
—If Senator Milne wishes to pick me up on things I said, I would like to raise a point of order. She accused the Prime Minister of lying. The Prime Minister does not lie. That is unparliamentary language.

(Senator Watson)—Be careful, Senator Milne, with the language that you might attribute to the Prime Minister.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—On a similar point of order to that of Senator Macdonald: I did hear Senator Milne accuse the Prime Minister of lying, thus it is worthy of a withdrawal.
—If you said that he lied, you have to withdraw that, but I am not sure that you actually said that, Senator Milne. You did use the word, but not in that particular form of words.
—I cannot recall the exact form of words, but that was clearly the intent of what I said. I withdraw it to the extent of saying that matters pertaining to the ‘children overboard’ affair showed that the Prime Minister was wrong in relation to the circumstances surrounding children being put overboard, as had been stated by the Prime Minister at the time.
I go on to say that, in the circumstances in the UK, people are shocked. Stickers have started appearing all over the UK, saying, ‘I love my country but fear my government.’ That is pretty frightening stuff in a democracy. It is pretty frightening when people are starting to lose so much confidence in their authorities that they are saying that they love their country but are becoming frightened of their government because of the excesses of power in terms of taking away people’s civil liberties. And that is the point that we are debating here today. Like other senators who have spoken, I do not know Scott Parkin, but I do know that people have basic human rights and basic civil liberties, and one of those is that, if they are plucked off the street, they have a right to be told what it is that they are accused of. Their lawyers have a right to be told what they are accused of.
I find the tawdry excuses of the Labor opposition absolutely unbelievable. It actually demonstrates the truth of what was said in recent media publications about the Labor Party not standing for anything anymore. What we have heard here is that the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had a briefing and was satisfied, and was apparently also satisfied that the person who was deported was not told why they were deported and that their lawyers were provided with no information. Apparently that is satisfactory to the Labor opposition in this country. Is not satisfactory to the Greens and it is not satisfactory to the Democrats. We want to stand here and know that people in this country are afforded justice. If we are elected as senators, the very basic things that we ought to be able to guarantee to every single Australian and every person who is here with a visa that was legally acquired are the justice they deserve, the fairness they deserve and an explanation for whatever occurs to them.
It seems to me that Mr Parkin was issued with a visa quite legally, which means that when the investigation took place about giving the visa he was not found to be a security risk. So something occurred between when he came to the country and when he was grabbed off the street that suddenly gave people the understanding that he was something of a threat to this country, even though every single thing he had said at meetings had showed that he was a peace activist and opposed to violence. The only thing that he had been talking about that may have been objectionable to the Bush administration, and hence the Howard government, is the relationship between Mr Cheney, Halliburton, the war in Iraq, the influence of oil companies and the way that certain companies like Halliburton have benefited enormously from the war in Iraq. If that poses a security risk to Australia then there is real cause for concern about what is going on. If that is not the case then the people deserve to know, or else the Scott Parkin matter is going to go into the same category as the ‘children overboard’ affair, the war in Iraq and the SIEVX. It is a basic, absolutely fundamental matter in this democracy.
I see opposition senators shaking their heads. I heard accusations of opportunism. I heard the demonisation, if you like, of people who do not agree. Suddenly we are accused of being extreme, a minority and so on. Yes, we are a minority, but we are also courageous enough to stand up for what is right. It is about time in this Senate that people did stand up and ask questions and not just go along with private briefings. If the briefing was suitable for the Leader of the Opposition, why was it not suitable for the Democrats and the Greens? It might well be that we have a healthier degree of scepticism about the explanation than the Leader of the Opposition does.
I want to put on the record my strong support for this motion. It should be going to a Senate inquiry. The government is on notice. It can vote us down here, as can the Labor Party, but the fact of the matter is that people in Australia are now unnerved by the abuse of absolute power. You have control over both houses, you can do as you like and you are doing as you like in this circumstance, with the support of the Labor Party. That is a matter of grave concern for Australians and people are feeling unnerved. Do not be surprised if people meet you in the street and say, ‘I love my country but I fear my government.’",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-06,"—Senator Milne is right when she says that people in this country are uncertain as a result of what the government has done on the issue of Scott Parkin. A week after Scott Parkin was deported by this government, on the basis of an adverse security assessment that appears to have been leaked to a government friendly journalist writing for the Australian, I received an email at my office from somebody who is planning to get married here in Australia. Like Scott Parkin, many of the guests that they have invited to their wedding are involved in the nonviolence movement in the United States. For his wedding here in Australia, this guy has invited a whole lot of peace activists from America. He sent me an email saying: ‘I’m really frightened. What do I tell them now? Do I tell my friends not to come to my wedding?’ The track record of this government is to deport somebody who is from America and who is involved in that nonviolent, peaceful action. That is where Scott Parkin comes from. The entire history of his involvement in political action has been to advocate nonviolence. So I received this email from someone living in Australia saying: ‘What do I do? Do I tell my friends not to come because what I have as an example of the way in which the government may treat them is that they may deport them?’
Scott Parkin was not only deported but also held in a cell in Melbourne for the days before he was deported. When the immigration inquiry that I am a part of was in Melbourne, it heard from one of the lawyers about the cell that Scott Parkin was held in before he was deported. It is inside a police headquarters in Melbourne. It is a cell that is usually used only for a couple of hours when people are held before they are transported elsewhere. No light comes into the cell. The lawyer, who has been involved with many people who have been held in that cell on the basis of criminal conviction, said that no light comes into it and he described it as a dungeon. That is where Scott Parkin was held. Scott Parkin was held in a dungeon—described as such by a lawyer who has had dealings with people who have been held there; he has seen the cell—and not told anything. Scott Parkin has still not been told why he was deported. His lawyers have still not been told why he was deported. The only person that the government say they are prepared to tell is the Leader of the Opposition. So they are not telling the guy or his lawyers why he was deported, but they are happy to tell the Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition then said, ‘That’s okay; you can deport Scott Parkin.’
A Scott Parkin peace lecture, which I was involved in, was held here at Parliament House. It was a nonviolence workshop like the ones that Scott Parkin had held. One of the participants in that workshop was Andrew Wilkie, the former ONA analyst. At that workshop and in his book Andrew Wilkie talked about ASIO briefings for leaders of the opposition that he has sat in on where there has been selective divulgence of information. He did not say that there had been any lying; he said that bits of information that supported the government’s case were provided to the Leader of the Opposition in those ASIO briefings and that other bits of information which did not support the government’s political case were not provided. I would be surprised if the Leader of the Opposition was not aware of the statements that Andrew Wilkie has made, but clearly the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to hear the concerns of someone who has sat in on these ASIO briefings; rather, he just takes the word of ASIO that it is okay to deport Scott Parkin. I call on the Senate to support the motion that has been moved by the Greens. We need an inquiry into why Scott Parkin was deported.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,9,3,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
The Senate ought not to let go the way in which Mr Parkin was arrested and deported from our country. I will briefly go through the facts of the matter. Mr Parkin, who I understand is a 33-year-old American citizen, has been a long-time advocate for the peaceful resolution of human affairs. He is opposed to war. He is opposed to violence. He is very much in favour of the resolution of our differences around the world through peaceful means. As such, he is in the tradition of Martin Luther King, the great American peace advocate and achiever of civil liberties for the American people, and, before that, Mahatma Gandhi and, indeed, right to back to HD Thoreau in the United States in the 1840s.
As part of his advocacy he has been opposed to the illegal invasion of Iraq and the motivation for that invasion. He has talked quite a deal about those who stood to gain, not least Halliburton, the huge US corporation and armaments manufacturer which is making billions of dollars out of the invasion and occupation of Iraq. The former CEO of Halliburton is now the Vice-President of the United States. He is the deputy to George W Bush—that is, Mr Dick Cheney. There is no doubt that Scott Parkin has been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration and Halliburton and its former CEO.
Mr Parkin came to Australia. He was granted a visa. There was some delay, but he was given a visa after all the due vetting by the Australian authorities. He attended a protest outside the Opera House. It was a gathering of the rich in the name of the Forbes corporation, and it included some US business interests. He went on to have talks with Australians interested in peace and global affairs, and he set up some further talks about peace, what it really means and, of course, the fact that it needs to be understrapped by a much fairer world. I am given to believe that about a week before he was arrested he was called by ASIO and asked to undertake an interview. I am also given to believe that he asked if this was necessary and was told, ‘No, it’s not.’ It was a voluntary thing, so he declined and went about his peaceful organisation. Then one Saturday, the Federal Police arrived and Mr Parkin was arrested. Within days he was deported, his visa having been withdrawn.
A number of important questions arise here, of course. How could it be that, in our democracy where our Prime Minister goes around the world—very often hand-in-hand with President George W Bush—advocating democracy and liberty, somebody who advocates peace in a tradition that goes back beyond Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago could be arrested in our country and deported with no other explanation to the public? How could that be, particularly in view of the fact that the Australian government had given him a visa just some weeks before?
I have a theory—because you have to look for some explanation—and that is that the Bush administration does not like Mr Parkin. For some reason, it did not get engaged fast enough but did get involved in the publicity that Mr Parkin was generating in Australia; maybe the US embassy picked up on that and did not like it. And, in communication with the government of our Prime Minister John Howard, the Bush administration decided that his visa should be withdrawn—and this is an Australian visa, not an American visa—and that he should be sent back to America. The consequent impact will very likely be, of course, that Mr Parkin will have a record—not for anything he has done, but because of these government moves—which will make it difficult for him to get visas to travel to other countries as well.
At least I know this: there is no way an American citizen would be deported from our country, under this government, without extensive consultations between Washington and Canberra, between the Bush administration and the Howard prime ministerial office. That means, of course, that both Prime Minister Howard and President Bush approved of this American having his visa withdrawn and being deported under these circumstances.
Consequent to Mr Parkin’s deportation, we awoke one morning to find a story on the front page of the Australian newspaper, which is so often the recipient of information from the government that the government wants to put out into the public arena. The story alleged that Mr Parkin had been deported because he was going to—not because he had, but because he was going to—make statements or encourage people to roll marbles under the hooves of horses in protests in Australia and, indeed, give techniques by which people who were arrested by the police could be taken out of custody.
There are a couple of problems with this ASIO information, which stood uncontested on the front page of the Australian newspaper. The first is that Mr Parkin has never advocated anything remotely like that. In fact, it is contrary to what he has advocated consistently in his pursuit of peaceful means for human beings to interact with each other. The second is that, when he was questioned about this, having been deported with a security officer on either side of him in the plane crossing the Pacific and then furnished with a bill for $11,000 by the Australian government, in the consequent interview he made it very clear that not only had he never advocated such things but that he never would. He is opposed to any form of gratuitous animal cruelty, and ditto to affronting the police in the way that was advocated. I point out again that the accusation was not that he had advocated such things—and it appears an ASIO operative or informant must have been at some of the meetings, and public meetings at that, that he had been attending in Australia—but that he was going to.
What country are we in? Surely the Inquisition is behind us. Surely the Salem witchcraft trials were some centuries ago. Surely Joan of Arc was put to the stake before our own more enlightened times. Even the McCarthy period of the 1950s in the United States at its apogee, we had hoped, had gone back into history. But no; in the year 2005, this peaceful man, advocating peace in our peace-loving democracy, is picked up in a police state operation, has his visa removed—by decision of the Attorney-General, effectively: the chief law-maker of this country—and is deported, his rights taken away without any due reason being given at all.
And then we see a fit-up, a false track from ASIO, appear on the front page of a newspaper, to try to justify that which is not only unjustifiable but which must be totally repugnant to any person who believes in a fair go in this country. This is the Howard government, in cahoots with the Bush administration, showing what it can do under the laws it wants to bring in in this country in the name of security. It can take away the rights of a peace activist, for goodness sake, on political grounds.
What happened here was that a political decision was made by Prime Minister Howard and by the chief law-maker of this country, the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, acting as a court. With no evidence extant, with no ability for the defendant to defend his position—indeed, with no charge; certainly with no legal representation or cross-examination—he was found guilty, sentenced and deported.
These are all the hallmarks of a police state activity. We must not be frightened of saying that, because that is what it is. If we are going to defend the rule of law—but, more particularly, justice—in this country then we have to confront injustice when we see it, particularly politically motivated injustice by a government which dominates both houses of the parliament. We have to be fearless in doing that.
Here is the Greens motion saying: let us have an inquiry into this matter. Let us get the ministers and the representatives to come forward and put their point of view. Let us have ASIO explain to senators—in camera if necessary if there is some national security factor at stake here—before a Senate inquiry, because Senate inquiries are so important as a watchdog on the government.
But there are two problems. The first is that the government is going to vote against it because it has got the numbers in this place. The second is that the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, sought an ASIO briefing on the arrest and deportation of Mr Parkin and after that briefing said publicly that he agreed with the government’s actions and no further explanation was required. Incidentally, I made a request for the same briefing and was refused. That is a government decision, but it is an absolute affront that any member of parliament should be refused such a briefing; we are all elected equal into this parliament by the people of Australia. When matters as important as this are at stake the justification should be forthcoming and, if it is going to be in camera, let it be so. I am no less capable of recognising the security of this country, which I love, than are Mr Beazley, Mr Howard, Mr Ruddock or anybody else. The very fact that I was denied that briefing indicates that the government does not and cannot stand by the decision that it took.
My understanding is that the opposition is not going to support this inquiry either. That is not just a pity; it is a failure by the Labor opposition and in particular by the Leader of the Opposition, who took the decision to support the Howard government in deporting Mr Parkin and to stand by that decision. Here are the two big parties saying: ‘We will make these decisions in camera, out of public view, and we will not have them inquired into by our fellow senators. We do not want them to look in behind this curtain where these decisions are being made.’ I put it to you, Acting Deputy President Forshaw, those decisions were wrong, cannot be justified and are an affront to the justice system that we hold dear in this country. I cannot believe that Labor is not going to support this motion. I cannot believe it. But there we have it. So the constructive opposition on this matter is left to the crossbench and to the Greens in moving this motion. Thank God we are here.
Everywhere I have been in the country in the last couple of weeks people have come up to me and said: ‘How could this happen in our country? How could this peace activist from the United States, of all places, be denied such a comprehensive range of rights?’ The answer is: it cannot be justified and it must not be allowed. Who is next to be removed from our midst because the government politically disagrees with them? Who is next on the Prime Minister’s list of people he does not want around in our country because they do not fit to his political comfort? This is very dangerous.
Of course we can all say: ‘No, we cannot have what happens in other countries happening in Australia. We are different—we are in some way superior in our ethics and a bulwark of democracy and justice to other people elsewhere around the world.’ That in itself is a grand mistake. We do have a parliament here which is a watchdog on executive government and which must be strong in using those watchdog powers. But I suspect today that that is going to be left to the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats, and that must be a worry in itself.
This is an extremely important motion. It is asking for an inquiry. It is not a motion to say, ‘Bring Scott Parkin back to Australia; pay his $11,000 debt; give a public explanation as to why he was deported on a farrago of misinformation and concocted claims.’ No, this is a motion to say, ‘Let us inquire into those things. Let us see if Senator Brown is wrong and that there is some other information out there that we do not know about.’ A Senate inquiry can look at that. If there is some security reason that it cannot come into the public arena, a Senate committee can deal with that in camera. It is a very important inquiry. It is a very important motion. I appeal again to the Labor Party to support it—and to the government for that matter. If they are right, support this for goodness sake.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,4,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-06,"—Senator Brown is clear on what the Labor Party’s position is in respect of this matter. We are not going to support the reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee that he has proposed. Senator Brown has ranged widely over the issue, but I am not going to deal substantively with it, because, in principle, what we have before us is procedural in that it is a proposal for a reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee, as Senator Brown knows, has a chair and deputy chair. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has spoken to the deputy chair, but I am aware that he has not spoken to the chair about bringing a reference forward. The usual process that people in this place adopt is to consult with the minister and, usually, the shadow minister of the particular area, and with either the chair or deputy chair, or both, to get references up. It is not easy to get references up in this place, as Senator Brown clearly knows. At the end of the day he may have been unsuccessful even if he had gone through those processes. But I am unaware of whether or not he has.
The other question of course is whether or not the Legal and Constitutional References Committee is the appropriate committee to in fact deal with the issue. There is a joint committee, the ASIO-DSD committee, which could deal with this issue in a more practical manner. I am unaware of whether or not Senator Brown has written to that committee and asked them to look into the matter. That committee is equipped to deal with these sorts of security sensitive issues. I think the Labor Party made the point last time Senator Brown moved a motion in respect of a similar matter that we did not think it was appropriate, and we have concluded again that it is not appropriate that references be sent to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee about such matters.
Also, Senator Brown will have the opportunity to ventilate this matter in estimates, which is coming up shortly, when ASIO appears as an agency. Senator Brown can pursue the matter at that time, and see how far he can progress it. The difficulty he will strike is that a references committee is usually used for a wide-ranging inquiry into a more general matter. They usually take submissions on and deal with particularly broad issues and then produce a report. From listening to his submission it appears that Senator Brown is asking for a rather short, sharp examination of ASIO, perhaps in camera. The difficulty that I suspect he will find is that ASIO may or may not provide the information he requests, in which case it would become a moot point as to whether or not the references committee would in fact advance Senator Brown’s arguments or produce the information that he is seeking. If Senator Brown has been unsuccessful in obtaining a briefing from ASIO I suggest that an alternative is to pursue reference of the matter for inquiry by letter to the relevant committee. That may or not provide him with any joy.
As happened last time in relation to a similar matter, Labor has requested and received a briefing, as correctly pointed out by Senator Brown. Our leader, Mr Kim Beazley, and the shadow minister for homeland security, Mr Arch Bevis, received a briefing in relation to the Scott Parkin matter. As a consequence of having received those briefings, Labor does not support the details of sensitive security operations being disclosed in an open forum. The difficulty of holding a references committee inquiry is of course that it could end up with ASIO informing the committee that it was not prepared to provide information in either an open forum or in camera. Unfortunately, as Senator Brown knows, in camera evidence, once provided, can be released by individual senators. We are all aware that that can happen sometimes—although I know that Senator Brown would not do that in any event—and my guess is that that would bear on ASIO’s ability to provide information. It might be the case that it would provide it to the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, and that is a matter that you could explore. But, in terms of the direction that you are seeking to take today, Labor does not think that it should be supported in the way that Senator Brown has gone about it. So we will not be supporting the motion, as I have said. The matter that you have aired is obviously a matter of concern to you, and we encourage you to take every available opportunity to pursue it in the way that you wish to. Labor has pursued it in the way that we have decided to. We have received private briefings and we are satisfied with those private briefings.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,4,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-06,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as spokesperson for matters concerning the Attorney-General and foreign affairs, to support the motion before us. In the last 15 minutes I have become incredibly conscious of the basic and fundamental rights and freedoms that I think we as Australians, and those people who visit our country, should enjoy. I feel as though they have died away. My wrath, while directed so strongly at the government, today finds another home with the Labor opposition. It is extraordinary that any spokesperson would suggest that the Democrats apply for or get a briefing. There is no statutory obligation to inform or brief members of the crossbenches on an issue of so-called national security such as this, on a security threat or indeed on an issue of national interest, which I believe this issue is. If we break this matter down to the basics, Senator Brown is asking for us to know as a parliament—that is, as representatives of the people of Australia—what happened. Why was Scott Parkin deported? The government and the opposition do not want to tell us that. I am the first to acknowledge that there is information and classified briefings that should not necessarily be available to all members of parliament or indeed to the community at large. I accept that. But, even if you will not tell us, why won’t you tell the person who was deported? That is the extraordinary thing here, and it amounts to an absolute abuse of basic human rights. People might disrespect or dismiss this issue because it does not involve an Australian citizen. But surely they still believe that the person at the heart of this scandal has the right to know why his visa was revoked or, if he does not, that perhaps his legal representatives have the right to know.
We have revoked a visa that was legally and appropriately obtained in the first place, as I understand it. We have arrested a man, thrown him into jail and into solitary confinement, deported him, given him a bill for the pleasure, failed to tell him why and then encouraged him, as I understand it, not to challenge the reasons for the revocation of that visa—that is, the implication was, ‘If you don’t challenge this, you’ll be deported faster.’ Of course, at the time you would have presumed that leaving faster was not an unsatisfactory outcome because, if Mr Parkin had stayed any longer, albeit in solitary confinement, he would have incurred more costs and a higher bill. These are the circumstances with which we are dealing.
What strikes me about this is that it strikes at the heart of some basic freedoms and principles that we hold dear—or at least I thought we did: that people would know what they were being arrested for, charged with if they are charged and detained for. I understand that we have made changes to laws in recent times and we all anticipate further changes to laws in the name of countering terrorism—an objective with which we all agree—but the impact of those laws in terms of some of these basic freedoms and principles, civil rights and human rights, is going to be extraordinary, because if this does not even raise a whimper from Her Majesty’s opposition then we are in trouble, folks.
If the government do not want to tell me the specifics I will accept that, grudgingly, but I will accept it. If the government will not give me classified briefings on material, I do not like it but I accept it. But if they will not tell the lawyer and the individual who is being deported after getting a legal visa in the first place then something has gone wrong with our society.
This motion is basic and simple. It calls for an inquiry into these issues. It says:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report:
All matters relating to the arrest and deportation of American citizen, Mr Scott Parkin.
That does not entail the disclosure of certain material and information if the government so chooses, and certainly it can be in camera. There is surely some information that senators can be given so that there is some understanding. The argument must be that, if we are going to make decisions on this and debate these issues, we deserve a little more information.
As to the issues of which committee and the process that has been pursued, I do not know if I am even going to dignify that with too much comment. Suffice to say, if the Labor Party are not happy with this committee, I certainly am happy to work with them—and I am sure Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens would be too—to find an appropriate committee. I suspect that there are parliaments around the world that would find a committee. They would find a select committee or they would find a royal commission. They would do whatever has to be done in order to find out why we arrest, put in solitary confinement, deport and charge, financially speaking, a person at the heart of an issue like this and then fail to tell them and their lawyers why. I am all ready to hear the information; I am all ready to be convinced that there was an issue of a threat to national security. I am quite happy to listen to that information and presumably be satisfied by it, but what we have instead is a situation where we can pick and choose people, albeit from other countries, and deport them. We do not even have to let them in—we know that—but once they get here legally we can deport them.
There is no evidence. No-one is charged with a crime and no evidence is provided of a crime having been committed. In fact, as I understand it, when Mr Parkin returned to America the FBI was not waiting for him at the doorstep or at the airport. So we have no evidence of what this man has done or is alleged to have done, except, as has been pointed out, what we must presume is a leak to our national daily paper—on the front page, I might add—that suggests that he was going to do something—

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—Senator Brown suggests that this is reminiscent of Salem and burning witches at the stake. I think it is more reminiscent of the futuristic film Minority Report—that we are actually anticipating what people are going to do, even though we have no evidence that that was going to take place. In fact, we may arguably have evidence to the contrary.
I want an inquiry because I am not sure how else, as a citizen, let alone a legislator, I am going to be satisfied that we have not become some kind of Stasi land where people just disappear if we do not like what they are saying about us or our allies. I strongly recommend Anna Funder’s book, because it got a bit too close to the bone for me, especially in a period when we are talking about national ID cards and removing people and putting them in detention for up to 14 days without charge. Come on. We are seriously skating close to an erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country like never before and if people are kidding themselves that we do not have a problem more fool them.
So when Senator Brown talks about talking to Australians—average punters, people who care about their community, their constitution, their politics or whatever; wherever people are on that spectrum—it means that people are concerned. You listen to talkback radio, you get the emails—
—Have you once in this chamber acknowledged the war on terror?
—Yes, I had a dear friend who died in it. How dare you!

(Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Stott Despoja, I would ask you—
—Then you should—
—Senator McGauran, cease interjecting.
—Senator McGauran, will you apologise and withdraw?
—Then don’t say our—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Cease interjecting. Every other speaker in this debate has been heard in silence, and Senator Stott Despoja is entitled to—
—She should—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Do not interrupt the chair while the chair is addressing the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it would be appropriate—though I do not know whether he has the bigness to do it—for Senator McGauran to withdraw his distasteful remarks.
—Senator Brown, I do not recall precisely the remarks that Senator McGauran made, but he does recall them. I do not think that a point of order was actually raised, but I am happy to have the issue reviewed. Senator Stott Despoja has not asked for the remarks to be withdrawn, so I will rule there is no point of order.
—Thank you. Perhaps the interjection epitomises the level of this debate. How dare anyone suggest that we do not care about terrorism or the war on terror! And especially, how dare Senator McGauran make those remarks when a close friend of mine was in the World Trade Centre—but Senator McGauran knows that. It makes me all the more determined to get justice, not revenge, and in the process not let terrorism change the lives of my fellow countrymen and countrywomen.
I do not want people to be under attack. I do not want terrorists to succeed—of course not. But I do not want to lose the basic principles that I hold dear as a citizen. I genuinely believe that these rights are under attack, and any objective commentator recognises this. Of course we have to strike a balance. Of course we have to work together and be strong in the face of terrorism and fear. But we have to make clear that the things that we are fighting for—that we all agree are worth fighting for—are protected, too.
I do not know Scott Parkin from a piece of wood. I know very little about this man. What I am asking for is information and enlightenment so I as a legislator can make an informed decision on this. I have not challenged our statutory obligations under the ASIO Act. I have not suggested that the information provided to the opposition is inadequate. I think the crossbenches have the right to that information, too. As I said in the intelligence services debate yesterday, one option put forward by the Democrats is that of extending the mandate and the composition—that is, the number of representatives on the new joint standing committee on the intelligence services—to include the crossbenches.
There are questions that we need to know the answers to. We need to know why ASIO made a security assessment of American peace activist Scott Parkin based on matters relating to ‘politically motivated violence, including violent protest activity’. Are there specific guidelines? We need to know what exactly constitutes, in the eyes of the Attorney-General and others, a ‘violent protest activity’. We need to know who makes the final judgment in that process. We need to know when the Attorney-General became aware that Mr Parkin represented a serious threat to Australian national security. We need to know if Mr Parkin has acted in any way contrary to Australian laws while he has been in Australia.
If Mr Parkin posed a serious threat to national security, why was he granted a visa? He was granted a visa. Senator Brown points out that it may have been longer in the processing than otherwise you would expect. But why was a visa granted to him and then revoked without explanation? I want to know who or what prompted initial serious concerns that Mr Parkin posed or constituted a serious threat to Australian national security. I want to know when this occurred. Surely this is not all classified information. Surely our Attorney-General can inform us of some of these things.
Senator Brown talks about a leak to the Australian newspaper. I am not suggesting that the journalist should give up their source—not at all. Most of us in this place would recognise the important role that journalists play. They need that trust—that relationship—between them and their sources, from wherever they may come. I am certainly not accusing anyone of being responsible for that leak. But I want to know how that information—more information than I have been able to get my hands on—ended up in the newspaper.
In the current climate, the government acts with alacrity when they hear of a leak that may have sprung from government sources—it may be journalists; it may be public servants. Look at their methods. Look at the extent that they have gone to to investigate certain complaints. We are at the point where we have two journalists, as I understand it, facing the consequences—which may involve prison time—of not revealing their sources. So why is the government so tardy in looking into this issue? I acknowledge that the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence is looking into this issue, but that is not at the behest—as I understand it, Senator Bob Brown, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—of the government.
These are some of the questions that we have. If our laws currently as they are composed allow for this kind of unjust treatment—because until we have information to the contrary, it is unjust and un-Australian, to invoke that phrase—to happen, then I do not know what is going to be acceptable and allowable under changes that are being considered. But I will not stand idly by while these changes take place or these kinds of methods are employed by government or anyone else.
Even if the opposition feel satisfied with that classified briefing to which they have been privy, I appeal to them and say that this is line in the sand stuff. Even if you feel that your leaders have enough information, this is the time when you as legislators need to acknowledge that we all need more information. We cannot stand by and let this kind of activity take place without challenge. The Democrats will be supporting the motion before us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,4,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-10-06,"—The government opposes Senator Bob Brown’s referral of this matter to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I think we have witnessed another self-indulgent display by Senator Brown. Senator Brown is well aware that the Australian government has a longstanding practice of not revealing security information, and I am not going to get into personal comments about Mr Parkin, a United States citizen. That is why the government has expert security advisors. I also understand that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been briefed satisfactorily on this matter.
Senator Brown’s suggestion that the circumstances surrounding Mr Parkin’s deportation be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee demonstrates his ongoing disregard for the consequences of publishing security sensitive material. Senator Brown has previously demanded that ASIO provide security information to the Senate regarding the detention of this United States citizen, Scott Parkin. Senator Brown was essentially asking for details of the security assessment that formed the basis for cancelling Mr Parkin’s visa, as we have heard. Today’s motion simply seeks the same information in another way. The government is simply not about to compromise security sensitive material to make Senator Brown happy.
ASIO discharges its increasingly difficult functions in protecting the Australian community from all sorts of politically motivated violence in a highly professional and accountable manner. All our security agencies do this in a whole range of ways. ASIO is subject to scrutiny in the form of administrative, judicial and ministerial review. ASIO is also subject to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—a committee that I was very pleased to be able to serve on before I became a parliamentary secretary—and to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS.
As Senator Brown is aware, the inspector-general will be conducting an inquiry into ASIO’s involvement in Mr Parkin’s affair. I make the point, from Senator Stott Despoja’s comment, that the inspector-general does not need to investigate process or matters as instructed by the government. He has a wide-ranging remit as a statutory officer and is able to self-initiate the sorts of inquiries that he thinks are appropriate. He is totally independent, highly professional and not answerable to the government. Clearly, the inspector-general provides independent oversight of ASIO, and the inspector-general’s investigation should satisfy Senator Brown.
Very clearly, the government opposes Senator Brown’s opportunism, but this is a reminder, and the Senate should be aware, that Senator Brown will use every opportunity to take a swipe at the United States. He appears to have a burning dislike and mistrust of the United States. Luckily, it is not a view that is shared by this side of the chamber or substantially by the other side of the chamber, nor in fact by the great majority of Australians. We do not like the opportunity taken by Senator Brown to always be critical of the United States in every shape, way and form. The government opposes this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,4,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I stand to be corrected, but I suspect I am the only member of parliament amongst current members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who has been deported from a country, so I have some personal knowledge of what that means and what that experience entails. At the time, I was destined to be the next president of the National Union of South African Students, I was a strong supporter of human rights—as I still am—I supported the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and I definitely supported the right of all black people throughout Africa to have the vote, both in my own home country of Rhodesia, as it was then, and in the apartheid ruled regime of South Africa.
Of course, it is no news to the Senate that those sorts of views were regarded very unfavourably in South Africa. In fact, those who supported the National Party, which ran the South African government, commonly referred to people like me as kaffir lovers—in Afrikaans, kaffir boetjies—as liberals, which was quite interesting; as communists—een van die rooi gevaar in Afrikaans—and so on. I was not into violence. However, to the great credit of that awful regime, when they deported me, they did tell me and everybody else why they deported me, and they did make it very clear under what laws and for what reasons they were deporting me. So I think I was accorded a little more respect than Mr Parkin was in these circumstances.
In Rhodesia I was refused the right to teach children—I had intended to become a teacher—because I supported the right of people to vote. It was hard for me to make a livelihood. I and my mother were followed by the secret police, had our mail opened, had our phones tapped and so on. I suspect—as I said, I stand to be corrected—I am the only member of the present parliament who has experienced the full weight of a very ugly state apparatus.
But Rhodesia was an extraordinary place. I am also very much against those who seek to pursue their aims by violence, so I volunteered for the Rhodesian armed forces. That must have caused some consternation in some quarters, but they accepted me and I spent nine years in and out of a war in which I nearly lost my life once and in which I saw things I never want to see again. The point of that story is that you can be a great supporter of human rights and universal human values and still oppose things like the ugliness of terrorism—in my case, very identifiably and vigorously so. The two are not in contrast and those who seek to put the argument in that way do themselves and members of parliament a disservice. It is a great shame to hear that expressed in a citadel of great democracy such as the Australian parliament.
The message we need to take from the Parkin episode is manifold. But, most of all, it is that, as much as possible, you need to keep the Australian people in touch with the facts and reassure them that there is no abuse or misuse of power. The difficulty we all face in these matters is that we are asked to take matters on trust. The difficulty with that is that you get three categories of problem with taking things on trust. The first category is that of the small minority of people who lie. The second category is that of the small minority of people who are so immoral as to abuse and misuse power in a way which furthers their own ends. The third category is that of the vast majority of human beings, amongst whom I number, who make mistakes and just get it wrong.
I look at somebody like Tony Blair, for instance—he is a powerful, interesting, charismatic, forceful and strong leader in a great democracy—and see that he got it absolutely wrong. Like a number of other leaders I can think of, he said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He got it absolutely wrong. I do not necessarily put him into either of the first two categories I just outlined. The point is that if you were to accept that you should take on trust his belief, which he said was based on intelligence, you would have been misled into a war which has had immense consequences.
Do we know or are we able to know that the intelligence given surrounding Mr Parkin was accurate? My own experience in Rhodesia was that the Rhodesian intelligence forces, which were extremely adept and extremely skilled, got it entirely wrong about Mr Mugabe and how well he would do in winning an election. Intelligence is a very difficult business. I hear that the Leader of the Opposition has been given a briefing. How does he know on what basis that briefing is founded? How does he know what the foundations of it are? We are not dealing here with a person reputed to be at the centre of a vigorous bombing ring or anything—even the government does not allege that. We have not heard anything of that sort. Mr Parkin is just apparently a person of some concern to the government. That may be, but there is a problem if you do not tell us about the lower order of people and we are suspicious of your motives and reasoning, or there may be a mistake of assessment. We just do not know.
I do not know anything about Mr Parkin. I am always fearful of a state, wherever the state is and whoever the state is, that says, ‘Trust me; we always know what you don’t know and you have to trust us.’ My personal experience is that you have to be wary of that. I say to the government that, if you asked the 76 senators in this place and the 150 House of Representatives members, not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to deport people who are a threat to our country and not one would oppose the right of an Australian government to refuse entry to this country to someone who is inimical to the national interest of this country. I cannot imagine there is one such member. But I would suggest to you that if you went and took an accurate poll on conscience of every individual senator and member they would always say, ‘Tell us why.’
It does not matter that it is Senator Brown who is moving this motion. It does not matter that sometimes Senator Brown gets right up your nose and right up everybody else’s nose—including mine now and again, and I return the compliment. That is not the issue. He has raised an issue of fundamental importance and that is that in a democracy you must keep the Australian people and the Australian parliament, which represents the Australian people, properly informed. Otherwise, because people will use and abuse power and will make mistakes, you will lead on to injustices. That is not acceptable from the government, many of whom I count as good friends and good people. It is just not acceptable. I want you to take away from this debate the thought in your heads to think more carefully about this. I say to the opposition—and I make this challenge to the opposition senators—that you have got to not step backwards. If the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘Trust me, chaps—I have had a briefing, I know all about it,’ do not trust him either. You do not know if he has been conned or misled by somebody who has made a mistake in intelligence gathering or assessment. We rely on you and you have to carry the flag with us.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,4,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2005-10-06,"—I rise today to support the motion that the circumstances surrounding the deportation of Scott Parkin be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am doing so because, as other speakers have said, and I am not going to go into those arguments, it is a matter of justice and fairness that the Australian people know why somebody was plucked off the street and deported from this country, with no questions asked of the rest of the community. We are standing here today asking those questions.
I was in Europe last week, and I came back through the UK on the day when an 82-year-old man was thrown out of the UK Labour Party conference because he dared to interject and say that Jack Straw was a liar after Jack Straw had said that the only reason that the British were in Iraq was to provide democracy to the Iraqi people. The old man was challenging that view because Tony Blair had said, as this government has said, that they went into Iraq over weapons of mass destruction. Another person stood up and said, ‘Leave the old man alone.’ He, too, was thrown out, and they were both detained under the new terrorism act in the UK. That old man was a refugee from Nazi Germany and had been a Labour Party member since before Tony Blair was born. That is how the terror laws are being used in the UK: to shield the government from criticism.
The crisis of confidence that is being shown here in Australia at the moment is that the Australian people have lost trust and confidence in their government. They simply do not believe them anymore. John Howard, the Prime Minister, was shown to have lied about the ‘children overboard’ affair. As to the issue of the war in Iraq, quite clearly the weapons of mass destruction were not there. Then we have the issue of the SIEVX. For a long time the government insisted that the SIEVX had gone down in international waters. And now that has been changed—quietly changed—to say, ‘These days we’re not sure where the SIEVX went down.’ That is why people in Australia are very suspicious of and have little trust in what the government do. I would also like to correct Senator Sandy Macdonald’s statement that Senator Bob Brown hates the United States.
—It is not true.
—It is not true, just as the simplistic accusation concerning the war on terror was not true. It is not the people of the United States or, indeed, the land itself; it is the actions of the Bush administration.
—If Senator Milne wishes to pick me up on things I said, I would like to raise a point of order. She accused the Prime Minister of lying. The Prime Minister does not lie. That is unparliamentary language.

(Senator Watson)—Be careful, Senator Milne, with the language that you might attribute to the Prime Minister.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—On a similar point of order to that of Senator Macdonald: I did hear Senator Milne accuse the Prime Minister of lying, thus it is worthy of a withdrawal.
—If you said that he lied, you have to withdraw that, but I am not sure that you actually said that, Senator Milne. You did use the word, but not in that particular form of words.
—I cannot recall the exact form of words, but that was clearly the intent of what I said. I withdraw it to the extent of saying that matters pertaining to the ‘children overboard’ affair showed that the Prime Minister was wrong in relation to the circumstances surrounding children being put overboard, as had been stated by the Prime Minister at the time.
I go on to say that, in the circumstances in the UK, people are shocked. Stickers have started appearing all over the UK, saying, ‘I love my country but fear my government.’ That is pretty frightening stuff in a democracy. It is pretty frightening when people are starting to lose so much confidence in their authorities that they are saying that they love their country but are becoming frightened of their government because of the excesses of power in terms of taking away people’s civil liberties. And that is the point that we are debating here today. Like other senators who have spoken, I do not know Scott Parkin, but I do know that people have basic human rights and basic civil liberties, and one of those is that, if they are plucked off the street, they have a right to be told what it is that they are accused of. Their lawyers have a right to be told what they are accused of.
I find the tawdry excuses of the Labor opposition absolutely unbelievable. It actually demonstrates the truth of what was said in recent media publications about the Labor Party not standing for anything anymore. What we have heard here is that the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had a briefing and was satisfied, and was apparently also satisfied that the person who was deported was not told why they were deported and that their lawyers were provided with no information. Apparently that is satisfactory to the Labor opposition in this country. Is not satisfactory to the Greens and it is not satisfactory to the Democrats. We want to stand here and know that people in this country are afforded justice. If we are elected as senators, the very basic things that we ought to be able to guarantee to every single Australian and every person who is here with a visa that was legally acquired are the justice they deserve, the fairness they deserve and an explanation for whatever occurs to them.
It seems to me that Mr Parkin was issued with a visa quite legally, which means that when the investigation took place about giving the visa he was not found to be a security risk. So something occurred between when he came to the country and when he was grabbed off the street that suddenly gave people the understanding that he was something of a threat to this country, even though every single thing he had said at meetings had showed that he was a peace activist and opposed to violence. The only thing that he had been talking about that may have been objectionable to the Bush administration, and hence the Howard government, is the relationship between Mr Cheney, Halliburton, the war in Iraq, the influence of oil companies and the way that certain companies like Halliburton have benefited enormously from the war in Iraq. If that poses a security risk to Australia then there is real cause for concern about what is going on. If that is not the case then the people deserve to know, or else the Scott Parkin matter is going to go into the same category as the ‘children overboard’ affair, the war in Iraq and the SIEVX. It is a basic, absolutely fundamental matter in this democracy.
I see opposition senators shaking their heads. I heard accusations of opportunism. I heard the demonisation, if you like, of people who do not agree. Suddenly we are accused of being extreme, a minority and so on. Yes, we are a minority, but we are also courageous enough to stand up for what is right. It is about time in this Senate that people did stand up and ask questions and not just go along with private briefings. If the briefing was suitable for the Leader of the Opposition, why was it not suitable for the Democrats and the Greens? It might well be that we have a healthier degree of scepticism about the explanation than the Leader of the Opposition does.
I want to put on the record my strong support for this motion. It should be going to a Senate inquiry. The government is on notice. It can vote us down here, as can the Labor Party, but the fact of the matter is that people in Australia are now unnerved by the abuse of absolute power. You have control over both houses, you can do as you like and you are doing as you like in this circumstance, with the support of the Labor Party. That is a matter of grave concern for Australians and people are feeling unnerved. Do not be surprised if people meet you in the street and say, ‘I love my country but I fear my government.’",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,4,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-06,"—Senator Milne is right when she says that people in this country are uncertain as a result of what the government has done on the issue of Scott Parkin. A week after Scott Parkin was deported by this government, on the basis of an adverse security assessment that appears to have been leaked to a government friendly journalist writing for the Australian, I received an email at my office from somebody who is planning to get married here in Australia. Like Scott Parkin, many of the guests that they have invited to their wedding are involved in the nonviolence movement in the United States. For his wedding here in Australia, this guy has invited a whole lot of peace activists from America. He sent me an email saying: ‘I’m really frightened. What do I tell them now? Do I tell my friends not to come to my wedding?’ The track record of this government is to deport somebody who is from America and who is involved in that nonviolent, peaceful action. That is where Scott Parkin comes from. The entire history of his involvement in political action has been to advocate nonviolence. So I received this email from someone living in Australia saying: ‘What do I do? Do I tell my friends not to come because what I have as an example of the way in which the government may treat them is that they may deport them?’
Scott Parkin was not only deported but also held in a cell in Melbourne for the days before he was deported. When the immigration inquiry that I am a part of was in Melbourne, it heard from one of the lawyers about the cell that Scott Parkin was held in before he was deported. It is inside a police headquarters in Melbourne. It is a cell that is usually used only for a couple of hours when people are held before they are transported elsewhere. No light comes into the cell. The lawyer, who has been involved with many people who have been held in that cell on the basis of criminal conviction, said that no light comes into it and he described it as a dungeon. That is where Scott Parkin was held. Scott Parkin was held in a dungeon—described as such by a lawyer who has had dealings with people who have been held there; he has seen the cell—and not told anything. Scott Parkin has still not been told why he was deported. His lawyers have still not been told why he was deported. The only person that the government say they are prepared to tell is the Leader of the Opposition. So they are not telling the guy or his lawyers why he was deported, but they are happy to tell the Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition then said, ‘That’s okay; you can deport Scott Parkin.’
A Scott Parkin peace lecture, which I was involved in, was held here at Parliament House. It was a nonviolence workshop like the ones that Scott Parkin had held. One of the participants in that workshop was Andrew Wilkie, the former ONA analyst. At that workshop and in his book Andrew Wilkie talked about ASIO briefings for leaders of the opposition that he has sat in on where there has been selective divulgence of information. He did not say that there had been any lying; he said that bits of information that supported the government’s case were provided to the Leader of the Opposition in those ASIO briefings and that other bits of information which did not support the government’s political case were not provided. I would be surprised if the Leader of the Opposition was not aware of the statements that Andrew Wilkie has made, but clearly the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to hear the concerns of someone who has sat in on these ASIO briefings; rather, he just takes the word of ASIO that it is okay to deport Scott Parkin. I call on the Senate to support the motion that has been moved by the Greens. We need an inquiry into why Scott Parkin was deported.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-06,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm that the Comrie report tabled today described the overall mismanagement of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs as ‘catastrophic’ and that its officers were manipulative and operated within a flawed culture? Can the minister now indicate whether she was aware of any cultural problems in her department prior to the identification of Ms Cornelia Rau and Ms Vivian Solon? Is it really the case that the full responsibility for the unfortunate treatment of Ms Rau and Ms Solon rested with three public servants?

Minister, isn’t it the case that the responsibility for the culture which led to the detention and removal of Ms Solon rests with both the minister and her predecessor Mr Ruddock? When will the minister and her predecessor actually take responsibility for generating the extremist ideology that is responsible for the appalling culture that exists in the immigration department? How many more reports do we have to get? I know there are still 200-odd people who have been removed and that there is still another report due. Minister, how many reports do we still have to get before you will take responsibility for this appalling mess?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Comrie Inquiry</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-10-06,"—I thank Senator Ludwig for his question. I can confirm that the Comrie/Ombudsman report does refer to the handling of the Alvarez case as catastrophic. You might like to read out the sentence after that which confirms that there are a number of people diligently doing their jobs who did try to bring what they saw as a mistake to the attention of their superiors. In fact, they did bring it to the attention of their superiors, who then did nothing with it.
Senator, you asked me why the blame rests with three people. I am not in a position to apportion blame. Under the Public Service Act, there is now a requirement that an investigation take place in relation to the three people named, one of whom has retired, as I understand it. I take this opportunity to correct the record. This morning I think I said that person had resigned. In fact, they have retired. I do not think there is much in that. As a consequence of no longer being a member of the Australian Public Service, they will not be subject to that inquiry. I was also asked this morning whether it is possible for the other two to resign and so remove themselves from that procedure. I understand that the answer to that is also yes.
Those people are not being investigated in relation to a culture in the department but for matters that are spelt out in the report. I do not want to say any more than that because the secretary will be the final decision maker in relation to these investigations and I do not want to create any impression that either I or he have some predetermined course of action in relation to this. I think that we have to wait and see what Mr Boucher says. Having said that, he is obviously going to have the report. He can have any supporting documents that were put together by Mr Comrie and the Ombudsman. As I understand it, he can have assistance from the Ombudsman’s office so that we do not have to redo all the factual matters. He is entitled to look at it fresh and ask any further questions that he wants to ask. The three public servants are being held responsible for the conduct as outlined in the report and not for anything else. I am not going to comment any more on that.
As to whether I sensed there was a cultural problem prior to these matters, that has been answered before, and I refer you to the numerous Hansards from the estimates that you were at, Senator. I refer in particular to remarks on the department’s need to have a much stronger user-friendly client focus. With the announcement this morning of some $230 million or more over five years going into a range of initiatives to address what Mr Palmer said, I am satisfied that we will in fact achieve that. So it is simply not correct for you to say that these people referred to in the Comrie/Ombudsman report are being held responsible for that at all. The government recognises what needs to be done. Nearly a quarter of a billion dollars is being put into fixing this. That is the answer to your question, Senator.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Comrie Inquiry</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-10-06,"—First of all, let me indicate that I do not expect that there will be one report. I have had discussions with the Ombudsman, and I would expect that these will be done in clusters. For example, if there is a group of people with a common issue that was dealt with in a particular way—for example, a mental health issue—I would expect that they would be dealt with together. If there were people whose problems might have eventuated because of poor record keeping or unsatisfactory information technology support, I would expect they would be grouped together. That is my understanding. It is a matter for the Ombudsman. I am just indicating to you that my understanding is that we would not necessarily look at one report. We might wait a long time for that. My personal opinion given to the Ombudsman is that the sooner we can deal with this matter the better, because my commitment as soon as Rau came forward was not to simply deal with that one matter, put my head in the sand and hope nothing else would happen but to do what I still believe is the right thing—that is, go back and see where this could possibly have happened again. We will clean all of these matters up. (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-10-06,"—During question time yesterday, Senator Stott Despoja asked me a question relating to section 7C of the Privacy Act. I have obtained further advice in relation to that question. I table that advice and seek leave to incorporate it.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
I understand that the Privacy Commissioner has determined that the exemption in the Privacy Act for political representatives applied to a complaint that Senator McGauran had disclosed personal information.
I am unable to comment on the reasons for the Privacy Commissioner’s decision.
In 2000 the Government amended the Privacy Act 1988 to provide, for the first time, protection for Australians on how their personal information is used by private sector organisations.
Privacy is not an absolute right. It must be balanced with other rights such as freedom of political communication, which is integral to Australia’s representative democracy.
The exemption in the Privacy Act for political acts and practices applies to political representatives, registered political parties, their volunteers and contractors. Along with the media exemption, this exemption encourages free and effective political communication.
I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee (the Committee) tabled their report The real Big Brother—Review of the Privacy Act 1988 on 23 June 2005.
Recommendation 11 of that report recommends that the need for political acts and practices exemption be examined.
The Government is currently considering the recommendations made by the Committee.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Yesterday the Minister for Defence said that he would seek to get from the Attorney-General information about communications between the two governments on the deportation of Scott Parkin and would give that to the chamber after question time.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) to questions without notice asked by Senators O’Brien and Carr today relating to the Regional Partnerships program.
I realise that it is probably a motion that is redundant in the sense that the minister did not have any answers to the questions that were asked of him. He spent a considerable amount of time hiding behind the fact that Mr Ian Kiernan had been, at some stage or other, appointed as president of the $1 company that was in receipt of $1.2 million worth of grants. I believe over $1 million of that grant has already been paid to the company. Frankly, he continued to avoid a key part of that question—that is, the seeking of a commitment to table the letter which was his involvement in the expedition of the application.
I did hear the minister say that this application was urgent and timely. I do believe that the application was sitting in the files of the government for many months. It just so happened—I think it was in June 2004—that we were told that Minister Campbell had written to the department to ask them to expedite the processing of this particular application. Did that have anything to do with the impending election? Why didn’t he write many months before? Why did he write almost at the end of his tenure as the relevant minister? Could it have had anything to do with the impending election and the desire for the government to get as many grants approved as possible in the lead-up to the election?
The minister can assist us to understand that by providing a copy of the letter that he sent to the department. The Senate committee inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program has asked for a copy of that correspondence. But, of course, the government has not provided that. I could interpolate here that there are a great many matters where the committee inquired of the department to get the government to provide information. I understand that, although a great many aspects of the information were not supplied while the committee was completing its report, some information has been provided too late for the committee to consider it but apparently before the inquiry has reported to the parliament. That is the level of contempt with which the government has treated the parliamentary process.
We are talking about a grant for over $1 million to a company with the intent of facilitating the financing of an ethanol project. This was an approval that was, I think, about a year old. I would have thought that a year after the funding was granted, and with more than $1 million of the grant paid, Minister Campbell would have been able to come in here and say: ‘This project has proceeded. They have got the assistance from the Commonwealth. Almost all of the grant has been paid and the company is able to say that it has got sign-off for business partners to fund the construction of an ethanol plant.’
I listened through the answer to the question. I listened through the answer to the supplementary question. He did not say that there was any commitment to funding this project. So there has been about $1 million of public money paid to a $1 company and we have nothing to show for it. We have the fact that Mr Ian Kiernan is the president of the company, and Senator Campbell seems to delight in hiding behind Mr Kiernan to avoid answering questions about his role in this grant to this company and the payment of what I believe will ultimately be $1.2 million to this company. But there has been not one ounce of information about why there has been no performance in relation to an outcome on this grant—not one litre of ethanol. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-10-06,"—Primary Energy is one of the most exciting renewable energy projects that has ever been seen in Australia to this point in time. It takes feed wheat and converts it to ethanol.
—No, it doesn’t.
—With respect to the very learned Senator O’Brien, who discloses one of the greatest amounts of commercial ignorance that this chamber has ever had the luxury to experience through its microphones, a project in its infancy has to have equity owners. This project has an equity owner. It is an idea, and as it grows so the equity owners will increase. The idea is a very good idea, and I defy him to say it is not a good idea and not a good project. The reason that Senator O’Brien does not like this project and the government sponsoring it and the reason that it has some sort of problem for him is because it is in the electorate of Gwydir. It is a National Party electorate. It comes from Gunnedah. What lies at the bottom of it is a $1.2 million grant. How come Gunnedah, which is in the former Deputy Prime Minister’s electorate, is getting a $1.2 million grant? Let me say that this is a good project. Projects like this in Western Australia get state and federal grants all the time. I defy Senator O’Brien to show that there is anything wrong with this grant.
It is a very exciting project, a great project. It is a project that will deliver substantial employment to regional New South Wales. As Senator O’Brien says, it was an application that was on the table in the department for many months and, for his benefit, that is called due diligence. The government just does not hand out $1.2 million. It is called due diligence. If the application had been dealt with very quickly, from the Senator O’Brien’s perspective the government would no doubt have dealt with it with undue haste.
Again, here we have the ALP seeing projects being developed in regional Australia by the coalition government and it irks them to the back teeth. So they hold an inquiry to have a look at what is going on with Regional Partnerships. When the report is tabled, it will be very interesting to see what they have found. If they were to be believed at the beginning of the inquiry, there would be fraud, corruption and a conspiracy to defraud, which is what I think the Leader of the Opposition said at one stage. Let us see if that is borne out. Let us see if that has any feathers to fly with. I very much doubt it.
For Senator O’Brien to say that the Primary Energy project has a value of $1—that is the insinuation and the innuendo in talking about the way that equity ownership is held in a proprietary company—is grossly unfair and is very typical of the line taken by him. When you cannot find anything wrong with a project—and that is something I will have some more to say about later on this afternoon, I trust, Mr Deputy President—the only thing you can do is play the man. In this instance, sadly, tragically, the opposition is playing the man and trying to denigrate a very good project. I trust that I will be standing here in a year’s time saying that that project is on the way and on the verge of delivering cheap ethanol.
I should also pause to point out that the intellectual property surrounding that project, as Senator O’Brien well knows, was given in evidence in camera to the committee. When he asks about the $1 shareholding, the government is very loath to disclose the business plan model, the underlying technology and all of that sort of stuff because we have our hands tied, and he knows it. It is cheap opportunism. Play the man. Run the insinuation. Run the innuendo and the smear. That is what this is about. This is a fabulous project. Mr Matthew Kelly is the prime mover of the project, and a finer Australian you would not have met. He is a very determined engineer who has committed himself to the project. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I too rise to take note of the answers today from Senator Ian Campbell, or the lack of answers, in relation to the questions that were put to him about the projects funded under the Regional Partnerships program. As Senator Johnston said, the report of the committee on which we both participated will be tabled later this afternoon. I am sure that we will hear much more about that program once the report is tabled. Throughout the inquiry, we actually were very concerned about the processes that Senator O’Brien referred to today. They were the processes that involved decision making and intervention by the minister’s office and by individuals who were members of staff in the minister’s office in decision making and announcements about those projects.
There are two projects that we are concerned about and that we asked questions about today. One is Tumbi Creek, which the minister pooh-poohed as involving a sense of deja vu. But for the people on the Central Coast, the debacle that surrounded the Tumbi Creek case really highlighted what many people in regional Australia are concerned about—that is, the extent to which good policy initiatives of governments of all persuasions can be completely sidelined by political decisions which are inappropriate and which serve the country very poorly and certainly serve regional communities very poorly. When projects are put up like that people are compromised. Individuals who provided evidence to the committee were denigrated and not given a chance to respond or defend themselves. The Tumbi Creek case is one that still has strong resonance on the Central Coast. It is a project that really showed the flaws of the Regional Partnerships program. As such, the minister had the chance today to actually explain and to put on the record the documents that would have allowed some public explanation of the intervention that took place in relation to that project.
I turn now to the question about the Primary Energy project. Again, this is a worthwhile ethanol project. Nobody denies that someone who has a concept for a worthy regional development project should be allowed to pursue funding through the state and federal governments, and the Regional Partnerships program and the Namoi Structural Adjustment Package are appropriate sources of funding to support what is a regional development initiative. But, again, the question comes down to the administration, the transparency of decision-making, and the intervention at ministerial and senior bureaucratic level into the decision-making process. That is, I think, a very fair and reasonable question to have asked the minister today, and, again, he fudged his answer. He fudged—as Senator Johnston tried to do in his response—by trying to suggest that Labor senators and the opposition were trying to denigrate the individuals involved, when in fact it is about holding the government responsible on the issues of accountability, decision making, transparency and understanding that there should be some fairness and equity in how decisions are determined for the Regional Partnerships program.
These were two cases that were considered during the Regional Partnerships inquiry. No-one is going to deny that we have actually had the opportunity to see some fantastic programs being funded under the Regional Partnerships program, but they were fantastic in the sense that there was adherence to process—that the guidelines were actually maintained and reviewed; that the decisions and the processes put in place by the Department of Transport and Regional Services were reflected in the documentation and the decision making that took place to support those projects. What we are concerned about on this side of the chamber is to ensure that regional Australia does get to understand and appreciate a process that is fair for everybody and is not going to be manipulated— (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-10-06,"—It is a pleasure to take note of the answers given by Senator Ian Campbell to questions from members of the opposition. Those questions were inspired and motivated by an intention to denigrate, to degrade and to devalue the merits of the Regional Partnerships program, yet this is one of the most successful Australian government programs in history, in my view.
This is part of a politicisation of that program by the opposition. It started last year when they had a very disappointing election result. They are trying to rewrite history with their efforts to denigrate this program by saying that the government pork-barrelled; that the government used slush funds; that the government was part of a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth to obtain seats in rural and regional Australia. Well, the facts speak for themselves. Let me say this: res ipsa loquitur—the facts speak for themselves. It will be very welcome when that report is tabled, hopefully later today. We will all welcome the facts when they are divulged in that report.
I want to focus on a couple of points and, in particular, on the Tumbi Creek matter that was raised by Senator Carr. In his answer, Senator Campbell referred to Kim Beazley, and a point of order was taken, to say, ‘Why should he be allowed to refer to correspondence from Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition?’ Well, I will tell you why: it was entirely appropriate, because it was the Hon. Kim Beazley, in the other place, on the public record, who asserted that members of the local council, the Wyong Shire Council, were involved in a conspiracy with federal members of parliament in an attempt to defraud the Commonwealth.
I have expressed the view, publicly and privately, that those allegations by the Leader of the Opposition were entirely baseless, but he has made the accusation—this was last year. So, on 9 February 2005, he moved a censure motion against the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, the Hon. Jim Lloyd, for, among other things, conspiring with others to defraud the Commonwealth and specifically directing local Wyong officials who knew the truth to stay silent. Absolute rot! The Leader of the Opposition said that, in the parliament, on the public record.
When asked during our deliberations, on the public record, Mayor Pavier—his name was mispronounced by Senator Carr as ‘Mayor Paver’; his name is Brenton Pavier and he is the Mayor of the Wyong Shire—rejected these claims. At the hearing I asked, ‘So you are not involved in any conspiracy?’, and the mayor said, ‘I have not been involved in any conspiracy.’ It is on the public record. So it was appropriate for Minister Campbell to refer to the Hon. Kim Beazley on this matter, because he is alleging that there was a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. When the report comes down we will all see if there was a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. We will all see if there was so-called pork-barrelling and whether slush funds were used, and the facts will speak for themselves.
You see, the Tumbi Creek matter was very important to the local community. The dredging of Tumbi Creek had many benefits, and it was fully supported by Ken Ticehurst—the indefatigable Ken Ticehurst, a real fighter; he has drive and tenacity, and he is very adamant that his community should get the best of all possible worlds. The Tumbi Creek dredging project is an important project for Ken Ticehurst and the local council, and it had full community support. We actually visited Tumbi Creek. The project was going to deliver a range of outcomes, including mitigating flood risk for residents in the local area, improving the environmental state of the creek and restoring a natural recreational asset to its proper condition.
The opposition members know that, yet they are trying to pull this whole program, this Regional Partnerships program, into disrepute; to denigrate the program. But it is simply one of the most successful programs in history. And, in fact, the benefits show that; for the funding expended to 31 December, 1,000 jobs have been delivered throughout Australia. For every $1 invested, $3— (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Ian Campbell to questions on Regional Partnerships projects in question time today. As all senators and others listening here in the parliament and on the airwaves will recall, at no stage did Senator Campbell attempt to answer the specific questions he was asked. In fact, he effectively treated question time in this Senate with a degree of contempt. In one instance when he was asked questions about the projects, he started to tell us about his plane journey and what in-flight program he was watching, showing total contempt for his role as a minister and the requirement on him to answer questions here in question time.
To go specifically to the two questions that were asked of Senator Ian Campbell, the first regarding the Primary Energy project and the second one regarding the Tumbi Creek project, I just want to remind the Senate of the facts. I say ‘the facts’ because government senators have made assertions about what the facts are. Of course any reading of the evidence from the public hearings by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee—and no doubt people will have an opportunity to read our report later—demonstrates that the facts in both these cases are that due process was not followed, there was a lack of transparency, there was ministerial interference or interference by a minister’s officers and there was abuse of proper accountability processes.
In the case of Primary Energy, I think Senator Stephens made a very good point: what we the opposition are claiming here and what the evidence demonstrates is not that the concept of the project is in any way to be maligned or criticised—certainly, we are not opposed to the Regional Partnerships program; in fact, it was a Labor government that established the area consultative committees which have an integral role in this program and it was a Labor government that established many of the sorts of programs that are now similarly implemented through Regional Partnerships. Now the issue is about process, it is about proper accountability.
The Primary Energy project has been granted, as Senator O’Brien said, $1 million of public funds. If that $1 million is not going to be properly used and accounted for then it means that some other worthwhile project that might have got that $1 million has missed out—and there were plenty of applications made under the Regional Partnerships program that were not successful or were unable to access funding because they were not of a high enough priority. This was a project that was assessed by the Department of Transport and Regional Services as a high-risk project. There was clear confusion in the evidence before our committee as to who was responsible for due diligence: was it the applicant or was it the department? The department did not know. There was a direction by the minister to fast-track approval of the funding for this project, when the department had serious misgivings about it. Evidence was given to the committee that the department’s own advice—its first lot of advice—was changed at the direction of a staff member of the former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson.
That is just a brief summary of what occurred. You have got to ask the question: in those circumstances, was this project approved simply to give political advantage during the period leading up to the last federal election to candidates and members in particular seats? That is what occurred. The same thing occurred with Tumbi Creek. The minister said in his answer that this is a great natural waterway that will be used for leisure activities. The evidence to the committee was that the dredging of that creek would not lead to that result at all. The money should have been spent on other activities. (Time expired)

Introduction

This inquiry into the administration of the Regional Partnerships Program (RPP) and Sustainable Regions Program (SRP) has been extensive, lengthy and important. It was established following allegations raised in parliament and the media about the misuse of the programs in the lead up to the 2004 federal election. Concerns raised included allegations of serious impropriety in the approval and announcement of certain grants, and the discovery that certain procedures governing the administration of the programs had been concealed from public view. Allegations were also made by a member of the House of Representatives that political conditions were placed on several grants made under the Regional Partnerships Program.
Between 2 February and 15 September 2005, the Committee conducted nineteen public hearings across the length and breadth of Australia. The Committee also conducted four site inspections of projects approved under RPP. The Committee took evidence from 99 witnesses at these hearings, and received 56 submissions and seven supplementary submissions.

Obstacles to the conduct of the inquiry

It is unfortunate that the Committee’s examination of the matters referred to it by the Senate was hindered by a lack of cooperation from the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS), the department responsible for the administration of the RP and SR programs. On a number of occasions, DOTARS failed to provide the Committee with timely and accurate information. DOTARS also refused to provide access to departmental witnesses with specific knowledge of the matters examined.
The Committee decided during the inquiry process to seek access to copies of RPP and SRP applications and ACC and SRAC recommendations on these applications. This led to a cost in terms of time and effort as the Committee was forced to seek this information directly from ACCs and SRACs. All ACCs and SRACs eventually provided the information, although some only complied after the Committee ordered them to provide the documents.
Of grave concern, however, were the further attempts of DOTARS to obstruct the inquiry by providing misleading information on two occasions to ACCs and SRACs regarding the powers of Senate committees, the obligations on those bodies to comply with the Committee’s request and the privileges afforded witnesses providing evidence to committees. I was authorised by the Committee to write to DOTARS warning that the dissemination of incorrect advice about committee powers and procedures constitutes interference in the process of the inquiry and may be considered a contempt of the Senate.
Further, at the time of finalising the report the Committee was still awaiting answers to a substantial number of questions taken on notice by the department. Indeed the Committee received hundreds of pages of answers and supporting documentation only yesterday after we had finalised the Report. The Committee understands that the answers had been compiled by the department and provided to the minister’s office some time ago. These delays and failures to respond by both the department and the minister are totally unacceptable and indeed contemptuous as they had had many weeks to provide the information requested.

Misleading Evidence

There are two issues regarding possible misleading evidence to which I need to refer.
The Committee received evidence in answers to questions on notice which contradicted evidence given by Wyong Shire Mayor, Cr Brenton Pavier, at a public hearing on 24 February 2005. The Committee considered that the answers to questions on notice provided a prima facie case that the Mayor’s oral evidence was deliberately false and misleading and therefore may have constituted a contempt of the Senate. The Committee resolved to raise a matter of privilege under standing order 81, and wrote to the President of the Senate asking that he give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges, in accordance with that standing order.
On 5 September 2005 the President made a determination giving precedence to the motion that the matter be referred to the Senate Committee of Privileges. The motion was put to a vote in the Senate on 7 September 2005 and negatived. This was a highly unusual development. Normally, following a determination by the President such motions are passed without debate. The Committee Report records its dismay that on this occasion the Senate departed from longstanding practice.
The second issue concerns the failure by a witness, Mr Greg Maguire, to provide information on donations that he claimed he, or his companies, had made to the federal and state election campaigns funds of Mr Tony Windsor MP. Mr McGuire stated to the Committee that he had made such donations and undertook to provide the details. He subsequently refused to provide the information. Mr Windsor and his former campaign manager, Mr Stephen Hall, denied that Mr Maguire had made any contributions to Mr Windsor’s election campaigns. Given the obligation on both donors and recipients to disclose both cash and in-kind contributions to election campaigns, the Committee is concerned that Mr Maguire may be in breach of the Electoral Act. The Committee therefore intends to refer this matter to the AEC for examination.

Regional Partnerships Program Administration

The Committee’s report provides an overview of administrative aspects of RPP, including the program guidelines, assessment and approval procedures, funds approved, and evaluations and reviews of the program. A number of concerns with the accountability of aspects of the program are raised. Areas of particular concern include the use of the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation (SONA) procedures to approve projects that do not meet the published RPP eligibility criteria, political bias in the levels of funding approved across electorates and the striking increase in funding approvals prior to the 2004 federal election. Analysis of grants approved from the commencement of the program through to 31 December 2004 shows that over half of the total funding approved in this period was approved in the three months preceding the election announcement.

Area Consultative Committees (ACCs)

ACCs fulfil two key roles in relation to the RP program—providing information and assisting proponents in developing applications, and providing comments and recommendations to the department on applications made from their region. ACCs also have primary responsibility for promoting the program. The Committee received generally favourable evidence regarding the competence and effectiveness of the ACCs in performing these roles, and the dedication of ACC members and staff to the progress of their regions.
The Committee considers that the involvement of ACCs in RPP application development is an important safeguard for ensuring that applications are of a high standard and meet the program guidelines. The Committee also considers that the ACCs’ comments on applications provide an important source of advice and means of assessing the local priority given to projects.
According to administrative procedures for RPP, applications should be automatically referred to the relevant ACC, and ten working days allowed for the ACC to provide comments and recommendations. However, the Committee became aware of applications that were not forwarded to ACCs for comment, or where the ACCs were given insufficient time to consider and rate the applications. The Committee considers that in bypassing the ACC review process, the department sidestepped an integral part of the assessment process.

Case studies

The Committee examined in detail the circumstances surrounding the application, assessment, approval and announcement of RPP grants for six projects namely:
The Beaudesert Rail heritage railway;
Dredging at Tumbi Creek;
Primary Energy Pty Ltd’s grains to ethanol plant proposal;
A2 Dairy Marketers’ milk processing plant proposal;
The Australian Equine and Livestock Centre; and
The University Of New England National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia.
These case studies point to serious deficiencies in the transparency and accountability of processes by which projects are brought forward, considered and approved for funding under RPP. In some cases, evidence points to undue political pressure to expedite grant approval and announcement at the detriment of sound application development and assessment. While the Committee recognises that many beneficial projects have been funded under the program, these six case studies involve grants totalling in excess of $15.5 million. They demonstrate that there is significant scope for improving the administration, accountability and transparency of RPP.
I would like to just comment briefly on a couple of the projects that were examined in detail by the Committee.

Beaudesert Rail

The Beaudesert Rail (BR) was the recipient of four Commonwealth Government grants totalling $5.7 million. These comprised a grant of $75,000 plus GST to produce a business and marketing plan; $5 million from the Centenary of Federation fund to develop and operate a heritage railway; $10,000 plus GST for a report on BR’s financial position and suggestions for a way forward; and a $600,000 grant under the RP program.
The Committee concluded that the $600,000 RPP grant to BR approved in November 2003, was made for political purposes. Documents provided in evidence to the Committee reveal that in the final days leading up to the decision to provide BR with an RPP grant rather than a loan, the then Deputy Prime Minister, The Hon John Anderson MP, who was also the portfolio minister for RPP, was involved in discussions with the Prime Minister’s office about the matter of government assistance for Beaudesert Rail. It appears that this was when the proposed form of assistance changed from a loan to an RPP grant. DOTARS was still unaware of this change the day before the grant was approved and was continuing to work on the basis that any funding would be in the form of a loan.
This project completely bypassed the program’s normal assessment procedures. Besides DOTARS being cut out of the process, BR was not required to make an application for RPP funding and the relevant ACC was not given an opportunity to comment on the project. Evidence also shows that the department was not satisfied that the project was financially viable and was still seeking evidence of the project’s prospects of solvency just days before the grant was approved.
The Committee considers that the BR grant serves as a warning of the effects of expediting projects without undertaking adequate due diligence checks. Beaudesert Rail’s financial viability was marginal at best (it was under administration at the time of the RP grant) and it ceased operation in August 2004. Creditors took possession of its assets in February 2005.
The manner in which the government resorted to using program funds for the BR grant reveals the disregard on the part of its most senior ministers for the RPP guidelines. It is one of several examples the Committee found of the virtually unfettered discretion in the hands of ministers under this program. The other striking aspect of the BR case is that program funds were used to achieve a political outcome in a government-held electorate following direct intervention from the Prime Minister.

Tumbi Creek

Two grants totalling $1.49b million to Wyong Shire Council for dredging work at the mouth of Tumbi Creek were approved by Parliamentary Secretary De-Anne Kelly in mid- 2004. The Committee was concerned about the allocation of such a large grant to a project with limited beneficiaries which provided a short-term rather than a long-term solution, particularly given that sustainability is an important feature of the RPP project viability criteria.
The Tumbi Creek dredging grant applications were assessed and approved within remarkably short time frames when compared with many other RPP grants. Departmental witnesses advised the Committee that the Parliamentary Secretary’s office had requested that the department give the project priority.
The Committee is particularly concerned that the haste with which these grants were approved meant that normal application development and assessment processes were circumvented. On the advice of a ministerial staffer the Council submitted its applications directly to DOTARS, rather than preparing the applications in consultation with the relevant ACC. The Committee received evidence that the relevant ACC had a number of concerns about the project, yet the ACC’s comments on the first application were not forwarded to the Parliamentary Secretary before the funding decision was made and the ACC was not provided with a copy of the second application.
A high degree of political collaboration involving ministerial advisers, the federal member’s office and members or officials of the Council was evident in relation to this particular RPP project. In one instance, involving a ministerial adviser countermanding departmental advice, the Committee considers that the communication was entirely inappropriate and is evidence of wider concerns about the unchecked growth in the power of ministerial staffers.
The lack of necessary state licences, required before the dredging work could proceed, is another example of the haste with which this grant was approved and announced. The latitude in the RPP guidelines meant that while the dredging project remained effectively ineligible to actually receive funding until the relevant approvals and licences were obtained, the grant announcement could still be made. RPP funding for the dredging work was announced by the Prime Minister in a marginal electorate just days before the 2004 federal election was announced. Yet, as at mid-August 2005, a funding agreement for the project still had not been entered into.

Primary Energy

The Committee’s examination of the Primary Energy Project highlights concerns about the administration of applications made under one program but funded another.
DOTARS admitted that the Primary Energy application fell outside the RP guidelines and assessed the project as “high risk”. The Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation (SONA) procedures were therefore used to circumvent the RP eligibility restrictions and fast-track the approval following a request from a minister.
The area of gravest concern about the Primary Energy project relates to the ministerial involvement in the department’s assessment of the application. The direction from one minister to the department to expedite the application to allow funding to be provided within two weeks seemed to pre-empt any rigorous assessment of the project. The Committee found that the on final departmental advice to the minister on the application was altered following the intervention of Mr Anderson’s chief of staff at senior levels in the department. Although departmental officers gave conflicting evidence on the chain of events leading to the change of advice, evidence from the former acting secretary of the department at the time reveals that the revised advice differed markedly from the department’s original advice.
This was not only another example of the high degree to which ministerial offices intervened in certain projects but also a case which transgressed the department’s practice of quarantining ministers from decisions related to applications from their own electorates. Because the application concerned a project in Minister Anderson’s electorate, neither the minister nor any of his staff should have been involved in any way with the decision making on the project.
The electoral division of New England featured prominently in the inquiry due to the proliferation of issues that emerged about the operation of the Regional Partnerships Program in that electorate. The Committee examined allegations that the Independent member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor MP was offered an inducement not to stand for the seat of New England at the 2004. federal election. The issues also included his claims that political conditions were put on grants made to three projects in the New England electorate.
Mr Windsor claimed that the grant to the Australian Equine and Livestock Centre, which was announced in September 2004 as a $6 million election commitment to be funded from RPP, was made conditional on his removal. from the equine centre working group. He claimed that this condition had been imposed to prevent him taking credit for the project. The Committee found that there was at least a perception among some people involved in seeking an RP grant for the project that Mr Windsor’s involvement would not be helpful in obtaining funding. However, the evidence was not conclusive that any such condition had been imposed on the grant.
Allegations of electoral bribery were investigated by the Committee in the context of Mr Windsor’s claims regarding the equine centre grant. This matter was also the subject of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police, which had found that no further action was necessary. Mr Windsor alleged that an intermediary, Mr Greg Maguire (the chair of the equine centre working group), had offered him an inducement on behalf of the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon John Anderson MP, and Senator Sandy Macdonald. The Committee received conflicting evidence. Without compelling and incontrovertible evidence, a committee of the Senate cannot make an adverse finding against a Senator or Member who has denied the allegations made against him. In the case of the alleged inducement, the evidence is not sufficient for this Committee to depart from that principle.
Mr Windsor also alleged that staff members of the University of New England had received a $4.95 million RPP grant for the National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia (SiMERR) in return for favourable comment in a local newspaper about the National Party. The Committee found that the National Party sought to obtain political advantage from the grant by way of advertisements carried in the local newspapers at the time of the centre’s official opening, and the university did not act appropriately in having its SiMERR advertisement appear with a party political advertisement. But the Committee found there was no evidence to prove Mr Windsor’s allegation about ‘cash for comment’.
In the case of the allegations about the opening of the Grace Munro Centre, which was not the subject of an RPP grant, the Committee believes that Senator Macdonald’s attempt to exclude Mr Windsor from the opening was inappropriate.

The Sustainable Regions Program

The Committee examined a second regional development program —the Sustainable Regions Program (SRP), which aimed to assist ten regions facing major economic, social or environmental change. The Committee’s examination of the Sustainable Regions Program raised questions about the basis on which the participant regions were selected and haw members of the Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees (SRACs) were chosen. DOTARS declined to provide the Committee with evidence on these matters on the grounds that they were ministerial decisions.
The Committee noted that the due diligence process for Sustainable Regions applications is more rigorous than the Regional Partnerships requirements. It is of particular interest that due diligence checks are conducted prior to the SRAC recommendation and the department’s advice being presented to the minister, in contrast to the practice found in some cases with RPP where due diligence checks only occurred after funding had been announced. Had this process existed under RPP, several of the failed projects investigated by the Committee may have been avoided.

The Atherton Tablelands Sustainable Region Advisory Committee

The Atherton Tablelands Sustainable Region Advisory Committee (ATSRAC) was the subject of a large amount of evidence to the inquiry. The evidence from members of the Atherton Tablelands community was overwhelmingly negative, and focused on perceptions of conflict of interest arising from the presence of four local mayors on ATSRAC, concerns about the inconsistent application of SRP guidelines, the lack of transparency of the application process and allegations of misplaced regional priorities. The Committee found that ATSRAC has little credibility with members of the community because of the number of projects that had failed or been viewed as unworthy.
The Committee notes that ultimately, responsibility for the composition and functionality of the ATSRAC board rests with the minister who appointed it. The Committee also recognises the difficult position of the mayors, who were elected to represent their shire but required, as members of ATSRAC, to subsume the interests of the shire under a strategic view of regional benefit. However, these tensions may not have been problematic had ATSRAC been appointed with a more balanced membership.
The three projects discussed in detail, JAM Custom Kitchens, the Atherton Hotel and Kalamunda Ecostay, raised concerns relating to competitive neutrality, conflict of interest and the lack of transparency of the application process. These projects highlight the inherent difficulties in providing government grants to the private sector, namely that while a grant may have a particular purpose, it frees up capital for other purposes (for example, in the case of the Atherton Hotel, the purchase of poker machines), raises due diligence and competitive neutrality questions and can create fractures in small and already fragile communities. This particularly applies if the grant process is not seen as transparent, rigorous and equitably accessible.

Findings and recommendations

In general terms, the Committee’s inquiry found that the main processes by which projects are proposed, considered and approved for funding under the Regional Partnerships Program are reasonably sound, although there is scope for strengthening these processes and building more rigour and transparency into the governance framework. The Committee makes a series of recommendations that would make it mandatory for all applications to be developed in consultation with ACCs and for ACCs to have a minimum of ten working days to consider all relevant applications. The Committee considers that involvement of the ACCs in the application development process is an important safeguard for the RP program. Multi-region funding applications would also have to be referred to all relevant ACCs under the improved assessment procedures that the Committee recommends DOTARS develops.
To assist ACCs to perform this enhanced role, the Committee recommends a review of the resourcing of ACCs and enhanced training of committee members and staff, as well as the adoption of three-year operational funding contracts to support strategic planning. It also recommends the Government conducts a review of the role of ACCs to ensure their contribution to regional. development is maximised.
The Committee considers that greater transparency around the RP program is required to allow the Parliament to monitor this significant area of expenditure and as a check on arbitrariness and politicisation. It recommends that a biannual statement be tabled in the Senate that lists information basic to providing an adequate level of scrutiny of the program, including all RP grants approved in the preceding six months, the department’s and ACC’s recommendations for each grant and a statement of reasons for decisions which are inconsistent with departmental and/or ACC recommendations.
The Committee also recommends that ACC recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants on request.
In the Committee’s view, the SONA procedures represent a fundamental accountability black hole and need to be removed. They expand the scope for departmental and ministerial discretion to unacceptable limits, providing a default to fund projects without reference to the program criteria/guidelines. The Committee recommends that the SOMA guidelines be abolished.
The Committee also concluded that the processes and procedures of the Sustainable Regions Program appear to be broadly sound, but its examination of SR projects in the Atherton Tablelands region highlighted problems arising from an insufficiently representative SRAC structure, opaque processes for appointing SRAC members and a lack of transparency around application processes. It makes recommendations to address those deficiencies.
To strengthen the governance framework for both programs, the Committee recommends that projects must have obtained relevant approvals or licences to be eligible for RP or SR funding. Similarly, it recommends that no program funding be approved for projects that fail to meet either program’s guidelines and other tests including proper due diligence. It also calls for due diligence processes and competitive neutrality procedures to be strengthened.
One of the major areas of concern to emerge from the inquiry surrounds the role of ministers and their staff. The Committee found that current arrangements are not adequate to mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest. It is also deeply concerned by the intervention by ministerial offices in the department’s assessment processes which the Committee considers was inappropriate and antithetical to the principle of the public service providing frank and impartial advice to ministers. While the Committee, on balance, supports the retention of ministerial discretion for each program, it recommends that ministers, parliamentary secretaries and their staff should be prevented from intervening in the assessment of grants. It also recommends strengthening existing measures to keep ministers at .arm’s length from applications that originate from their own electorates.
The finding that over half of grants approvals occurred in the three months leading to the federal election announcement in 2004 is another critical area of concern. This can only feed allegations of ‘pork barrelling’ with these programs and. increase perceptions of bias, particularly in the context of election campaigns. The Committee recommends improved procedures to enhance the accountability of ministers during the sensitive period leading up to federal election campaigns.
I conclude, as is also stated in the incorporated speech, by recording the committee’s thanks to the secretariat staff—Alistair Sands, Terry Brown, Lisa Fenn, Melinda Noble and Alex Hodgson—for their sterling efforts during the inquiry. They had thousands of pages of submissions and documentary material to read and collate, as well as having to organise an extensive series of public hearings and help finalise a lengthy report. They were a great team and we could not function without them. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I would like to commence, of course, where the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee left off, and that is by thanking the secretariat. There are reports which are much easier for the secretariat to handle than this one. The physical load on the secretariat and the task required of them was immense indeed. The committee and the Senate should be grateful for their efforts—I certainly am.
The inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions Program, which is the subject of this report, in my view revealed the Senate at its best. I was a little surprised at the somewhat exaggerated tone—I will not use the word ‘hysterical’—of the government’s minority. Whilst it was indeed a highly politicised and political issue, in the end it showed that the Senate expresses itself well when it has to adjudicate on these matters. And a very fair outcome resulted.
A hot political question was handed to the Senate to answer. That question was: did the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, and Senator Sandy Macdonald offer an inducement to independent member of the House of Representatives Tony Windsor to vacate his seat? The answer to that question, as produced by the evidence, was unequivocally no, and those two members of parliament are cleared by the report. The evidence presented to the committee revealed that it was the chairman of the board of the National Equine and Livestock Centre, Mr Greg Maguire, who caused Mr Windsor and his associates to have that belief. I must say that, in making those remarks, I am personally pleased because Senator Macdonald is known to me. I like the man, I respect him and I am glad that he has been relieved of the burden of the allegation. And, of course, with respect to the former Deputy Prime Minister, I have always found him to be a straightforward and genuine person to deal with.
The second hot question placed on the committee’s agenda related to the use of the government’s Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions Program for political pork-barrelling. Again, the committee has been unequivocal in continuing to support the maintenance and continuance of the Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions Program. But, with respect to the issue of political pork-barrelling and a perception of that occurring, the answer the committee provides to that question is, ‘Yes, in part.’ The committee did find evidence that, in a minority of instances, there was political interference and poor process, particularly in pre-election periods. The committee has recommended an accountability facelift, which is needed to restore the credibility and overall value of the programs. I believe the committee’s recommendations are the right nip and tuck for these programs.
Unless the government reacts favourably to the majority of the committee’s recommendations, the programs will continue to be treated with great suspicion in the media and by the public. It is critical that the government introduces greater probity, accountability and process improvements to the programs. I know it is the job of government senators to defend the government and it is the job of opposition senators to attack them but, when all sides of parliament are in agreement as to the need for programs like this, it is incumbent on everyone to fix the problems that have been identified. One of the immediate problems you have with any issue of ministerial discretion is that the closer you come to an election the greater the temptation is for those involved with the political process, including or perhaps especially staff members, to get overanxious and to start to interfere in processes which should be kept at arms-length and be handled properly.
In that respect, I draw the attention of the Senate to the recommendation that, when the minister’s decision to approve or not approve a grant is different to the recommendation of either the area consultative committee or the department, or the funding amount approved by the minister is different to the amount recommended, then the grant approval decision should be made in conjunction with the relevant shadow minister. That would be in the period from 1 July preceding a general election. The committee then recommended that all grants approved in those circumstances should be announced jointly by the minister and the shadow minister. That would then address the issue of ministerial discretion nearing an election, which raises other problems.
I want to compliment the chair not only on producing this report in difficult political circumstances but on introducing to the Senate another report which is equally as important and which should be read, in my view, in conjunction with this report. I refer, of course, to the work of the same Senate committee, the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, and its report entitled Staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 of October 2003. Recommendation 2 of that report says in part:
The Committee recommends that the government should make ministerial staff available to appear before parliamentary committees in the following circumstances:
And the fourth and fifth dot points read:
Critical or important information or instructions have been received by a minister’s office but not communicated to the minister; or
A government program is administered to a significant extent by government MOPS staff.
This is an issue that this inquiry exposed again—that is, the involvement of ministerial staff in executive actions. Recommendation 12 of that same report is:
The Committee recommends that the MOPS Act be amended to require that the Prime Minister promulgate a code of conduct for ministerial staff.
To my knowledge, that has still not happened. Recommendation 20 says:
The Committee recommends that all departments provide written guidance to staff regarding interactions with minister’s offices, and that all senior staff receive adequate training in this area.
You can see that what I am concentrating on is the danger in the circumstances where ministerial discretion applies. It is ministerial discretion that you have to be particularly careful about. I welcome the committee’s recommendations as not just trying to fence off ministerial discretion in an appropriate manner without removing it but trying to ensure that the issues of integrity, probity and good process are not only maintained but are drastically improved with respect to the way in which these programs are carried out.
In conclusion, I want to remind senators of the two fundamental conclusions of the report. The first is that the minister and the senator who were the subject of allegations are found not to have been at fault. Secondly, the programs, in a minority of cases, do exhibit some real accountability issues, and those recommendations will address that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-10-06,"—It is an honour to stand here to speak to the report—in particular, the government senators’ report—which has been tabled today. I will be dealing with three main areas in the report. Firstly, there are the allegations of the most serious kind with respect to the former Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Sandy Macdonald. Secondly, I will be talking about the merits of the Regional Partnerships program. Thirdly, there are the accusations of pork-barrelling, slush funds, conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth et cetera made by the Labor members of the parliament in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
Firstly, I want to say that the allegations made with respect to the Hon. John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, were in my view designed to defame and discredit his good name and his reputation as a member of parliament and indeed as an Australian citizen. The accusations were also made with respect to the involvement of Nationals Senator Sandy Macdonald. Despite the Australian Federal Police finding no case to answer against the two men named in relation to the allegations of corruption and an inducement to leave politics and despite the fact that that Federal Police finding was delivered prior to this inquiry proceeding, the Labor senators in this place persisted with the inquiry in one of the most scurrilous acts, in my view, to besmirch the good name of a man who is held in the highest regard across all quarters of this nation. It was for me one of the low points of my political career in this Senate to date. In my view, Labor should be ashamed of themselves in their pursuit to damage the reputation of the Hon. John Anderson and Senator Sandy Macdonald.
The report has found no case to answer. In fact, not only that but the report found that the allegations of Mr Tony Windsor were in fact wrong in matters of fact. The matter had been addressed and dismissed, as I said, even before the Senate referred this inquiry to the committee for examination and report. The allegations made by Mr Windsor seriously impugn the reputation and integrity of the former Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Macdonald and, despite the AFP’s finding, Mr Windsor did not withdraw the allegation or publicly apologise at the time, nor has he done so since, for his assertions. So the government senators, as is set out in our report, consider that Mr Windsor should publicly withdraw and regret his allegations and should apologise on the public record to both the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, and Senator Macdonald for his derogatory and defamatory statements. I hope that now he will consider this report and do exactly that.
Secondly, in terms of the merits of the program, I want to say that this is one of the most successful government programs in history. It delivers outstanding returns for and on behalf of the taxpayer. Specifically, I would like to say that, for every $1 invested by the Australian government there is $3 invested by other partners. In terms of state Labor governments, who in fact support the program, for every $1 the Australian government puts in they put in 93c, so it is nearly dollar for dollar. It is indeed an outstanding return on investment. That is, in anybody’s book, a $3 return for a $1 investment. In terms of job creation, for every $50,000 expended there are three jobs in the short term, moving to four jobs in the longer term. Again, that is a great result.
In terms of the accusations by the Labor Party of pork-barrelling, a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth and slush funds, let us have a look at the projects and the program and how it works. Of the Regional Partnerships projects approved, the ALP-held seats had a higher approval rate than the coalition-held seats: 78 per cent to 76 per cent, which is almost exactly the same. That dispels in any way, shape or form the accusations by the Labor Party of pork-barrelling. The approval rates are the same.
Interestingly, when you look at areas in the provincial or remote categories it puts to rest any claims of politicisation. The eight electorates held by ALP members before the 2004 election received $7.51 million, more than double the $3.16 million of Regional Partnerships funding received by the eight provincial seats held by the coalition members. So that is further evidence.
In terms of the veracity of the audit reports, let us just say that there were three internal reviews by the respected independent consultants, KPMG, and five external reviews of the program. There were no findings of maladministration or wrongdoing in the management of the Regional Partnerships program. It can be proven that the ALP have embarked on a costly and, in my view, wasteful attempt to rewrite the history of the 2004 federal election for their own purposes because they have shown contempt for regional areas in Australia. I hope they will consider the report and reflect on that and make amends for it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-10-06,"—This report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee will prove to be a millstone around the neck of this tarnished government. It shows what millions of Australians have known for a very long time: that the Howard government will do whatever it takes to maintain its grasp on power. For nine long years this government has shamelessly plundered public resources to buttress its political fortunes. As the highest taxing government in Australia, it has had no shortage of resources at its disposal.
It needs to be said at the outset that the Howard government did not want this inquiry into Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions to proceed. It opposed the inquiry reference and obstructed the proceedings of the committee in every conceivable way. The government refused to produce departmental witnesses, withheld critical information about project approvals, provided the committee with erroneous information that took months to correct the record and wrote to some potential witnesses encouraging them to ignore the committee’s request for assistance. So great was this obstruction that the committee draws attention to it in its report.
The report also notes the committee’s dismay at the government’s handling of concern about potential misleading evidence given by the Liberal Mayor of Wyong Shire, Councillor Brenton Pavier, during the committee’s inquiry. The committee resolved that evidence from Councillor Pavier in connection with the infamous Tumbi Creek grant may have been deliberately false and misleading and have constituted a contempt of the Senate. Last month, the President of the Senate gave precedence to a motion that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee but, consistent with the government’s abuse of its majority in this place since 1 July, it denied the Privileges Committee the opportunity to consider the matter. It was an outrageous decision that served to cover up the tawdry relationship between Councillor Pavier and the office of Minister Lloyd in connection with the Tumbi grant and demonstrated utter contempt for the only thing that really matters in the Senate committee system: the truth.
This report details the outrageous abuse of the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs—an abuse that gathered momentum in the lead-up to 2004 election. As a result of this committee’s inquiry, most Australians know that many grants were approved against departmental and/or local advisory committee advice. They know that many grants were approved despite the fact that they fell outside the published program guidelines. As a result of Labor’s scrutiny, the Australian people have learnt that the Howard government operated a set of shadowy guidelines that meant that any Regional Partnerships program could be approved, no matter what.
What I think will shock readers of this report is the extent to which the government abused the Regional Partnerships program, in particular in the three months preceding the calling of last year’s federal election. Analysis based on the government’s own data shows that in June, July and August 2004, Regional Partnerships grants worth more than $71 million were approved—more than one half of all the approved funding since the commencement of the program on 1 July 2003. It is not just the timing of Regional Partnerships grant approvals that exposed the government’s abuse of this program; the distribution of funds tells another damning tale contrary to the submission that was put to us before. Analysis of approved Regional Partnerships grants to 31 December 2004 shows that in rural seats the average amount of funding approved for government held seats was $1.5 million; for Labor seats, $1.1 million; and for Independent seats targeted by the National Party, $4.9 million. In metropolitan seats, the average amount of funding received by the government held seats was $180,000, while Labor seats received just half that amount—and that was in metropolitan seats for a regional program.
This report lays bare the Howard government’s rorting of regional funding programs to achieve political goals, not sustainable regional development outcomes. So comprehensive has the abuse of regional funding been that many projects funded under Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions have become bywords for rorting. A number of them—Beaudesert Rail, Tumbi Creek, A2 Dairy Marketers, Primary Energy and the Atherton Hotel—are examined as case studies in this report. Cumulatively, the value of the five projects I have just named exceeds $5 million—that is, $5 million to fund a steam train that would not go, a creek that dredged itself, a milk company that folded before the ink on the funding announcement was dry, an ethanol company worth $1 that has yet to produce a drop of fuel and a hotel funded to run ‘wacky Wednesdays’ and stunt bikini babes, while other communities on the Atherton Tableland cry out for potable drinking water.
The extent of the pre-election pork-barrelling catalogued in this report will shock Australians. I also think the detailed examination of assessment and approval processes for selected grants will surprise many, including members of the press gallery who have grown relaxed and comfortable—perhaps too relaxed and comfortable, I might say—with the abuse of office by the Howard government. With respect to the government, the architects of the rorted regional programs under examination, I do not expect that much will change. The thin and partisan minority report issued by government senators suggests as much. In yesterday’s Australian newspaper, economics editor Alan Wood says:
Regional development is a polite euphemism for keeping Nationals happy ...
Sadly, under this government, he is right. The Howard government has no commitment, none whatsoever, to the development of Australia’s regions. The only commitment it has is a commitment to maintaining office, whatever the cost. Nonetheless, I do urge the government, or at least the handful of its members who after nine long years still care about the quaint concept of propriety of office and good governance, to read the majority committee report and take heed of its conclusions and recommendations.
It would be remiss of me not to thank Senator Forshaw, the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, and recognise the fair and even-handed manner in which he conducted this inquiry. I also acknowledge fellow Labor Senators Carr, Stephens and McLucas and Democrats Senator Murray, who contributed so ably to the committee’s work on this. I do note that Senators Johnston and Barnett have attended and have sought to defend the government as best they can against this litany of irrefutable accusations which we level against them.
I think all members of the committee, whether they are signatories to the majority report or not, would extend their sincere thanks to the committee secretariat, including the secretary, Mr Alistair Sands, and his staff, Ms Lisa Fenn, Ms Alex Hodgson and Ms Melinda Noble, who travelled with the committee and did an extensive amount of work assisting in pulling together the vast array of written material that the committee received. Let me also thank Hansard and the sound and vision staff, who provided this inquiry with the same sterling service they provide to all committees. I conclude by noting that this inquiry has shone a bright light on one of the dark recesses of this government. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-10-06,"—Regional Partnerships has proved to be one of the best pieces of public policy ever enacted in the history of our federation. Standing alongside recent projects such as Roads to Recovery, this program has delivered more jobs, more investment and more development in regional Australia than any project in recent history.
I categorise the opposition’s theme in this report in one word: disappointment. There is disappointment that there was no evidence and no capability or possibility of a finding against former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson; disappointment that there was nothing to support the scurrilous accusations of coercion against Senator Sandy Macdonald; and disappointment that there was absolutely no evidence such as would substantiate any case against Mayor Pavier, no evidence against Minister Kelly and no sustainable evidence against Mr Maguire. Disappointment is the word that categorises all of the matters behind this majority report. I quote from page 16 of the introduction to the report:
Without compelling and incontrovertible evidence, a committee of the Senate cannot make an adverse finding against a Senator or Member who has denied the allegations made against him. In the case of the alleged inducement—
this is talking about former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson—
the evidence is not sufficient for this Committee to depart from that principle.
Further on, it says:
... the Committee found there was no evidence to prove Mr Windsor’s allegation about ‘cash for comment’.
These are the facts. If you had listened to Senator O’Brien, you would think that they had found a smoking gun. But this is the truth—they found nothing. With respect to my good friend and colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald, the report says:
There is no evidence, however, that the Senator attempted to coerce or threaten the council, even when it became apparent that the council intended to proceed to invite Mr Windsor to participate in the opening.
There was no evidence. That was the foundation of this inquiry. That is why we travelled Australia—in the vain hope that Labor would be able to stick something on these good men. And they have stuck nothing on them—absolutely nothing. We have page after page of fabulous reference to a magnificent piece of public policy. The government senators make no bones about the fact that Regional Partnerships is something that must go on. The hard work of the volunteers in the area consultative committees needs to be acknowledged. I congratulate them on their volunteer work and for the things they do for their communities. They are the unsung heroes out there in the bush.
De-Anne Kelly is much maligned by the Labor Party. In the few minutes I have left, let me recite what was said about her by a witness. She wanted to support A2 Milk, which actually paid 50c a litre to dairy farmers. Mr Stewart, who gave evidence on behalf of that organisation, said:
We walked into De-Anne Kelly’s office that day and I said, ‘The farmers are desperate and, because of the government levy, they are going to the wall. It was supposed to help them.’ I said, ‘We actually pay 50c a litre, where some are only getting 29c and 31c.’
In answer to a further question, Mr Stewart said:
She said, ‘How can you do that?’
He explained to her the benefits of A2 Milk and went through setting out the possibilities of farmers receiving a decent return. He said—and it is on the Hansard, in the committee records—that she conducted herself in an exemplary fashion and would not sit with him because he was a candidate or applicant for money. There is an absolute vindication of Minister Kelly in the way that she has conducted herself in all of this. I am very pleased and proud to say that she had the dairy farmers’ best interests at the forefront of her mind at all times. That is a lot more than can ever be said about the opposition senators, who went through this witch-hunt for no real reason. I thank the committee secretariat for their hard work—for no really good reason, unfortunately. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Introduction

This inquiry into the administration of the Regional Partnerships Program (RPP) and Sustainable Regions Program (SRP) has been extensive, lengthy and important. It was established following allegations raised in parliament and the media about the misuse of the programs in the lead up to the 2004 federal election. Concerns raised included allegations of serious impropriety in the approval and announcement of certain grants, and the discovery that certain procedures governing the administration of the programs had been concealed from public view. Allegations were also made by a member of the House of Representatives that political conditions were placed on several grants made under the Regional Partnerships Program.
Between 2 February and 15 September 2005, the Committee conducted nineteen public hearings across the length and breadth of Australia. The Committee also conducted four site inspections of projects approved under RPP. The Committee took evidence from 99 witnesses at these hearings, and received 56 submissions and seven supplementary submissions.

Obstacles to the conduct of the inquiry

It is unfortunate that the Committee’s examination of the matters referred to it by the Senate was hindered by a lack of cooperation from the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS), the department responsible for the administration of the RP and SR programs. On a number of occasions, DOTARS failed to provide the Committee with timely and accurate information. DOTARS also refused to provide access to departmental witnesses with specific knowledge of the matters examined.
The Committee decided during the inquiry process to seek access to copies of RPP and SRP applications and ACC and SRAC recommendations on these applications. This led to a cost in terms of time and effort as the Committee was forced to seek this information directly from ACCs and SRACs. All ACCs and SRACs eventually provided the information, although some only complied after the Committee ordered them to provide the documents.
Of grave concern, however, were the further attempts of DOTARS to obstruct the inquiry by providing misleading information on two occasions to ACCs and SRACs regarding the powers of Senate committees, the obligations on those bodies to comply with the Committee’s request and the privileges afforded witnesses providing evidence to committees. I was authorised by the Committee to write to DOTARS warning that the dissemination of incorrect advice about committee powers and procedures constitutes interference in the process of the inquiry and may be considered a contempt of the Senate.
Further, at the time of finalising the report the Committee was still awaiting answers to a substantial number of questions taken on notice by the department. Indeed the Committee received hundreds of pages of answers and supporting documentation only yesterday after we had finalised the Report. The Committee understands that the answers had been compiled by the department and provided to the minister’s office some time ago. These delays and failures to respond by both the department and the minister are totally unacceptable and indeed contemptuous as they had had many weeks to provide the information requested.

Misleading Evidence

There are two issues regarding possible misleading evidence to which I need to refer.
The Committee received evidence in answers to questions on notice which contradicted evidence given by Wyong Shire Mayor, Cr Brenton Pavier, at a public hearing on 24 February 2005. The Committee considered that the answers to questions on notice provided a prima facie case that the Mayor’s oral evidence was deliberately false and misleading and therefore may have constituted a contempt of the Senate. The Committee resolved to raise a matter of privilege under standing order 81, and wrote to the President of the Senate asking that he give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges, in accordance with that standing order.
On 5 September 2005 the President made a determination giving precedence to the motion that the matter be referred to the Senate Committee of Privileges. The motion was put to a vote in the Senate on 7 September 2005 and negatived. This was a highly unusual development. Normally, following a determination by the President such motions are passed without debate. The Committee Report records its dismay that on this occasion the Senate departed from longstanding practice.
The second issue concerns the failure by a witness, Mr Greg Maguire, to provide information on donations that he claimed he, or his companies, had made to the federal and state election campaigns funds of Mr Tony Windsor MP. Mr McGuire stated to the Committee that he had made such donations and undertook to provide the details. He subsequently refused to provide the information. Mr Windsor and his former campaign manager, Mr Stephen Hall, denied that Mr Maguire had made any contributions to Mr Windsor’s election campaigns. Given the obligation on both donors and recipients to disclose both cash and in-kind contributions to election campaigns, the Committee is concerned that Mr Maguire may be in breach of the Electoral Act. The Committee therefore intends to refer this matter to the AEC for examination.

Regional Partnerships Program Administration

The Committee’s report provides an overview of administrative aspects of RPP, including the program guidelines, assessment and approval procedures, funds approved, and evaluations and reviews of the program. A number of concerns with the accountability of aspects of the program are raised. Areas of particular concern include the use of the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation (SONA) procedures to approve projects that do not meet the published RPP eligibility criteria, political bias in the levels of funding approved across electorates and the striking increase in funding approvals prior to the 2004 federal election. Analysis of grants approved from the commencement of the program through to 31 December 2004 shows that over half of the total funding approved in this period was approved in the three months preceding the election announcement.

Area Consultative Committees (ACCs)

ACCs fulfil two key roles in relation to the RP program—providing information and assisting proponents in developing applications, and providing comments and recommendations to the department on applications made from their region. ACCs also have primary responsibility for promoting the program. The Committee received generally favourable evidence regarding the competence and effectiveness of the ACCs in performing these roles, and the dedication of ACC members and staff to the progress of their regions.
The Committee considers that the involvement of ACCs in RPP application development is an important safeguard for ensuring that applications are of a high standard and meet the program guidelines. The Committee also considers that the ACCs’ comments on applications provide an important source of advice and means of assessing the local priority given to projects.
According to administrative procedures for RPP, applications should be automatically referred to the relevant ACC, and ten working days allowed for the ACC to provide comments and recommendations. However, the Committee became aware of applications that were not forwarded to ACCs for comment, or where the ACCs were given insufficient time to consider and rate the applications. The Committee considers that in bypassing the ACC review process, the department sidestepped an integral part of the assessment process.

Case studies

The Committee examined in detail the circumstances surrounding the application, assessment, approval and announcement of RPP grants for six projects namely:
The Beaudesert Rail heritage railway;
Dredging at Tumbi Creek;
Primary Energy Pty Ltd’s grains to ethanol plant proposal;
A2 Dairy Marketers’ milk processing plant proposal;
The Australian Equine and Livestock Centre; and
The University Of New England National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia.
These case studies point to serious deficiencies in the transparency and accountability of processes by which projects are brought forward, considered and approved for funding under RPP. In some cases, evidence points to undue political pressure to expedite grant approval and announcement at the detriment of sound application development and assessment. While the Committee recognises that many beneficial projects have been funded under the program, these six case studies involve grants totalling in excess of $15.5 million. They demonstrate that there is significant scope for improving the administration, accountability and transparency of RPP.
I would like to just comment briefly on a couple of the projects that were examined in detail by the Committee.

Beaudesert Rail

The Beaudesert Rail (BR) was the recipient of four Commonwealth Government grants totalling $5.7 million. These comprised a grant of $75,000 plus GST to produce a business and marketing plan; $5 million from the Centenary of Federation fund to develop and operate a heritage railway; $10,000 plus GST for a report on BR’s financial position and suggestions for a way forward; and a $600,000 grant under the RP program.
The Committee concluded that the $600,000 RPP grant to BR approved in November 2003, was made for political purposes. Documents provided in evidence to the Committee reveal that in the final days leading up to the decision to provide BR with an RPP grant rather than a loan, the then Deputy Prime Minister, The Hon John Anderson MP, who was also the portfolio minister for RPP, was involved in discussions with the Prime Minister’s office about the matter of government assistance for Beaudesert Rail. It appears that this was when the proposed form of assistance changed from a loan to an RPP grant. DOTARS was still unaware of this change the day before the grant was approved and was continuing to work on the basis that any funding would be in the form of a loan.
This project completely bypassed the program’s normal assessment procedures. Besides DOTARS being cut out of the process, BR was not required to make an application for RPP funding and the relevant ACC was not given an opportunity to comment on the project. Evidence also shows that the department was not satisfied that the project was financially viable and was still seeking evidence of the project’s prospects of solvency just days before the grant was approved.
The Committee considers that the BR grant serves as a warning of the effects of expediting projects without undertaking adequate due diligence checks. Beaudesert Rail’s financial viability was marginal at best (it was under administration at the time of the RP grant) and it ceased operation in August 2004. Creditors took possession of its assets in February 2005.
The manner in which the government resorted to using program funds for the BR grant reveals the disregard on the part of its most senior ministers for the RPP guidelines. It is one of several examples the Committee found of the virtually unfettered discretion in the hands of ministers under this program. The other striking aspect of the BR case is that program funds were used to achieve a political outcome in a government-held electorate following direct intervention from the Prime Minister.

Tumbi Creek

Two grants totalling $1.49b million to Wyong Shire Council for dredging work at the mouth of Tumbi Creek were approved by Parliamentary Secretary De-Anne Kelly in mid- 2004. The Committee was concerned about the allocation of such a large grant to a project with limited beneficiaries which provided a short-term rather than a long-term solution, particularly given that sustainability is an important feature of the RPP project viability criteria.
The Tumbi Creek dredging grant applications were assessed and approved within remarkably short time frames when compared with many other RPP grants. Departmental witnesses advised the Committee that the Parliamentary Secretary’s office had requested that the department give the project priority.
The Committee is particularly concerned that the haste with which these grants were approved meant that normal application development and assessment processes were circumvented. On the advice of a ministerial staffer the Council submitted its applications directly to DOTARS, rather than preparing the applications in consultation with the relevant ACC. The Committee received evidence that the relevant ACC had a number of concerns about the project, yet the ACC’s comments on the first application were not forwarded to the Parliamentary Secretary before the funding decision was made and the ACC was not provided with a copy of the second application.
A high degree of political collaboration involving ministerial advisers, the federal member’s office and members or officials of the Council was evident in relation to this particular RPP project. In one instance, involving a ministerial adviser countermanding departmental advice, the Committee considers that the communication was entirely inappropriate and is evidence of wider concerns about the unchecked growth in the power of ministerial staffers.
The lack of necessary state licences, required before the dredging work could proceed, is another example of the haste with which this grant was approved and announced. The latitude in the RPP guidelines meant that while the dredging project remained effectively ineligible to actually receive funding until the relevant approvals and licences were obtained, the grant announcement could still be made. RPP funding for the dredging work was announced by the Prime Minister in a marginal electorate just days before the 2004 federal election was announced. Yet, as at mid-August 2005, a funding agreement for the project still had not been entered into.

Primary Energy

The Committee’s examination of the Primary Energy Project highlights concerns about the administration of applications made under one program but funded another.
DOTARS admitted that the Primary Energy application fell outside the RP guidelines and assessed the project as “high risk”. The Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation (SONA) procedures were therefore used to circumvent the RP eligibility restrictions and fast-track the approval following a request from a minister.
The area of gravest concern about the Primary Energy project relates to the ministerial involvement in the department’s assessment of the application. The direction from one minister to the department to expedite the application to allow funding to be provided within two weeks seemed to pre-empt any rigorous assessment of the project. The Committee found that the on final departmental advice to the minister on the application was altered following the intervention of Mr Anderson’s chief of staff at senior levels in the department. Although departmental officers gave conflicting evidence on the chain of events leading to the change of advice, evidence from the former acting secretary of the department at the time reveals that the revised advice differed markedly from the department’s original advice.
This was not only another example of the high degree to which ministerial offices intervened in certain projects but also a case which transgressed the department’s practice of quarantining ministers from decisions related to applications from their own electorates. Because the application concerned a project in Minister Anderson’s electorate, neither the minister nor any of his staff should have been involved in any way with the decision making on the project.
The electoral division of New England featured prominently in the inquiry due to the proliferation of issues that emerged about the operation of the Regional Partnerships Program in that electorate. The Committee examined allegations that the Independent member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor MP was offered an inducement not to stand for the seat of New England at the 2004. federal election. The issues also included his claims that political conditions were put on grants made to three projects in the New England electorate.
Mr Windsor claimed that the grant to the Australian Equine and Livestock Centre, which was announced in September 2004 as a $6 million election commitment to be funded from RPP, was made conditional on his removal. from the equine centre working group. He claimed that this condition had been imposed to prevent him taking credit for the project. The Committee found that there was at least a perception among some people involved in seeking an RP grant for the project that Mr Windsor’s involvement would not be helpful in obtaining funding. However, the evidence was not conclusive that any such condition had been imposed on the grant.
Allegations of electoral bribery were investigated by the Committee in the context of Mr Windsor’s claims regarding the equine centre grant. This matter was also the subject of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police, which had found that no further action was necessary. Mr Windsor alleged that an intermediary, Mr Greg Maguire (the chair of the equine centre working group), had offered him an inducement on behalf of the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon John Anderson MP, and Senator Sandy Macdonald. The Committee received conflicting evidence. Without compelling and incontrovertible evidence, a committee of the Senate cannot make an adverse finding against a Senator or Member who has denied the allegations made against him. In the case of the alleged inducement, the evidence is not sufficient for this Committee to depart from that principle.
Mr Windsor also alleged that staff members of the University of New England had received a $4.95 million RPP grant for the National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia (SiMERR) in return for favourable comment in a local newspaper about the National Party. The Committee found that the National Party sought to obtain political advantage from the grant by way of advertisements carried in the local newspapers at the time of the centre’s official opening, and the university did not act appropriately in having its SiMERR advertisement appear with a party political advertisement. But the Committee found there was no evidence to prove Mr Windsor’s allegation about ‘cash for comment’.
In the case of the allegations about the opening of the Grace Munro Centre, which was not the subject of an RPP grant, the Committee believes that Senator Macdonald’s attempt to exclude Mr Windsor from the opening was inappropriate.

The Sustainable Regions Program

The Committee examined a second regional development program —the Sustainable Regions Program (SRP), which aimed to assist ten regions facing major economic, social or environmental change. The Committee’s examination of the Sustainable Regions Program raised questions about the basis on which the participant regions were selected and haw members of the Sustainable Regions Advisory Committees (SRACs) were chosen. DOTARS declined to provide the Committee with evidence on these matters on the grounds that they were ministerial decisions.
The Committee noted that the due diligence process for Sustainable Regions applications is more rigorous than the Regional Partnerships requirements. It is of particular interest that due diligence checks are conducted prior to the SRAC recommendation and the department’s advice being presented to the minister, in contrast to the practice found in some cases with RPP where due diligence checks only occurred after funding had been announced. Had this process existed under RPP, several of the failed projects investigated by the Committee may have been avoided.

The Atherton Tablelands Sustainable Region Advisory Committee

The Atherton Tablelands Sustainable Region Advisory Committee (ATSRAC) was the subject of a large amount of evidence to the inquiry. The evidence from members of the Atherton Tablelands community was overwhelmingly negative, and focused on perceptions of conflict of interest arising from the presence of four local mayors on ATSRAC, concerns about the inconsistent application of SRP guidelines, the lack of transparency of the application process and allegations of misplaced regional priorities. The Committee found that ATSRAC has little credibility with members of the community because of the number of projects that had failed or been viewed as unworthy.
The Committee notes that ultimately, responsibility for the composition and functionality of the ATSRAC board rests with the minister who appointed it. The Committee also recognises the difficult position of the mayors, who were elected to represent their shire but required, as members of ATSRAC, to subsume the interests of the shire under a strategic view of regional benefit. However, these tensions may not have been problematic had ATSRAC been appointed with a more balanced membership.
The three projects discussed in detail, JAM Custom Kitchens, the Atherton Hotel and Kalamunda Ecostay, raised concerns relating to competitive neutrality, conflict of interest and the lack of transparency of the application process. These projects highlight the inherent difficulties in providing government grants to the private sector, namely that while a grant may have a particular purpose, it frees up capital for other purposes (for example, in the case of the Atherton Hotel, the purchase of poker machines), raises due diligence and competitive neutrality questions and can create fractures in small and already fragile communities. This particularly applies if the grant process is not seen as transparent, rigorous and equitably accessible.

Findings and recommendations

In general terms, the Committee’s inquiry found that the main processes by which projects are proposed, considered and approved for funding under the Regional Partnerships Program are reasonably sound, although there is scope for strengthening these processes and building more rigour and transparency into the governance framework. The Committee makes a series of recommendations that would make it mandatory for all applications to be developed in consultation with ACCs and for ACCs to have a minimum of ten working days to consider all relevant applications. The Committee considers that involvement of the ACCs in the application development process is an important safeguard for the RP program. Multi-region funding applications would also have to be referred to all relevant ACCs under the improved assessment procedures that the Committee recommends DOTARS develops.
To assist ACCs to perform this enhanced role, the Committee recommends a review of the resourcing of ACCs and enhanced training of committee members and staff, as well as the adoption of three-year operational funding contracts to support strategic planning. It also recommends the Government conducts a review of the role of ACCs to ensure their contribution to regional. development is maximised.
The Committee considers that greater transparency around the RP program is required to allow the Parliament to monitor this significant area of expenditure and as a check on arbitrariness and politicisation. It recommends that a biannual statement be tabled in the Senate that lists information basic to providing an adequate level of scrutiny of the program, including all RP grants approved in the preceding six months, the department’s and ACC’s recommendations for each grant and a statement of reasons for decisions which are inconsistent with departmental and/or ACC recommendations.
The Committee also recommends that ACC recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants on request.
In the Committee’s view, the SONA procedures represent a fundamental accountability black hole and need to be removed. They expand the scope for departmental and ministerial discretion to unacceptable limits, providing a default to fund projects without reference to the program criteria/guidelines. The Committee recommends that the SOMA guidelines be abolished.
The Committee also concluded that the processes and procedures of the Sustainable Regions Program appear to be broadly sound, but its examination of SR projects in the Atherton Tablelands region highlighted problems arising from an insufficiently representative SRAC structure, opaque processes for appointing SRAC members and a lack of transparency around application processes. It makes recommendations to address those deficiencies.
To strengthen the governance framework for both programs, the Committee recommends that projects must have obtained relevant approvals or licences to be eligible for RP or SR funding. Similarly, it recommends that no program funding be approved for projects that fail to meet either program’s guidelines and other tests including proper due diligence. It also calls for due diligence processes and competitive neutrality procedures to be strengthened.
One of the major areas of concern to emerge from the inquiry surrounds the role of ministers and their staff. The Committee found that current arrangements are not adequate to mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest. It is also deeply concerned by the intervention by ministerial offices in the department’s assessment processes which the Committee considers was inappropriate and antithetical to the principle of the public service providing frank and impartial advice to ministers. While the Committee, on balance, supports the retention of ministerial discretion for each program, it recommends that ministers, parliamentary secretaries and their staff should be prevented from intervening in the assessment of grants. It also recommends strengthening existing measures to keep ministers at .arm’s length from applications that originate from their own electorates.
The finding that over half of grants approvals occurred in the three months leading to the federal election announcement in 2004 is another critical area of concern. This can only feed allegations of ‘pork barrelling’ with these programs and. increase perceptions of bias, particularly in the context of election campaigns. The Committee recommends improved procedures to enhance the accountability of ministers during the sensitive period leading up to federal election campaigns.
I conclude, as is also stated in the incorporated speech, by recording the committee’s thanks to the secretariat staff—Alistair Sands, Terry Brown, Lisa Fenn, Melinda Noble and Alex Hodgson—for their sterling efforts during the inquiry. They had thousands of pages of submissions and documentary material to read and collate, as well as having to organise an extensive series of public hearings and help finalise a lengthy report. They were a great team and we could not function without them. I commend the report to the Senate.
—I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today’s debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I would like to commence, of course, where the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee left off, and that is by thanking the secretariat. There are reports which are much easier for the secretariat to handle than this one. The physical load on the secretariat and the task required of them was immense indeed. The committee and the Senate should be grateful for their efforts—I certainly am.
The inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions Program, which is the subject of this report, in my view revealed the Senate at its best. I was a little surprised at the somewhat exaggerated tone—I will not use the word ‘hysterical’—of the government’s minority. Whilst it was indeed a highly politicised and political issue, in the end it showed that the Senate expresses itself well when it has to adjudicate on these matters. And a very fair outcome resulted.
A hot political question was handed to the Senate to answer. That question was: did the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, and Senator Sandy Macdonald offer an inducement to independent member of the House of Representatives Tony Windsor to vacate his seat? The answer to that question, as produced by the evidence, was unequivocally no, and those two members of parliament are cleared by the report. The evidence presented to the committee revealed that it was the chairman of the board of the National Equine and Livestock Centre, Mr Greg Maguire, who caused Mr Windsor and his associates to have that belief. I must say that, in making those remarks, I am personally pleased because Senator Macdonald is known to me. I like the man, I respect him and I am glad that he has been relieved of the burden of the allegation. And, of course, with respect to the former Deputy Prime Minister, I have always found him to be a straightforward and genuine person to deal with.
The second hot question placed on the committee’s agenda related to the use of the government’s Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions Program for political pork-barrelling. Again, the committee has been unequivocal in continuing to support the maintenance and continuance of the Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions Program. But, with respect to the issue of political pork-barrelling and a perception of that occurring, the answer the committee provides to that question is, ‘Yes, in part.’ The committee did find evidence that, in a minority of instances, there was political interference and poor process, particularly in pre-election periods. The committee has recommended an accountability facelift, which is needed to restore the credibility and overall value of the programs. I believe the committee’s recommendations are the right nip and tuck for these programs.
Unless the government reacts favourably to the majority of the committee’s recommendations, the programs will continue to be treated with great suspicion in the media and by the public. It is critical that the government introduces greater probity, accountability and process improvements to the programs. I know it is the job of government senators to defend the government and it is the job of opposition senators to attack them but, when all sides of parliament are in agreement as to the need for programs like this, it is incumbent on everyone to fix the problems that have been identified. One of the immediate problems you have with any issue of ministerial discretion is that the closer you come to an election the greater the temptation is for those involved with the political process, including or perhaps especially staff members, to get overanxious and to start to interfere in processes which should be kept at arms-length and be handled properly.
In that respect, I draw the attention of the Senate to the recommendation that, when the minister’s decision to approve or not approve a grant is different to the recommendation of either the area consultative committee or the department, or the funding amount approved by the minister is different to the amount recommended, then the grant approval decision should be made in conjunction with the relevant shadow minister. That would be in the period from 1 July preceding a general election. The committee then recommended that all grants approved in those circumstances should be announced jointly by the minister and the shadow minister. That would then address the issue of ministerial discretion nearing an election, which raises other problems.
I want to compliment the chair not only on producing this report in difficult political circumstances but on introducing to the Senate another report which is equally as important and which should be read, in my view, in conjunction with this report. I refer, of course, to the work of the same Senate committee, the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, and its report entitled Staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 of October 2003. Recommendation 2 of that report says in part:
The Committee recommends that the government should make ministerial staff available to appear before parliamentary committees in the following circumstances:
And the fourth and fifth dot points read:
Critical or important information or instructions have been received by a minister’s office but not communicated to the minister; or
A government program is administered to a significant extent by government MOPS staff.
This is an issue that this inquiry exposed again—that is, the involvement of ministerial staff in executive actions. Recommendation 12 of that same report is:
The Committee recommends that the MOPS Act be amended to require that the Prime Minister promulgate a code of conduct for ministerial staff.
To my knowledge, that has still not happened. Recommendation 20 says:
The Committee recommends that all departments provide written guidance to staff regarding interactions with minister’s offices, and that all senior staff receive adequate training in this area.
You can see that what I am concentrating on is the danger in the circumstances where ministerial discretion applies. It is ministerial discretion that you have to be particularly careful about. I welcome the committee’s recommendations as not just trying to fence off ministerial discretion in an appropriate manner without removing it but trying to ensure that the issues of integrity, probity and good process are not only maintained but are drastically improved with respect to the way in which these programs are carried out.
In conclusion, I want to remind senators of the two fundamental conclusions of the report. The first is that the minister and the senator who were the subject of allegations are found not to have been at fault. Secondly, the programs, in a minority of cases, do exhibit some real accountability issues, and those recommendations will address that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-10-06,"—It is an honour to stand here to speak to the report—in particular, the government senators’ report—which has been tabled today. I will be dealing with three main areas in the report. Firstly, there are the allegations of the most serious kind with respect to the former Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Sandy Macdonald. Secondly, I will be talking about the merits of the Regional Partnerships program. Thirdly, there are the accusations of pork-barrelling, slush funds, conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth et cetera made by the Labor members of the parliament in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
Firstly, I want to say that the allegations made with respect to the Hon. John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, were in my view designed to defame and discredit his good name and his reputation as a member of parliament and indeed as an Australian citizen. The accusations were also made with respect to the involvement of Nationals Senator Sandy Macdonald. Despite the Australian Federal Police finding no case to answer against the two men named in relation to the allegations of corruption and an inducement to leave politics and despite the fact that that Federal Police finding was delivered prior to this inquiry proceeding, the Labor senators in this place persisted with the inquiry in one of the most scurrilous acts, in my view, to besmirch the good name of a man who is held in the highest regard across all quarters of this nation. It was for me one of the low points of my political career in this Senate to date. In my view, Labor should be ashamed of themselves in their pursuit to damage the reputation of the Hon. John Anderson and Senator Sandy Macdonald.
The report has found no case to answer. In fact, not only that but the report found that the allegations of Mr Tony Windsor were in fact wrong in matters of fact. The matter had been addressed and dismissed, as I said, even before the Senate referred this inquiry to the committee for examination and report. The allegations made by Mr Windsor seriously impugn the reputation and integrity of the former Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Macdonald and, despite the AFP’s finding, Mr Windsor did not withdraw the allegation or publicly apologise at the time, nor has he done so since, for his assertions. So the government senators, as is set out in our report, consider that Mr Windsor should publicly withdraw and regret his allegations and should apologise on the public record to both the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, and Senator Macdonald for his derogatory and defamatory statements. I hope that now he will consider this report and do exactly that.
Secondly, in terms of the merits of the program, I want to say that this is one of the most successful government programs in history. It delivers outstanding returns for and on behalf of the taxpayer. Specifically, I would like to say that, for every $1 invested by the Australian government there is $3 invested by other partners. In terms of state Labor governments, who in fact support the program, for every $1 the Australian government puts in they put in 93c, so it is nearly dollar for dollar. It is indeed an outstanding return on investment. That is, in anybody’s book, a $3 return for a $1 investment. In terms of job creation, for every $50,000 expended there are three jobs in the short term, moving to four jobs in the longer term. Again, that is a great result.
In terms of the accusations by the Labor Party of pork-barrelling, a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth and slush funds, let us have a look at the projects and the program and how it works. Of the Regional Partnerships projects approved, the ALP-held seats had a higher approval rate than the coalition-held seats: 78 per cent to 76 per cent, which is almost exactly the same. That dispels in any way, shape or form the accusations by the Labor Party of pork-barrelling. The approval rates are the same.
Interestingly, when you look at areas in the provincial or remote categories it puts to rest any claims of politicisation. The eight electorates held by ALP members before the 2004 election received $7.51 million, more than double the $3.16 million of Regional Partnerships funding received by the eight provincial seats held by the coalition members. So that is further evidence.
In terms of the veracity of the audit reports, let us just say that there were three internal reviews by the respected independent consultants, KPMG, and five external reviews of the program. There were no findings of maladministration or wrongdoing in the management of the Regional Partnerships program. It can be proven that the ALP have embarked on a costly and, in my view, wasteful attempt to rewrite the history of the 2004 federal election for their own purposes because they have shown contempt for regional areas in Australia. I hope they will consider the report and reflect on that and make amends for it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-10-06,"—This report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee will prove to be a millstone around the neck of this tarnished government. It shows what millions of Australians have known for a very long time: that the Howard government will do whatever it takes to maintain its grasp on power. For nine long years this government has shamelessly plundered public resources to buttress its political fortunes. As the highest taxing government in Australia, it has had no shortage of resources at its disposal.
It needs to be said at the outset that the Howard government did not want this inquiry into Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions to proceed. It opposed the inquiry reference and obstructed the proceedings of the committee in every conceivable way. The government refused to produce departmental witnesses, withheld critical information about project approvals, provided the committee with erroneous information that took months to correct the record and wrote to some potential witnesses encouraging them to ignore the committee’s request for assistance. So great was this obstruction that the committee draws attention to it in its report.
The report also notes the committee’s dismay at the government’s handling of concern about potential misleading evidence given by the Liberal Mayor of Wyong Shire, Councillor Brenton Pavier, during the committee’s inquiry. The committee resolved that evidence from Councillor Pavier in connection with the infamous Tumbi Creek grant may have been deliberately false and misleading and have constituted a contempt of the Senate. Last month, the President of the Senate gave precedence to a motion that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee but, consistent with the government’s abuse of its majority in this place since 1 July, it denied the Privileges Committee the opportunity to consider the matter. It was an outrageous decision that served to cover up the tawdry relationship between Councillor Pavier and the office of Minister Lloyd in connection with the Tumbi grant and demonstrated utter contempt for the only thing that really matters in the Senate committee system: the truth.
This report details the outrageous abuse of the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs—an abuse that gathered momentum in the lead-up to 2004 election. As a result of this committee’s inquiry, most Australians know that many grants were approved against departmental and/or local advisory committee advice. They know that many grants were approved despite the fact that they fell outside the published program guidelines. As a result of Labor’s scrutiny, the Australian people have learnt that the Howard government operated a set of shadowy guidelines that meant that any Regional Partnerships program could be approved, no matter what.
What I think will shock readers of this report is the extent to which the government abused the Regional Partnerships program, in particular in the three months preceding the calling of last year’s federal election. Analysis based on the government’s own data shows that in June, July and August 2004, Regional Partnerships grants worth more than $71 million were approved—more than one half of all the approved funding since the commencement of the program on 1 July 2003. It is not just the timing of Regional Partnerships grant approvals that exposed the government’s abuse of this program; the distribution of funds tells another damning tale contrary to the submission that was put to us before. Analysis of approved Regional Partnerships grants to 31 December 2004 shows that in rural seats the average amount of funding approved for government held seats was $1.5 million; for Labor seats, $1.1 million; and for Independent seats targeted by the National Party, $4.9 million. In metropolitan seats, the average amount of funding received by the government held seats was $180,000, while Labor seats received just half that amount—and that was in metropolitan seats for a regional program.
This report lays bare the Howard government’s rorting of regional funding programs to achieve political goals, not sustainable regional development outcomes. So comprehensive has the abuse of regional funding been that many projects funded under Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions have become bywords for rorting. A number of them—Beaudesert Rail, Tumbi Creek, A2 Dairy Marketers, Primary Energy and the Atherton Hotel—are examined as case studies in this report. Cumulatively, the value of the five projects I have just named exceeds $5 million—that is, $5 million to fund a steam train that would not go, a creek that dredged itself, a milk company that folded before the ink on the funding announcement was dry, an ethanol company worth $1 that has yet to produce a drop of fuel and a hotel funded to run ‘wacky Wednesdays’ and stunt bikini babes, while other communities on the Atherton Tableland cry out for potable drinking water.
The extent of the pre-election pork-barrelling catalogued in this report will shock Australians. I also think the detailed examination of assessment and approval processes for selected grants will surprise many, including members of the press gallery who have grown relaxed and comfortable—perhaps too relaxed and comfortable, I might say—with the abuse of office by the Howard government. With respect to the government, the architects of the rorted regional programs under examination, I do not expect that much will change. The thin and partisan minority report issued by government senators suggests as much. In yesterday’s Australian newspaper, economics editor Alan Wood says:
Regional development is a polite euphemism for keeping Nationals happy ...
Sadly, under this government, he is right. The Howard government has no commitment, none whatsoever, to the development of Australia’s regions. The only commitment it has is a commitment to maintaining office, whatever the cost. Nonetheless, I do urge the government, or at least the handful of its members who after nine long years still care about the quaint concept of propriety of office and good governance, to read the majority committee report and take heed of its conclusions and recommendations.
It would be remiss of me not to thank Senator Forshaw, the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, and recognise the fair and even-handed manner in which he conducted this inquiry. I also acknowledge fellow Labor Senators Carr, Stephens and McLucas and Democrats Senator Murray, who contributed so ably to the committee’s work on this. I do note that Senators Johnston and Barnett have attended and have sought to defend the government as best they can against this litany of irrefutable accusations which we level against them.
I think all members of the committee, whether they are signatories to the majority report or not, would extend their sincere thanks to the committee secretariat, including the secretary, Mr Alistair Sands, and his staff, Ms Lisa Fenn, Ms Alex Hodgson and Ms Melinda Noble, who travelled with the committee and did an extensive amount of work assisting in pulling together the vast array of written material that the committee received. Let me also thank Hansard and the sound and vision staff, who provided this inquiry with the same sterling service they provide to all committees. I conclude by noting that this inquiry has shone a bright light on one of the dark recesses of this government. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-10-06,"—Regional Partnerships has proved to be one of the best pieces of public policy ever enacted in the history of our federation. Standing alongside recent projects such as Roads to Recovery, this program has delivered more jobs, more investment and more development in regional Australia than any project in recent history.
I categorise the opposition’s theme in this report in one word: disappointment. There is disappointment that there was no evidence and no capability or possibility of a finding against former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson; disappointment that there was nothing to support the scurrilous accusations of coercion against Senator Sandy Macdonald; and disappointment that there was absolutely no evidence such as would substantiate any case against Mayor Pavier, no evidence against Minister Kelly and no sustainable evidence against Mr Maguire. Disappointment is the word that categorises all of the matters behind this majority report. I quote from page 16 of the introduction to the report:
Without compelling and incontrovertible evidence, a committee of the Senate cannot make an adverse finding against a Senator or Member who has denied the allegations made against him. In the case of the alleged inducement—
this is talking about former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson—
the evidence is not sufficient for this Committee to depart from that principle.
Further on, it says:
... the Committee found there was no evidence to prove Mr Windsor’s allegation about ‘cash for comment’.
These are the facts. If you had listened to Senator O’Brien, you would think that they had found a smoking gun. But this is the truth—they found nothing. With respect to my good friend and colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald, the report says:
There is no evidence, however, that the Senator attempted to coerce or threaten the council, even when it became apparent that the council intended to proceed to invite Mr Windsor to participate in the opening.
There was no evidence. That was the foundation of this inquiry. That is why we travelled Australia—in the vain hope that Labor would be able to stick something on these good men. And they have stuck nothing on them—absolutely nothing. We have page after page of fabulous reference to a magnificent piece of public policy. The government senators make no bones about the fact that Regional Partnerships is something that must go on. The hard work of the volunteers in the area consultative committees needs to be acknowledged. I congratulate them on their volunteer work and for the things they do for their communities. They are the unsung heroes out there in the bush.
De-Anne Kelly is much maligned by the Labor Party. In the few minutes I have left, let me recite what was said about her by a witness. She wanted to support A2 Milk, which actually paid 50c a litre to dairy farmers. Mr Stewart, who gave evidence on behalf of that organisation, said:
We walked into De-Anne Kelly’s office that day and I said, ‘The farmers are desperate and, because of the government levy, they are going to the wall. It was supposed to help them.’ I said, ‘We actually pay 50c a litre, where some are only getting 29c and 31c.’
In answer to a further question, Mr Stewart said:
She said, ‘How can you do that?’
He explained to her the benefits of A2 Milk and went through setting out the possibilities of farmers receiving a decent return. He said—and it is on the Hansard, in the committee records—that she conducted herself in an exemplary fashion and would not sit with him because he was a candidate or applicant for money. There is an absolute vindication of Minister Kelly in the way that she has conducted herself in all of this. I am very pleased and proud to say that she had the dairy farmers’ best interests at the forefront of her mind at all times. That is a lot more than can ever be said about the opposition senators, who went through this witch-hunt for no real reason. I thank the committee secretariat for their hard work—for no really good reason, unfortunately. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Senate to support the maintenance of compulsory voting for elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives.
This is a matter of urgency because in recent days we have seen a barrage of leaked material, inspired leaks from the Liberal Party in this parliament, aimed at softening up this country for major changes to the electoral arrangements in this country—major changes to the Electoral Act. This is a few days in advance of a parliamentary committee report into the last election, which is to be tabled on Monday. We have seen an enormous amount of backgrounding from government members about this forthcoming report and a prolonged and deliberate campaign by the advocates of voluntary voting within the government to be pursued by this government. This is despite the fact that the Prime Minister himself has said that it is ‘not on the government’s agenda’. The urgency is this: a report published in the Age on Wednesday, 5 October said:
A senior minister will fight to make voluntary voting Coalition policy at the 2007 election, despite John Howard saying it is ‘not on the Government’s agenda’.
This is despite the fact that the National Party, as the junior member of this coalition government, have ruled out support for such a proposition. The report went on:
Finance Minister Minchin, one of the advocates for change, immediately sought from Mr Howard clarification of what he had meant.
Senator Minchin later told The Age Mr Howard was not ruling out voluntary voting becoming policy at the next election.
‘I will continue to argue the case for the Coalition to go to the next election with a policy for ending compulsory voting,’ Senator Minchin said.
When asked by The Age to clarify, a spokeswoman for Mr Howard said, ‘Compulsory voting will remain, including at the next election. It is not on the agenda for change. But it is still open to others to discuss the case for voluntary voting.’
We have heard from the National Party. Senator Minchin’s position has been made quite clear. Senator Boswell, on the other hand, has said that the National Party would firmly reject such a proposition. In last Tuesday’s Age he is reported as saying:
Cynicism towards politicians and politics is at a high enough level without giving people the option to completely disconnect and take no interest or responsibility in who runs the country and how it is run.
Senator Boswell commented further:
Their major concern with non-compulsory voting was that we believe all voters should have ownership of their government. Compulsory voting provides a clear connection between the people and the Parliament.
He further pointed out that in the 2004 election in the United States, voter turnout was some 55.3 per cent. He went on:
This means that, theoretically, the President could have been elected by less than 28 per cent of the population. The last Australian Senate election had a turnout of nearly 95 per cent.
Those comments have been made in repeated circumstances across the country in recent times. This urgency motion today provides the opportunity for the National Party to put up or shut up. It provides the opportunity for the National Party to put their votes behind their stated public positions. Instead of being the doormats of this government, instead of providing their traditional role as being the rollover merchants, those who acquiesce to every wish of the Liberal Party, this is an opportunity for the National Party to come forward and say to the people of this country by their vote that they are opposed to changing the electoral system.
The electoral system we currently have was one of the two great reforms introduced to this country. This country has a very fine tradition in terms of its international reputation in public administration but also in terms of its electoral laws—two fundamental principles of a decent democratic system. In 1918 we had the introduction of preferential voting in this country, and compulsory voting was introduced in 1924. As I see it, these two are the most significant progressive electoral reforms this country has seen. Both those changes were introduced by non-Labor governments, and I think we should give credit where it is due.
There was a concern at the time that the newly-formed National Party needed special protection because the people who tend to vote for the National Party—and it is pretty much the same profile today in their electorates—tend to be the poorest in our society and the least educated. They tend to be people, like Labor voters, that need governments the most and they need the political system to respond to their needs the most. That is the major problem with voluntary voting. It is a system designed to disenfranchise the citizenry of this country. It is a system that has the effect of removing from the electoral system itself the participation of those that need government the most—the poor and the dispossessed, the people with less access to the opinion-makers. They are people who need government services and they need to ensure that the parliamentary system responds to their needs.
So my concern, as we look at this proposal that Senator Minchin is pursuing, along with Senator Abetz and many others, is that a pattern of behaviour is being established whereby the government is attempting to restrict the franchise and to restrict the capacity of Australians to participate in the election of governments in this country. We have a situation today where the government is proposing the abolition of compulsory voting over time—and that is what we are being softened up for. The National Party has the chance to put its money where its mouth is here. We are being softened up for a proposal that clearly would see a significant shift in the level of participation in the electoral system in this country.
A dress rehearsal is being proposed through Senator Minchin’s actions and his clear defiance of what the Prime Minister is saying, while he is claiming that this is not on the agenda at this time. What is in fact being proposed, through the back door, is that this become a matter of government policy after the next election. We have a full-scale assault being made upon the integrity of our national electoral system, and with the Senate report next week we will see that claim made over and over again. The ultimate target of the abolition of compulsory voting is being established here.
Senator Abetz, of course, has been the vanguard of those changes. He is an extreme right winger in terms of his behaviour in Tasmania. He has long held these views about trying to provide a restriction on the right of people to participate in the affairs of this country. What we have seen in major democracies of the world where there is voluntary voting is a general trend toward a decline in the levels of participation in the electoral system. Of course there are a whole range of factors that lead to those circumstances, but what you see essentially is that the participation in the electoral process of the majority of eligible voters is declining in those countries, which is, in effect, reducing the democratic legitimacy of those elections. But, by contrast, in Australia we have a situation where well in excess of 95, 96 and 97 per cent of the population vote. Figures such as that have, year after year, demonstrated the participation rates in the Australian federal electoral system. We have a situation where no-one can legitimately claim that the electoral system lacks integrity or that there is a lack of legitimacy in the results that are being produced.
What we have is a philosophical argument being presented by some sections of the extreme right wing of the Liberal Party. It is a philosophical argument that essentially argues that people should not be compelled to vote. Our current legal system does not compel people to vote; it compels people to turn up. It asks people to do one very simple thing: every couple of years, turn up to a polling station. And you do not have to do that if you get a postal vote. There is no requirement to actually cast the vote. What we have here is a somewhat muddled set of thinking on the question of compulsion. No-one that I am aware of in this parliamentary system is publicly prepared to argue that there should be voluntary payment of taxes. No-one says we should have voluntary school attendance. No-one says we should have voluntary wearing of seatbelts. So it is not a question of compulsion; it is a question, in my mind, of political advantage. Requiring citizens to participate in the process of choosing their own government actually serves to improve the level of government. It ought to provide the opportunity for Australians to have a say in who runs their parliament. It ought to be a situation where citizens are less likely to be alienated from the processes of the political system and be less disengaged from the system of government we have in this country.
On the contrary, the suggestion has been put to us by Senator Abetz, Senator Minchin and the other flat earth people in the Liberal Party that essentially we should have a mechanism whereby an advantage should be given to those who they think are more likely to support the Liberal Party: those who are well educated, well connected, articulate and able to enjoy the benefits of wealth. We have a situation where, with the homeless, the aged, those of non-English-speaking backgrounds and those in Indigenous communities, an effort is being made at all possible levels to discourage them from participating in the processes of government. Those who need the services of the state the most are being encouraged to withdraw from having their say.
Everyone knows that the general level of support for the ballot is particularly strong in this country. Opinion poll surveys suggest that in excess of 70 per cent of Australians support the notion of compulsory voting. There is no compelling reason that has been argued as to why that should change, other than a very narrow partisan view in some quarters that this will support the Liberal Party’s electoral fortunes. I do not believe that it is too much to ask that people participate in the ballots of this country. The current trend in international politics suggests that the logic for voluntary voting is to move against people participating in political processes. If we have a mechanism whereby voluntary voting is pursued, in my view the level of apathy and disengagement will be increased.
There was a situation recently in the United States where, after the hurricane that hit New Orleans, night after night we saw on our TV screens dreadful images of people who had been left behind by the American political system. They were trapped in their basements, trapped in their attics, away from the services of government. They were the least powerful, the poorest. I note that the number of black faces was all too evident in those TV shots that I saw. We noticed that the people who are the most disengaged from the political system in the United States were the ones who ended up with the poorest services. It seems to me that that is a direct consequence of a political system that discourages people from registering to vote and from participating in the electoral system.
What we are noticing here is an orchestrated campaign by the extreme right wing of the Liberal Party aimed at shafting the National Party and undermining what they see as the traditional working-class support of the Labor Party. In response we have heard some feeble, mealy-mouthed comments from the National Party. This is their chance to put their vote on the table and say that they disagree with the extremists within the Liberal Party. This is the chance for the National Party to come clean and to support the policy which they claim they are prepared to argue for. Australia has a very proud record in terms of its electoral systems. We ought not to allow that to be diminished. (Time expired).",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Electoral Reform</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-10-06,"—Senator Carr is quite right: there is some discussion about our system of voting. There are some people who are promoting the idea of a change to non-compulsory voting. That just shows that the coalition is a healthy political organisation where people have different points of view and where people are free to express their points of view and encourage debate. I note that in the Labor Party there has been some debate about things like taxation. Some of the leading luminaries of the Left of the Labor Party, like Lindsay Tanner, are talking about the need to provide greater reward for effort for higher income earners. That is probably a little more heretical than Senator Carr seems to feel the suggestion that we should go to non-compulsory voting is. It just shows that there is healthy debate within the Australian political system.
Australia is one of quite a few countries around the world that do have compulsory voting. I think there are more than 20 countries that do, and they include Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Greece, the Philippines and Switzerland. Quite a few South American countries also have compulsory voting. Many countries in the world have non-compulsory voting. It is interesting to look at the voter turnouts in those countries. I believe that in the 2001 UK election the voter turnout was 59 per cent. In the US presidential elections the turnout is often less than 50 per cent.
There is an argument that it is undemocratic to force people to vote. The argument goes that people should have the option to vote. If they want to participate in electing a government then that is their choice. They should be allowed to opt not to vote. But, in fact, as Senator Carr has said, what people are required to do in our system is to turn up at a polling place, where they have their names crossed off a roll. If they choose not to vote or to vote informally then that is their business. It is a very interesting argument, this one. I am politically a classical liberal. I believe in the individual, in the right of the individual to conduct their affairs without undue influence from the heavy hand of government—
—By paying tax.
—By paying tax, indeed. I do not think we should all pay too much tax. I think we should have reasonable reward for effort for all Australians so that if you work hard then you earn more. I believe in that sort of thing. I believe in freedom of choice. I can see the point of view that Australian laws which make voting in state and federal elections compulsory, and which impose penalties for noncompliance with those laws, can be regarded as coercive. Nevertheless, Senator Carr, I am one of those Liberals who do support the system of compulsory voting in state and federal elections. In view of what I have just said, you may say that it is inconsistent for me to hold that sort of view, that it is inconsistent with my basic political philosophy as a classical liberal. I have four strong reasons for supporting compulsory voting.
—So you will vote for the motion.
—I do not object to your motion at all. As I said, I do support compulsory voting. I support it first of all for what might be called the ‘democracy is a fragile flower’ argument. If you look around the world, and particularly around our own region, you will see that there are very few genuinely democratic nations. As Australians we are the inheritors of a great democratic tradition. I think it is important that our citizens are aware of the democratic tradition that they enjoy. One of the ways of making them aware of it is to require them to go along to a polling booth every three or four years to vote for a government.
Secondly, the uniquely Australian combination of compulsory and preferential voting means that an Australian election is a more complete assessment of the political mood of the citizens of this country than occurs in almost any other country in the world. That is an important point because, in effect, the combination of compulsory and preferential voting means that general elections in Australia are a unique poll of the political mood of the Australian people. The Australian people, through the process, end up with a government which more genuinely represents their point of view.
Thirdly, there is the question of apathy in the Australian public about political issues or participating in politics. I spent about eight years in local government in Western Australia, where the voter turnout before the introduction of postal voting was usually between 13 per cent and 18 per cent. Before compulsory voting was introduced in Australia, voter turnout in federal elections and for the Senate, for example, was, I believe, around only 50 per cent. That leads me to another point. With low voter turnout it is possible for political interest groups to manipulate election results and stir up groups who have fairly—
Honourable senator interjecting—
—Yes, exactly—the big unions could get all their members out there to vote and they could end up winning seats in areas where perhaps you would not expect them to. In Western Australia in the early nineties we had a particularly nasty gentleman called Mr Van Tongeren painting anti-Asian graffiti around Perth. He thought about running candidates in elections. One could imagine that somebody like him, or some very extreme groups with similar views, could end up getting people in parliament under a system of non-compulsory voting. I think that would be a very undesirable consequence.
My fourth reason for supporting compulsory voting is that non-compulsory voting has two adverse effects. Firstly, you have to get the vote out. If you have ever been to the United States or the UK during a general election you will have seen that they spend all their time worrying about how to get the voters to the polls. They run buses and offer inducements. We do not have to do that in Australia. We just talk about issues and policies. So we are not diverted by the fact that we have to get the vote out. The fact that the vote is compulsory, as I have already said, means that the policies that each of the parties present have to appeal to the whole Australian population. Australia probably gets a better policy outcome with compulsory voting than do countries where it is non-compulsory.
So I believe that compulsory voting has many things in its favour. Not least of them is that compulsory voting means that the act and outcome of voting in Australia represents the considered views of the whole Australian community. It is, in effect, also a statement of respect for the democratic processes which we enjoy in Australia. I believe that through our compulsory preferential system the Australian people end up, as I have said, with a government that most represents the consensus. I for one on this side of the political fence can see no reason to change our present system. I hope that the merits of compulsory preferential voting will be understood by both the people of Australia as a whole and our political leaders, and that that system is retained. Senator Carr seems to think there is some great dissension within the ranks of the coalition over this issue. As with many issues, I suppose there are a few people who want to change things but I think the majority want to leave the system as it is, Senator Carr.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Electoral Reform</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-06,"—I too welcome this debate and am absolutely unafraid of it, particularly since the vast majority of the Australian public support compulsory voting. I am not at all convinced that those who support voluntary voting are going to win the day. But, having said that, one needs to argue and to keep arguing the case. The Democrats say that voting is a means of participating in the political process uniquely accessible to the largest number of citizens. For many, it represents the only way that they believe they can influence what the government does. Removing the obligation to vote is not simply a matter of freeing people from the performance of a duty. It represents a devaluing of the act of voting by any government that supports that change, and a corresponding devaluing of the people’s role in the system of government.
We think that compulsory voting helps to ensure the expression of choice, at least by a majority of voters, and helps guard against opportunities for improper or illegal electoral practices, such as multiple voting or bribing voters. The Democrats are firmly of the opinion that voluntary voting allows more illegal or improper voting practices to occur than does compulsory voting. We say that voting is the civic responsibility of all citizens in a democratic society. We say that each citizen must take responsibility for who governs them and how they are governed. We say that compulsory voting ensures the expression of choice by all those eligible to vote and, as far as possible, ensures that parliaments are elected according to the will of all their citizens.
The great virtue of the Australian system is the combination of compulsory voting and the preference vote. Compulsory voting helps legitimise the electoral process and the parliaments chosen by it. Social and political cohesion is promoted, and alienation of the disadvantaged from the political process is diminished. Citizens develop a sense of ownership of the political and decision-making process. Nowhere is that more evident than on voting day, when hordes, thousands, of citizens who do not usually participate in party political affairs turn out to help in the process of voting. And they enjoy it enormously. Compulsory voting contributes to civic education and the entrenchment of civic values. Election campaigns therefore can focus on the issues and choices before the voters rather than overconcentrate on mechanisms for simply getting people to the polls. Compulsory voting diminishes opportunities for the exercise of corrupt, illegal and improper practices during elections, and the involvement of all citizens in elections provides some protection against domination by minority interest groups, the economically powerful and other elites. I have never thought it a virtue of the American system that the President of the United States of America is elected on one-quarter of eligible voters’ votes.
There is also the furphy often put about that countries with compulsory voting are very rare. They are not. Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cyprus, Ecuador, Egypt, Fiji Islands, Greece, Italy, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Nauru, Paraguay, Peru, Singapore and Switzerland all have systems which include compulsory voting. It is also commonly thought that a minority of citizens around the world support compulsory voting but in fact a very large number of people within democratic societies exercise compulsory votes. From memory, somewhere in excess of 600 million people and nearly 10 per cent of democracies around the world indulge in compulsory voting. Of course, the political parties in control of societies with voluntary voting fear the introduction of compulsory voting and preference voting because they know that they give far more power to the people.
One of the great virtues of our system and one of the great legitimacies that the present Prime Minister enjoys is that he can truly claim to be the majority representative as a result of our system because of the interaction of compulsory voting, the primary vote, the preference vote and the number of seats that he acquires. Whichever party the Prime Minister comes from, that is always something Australians can be thankful for.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Electoral Reform</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I support the urgency motion before the Senate. I note in the urgency motion the use of the terminology ‘compulsory voting’. I think compulsory voting as a term is very easy shorthand, and it is certainly common usage, but it is more accurate to describe our system as compulsory attendance at a polling booth. Attendance is the compulsion; attendance is the obligation on citizens. That has been a hallmark of our electoral system since 1924. It ensures a high and therefore representative turnout in our elections. It makes sure that every citizen in the country has a stake in the result of an election.
It is worth recalling that, when introducing the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, ex-senator Herbert Payne, a nationalist, said:
If people exhibit no interest in the selection of their representatives, it must necessarily follow, in the course of time, that there must be considerable deterioration in the nature of laws governing the social and economic development of this country.
Since that time, voters have, in ex-senator Herbert Payne’s words, ensured that those who live under our form of government ‘see that it is democratic not only in name but in deed’. I challenge anyone to say that the system of compulsory voting has not operated successfully throughout this country. Compulsory voting is what empowers people in our Australian democratic process. Everyone has a stake in the outcome, and that is essential in any democracy.
When all Australians have had the opportunity to participate in the electoral process, whether or not you like the outcome, it is pretty hard to argue that the outcome does not represent the will of the people. People genuinely accept that citizenship and participation in a social democracy bring certain obligations that are largely unquestioned as part of our daily lives—paying taxes, attending school, driving on the right side of the road, abiding by the law and voting in elections. The acceptance by society of such obligations is what keeps and promotes our social and political cohesion. The Labor Party believes that voting is a communal act by all Australians. It is an affirmation of the commitment of Australians to democratic and public processes. Compulsory voting at attendance ballots is the hallmark of our democratic electoral system.
Labor is also very acutely aware of the fact that voluntary voting would mean that political parties and political campaigns will inevitably target those people who are most likely to vote. It is the most disadvantaged in the community who tend not to vote in voluntary systems and it is precisely those people that government has a special responsibility and obligation to. Those people—the young, people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, people who do not live in capital cities, the poor, the vulnerable and the disadvantaged—have least access to the resources to enable them to put their views forward to influence policy formulation. Who is it to say that their vote should be given less weight than that of the so-called informed sections of our society?
It is no wonder that Senator Eric Abetz thinks it would be a good idea to disenfranchise those people in our society whom the government he is a member of and a minister in has abandoned. You cannot really take much notice of anything Senator Abetz says. I was here in question time today when Senator Abetz, in answer to a dorothy dix question he was asked about prisoner voting, said:
‘Prisoners, of all the groups that make up our society, are perhaps most vulnerable’. Really? Try telling that to the victims of Martin Bryant, the Port Arthur mass murderer, or to the victims of Ivan Milat; or, for that matter, to rape victims. The quote goes on: ‘Why should they’—prisoners—‘be excluded from the most fundamental right?’
He is quoting Mr Stanhope, the Chief Minister of the ACT. Senator Abetz said:
Try telling that to the victims of Martin Bryant, the Port Arthur mass murderer, or to the victims of Ivan Milat; or, for that matter, to rape victims.
Even Senator Abetz, one of the most incompetent ministers in this incompetent government, knows that a prisoner who is serving a term in jail of the length that Milat and Bryant are serving—they will never be released from jail—cannot vote under our electoral system. He ought to know that, because he, Senator Abetz, is the person who introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Act 2004. I have the act here. I have the explanatory memorandum that stands in the name of Senator Abetz, the Special Minister of State. It amends the Electoral Act to prevent prisoners serving a sentence of three years or longer from enrolling to vote.
How scummy, how low, how deceitful and how ordinary for a minister to say that in question time! Why doesn’t this lily-livered, gutless minister get down here and apologise to the Senate and to the Australian people for that appalling and dishonourable mislead that we saw in question time today? Of course he will not do it, because there are no standards under the Howard government.
Voluntary voting will mean that political parties will concentrate their efforts on mobilising the vote on election day. They will not be concentrating their efforts on ideas, policies and programs for government. We are going to hear from the National Party in a moment. We have already heard Senator Boswell in this debate wax lyrical about how, for once, they are going to stand up to the government—on one issue they are going to stand up to the government. I want to warn Australians and warn National Party members and voters about what Senator Boswell and other members of the National Party are really on about with voluntary voting. You cannot believe them. You know that they have never stood up to the Liberals—ever—in their political lives. You know that not one of them has ever had the courage to cross the floor in the Senate—not one of them. You know that not one of them has ever had the capacity or ability to serve in the Howard government in the 10 years that it has been in office. Not one of them has ever served as a minister. But did you know that when the heat was put on when the issue of compulsory or voluntary voting was last debated in the Senate they caved in to the Liberals—as they always do?
I remind the Senate not to forget the sheer lily-livered gutlessness of the National Party over the constitutional convention bill in 1997. What a yellow-bellied lot they were when that bill was in the chamber for debate! It introduced voluntary voting for the Constitutional Convention. When the heat was put on the National Party, they—as they always do—limply gave in. They ran up the white flag to the Liberals and Senator Minchin, as they always do. They would not support what was the majority in this chamber to try and ensure that we had a compulsory attendance ballot and not a voluntary postal ballot. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2005-10-06,"—I have a strong interest in the process of voting and, much to the derision of many of my colleagues in here, have made my intentions clear from platforms such as my maiden speech. I have also tried to get the parliament to encompass new forms of technology as methods of voting. Australia unfortunately sees voting as something that is to be squeezed in between doing the shopping and taking the kids to netball. We are a moderate society, and politics tracks pretty closely between the certain cap and collar of right and left views. Step outside that paradigm and, Latham-like or Whitlam-like, the result is a political recoil, represented by the majority that is now held in both houses by the coalition. Labor would understand from the problems it currently has in raising union membership that people have other things to do and other places to go. In Australia, it could well be the gardening. One could call attention to the state of this house on so many occasions and see that people often have other things to do.
In my tour of the US with the young political leaders in 2002, I saw that non-compulsory voting means that the biggest motivator is aimed at pitching a message to get people out to vote. The problem is not so much one of coming up with a strident motivator to shake people out of their complacency or out of bed but one of fulfilling the policy objective that is set down as a reason to get people out of bed.
We in this country pitch to the middle ground. We pitch to that 10 per cent who change their views and who affect power in our country. In 105 years this has given us unbridled freedom. We have never had to worry about a revolution or a civil war. It has been an effective mechanism of government. ‘Ex sapienta modus’ was the motto of my university. It means ‘out of wisdom comes moderation’. If we get rid of compulsory voting, we are proposing a move from wisdom to foolishness as we inspire the vitriolic edges to start holding sway in our parliament. Are we happy to put our nation on a political see-saw with wide and varied oscillations between the far right and the far left?
In the US, 52 per cent of people voted at the last congressional election. I would say that we would have a more relaxed attitude in Australia. I heard what was said before by my colleague from the Democrats, but I have in front of me information showing that at the last election in Switzerland 42.3 per cent of the people turn out to vote. I would suggest that Australians would have a much lower level of voting involvement than other countries.
Now let us think about the Senate. It is on the record that, with the right preference flows from the Machiavellian source of undisclosed above-the-line preference deals, you can attain a Senate position with as little as 1.9 per cent of the vote. Let us take our good friends in Tasmania in this instance. Tasmania has 342,809 people on the electoral roll. With 45 per cent participation, that would mean that there would be 154,264 voters. With only 1.9 per cent needed, that would mean that a senator could be elected to the parliament with the princely number of 2,931 votes. I can find all sorts of interesting groups who could muster up those numbers and who could thus be involved in our federal parliament.
I believe this motion could well be supported by the Citizens Electoral Council, the League of Rights or any community of belligerent marginal union groups. The Free Marijuana Party in Queensland attained 17,485 votes. So we could be welcoming to our parliament Mr Nigel Freemarijuana to deliberate over the affairs of our nation. But let us not leave out my state of Queensland, where Labor Premier Red Ned Hanlon installed the gerrymander or malapportionment system in the late 1940s—which, to all intents and purposes, is still there and possibly worse. Premier Beattie attained power in the last state election, in a unicameral system, winning 63 out of 89 seats with just 47 per cent of the vote.
Because of that situation, we now have in Queensland a Pythonesque parade of ministers losing portfolios, being sacked from portfolios or not realising they have portfolios. We had a minister who was sacked from the health portfolio and then picked up the primary industry portfolio and then picked up the backbench—because that is where they have sent him. Forty-seven per cent of the vote and 70 per cent of the seats brought into power the health disaster, the power crisis, the water crisis and the infrastructure crisis. The Labor government in Queensland is a euphemism for a management crisis. Maybe if there were a greater reflection of seats to the percentage of the vote they muster, the Labor government in Queensland just may be a little bit more on their game.
Why would Labor want Mr Nigel Freemarijuana as a new senator? Maybe the best thing to do is to refer to Mr Graham Richardson, who, in his book Whatever it takes, discussed changes to the Electoral Act. About the manipulation of the Electoral Act, he said:
... that Labor could embrace power as a right and make the task of anyone trying to take it from us as difficult as we could.
So Labor’s form is well and truly on the books. I would applaud the Labor Party if they approved compulsory preferential voting but, if they want to install a Queensland Labor fiasco over the whole of our nation and endorse first past the post, they are not being fair dinkum. On this issue, Labor must be dismissed as not being fair dinkum. They need to get out of their box and say, ‘We believe in compulsory preferential voting,’ but they will not. I acknowledge that they express different views on the other side of the chamber but today we have seen that we can have different views. That is why we have a Liberal-National coalition. That is why we are in government.
—That’s why you are the doormats.
—It is good to see that we have stirred them out of their box. They are out of their box now. They do not like the words ‘compulsory preferential voting’. They do not like that phrase because it is the key to their demise. That shows how weak their argument is and how little is encompassed in it. This morning I abstained from the vote on ethanol. So your argument in the first instance is wrong as well. Where was the Labor Party? They were all together in their box. When was the last time the Labor Party actually broke and voted along state lines? They do not have the guts. It is not there. It is all a sham. It is a fiasco—and it goes on. I would like to see the day when Mr Faulkner and Mr Carr are on separate sides of the room, but that is not going to happen. The union thugs will get in there and screw them down and make sure that they toe the line.
So, if you want to advocate compulsory preferential voting, I will be voting with you. If you endorse it in Queensland and bring it in tomorrow, we will have a fairer system for all and you will give back to Queensland their right of representation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Electoral Reform</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-06,"—I thank Senator Joyce for that entertaining speech. I can assure him that, with one exception, the Greens will be endorsing the National Party’s policy of compulsory preferential voting at the next Queensland election, if that is what the party’s policy is. We too support such a policy rather than the optional preferential system which the Labor Party in New South Wales and Queensland supports. Moreover, we support—and I am sure Senator Joyce will consider this strongly because it is fairer still—proportional representation. Where you have a unicameral system—such as in Queensland where the upper house was abolished many decades ago—it is all the more important that you have proportional representation, so that each party is represented according to the votes given to it by the people of Queensland or whichever state it may be and voters have their votes valued equally: one person, one vote, one value.
I have noticed, Senator Joyce, that if there is one thing that riles the Labor Party in this chamber it is to advocate proportional representation as a fairer system for representation in the House of Representatives in this parliament.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—You will note that it is not on the agenda of Senator Abetz, the Special Minister of State, but it would, arguably, be the most important breakthrough we could have in giving a fairer voting system to the people of Australia.
The Greens are also very strong supporters of the compulsory voting system that we have, but I want to say two things about that system. First of all, we do have non-compulsory voting. What is required is compulsory attendance at the ballot box or in the voting booth. But, if you want to pick up your form, leave it blank and put it into the ballot box or you want to put in an informal vote with a comment on an issue or about somebody, you are very welcome to do that. You do not have to vote. What you have to do as part of your responsibility as a citizen in this democracy to balance the rights which flow from it is go to the ballot box with your vote and deposit it. There is not compulsory voting. You do not have to select a candidate or a party if you do not want to do that. That is the beauty of the system that we have in this country. But it does call upon citizens to shoulder the responsibility—much the same as, when it gets down to life and death issues, we require people to wear seatbelts or drive on the left-hand side of the road. There are some responsibilities that we as a community have to have. While it is a different matter, one of those ought to be attending the voting booth on election day.
One of the things that might weaken Senator Abetz’s resolve when it comes to the matter of non-compulsory voting—that is, not having to go anywhere near the ballot box or take any interest in politics in this country—is that the Greens, of all parties, would do best out of that. We are not advocating it but we would stand to do best out of it. The indicators in the analysis of voters is that the Greens have the highest percentage of tertiary educated voters. I think it would be very likely that we would also have the highest percentage of voters who study and watch politics. There is no doubt that if non-compulsory voting came in we would lose fewer of our voters than the other parties. That is something that the government needs to take into account because I think there is a political imperative in the whole suite of proposals that has been put forward by the government. It is aimed at enhancing the government’s prospects at the next election. So it is going to be interesting to see the legislation that comes up and will be put through this parliament, no doubt, in the next little while. It will largely be there to foster the interests of the coalition, but not necessarily of the National Party. There is going to be a healthy debate when that time comes.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Electoral Reform</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-10-06,"—I am the last speaker on this urgency motion and I will conclude the government’s argument on it. I will firstly say to Senator Carr, and those on the other side, that on any analysis this does not rate as an urgency motion. Senator Carr has tried to whip up heat on this and Senator Faulkner has unloaded his usual daily bile that sticks in his throat and which he must in some way unload, either on his own colleagues or on this side of the house, or it eats him. To try and say that this is a matter of urgency for the Senate to discuss is an absurdity and just shows how disconnected the opposition are now. I could suggest subjects for you to bring in here that are worthy of debate in this house and are worthy of an urgency motion which we may well come to vote on. But to say that the matter of compulsory voting, or not, is a matter of urgency is not only disconnected but also an abuse of Senate time. It is an absurdity.
This is not a government policy. The government have absolutely no intention of changing the current policy. What has upset Senator Carr and those on that side is that we, as individuals, hold separate opinions, that we seek to debate it and that Senator Minchin has done a paper on it and presented it in certain forums and, for that matter, so has Senator Abetz. As the Prime Minister has said, to take the heat right out of the argument and right out of this urgency motion, there is no attempt by the government to change our compulsory system. If we did, and we have no intention of doing so, we would take it to the people. It is not a matter of process of passing it through this Senate; it would be matter of doing what we are doing at the next election. I think what you have got mixed up, Senator Carr, is that at the next election at we will be taking a referendum to the people—but not on this issue. This is not going to raise its head again except in idealistic forums that we on this side debate in. We do not mind if there are different opinions. We are taking to the people in a referendum at the next election the question of four-year terms, on which you agree with us.
So how this can reach the status of an urgency motion is beyond me. There are so many other issues to debate. For example—why I am helping you I do not know—why would you not bring in the petrol issue? That really is an issue that is hurting the people out there. We understand that. We would like to debate that issue; to put it out there on air. We fully understand that the high prices are hurting the households of Australia. Have you ever thought of raising that issue? Maybe we should take the opportunity of raising urgency motions, if you are not going to raise them responsibly. You come in here with a gigantic beat-up; a complete waste of time for the Senate.
Nevertheless, I will address the matter. I am quite happy to address the matter, I simply do not want to address it in this chamber at all. As Senator Murray said, there are many countries, including Australia, that have compulsory voting but it is true to say that most countries have voluntary voting. The point was well made by several speakers, including Senator Joyce no less, that we have grown up with this since Federation. This is a system that Australians have grown up with. It is a cultural heritage, if you like. It has given them a study and knowledge of the political system that I think many other countries that have the voluntary voting system are devoid of. The fact that it has been compulsory has given Australians a greater knowledge of, let alone a contribution to, their democracy. In over 100 plus years, that has filtered through from generation to generation, and we have one of the most informed voting publics in the world. That is one good argument for why we should keep it.
References were made to the American system. Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce mentioned that the turnouts there are so low. Senator Boswell’s press release says that the highest voter turnout was some 60 per cent in 1968 but at the last presidential election, in 2004, they had 55 per cent, and at the one before that they were down to about 37 per cent. So you can imagine that the President is elected on less than that. He could be elected by something like 25 per cent of the population of the United States. We do not want that sort of system here. We are not used to it. What is more, as you all know the non-compulsory system very much shapes the politics of the day, which I, for one, would seek to avoid. That is because you have to get the voters out there, so the whole campaign style changes. In fact, we would have to spend more on campaigning than we do now. If there is a criticism now from the minor parties or from the public that we spend too much on TV ads and mail-outs during election campaigns, I think it would greatly increase under the voluntary system. As we know in America there are many, what we would see as dubious or certainly not normal, ways of getting the voters out to vote. This is done by cars, all sorts of inducements, bussing them there, dropping them off at the aged care centre. In our system we would find those sorts of voting inducements a little dubious. We do not welcome it.
This has been a well studied subject. I do not know why Senator Carr has suddenly put heat into the issue, or attempted to. This parliament has studied it. The respected Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters tabled a report in the parliament after the 1996 election. Part of that report, and part of their criteria for assessing each election, is the question of compulsory or voluntary voting. They did another one after the 1998 election and after the 2001 election. On each occasion, the government, in its response to the report, has rejected the change to the system and supported the existing system. I refer members of the Senate to the Report of the inquiry into the 2001 federal election and matters related thereto by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It sets out in a special chapter, chapter 7, the arguments for and against compulsory voting. It is comprehensive and somewhat convincing for the compulsory voting argument. As a concluding comment, I would direct members of the Senate to that report.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-10-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I want to speak tonight on this important report: Provision of exported assistance to rural and regional Australia through the TradeStart Program: Australian Trade Commission (Austrade). It examines the very significant TradeStart Program that works to support, in particular, rural and regional small to medium enterprises to commence exporting on a sustainable basis and to convert what are called ‘irregular exporters’ to regular, sustained exporting. This is an important program and this is a very important report because it reflects on the success of a program that has punched above its weight in many respects. It is one of the good news stories of Austrade and it has made a significant difference to the New Exporter Development Program targeting regional and outer metropolitan areas.
The Audit Office makes some very significant findings in this report and most of them are very positive. I would like to focus on those first and then deal with the concerns that the Audit Office had about the program. First of all, TradeStart, as I said, has punched above its weight for a small program. The overwhelming message was that the clients interviewed by ANAO advised that they would not have achieved an export sale without the assistance of Austrade through the TradeStart program and that it has a considerable impact on rural and regional Australia, certainly in assisting companies to commence exporting. We know that the importance of developing a sustainable export stream for small to medium enterprises in regional Australia is one of the ways that we are going to ensure that we have sustainable regional communities. TradeStart is contributing very much to that key priority of the Australian government and, of course, of the Australian opposition.
Half of the export sales in 2003-04 were for amounts under $20,000, reflecting the program’s targeting of small to medium enterprises. For exports, $20,000 probably does not sound like very much but for someone who is trying to establish an exporting business that can be a significant first step in creating overseas markets and helping to develop some of the important standards and critical levels of exports to ensure a continuing and sustainable business model.
Interestingly, the average program cost for each export sale was again around $20,000, which reflects in part the model for TradeStart, which is generally resource intensive. That acknowledges the fact that there are difficulties in breaking into export markets but that once small and medium enterprises actually get that break they are able to take off, grow and sustain themselves without that ongoing assistance from government.
The overall audit conclusion states:
... management of TradeStart provides potential new and irregular exporters in rural and regional Australia with accessible and well-managed export coaching services.
In fact, one of the important findings and one of the important features of the TradeStart program is the focus on coaching and mentoring small businesses so that they do understand the demands of the export markets, creating and sustaining export markets and providing some opportunities through Austrade to define new markets overseas that normally individuals, at such a small scale, would not have access to. So it is a great program that is being accessed by many small businesses in rural and regional Australia and needs to be encouraged. We know that the businesses that considered they would not otherwise have exported have made this step. Few entrants to TradeStart have been recorded as sustaining exporting in the medium term and that reflects the youth of the program—the fact that it needs to maintain that over a longer period of time than is considered in the report.
We have some recommendations from Austrade and the ANAO about how to improve this program to support small and medium enterprises in regional Australia. Interestingly, while the Audit Office has made these recommendations, they are not about the transparency and the management of the government program, which is of course one of the important roles of the ANAO; they are about improving the processes to support small and medium enterprises. They are important recommendations and all six have been responded to and agreed to by Austrade.
The first recommendation was:
The ANAO recommends that, to support proposals put forward and demonstrate reasons for decisions, Austrade document all key decisions during intermediate stages of competitive selection processes.
That highlights an issue that occurred with the first process of selecting allies, as they are called, for TradeStart, which commenced in July 2002. At the time, Austrade did not use systematic selection criteria to choose organisations to participate in the program. In itself, the request for proposals meant that the selected organisations were encouraged to participate but systematic selection criteria were not used to choose them. That is something that reflects on the transparency and on the good reputation of Austrade’s programs, and certainly that was addressed.
The second recommendation was:
... when the opportunity presents itself, possibly with the move to new contractual arrangements, Austrade determine the extent to which TradeStart office locations align with assessed needs and priorities.
That recommendation is also very important because it reflects the integration of TradeStart offices and services with the broader applications and activities of Austrade services. That recommendation was also agreed to by Austrade.
The third recommendation that:
... Austrade strengthen the transparency of decision-making on applications to join the New Exporter Development Program, and accountability for these decisions, by requiring TradeStart export advisers to complete, and file, the initial client needs assessment checklist for each applicant.
That was a very important recommendation, again about transparency of decision making and ongoing accountability measures for what is an excellent program.
The fourth recommendation was:
... Austrade implement more structured procedures to manage the potential for conflicts of interest arising from the TradeStart export advisers’ responsibilities.
As you can well imagine, that reflects the fact that there may be competitive interests looking to actually engage in a similar market and that TradeStart export advisers would have to balance two individuals with similar kinds of export potential and make sure that no conflicts of interest arise or, if conflicts of interest arise, that there is a process for managing that.
The fifth recommendation was:
... Austrade identify and implement appropriate mechanisms for timely ... preliminary market intelligence about the suitability of potential market(s) for TradeStart clients’ products or services.
That speaks for itself and was also agreed to.
Finally, the sixth recommendation was:
... expand the TradeStart performance framework with targets for rural and regional Australia, and reporting on them.
Of course, it is a statement of the obvious that, when you cannot actually benchmark or showcase what are excellent examples of successes in a program like TradeStart, you cannot possibly market this project to potential clients. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 9 of 2005-06</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,21,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2005-10-06,"—I wish to speak tonight on the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program 2005. As a recent participant in the 2005 Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, I wish to congratulate all those involved on presenting such an innovative and well-structured program. The ADF program, which began in 2001, is designed to give parliamentarians the same opportunity I had, to see first-hand and to understand how the members of our defence forces live, work and train to meet their day-to-day challenges while they defend our nation and its national interests. Having been part of the program I now have a far better understanding of the Navy’s role and especially that of the support bases and their involvement in keeping ships at sea, maintaining the Fleet Air Arm capability and the training of expert personnel to perform a variety of tasks and duties. This experience will now give me an opportunity to be able to contribute to an informed debate on defence and national security issues with the information and knowledge I have gained from being a participant in the program.
It was indeed a privilege for my two parliamentary colleagues and me to be attached to the Navy’s training establishments for five days and to enjoy the company of the men and women who are involved in the many and varied aspects of Navy life. Our first day began in Sydney when we joined the HMAS Stuart, which was commissioned in August 2002 and was the first Anzac class frigate to be based at Fleet Base East in Sydney. HMAS Stuart is under the command of Commander Peter Leavy, who made us very welcome and made sure that our time spent on the ship was well worth while. I thank the commander for his wonderful hospitality. Because of problems with the ship’s navigational equipment, we were delayed in sailing on time, so we had the opportunity to stay on board that evening and learn far more about the ship and its crew. We were given an excellent safety briefing, a tour of the ship and learnt how to climb down a rope ladder into the RIB, a rigid inflatable boat, in which we did a quick tour of Sydney Harbour.
We sailed early next morning en route to Jervis Bay and had the opportunity to see the ship’s gun fired during target practice. It is interesting to note that there are a number of environmental regulations associated with the firing of this gun. It cannot be fired if there are whales, dolphins, seals or sea birds in or near the target area. The ‘man overboard’ drill was also put into action while we were at sea. This was a very impressive exercise and it was interesting to see how each member of the crew was deployed to deal with the situation. I was especially impressed with the equipment available for the medical team to handle such a situation. On leaving the Stuart we were all presented with an individual cartoon drawn by a very talented midshipman, Candice Poole. I thank her and wish her well with her naval career.
Our next visit was to HMAS Creswell at Jervis Bay, hosted by Commanding Officer Captain Tony Aldred, and I thank him for his hospitality. HMAS Creswell is located on the south-western shores of Jervis Bay, 180 kilometres south of Sydney. It is part of a large national park which includes some magnificent woodland and beaches. The Royal Australian Naval College forms the major part of HMAS Creswell, which is the single service centre for naval officer training. Officer initial training and officer and senior sailor advanced training are conducted here with seamanship, fitness and survival training being the main components of the course. There is also an excellent Navy museum within the establishment. The Kalkara flight line is also based at HMAS Creswell. This unit supplies state of the art aerial targets for naval exercises. I was fascinated with the technology used in a number of the projects being undertaken by this unit.
HMAS Albatross, the home of the Fleet Air Arm, was the next base visited. This visit was hosted by Commanding Officer Captain Grant Ferguson, and I thank him also for his hospitality. It is the largest operational Navy establishment—some 520 hectares—and it employs 1,600 people from the Navy, Army, Air Force and civilian population. It is the Navy’s only air station, has an operational military airfield and is situated near the town of Nowra, approximately three hours south of Sydney.
The primary task of HMAS Albatross is to support the four naval air squadrons, which provide air support to the fleet. The four squadrons operate Squirrel, Seahawk, Westland Sea King and Super Seasprite helicopters. The air station is also the home to the Navy Aviation Force Element Group. The Commander Australian Navy Aviation Group has responsibility for the delivery of aviation capability to the government. HMAS Albatross is also the home to Australia’s Museum of Flight and has become a high-profile tourist attraction.
We then moved on to HMAS Kuttabul, which was commissioned in 1943 and is situated at Garden Island in Sydney. This establishment is under the command of Commander Brett Chandler, and it includes in excess of 1,450 personnel and 55 lodger units. I thank Commander Brett Chandler and Lieutenant Commander David Jones, the executive officer, for their wonderful hospitality. Kuttabul includes a large number of lodger units. We were able to look at Fleet Base East, Garden Island, the maritime headquarters and the dry dock.
Time does not permit me to go any further on this, so I will go on to the next base we visited, which was HMAS Waterhen. This is the Royal Australian Navy’s commissioned establishment located on the northern shores of Sydney Harbour. It is the home of Australian Mine Countermeasures and provides an administration, port and health services and transport and logistics support to Commander Australian Navy Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Group. We were very fortunate to go aboard the minehunter Yarra and to go back out through the heads to try out their equipment. We went out towards a dive wreck and did quite a lot of coastal mapping of the sea floor.
When we returned we were taken by sea transfer to HMAS Penguin, which is where the main hospital base is. It is also where they have their decompression chamber, which I was very intereted in, having a medical background. From there we went on to HMAS Watson, which sits on the cliffs of South Head in Sydney. It has a most beautiful Memorial Chapel of St George the Martyr and does all maritime warfare training in the Royal Australian Navy. The chapel is a conspicuous and timeless memorial to all men and women of the Royal Australian Navy who have lost their lives in war. It really is a most beautiful place. At Watson the role of the Training Authority Maritime Warfare is to help prepare officers and sailors of the Royal Australian Navy to go to sea to be part of the team that contributes to fleet requirements and outcomes. This was a very interesting area and I could probably spend my whole time just speaking about HMAS Watson. In conclusion, I would like to say what a wonderful experience this was and thank Lieutenant Commander Sam Jackman and Mrs Sue Collicutt of Navy headquarters for the work that they did in getting this program together and accompanying us on the trip.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program 2005</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
