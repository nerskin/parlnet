Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:01):  Today I present the 20th report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament, together with 20 petitions and 44 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. 


The right to petition the Parliament dates back to the 13th century, and has been described as 'the oldest of all parliamentary forms'.


Back then, bills were gradually derived directly from petitions. Nowadays, petitions continue to enable citizens to put their grievances to parliament, to gain public exposure and support for their cause and to draw issues to the attention of the House.


In the 45th Parliament, a major part of the petitions process involves ministers responding in writing to petitioners about issues within their portfolio.


This important act assures petitioners that their petition has reached the office of a representative of government responsible for change, and that that office has heard the petitioner's grievance.


As I noted earlier, this report contains 44 ministerial responses to petitions presented to this House. The committee is grateful for the ongoing support from ministers in providing timely responses to petitions, and for their active involvement in the petitions process.


While not every petition can be acted upon, what is important is that the petitioner has a chance to be heard. 


I will continue to provide updates to the House on the work of the Petitions Committee. Thankyou, Mr Speaker.

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (10:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Free Range Eggs) Bill 2018 will ensure three things. Firstly, it will ensure that eggs marketed as 'free range' are eggs laid by hens that are able to, and do in fact, move freely on an open range during daylight hours on most days. Secondly, it will ensure that 'free range' is a term limited to hens that are stocked at a density of no more than 1,500 birds per hectare. Thirdly, it will clarify existing rules to ensure that stocking density is displayed prominently on egg cartons in only a 'hens per hectare' format.


Eggs are part of the weekly shopping list for all Australians and the egg industry is an important driver in the Australian economy. Free-range eggs have grown in popularity with consumers. But what defines a 'free-range egg'? 


This issue was first raised with me by small-scale egg producers in my electorate. Many of the free-range farms through the Adelaide Hills, Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island are exactly how consumers would picture an egg farm, with plenty of space, grass and fresh air for the hens to roam freely. I am happy to admit that, before speaking to my local producers, I was unaware on the exact definition of free range. In my mind, that picture represented free range.


Little did I know that the Australian Consumer Law (Free Range Egg Labelling) Information Standard 2017, implemented by the Australian government in 2017, had significantly broadened the definition of 'free range'.


As it stands, free-range eggs are eggs laid by hens that have meaningful and regular access to an outdoor range during daylight hours, have the ability to roam and forage on that outdoor range and are subject to a stocking density of up to 10,000 hens. Farms with this stocking density are very different to farms with a stocking density of 1,500 hens. There is a vast difference in this farming practice.


Let's be clear: a stocking density of 10,000 hens does not reflect the consumer depiction of free range, and the cute pictures of hens on grass on the front of free-range egg cartons are not 10,000-hen farms. Nor does the vagueness about whether the hens actually do roam free and not just have access to roam—ambiguous at best and some would say misleading. In fact, my review of supermarkets showed that none of the producers that had 10,000 birds per hectare put those pictures on the front of any of their cartons.


It's clear that the current standards do not meet consumer expectations. I want to make this bill about providing relevant information to the consumer. I understand there is a place in the market for both barn-laid and caged eggs. My intentions with this bill are to ensure that there is information and protection for consumers and that there is clarity.


The Nick Xenophon Team promotes transparency and accountability, and I strongly believe that consumers should have all of the relevant information available to them when they are making their choices at the supermarket.


Since this issue was raised with me, I have consulted extensively with my community and with free-range egg farmers. The overwhelming message that I have received is that most people don't understand the definition of 'free range'. The assumption in the community is that 'free range' is the farm with green grass and hens roaming far and wide, as depicted on cartons. The reality, as it stands, is vastly different. For products that are allowed to be marketed under the same banner, there is a wide gap in farming practices.


I believe it is fair and reasonable for labelling laws to reflect community expectation. If community expectation of 'free range' is a farm where hens are outside for much of the day with lots of space, then legislation should reflect that. The current rules are ambiguous, and I believe this bill goes a long way to ensuring that we bring the existing definition of free range closer to the expectations of consumers.


I profess that I am not the first champion of this cause. Indeed, this issue has been raised several times over the past decade by representatives of several different political parties. I want to acknowledge Ms Tammi Franks, from the South Australian Legislative Council. She is a member of the Greens. She has done extensive work to promote this issue in South Australia, but she was told that this was a federal issue—so here I am.


I also support the private member's bill that my Liberal colleague in South Australia Mr Michael Pengilly, the member for Finniss, who is within the electorate of Mayo as a state member—a gentleman I don't often agree with—took to the South Australian parliament to implement some standards that this bill sets out. 


I am not surprised that this issue crosses party lines, as it is at its heart an issue about providing consumers with the information they need to make an informed choice.


Reducing the stocking density of hens that are considered to be free range would bring our standards closer to those that are observed internationally.


The European Union requires eggs labelled as 'free range' to be laid by hens with a stocking density of no greater than 2,500 hens per hectare. This stocking density is also followed in the United Kingdom. To think that our current laws allow for a stocking density four times higher than that of Europe and the UK, where in many cases we have lower rainfall and less fertile soil—the two ingredients required for great pasture—shows how out of touch our laws are with consumer expectations.


The reason that this bill seeks to limit the maximum stocking density to 1,500 hens per hectare is to bring it in line with the CSIRO's model code, which was the voluntary code for free-range egg producers before the recent information standard came into place. I'm pleased this bill has the support of the RSPCA, whose code of conduct also recommends a stocking density of 1,500 birds per hectare.


I'm also pleased that this bill has the support of CHOICE. CHOICE has been a long-time advocate for this issue. Their app, CluckAR, can be downloaded and used to scan egg carton labels so you can find out what the stocking density is on the carton and whether it meets your standards as a consumer. This app has been downloaded more than 109,000 times and has been used to scan more than 1.9 million egg cartons. That's an average of 2,500 scans per day. And we must keep in mind that not everybody has a smart phone and not everyone has the time to scan a carton while they're shopping—and nor should they. If ever you need evidence that this is a true consumer issue, this is it.


I'm sure many of my colleagues in this place would have received many emails in their inbox over the weekend from constituents urging them to support this bill. That's not from me. That's because this campaign has been taken up by CHOICE, and I thank them for their efforts in raising awareness on this issue. I can only hope that my colleagues listen to the concerns of their constituents and push for this bill to go to a vote or be adopted by government.


In an act of fortuitous timing, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last week released its enforcement guidelines for free-range egg chicken claims, aligning them with guidelines for the federal government's information standard.


As I have said, this standard does not specify that hens must actually go outside to be considered free range. As long as they're provided meaningful access and have the ability to go outside, they will be considered free range.


I want to highlight the 2015 enforcement guidelines released by the ACCC before this new information standard was released. In those guidelines, the ACCC considered that if most hens do not range freely or do not go outside the barn then to market these eggs as free range would be a breach of the Australian Consumer Law.


My bill explicitly sets out a requirement for free-range eggs to be laid by hens that are able to do so and do in fact move freely in an open range during daylight hours. It's as simple as that. There is no ambiguity. This provides clarification for both producers and consumers.


I've drafted this bill with the thought of catering to egg producers, both big and small, who operate under the current rules. The changes in labelling requirements will not take effect until 12 months after the bill reaches royal assent. I understand that this would provide enough time for producers to make relevant adjustments, but I'm also open to amendments on this point, should it be necessary. I don't want to see any particular producer facing hardship because of labels. I understand it costs a lot to produce cartons, but no producer who I spoke to has more than 12 months worth of carton stock.


I hope that both the government and the opposition will see fit to support this bill and in turn support Australian consumers. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms McGowan:
  I second the motion, congratulate the member for Mayo on her work and reserve my right to speak.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (10:13):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) approximately 16,000 Australians fought in the Boer War in contingents raised by the Australian colonies or the Commonwealth Government (after 1901), or joined British and South African colonial units;


(b) Australians, Lieutenants Harry 'Breaker' Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton served as volunteers in a South African irregular unit, the Bushveldt Carbineers, under British Military Command;


(c) Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton were found guilty at their courts martial for the death of 12 Boer prisoners even though they pleaded their actions were in accordance with orders of their British superiors; and


(d) Lieutenants Morant and Handcock were executed on 27 February 1902, and Lieutenant Witton's sentence commuted to life imprisonment, but he was released from prison in 1904 after representations from the then Australian Government and British parliamentarians, including Winston Churchill;


(2) acknowledges:


(a) that Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton were convicted of committing a serious crime;


(b) the serious deficiencies in the handling of the legal case against the three men, including the right to appeal their sentences by their legal advocate, Major James Francis Thomas, the opportunity to seek intervention by the Australian Government and the ability to contact their families to inform them of their plight;


(c) the failure of British Military Command to implement the recommendations for mercy made by the courts martial to be applied equally to these men;


(d) the findings of respected legal figures and community leaders who support this assessment; and


(e) the ongoing emotional suffering this case has caused the descendants of Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton; and


(3) expresses:


(a) sincere regret that Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton were denied procedural fairness contrary to law and acknowledges that this had cruel and unjust consequences; and


(b) sympathy to the descendants of these men as they were not tried and sentenced in accordance with the law of 1902.


Harry 'Breaker' Morant is a name which is familiar to all Australians, but maybe not for the right reasons. In the movie Breaker Morant, produced in 1980, Edward Woodward, Bryan Brown and Lewis Fitz-Gerald depicted the three Army personnel. It spoke of the executions of Lieutenants Harry 'Breaker' Morant and Peter Handcock on 27 February 1902—some 116 years ago—and the sentencing of Lieutenant George Witton to life imprisonment. The issue continues to ignite passionate debate about the guilt or innocence of these men and calls for the acknowledgement of and relief for their descendants.


I wish to acknowledge some of the descendants of Lieutenant Harry 'Breaker' Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton, as they sit in the chamber today: Michael and Lesley Handcock; Merrill Urban and Richard Williams; Beverley Little, Tony Little and Lynette Pont—all descendants of Harry; Jennifer Witton-Sand, a descendant of George Witton; Ann and Cathy Morant, descendants of Harry 'Breaker' Morant; and Beach Thomas, a descendant of Major James Thomas, their defence counsel. I acknowledge and welcome you here today to the Australian parliament. And I acknowledge their advocate, James Unkles, and his wife, Marie, and the historians Shane and Melissa Williams, who are in this chamber to witness this moment. James, thank you so much for the work that you've done to date in preparing this auspicious motion.


Today, I acknowledge that Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton were not tried in accordance with military law of 1902 and suffered great injustice as a result. The convictions were unsafe and unlawful and the sentences illegal as appeal was denied. This provides an opportunity for the parliament to discuss this.


The war between Britain and the two Dutch South African republics—the Boer War—began on 11 October 1899, when the Boers declared war on the British, and lasted until 31 May in the year 1902. During the Boer War, approximately 16,000 Australians served under British command and about 600 Australians died during the conflict. It was the first major conflict involving Australians overseas.


Harry Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton, like so many other volunteers from Australia and other Commonwealth countries, joined up to support the Empire. The three men became commissioned officers and joined a volunteer unit called the Bushveldt Carbineers. These men shot 12 Boer prisoners while acting under the orders of senior British regular army officers—this fact is not in dispute. The court martial made significant recommendations for the three accused with respect to shooting the Boer prisoners. The court strongly recommended that, due to mitigating circumstances, including their lack of previous military experience, their ignorance of military law and their good military service during the war, mercy should be shown during the trial and their sentences. The court martial and Lord Kitchener, the military Commander-in-Chief, confirmed their sentences on 25 February 1902. He commuted Witton's sentence to penal servitude and ignored the court's recommendations for mercy for Handcock and Morant. Following the trial in 1902, Lieutenants Moran and Handcock were executed and Lieutenant Witton was imprisoned but released from prison following representation from Australian and British parliamentarians.


Today, I acknowledge that the process used to try these men was flawed and that they were not afforded the rights of an accused person facing serious criminal charges enshrined in military law in the year of 1902. The prosecution had three months to prepare cases against the accused before trials commenced in January 1902. That was in stark contrast to Morant, Handcock and Witton, who were denied the right to consult legal counsel until 15 January 1902, leaving one day's preparation before trial to seek legal advice on serious allegations and complex issues with their defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas, with whom they had had no previous contact. Their confinement and their limited time to prepare a defence, including locating and interviewing witnesses, prevented or frustrated them from mounting a defence to charges of murder. The circumstances that led to the execution of Morant and Handcock and the sentencing of Witton to penal servitude were characterised by indecent haste and a disregard for the rule of law and the appeals process.


This is what this motion speaks to. It speaks to the fact that these officers in the Australian Army, serving as volunteers, were not afforded their right to an appeals process. They were also prevented from communicating with their relatives, the Australian government and, most importantly, the sovereign king, who could have examined their pleas for clemency. Had their verdicts been stayed for a few days, Handcock, Morant and Witton could have discussed their options with legal counsel. They could have sought advice from the Australian government, as the military standards would have normally provided. Lord Kitchener made himself unavailable when the sentences were announced and could not be contacted, denying an opportunity for the accused to seek his reconsideration of the sentences. Lord Kitchener's actions ignored due process and denied an opportunity for an appeal or allow the men to exercise their right to a state or military redress of grievance. The sentences were carried out within two days of convictions and the sentences being announced. The accused were denied the opportunity to consider all avenues of review, including appeal action, with this unnecessary haste.


The laws of war prior to 1928 permitted reprisal against prisoners. 'Take no prisoners' was then a lawful order and was construed as such by Morant, Handcock and Witton, demonstrating that the British military had to take decisive action in fighting a devious guerrilla campaign waged by the Boers. Kitchener's decision to issue such orders was considered lawful according to the law in 1901, and one that had to be obeyed by the men. At the time of the offences, the law of reliance on superior orders was recognised as a legal defence in certain circumstances.


Sir Isaac Isaacs, Witton's second defence counsel, who eventually served as Governor-General and Chief Justice of the High Court, entered a submission on Witton's culpability, obedience to superior officers, limited military experience and disproportionate sentence. This could also be applied to the cases of both Morant and Handcock. Following a petition signed by over 80,000 Australians and support from the Australian and British parliaments, Witton was released from prison. Several members of the legal community have also supported the expression that we have here today, and I mention David Denton QC; Robert McClelland, former Attorney-General; Sir Laurence Street QC, former Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court; Geoffrey Robertson QC; and Gerard Nash QC.


I acknowledge the descendants of Lieutenant Harry 'Breaker' Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton. The treatment of these men has caused them much grief and shame. Over the years, their families have had to try to deal with the guilt of the way in which these men were treated. Their collective grieving has been in secret, fearful that they would be shamed for the events of all those years ago. I'd like to express my deepest sympathy to all those in the chamber here as descendants and hope that this motion will go some way to easing your pain from 116 years ago. The Australian support for the British during the Boer War was significant for an emerging nation. This motion regarding Handcock, Morant and Witton recognises their service, respecting that duty to obey the orders of British superiors and be loyal to the Crown.


Lieutenants Morant and Handcock were the first and last Australians executed for war crimes, on 27 February 1902. The process used to try these men was fundamentally flawed. They were not afforded the rights of an accused person facing serious criminal charges enshrined in military law in 1902. Today, I recognise the cruel and unjust consequences and express my deepest sympathy to the descendants and thank their advocate, James Unkles, for his ongoing work. Today, I acknowledge the Morant and Handcock descendants and I note that this appeals process, again, will help bring some closure to what is an oversight and a travesty of military justice. It is through these few words in this chamber that I hope you find relief and that the history books will reprieve you.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:24):  I rise to thank my good friend the member for Wright for raising this motion. I salute his support for men and women in the Australian Defence Force and the interest he's taken in this issue. I also acknowledge the descendants who are in the chamber with us today on what has been an issue that has been a deep scar on and deep trauma of the Australian experience over many years. It was in the context of one of the more traumatic conflicts that our men and women in the Australian Defence Force have been involved in—the guerrilla warfare counterinsurgency environment is the most challenging circumstance that serving men and women can be involved in. We all know the stories that there have been through the years of being unable to identify the enemy clearly in that environment, the severe tension and trauma that is put upon those people in working through difficult environments of being sniped at and, in more modern times, attacked by improvised explosive devices. The incident that comes to mind too, most recently, was the killing of the cook in Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Jones, and the emphasis that that then places on leadership in these circumstances, where we have to ensure that we're wrapping around our personnel, that there are no revenge or retaliation motivations, and also that people that we identify who are experiencing the stresses and traumas of these environments are properly identified and provided with support. 


One thing that really jumps out at you if you look back at the history of this war, as I have. In also drawing on my own personal experiences in many deployments, I've noted that your standards start to get brutalised and can decline. This first happened to me in Somalia. It really came as a shock to me when I identified this happening. I understood then that one of my biggest roles as an officer was to maintain standards, to identify these kinds of pressures and problems that can arise. Many times in my own deployments there were circumstances where it would have been quite easy—no-one would have known—to fudge issues and problems in a way that would have been completely counter to the long-term strategic objectives we had and the interests of our soldiers in both their safety and their mental health in subsequent years. 


Coming back to that experience in the Boer War, one of the things that really jumps out at me is the issue of the mental health of Breaker Morant himself. When his good mate Captain Hunt was killed and his body mutilated, something clearly snapped in him. It was identified by all the observers who were there that he was a completely changed person after that. Because this was an irregular unit, there were clearly failures of leadership about managing those personal matters in that brutal environment. Of course different standards applied at that time about how prisoners who were wearing uniforms were dealt with. The circumstances in which these people found themselves created this massive mental trauma that should have been better managed. 


As has been alluded to, the issue of the 'justice' process was the greatest heinous issue of all. When you look back and think that we became a nation during the course of this war, and our government was not even informed for a couple of months about the process that took place and that these men were executed and Witton imprisoned, that led to the fact that we weren't going to let that ever happen again. So, if there's anything positive that we can say came out of this, it was that Australians on all sides of politics, and in our national approach to these issues, were never going to be subject to military justice again. And just as well, because in the First World War there was a lot of intense pressure to bring Australian military personnel under military justice. The British executed over 300 people—306 people, including Canadians and New Zealanders and Irish—but no Australian was executed. We were subject to our own discipline system. The reason that happened was the experience that occurred in this unfortunate and tragic circumstance. 


So it's important and it's great that we've learned these lessons. I might also say, to the great credit of the Australians serving in the Boer War at that time, that many of them identified and were ashamed and disgusted by some of the practices that were going on there, given, obviously, signals by higher command, and actually raised this issue en masse in a petition to say, 'These need to be investigated and dealt with.' We've learned that lesson. We need to maintain that standard. If we take any lesson out of this, we need to preserve the integrity and the reputation of the slouch hat. Obviously these injustices of the past need to be remembered.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:29):  I commend the member for Wright and the member for Eden-Monaro for their remarks. The injustice suffered by Harry 'Breaker' Morant is something that is in the Australian imagination. I commend the members of his family that are here in the gallery, and particularly Jim Unkles, for his long campaign for justice on their behalf. This is not an issue, as the member for Eden-Monaro pointed out, of whether some wrong act was committed; it's an issue of whether Australian servicemen serving in the Boer War were treated differently to British troops fighting in the same conflict. It's not just clear from the legend of the film but from all of the research that has been done since that that was the case.


I really think the member for Eden-Monaro made a great point: because of this great injustice, perhaps Australian troops were not executed during World War I, which came so soon afterwards. That's a very important step. It was a step that Australia took in seeing that we were more independent of Britain—not that we wanted to disassociate ourselves from the great Westminster system or anything like that, but there were circumstances where the imperial interests of Great Britain, prior to the First World War, were trying to be friendly with the German kaiser. Lord Kitchener felt, therefore, that the Australian colonials could be treated differently to British troops. These kinds of incidents happened after, as the member for Eden-Monaro said—and I'm sure the member for Wright did too—the mutilation of members of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the Boers. It was a very vicious conflict. Breaker Morant and his associates were treated differently to British troops. I think the idea of Lord Kitchener, in making himself absent from any ability to appeal the court martial, was that this would appease the Germans. After all, a German minister had been killed in that conflict. If one looks at even the geostrategic aims of what was attempted to be achieved, no appeasement was raised with Germany. The kaiser was determined to have his Great War; he was determined to show that Germany was the great power in Europe. And such foolish efforts by Lord Kitchener to appease, in anticipation, the Germans by executing colonials was unethical and a mistaken idea.


Jim Unkles, in his wonderful piece recently in The Australian, explained that this is a debate not about the execution of prisoners during the Boer War but about whether they were denied justice. He details the scandalous point that Lord Kitchener left Pretoria and told his staff he was uncontactable, thereby denying the Australians their legal right to appeal to King Edward and seek the assistance of the Australian government. That was a calculated perversion of the course of justice. He may have been told to do that by higher-ups in the British government, but, whatever it was, it was an example of treating Australians differently. I think this country has developed independently since then. That was a key point in the breaking of the commonality between Australia and Britain. If one looks at The Bulletin or any of the magazines that were published in all of the intervening years, they were very strongly aware of this injustice, and it sort of helped develop the independent Australian psyche that we have now, particularly when we're involved in military conflict. It's commendable that we continue to raise this with the British. I don't think any justice will be done until the capital punishment suffered by those two poor men is overturned.



The SPEAKER:  The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. At a personal level, I welcome the descendants of the Morant, Handcock and Witton families to the gallery today and also James Unkles and his wife. Jim is a very passionate and dedicated member of my constituency and I want to welcome him here today.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (11:44):  I'm speaking today on the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017. This bill gives effect to two measures announced in the 2017 budget: firstly, the government response to the parliamentary inquiry into the child support program and, secondly, supporting No Jab, No Pay and Healthy Start for School's new compliance arrangements. Labor supports the No Jab, No Pay component of this legislation as well as the majority of the proposed changes to child support in schedule 1. But we do have some concerns about the changes relating to the amendment of tax assessments and overpayments, and I'll come to that. We're concerned that child support recipients who've received child support payments in good faith will unexpectedly owe debts having already spent that money caring for their children. We've made representations to the minister on this issue and requested some further information. We will reserve our final position on this, including whether any amendments are required in the Senate, until we get this further information on the potential impacts of the changes.


Labor, of course, believe that all children deserve the opportunity to have the best start in life, and we support the efforts in this legislation to strengthen immunisation rates so all Australian children have the best chance at growing up strong and healthy. In government, Labor made important changes to family tax benefits designed to lift immunisation rates. We made the decision to link the family tax benefit end-of-year supplements to immunisation. Ahead of the 2013 election, Labor committed to further tighten immunisation requirements within the family payment system. So the principles on which the No Jab, No Pay policy are based have enjoyed bipartisan support for a number of years.


Let me say very clearly for the record that Labor strongly believe in vaccinations. Vaccinations are one of the great success stories of human development over the last century. We've seen the eradication or near eradication of diseases such as polio and smallpox, including here in Australia. In the early 1950s Australia had just come through its worst ever polio epidemic. Around 10,000 Australians a year, mainly children and teenagers, were contracting polio. No treatment was available for the virus. Polio results in paralysis by destroying nerves cells in the spinal cord. Australia started using the newly discovered polio vaccine shortly after and, by the end of that decade, Australia almost eliminated the disease.


According to the World Health Organization in 1980, prior to widespread vaccination, measles was responsible for around 2.6 million deaths each year. In 2013, the number of deaths from measles had fallen to around 145,000 worldwide. There can be no doubt then that vaccinations save lives. Vaccinations save lives by increasing the so-called herd immunity. Herd immunity means that, when immunisation rates are low, illnesses such as measles or whooping cough can be much more easily spread. In a community where a large number of people are immune as a result of vaccines, the chain of infection can be stopped—the greater the number of people who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with the infection.


The good news is that immunisation rates are improving. Since No Jab, No Pay commenced in 2015, around 200,000 families have taken action to ensure they meet immunisation requirements. Victoria has achieved its best ever immunisation coverage ,with 94.9 per cent of five-year-olds up to date with their vaccinations. The increase followed the Victorian government's No Jab, No Play law, which bans unvaccinated children from attending child care and kindergarten. In addition to supporting this legislation, I commend the Andrews Labor government in Victoria and, in particular, the health minister, Jill Hennessy, for her leadership in this policy area.


This policy approach is working and is improving immunisation rates, but we can't be complacent. In 2014, the World Health Organization said that Australia had eliminated measles. Australia is one of the first countries in the Western Pacific to do so. But unfortunately, late last year, we saw an outbreak of measles in Melbourne. Back in April 2017, we also saw an outbreak of measles in Western Sydney. A total of 28 people in New South Wales and 18 people in Victoria were diagnosed with measles as at November 2017. So the issue is still very relevant here today. As we understand it, the cases in New South Wales originated from infectious people who contracted the virus overseas and brought it back to Australia. However, falling immunisation rates risk exposing Australians to these outbreaks. Falling immunisation rates increase the risk of outbreaks of preventable diseases and threaten the health of the most vulnerable members of our communities, especially newborn babies. This is very important. High rates of immunisations are vital to people for whom a vaccine may not produce a strong immune response. These vulnerable people in our community are generally protected from preventable diseases by herd immunity. Large vaccinated populations protect those who are weak or susceptible to disease. That's why it's important that we maintain and encourage high rates of immunisation across the country. Our responsibility as policymakers is to support policies that are designed to improve immunisation rates and make the community safer. That's why Labor will support the No Jab, No Pay policy in this legislation and the amendments to it.


Currently, parents who do not keep their child's immunisations up to date are not eligible to receive the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement. The family tax benefit part A supplement is paid at $737 a child for families with incomes below $80,000 a year. This bill amends the No Jab No Pay rules to, instead, withhold approximately $28 a fortnight from family tax benefit part A for families whose child does not meet the immunisation requirements instead of withholding the supplement. This schedule would come into effect on 1 July 2018. Under the new rules, fortnightly payments would be reduced from the time that the child's immunisations become overdue. When a child's vaccinations are overdue, the family would be notified and a 63-day grace period would apply for the child to receive the vaccination or for a valid medical exemption to be obtained. If the vaccination is not caught up within the 63-day period or a valid exemption is not obtained, the fortnightly reductions will begin from the beginning of the grace period. This change is required as the existing rules do not apply to families with an annual income in excess of $80,000 a year as they're no longer eligible to receive the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement. So, as I say, this is a measure that Labor supports.


I move to schedule 1, part 1: changes to the length-of-interim-care period. This is a separate part of the legislation to do with child support. Currently, the amount of child support and family tax benefit payable is assessed with regard to the paying parent's taxable income and the amount of time they spend caring for the child or children. Sometimes one parent is providing more care than is provided for under a court order or agreed care arrangement. In this instance, the other parent may be aggrieved because they're not getting as much opportunity to care as they want or believe they're entitled to and they're paying more child support than they feel they should. A registrar can make a care arrangement, which is an interim determination based on 'a written agreement, parenting plan or court order' rather than on the actual care. That arrangement generally runs for an interim period of 14 weeks. In special circumstances, it can be extended up to 26 weeks. The amount of child support paid during that interim period is based on the agreed care or court order, not the actual care, provided that the paying parent is taking reasonable steps to seek compliance with the parenting arrangement. This option of an interim period is intended to give both parents time to resolve the dispute over care. After the interim period elapses, the child support assessment changes to reflect actual care.


In 2015, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs tabled the report of their inquiry into the child support program called From conflict to cooperation. The committee made 22 recommendations, all of which Labor supported. The committee heard evidence that 14 weeks is shorter than the normal length of time that it would take parties to resolve their dispute over care, given the length of time it takes for dispute resolution to commence or legal proceedings to be resolved. The proposal in part 1 of this schedule is to change the length of interim periods. For disputes about care where there is a pre-existing court order, the interim period would be up to 52 weeks if a disputed care change occurs within the first year of the court order, or up to 26 weeks for older court orders if the person with increased care does not continuously take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution through the maximum 26-week interim period, or between 14 and 26 weeks for older court orders where the person with increased care continuously takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. In practice, this seems likely to usually be 26 weeks, as the child support inquiry heard evidence from the Attorney-General's Department that the average time between contacting a family relationship centre and the first dispute resolution session is approximately 12 weeks.


For disputes about care where there is a non-enforceable agreement of a parenting plan, not a court order, the maximum interim period will be 14 weeks. This will be reduced to a minimum of four weeks if the disputed care change occurs after the first year of the agreement or plan and the person with decreased care continuously takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. The interim period ends if the person with reduced care stops seeking to enforce the order, agreement or plan. It also ends if a new care arrangement begins to apply or if the existing one stops applying. Currently, an exemption from participating in dispute resolution processes is available in situations where there's been family violence. These exemptions will continue to be available.


I will now move to part 2 of schedule 1, changes to tax assessments. Currently, the amount of child support paid is calculated on the basis that the individual's tax assessment for a given year is correct, and it cannot be recalculated if the tax assessment is shown to be incorrect unless special circumstances exist, such as tax evasion or fraud. This is problematic where payer parents are obligated to pay an amount of child support that is artificially high and unaffordable or, alternatively, an insufficient amount of child support as a result of their tax return being incorrect. This part of the bill allows for the amount of child support to be recalculated based on an amended tax return. In circumstances where an amended tax assessment results in a higher adjustable taxable income, the higher adjustable taxable income would be applied retrospectively to the paying parent's child support obligation over the course of the year.


If the amended tax assessment results in a lower adjusted taxable income, this would also be applied retrospectively if the paying parent applied for the amendment of the tax assessment either before the lodgement of that year's tax return fell due or within 28 days of becoming aware of the issue with the tax assessment, unless special circumstances exist. This reduces the amount of any potential overpayment that could be claimed from a payee by requiring that action be taken quickly on behalf of the payer. Nevertheless, we have concerns that this could lead to child support payees unexpectedly receiving a potentially large debt, having received payments and spent the money in good faith, trusting that the information that was provided to the tax office was accurate. Child support recipients are often on very low incomes and are unlikely to be able to service a debt, particularly where it has arisen through no fault of their own. We have raised this concern with both the former Minister for Social Services and the new minister, and, as I indicated earlier, the minister is considering the matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (11:44):  I'm speaking today on the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017. This bill gives effect to two measures announced in the 2017 budget: firstly, the government response to the parliamentary inquiry into the child support program and, secondly, supporting No Jab, No Pay and Healthy Start for School's new compliance arrangements. Labor supports the No Jab, No Pay component of this legislation as well as the majority of the proposed changes to child support in schedule 1. But we do have some concerns about the changes relating to the amendment of tax assessments and overpayments, and I'll come to that. We're concerned that child support recipients who've received child support payments in good faith will unexpectedly owe debts having already spent that money caring for their children. We've made representations to the minister on this issue and requested some further information. We will reserve our final position on this, including whether any amendments are required in the Senate, until we get this further information on the potential impacts of the changes.


Labor, of course, believe that all children deserve the opportunity to have the best start in life, and we support the efforts in this legislation to strengthen immunisation rates so all Australian children have the best chance at growing up strong and healthy.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2018-02-12,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (12:01):  by leave—Yanggu gulanyin ngalawiri, dhunayi, Ngunawal dhawra. Wanggarralijinyin mariny bulan bugarabang.


Today, Mr Speaker, we meet on Ngunawal land. We acknowledge and pay our respects to Ngunawal elders past and present, and pay our deepest respects to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today and right across our nation.


I acknowledge Minister Ken Wyatt, Senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy and the member for Barton, Linda Burney. Thank you for your wise and powerful voices—First Australians, leading the way for many more in years to come.


Galarrwuy Yunupingu describes his culture as a 'gift'—a gift to the nation bestowed upon us all. And he is right. But Indigenous culture is not frozen in time. It is constantly evolving. It's dynamic. It is ancient and modern. It is as old as the 65,000-year-old rocks and tools unearthed at Kakadu last year, and as new as Reko Rennie's 'Lighting the Sails' on the Opera House or the hand-painted Rolls Royce he drove across his grandmother's country—Kamilaroi country—to reconnect with his spiritual home.


Lucy and I recently visited the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, AIATSIS, here in Canberra. We learned there that, before European settlement, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians spoke up to 600 dialects of languages. AIATSIS has grouped these into six or seven key language families that are as different, one from the other, as Latin is from Chinese.


When we consider that there are just three language families in all of Europe, we get some idea of the enormous diversity and knowledge contained in Australian Indigenous languages—Australian languages, as Galarrwuy reminded us not so long ago. The largest language family in Australia is called Pama-Nyungan, from the words for 'man' in the far north-east and south-west, and covers about seven-eighths of the continent. The other language families, 'non-Pama-Nyungan', so-called, are found in the Far North, from the Kimberley across to the Gulf of Carpentaria.


At the last election the government promised to protect and revitalise Indigenous languages. Later this month we will hold a national Indigenous language convention on the Gold Coast to help fulfil that commitment.


Language is the great carrier of culture, and so much of our Indigenous languages is, like poetry, almost impossible to translate. These are complex concepts enriching us remarkably. AIATSIS is doing formidable work, and Lucy and I were so pleased to be there and congratulating them on that work. I am also pleased that the government is providing more support.


We acknowledge that we have not always treated our First Australians with the respect that we should have. In 2018, 10 years on from the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, we have the chance to write a new chapter of history, where indigeneity is embraced and not derided, where diversity of cultures and language embodies strength, and where individuals, families, governments and institutions operate in a relationship of high expectations.


The work of AIATSIS reminds us that, far from the stereotypes of poverty and despair, our First Australians are proud peoples who have intimate knowledge of these lands, whose songs date back to time out of mind, who connect all of us, all Australians, to the oldest continuous cultures in the world. This truth should be a great source of pride for everyone. This 'gift', to use Galarrwuy's word, should be honoured.


Indigenous leaders have written to me saying, 'Despite some small gains, First Peoples across the nation concede that the Closing the Gap targets were inappropriate and that there was no community buy-in from the outset.' That has to change.


Last week, COAG hosted a delegation of Indigenous leaders as part of our commitment of doing things with, not to, Indigenous people. We heard very clearly the desire for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be equal partners in this work, and in Chris Sara's words 'to have real skin in the game',  in terms of accountability and opportunity. We heard the need to take the time to get the refresh of the Closing the Gap targets right. COAG agreed to extend the time frame for concluding the refresh to October this year. We must work diligently, but respectfully, and this will allow us the time to do both.


This three-way engagement—the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—will build more accountability into a refreshed agenda. I welcome the first ministers and their representatives here today.


We can not close the gap if we do not have equal participation in the economy. One of the most effective ways to tackle disadvantage is by ensuring that everyone is included in the economy and shares in its benefits. On this side of the chamber we are determined to build a strong economy, where everyone who can work is able to find employment. Our push for an internationally competitive tax system is designed to enable all Australian businesses, including those owned and operated by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, to invest and grow.


In 2012-13, Indigenous businesses secured just $6 million of contracts through federal government procurement. I am pleased to announced that, since we set targets through our Indigenous Procurement Policy in 2015, Indigenous businesses have now won over $1 billion in government contracts. This program, with great credit to the minister, Nigel Scullion, has exceeded all expectations and it is being emulated, as you would have seen, at the gathering earlier with the BCA.


A new $213.6 million 'Bayinguwa' project—the Aboriginal name for Garden Island in Sydney—to design the refurbishment of the Garden Island naval base has just been awarded to a joint venture between Indigenous business, PSG Holdings, and Lendlease.


As part of our commitment to do things with not to, we engaged some 200 Indigenous business men and women from across the country to develop the Indigenous Business Sector Strategy, which we are launching today, to help meet the extraordinary growth in the sector.


Indigenous Business Hubs will be created across the country, starting with Western Sydney, to take advantage of our City Deals, and our government's record investment in infrastructure, including the Western Sydney Airport.


These hubs will be one-stop shops for Indigenous businesses to access the myriad of support services that are out there, all in the one place.


Indigenous affairs minister Senator Scullion is currently working with the NSW Aboriginal Land Council, the largest representative body in the country, on ensuring the hub is designed by, and tailored for, Indigenous Australians.


We have formed an Indigenous reference group to ensure Indigenous people in northern Australia are full economic participants in the northern Australia policy. 


Indigenous Australians either directly own or have legal rights to most of the North: 66 per cent of Queensland, 80 per cent of the Northern Territory and 94 per cent of Western Australia is communal freehold Aboriginal land, or claimed or determined native title land. 


My commitment is to do all I can, and the government will do all that we can, to ensure that Indigenous Australians play a central role our nation's success story in every respect, just like: 


Lola Greeno, Yvonne Koolmatrie or Daniel Boyd, those accomplished Indigenous artists whose work inspired and challenged us in the Defying Empire exhibition at the National Gallery mid-last year.


Our Australian of the Year award finalists—Dion Devow, Johnathan Thurston, and Dr Tracy Westerman.


Business people like Daniel Jones, who runs his own contracting company in Timber Creek in the Northern Territory.


Thomas Hudson, who is expanding his Indigenous tourism business on the Cape York Peninsula.


Kristal Kinsela, who spoke so eloquently at the COAG meeting last Friday, who said her Indigenous business went from three staff to 15, also thanks to the Indigenous Procurement Policy.


Dr Kim Isaacs, also at the COAG meeting, a GP from Broome with whom we reflected on the deep significance of liyan, a holistic concept of well being and connectedness in the Yawuru language. 


Ray Pratt, who has grown his company, Dice Australia, into one of our leading technological service providers in the construction and renewable energy sectors.


These great Australians, and many others like them, prove that the solution to closing the gap rests within the imagination, the ingenuity, the passion and the drive of Indigenous people themselves. Government must be an enabler of this success. 


Too often we are quick to highlight the 'despondency and deficit', which does nothing to help those who aspire to be like Kristal, Thomas or Raymond—to work hard, contribute and succeed, all the while being proud first Australians—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. 


Today, I table the 10th Closing the gap report.


Every day, we see proof that many people's lives are improving. 


As part of the Closing the Gap refresh, state-by state-targets will help give more granular and specific local insight to progress, or lack of progress, and more precisely, where more focused effort is needed. 


I can advise the House three of the seven Closing the Gap targets are on track this year, giving us the most promising result since 2011.


The target to halve the gap in child mortality is back on track. 


The life expectancy target is not on track, but life expectancy has been increasing, and between 1998 and 2016 the overall Indigenous mortality rate declined by 14 per cent. 


Up to 51 per cent of low-birth-weight births to Indigenous mothers have been attributed to smoking during pregnancy, and rates of smoking during pregnancy are still 45 per cent in 2015.


For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, tobacco smoking is the most preventable cause of ill health and early death. Among Indigenous Australians, smoking directly causes about a third of the incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease and around one in five deaths. 


That's why Minister Ken Wyatt, the Minister for Indigenous Health, has announced $184 million towards reducing smoking rates.


I can report that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged five are the first cohort of any children nationally to reach the 95 per cent immunisation target. 


The target to have 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025 is also on track this year.


Today, around 14,700 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are enrolled in early childhood education, the year before full-time school. We must continue to ensure those children are attending, not just enrolled, in order to receive the full benefit.


The target to halve the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020 is also on track.


Nationally, the gap has narrowed by more than 12 percentage points over the past decade, but we need to lift the quality of these outcomes and we heard that very powerfully at the COAG Special Gathering of Indigenous leaders last week. 


The target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy by 2018 is not on track this year.


But the data shows that the gap is narrowing, especially in reading in years 3 and 5, and in numeracy in years 5 and 9.


The target to close the gap in school attendance by 2018 is not on track this year.


Over the next decade, we will put in place a nationally consistent needs based funding system for all schools, with record investment of $249.8 billion, including a $4.4 billion loading for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. We await David Gonski's report on how to ensure these additional funds are spent effectively. But we cannot let this opportunity pass to improve the effectiveness of our record level of spending on education. 


The employment target is not on track, and great challenges remain in community safety, health, incarceration rates and family violence, which we discussed at COAG last week.


Our new Time to Work program will bring employment services into prisons so Indigenous people can leave with a focus on work and break the cycle of incarceration. 


Specialist Indigenous organisation, We Al-li, is delivering trauma-informed training to all 14 family violence prevention legal services across Australia.


We promised to work in partnership with communities, and we listened to the cry for help from leaders, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, in Ceduna, the Kimberley, the Goldfields and Bundaberg. Strong women like Amanda Bennell and Betty Logan are here with us in the chamber today. 


The cashless debit card is not for everyone. But if a community has stepped up and asked for help, as these communities and their leaders have done, we must put politics aside and listen. 


We are committed to stopping the welfare-fuelled violence and misery. We will put the rights of children far above ideologically driven arguments. And we hope that common sense will prevail as we seek support for the cashless debit card for those communities who have chosen to use this tool to make their communities safer for everyone. 


I recognise good health underpins the Closing the Gap agenda. Our government continues to invest substantially and to work closely with communities in a wide range of Indigenous health programs.


From July last year, our government has been supporting the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector through a new network funding agreement with the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO).


This funding agreement was developed in consultation with the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector to inform national policy and support community-controlled organisations on the ground. In 2017-18 we provided $20 million to ensure our commitment to working with Indigenous Australians is a reality.


The last decade has given us a richer understanding about what works and what doesn't, and the most valuable lesson has come from applying Chris Sarra's advice to 'do with, not to'.


Data that ends up in a spreadsheet at the ABS here in Canberra is meaningless. Too much is written about communities and not nearly enough is written for communities. 


To give effect to 'doing things with not to', data must be local and it must be made available to communities—to local decision-makers who need it to know what is happening on the ground, to track changes and monitor progress.


This is a big shift.


The first step was bringing Indigenous funding into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy so we could understand where money was being spent. Then, last year, I announced more than $50 million in funding to strengthen Indigenous research and evaluation so that we know both where money is being spent and what the results are.


As the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory highlighted, the underlying problem was not the level of overall funding but that investment is not rigorously tracked, monitored or evaluated to ensure that it's appropriately distributed and directed.


Provided the legislation passes—and we call on those opposite to support it—our new Indigenous Productivity Commissioner will work with the Productivity Commission to apply greater rigour to assessing what works and why.


I can announce today that we'll trial a new Indigenous Grants Policy which will look at how the billions of dollars we spend on Indigenous-related grants might better support growing Indigenous organisations.


Before the Indigenous Advancement Strategy was introduced, Indigenous organisations received 30 per cent of the Indigenous programs and activities funding. Now, 50 per cent of the value of the IAS goes to Indigenous organisations. We want to lift this even further by leveraging the successes of the Indigenous procurement policy.


As Andrea Mason puts it: 'It's about us, and anything that is about us needs to be shaped by us.' We are doing more to use local expertise to design solutions to local problems, and our best example of that is Empowered Communities. We are hopeful that, through the Closing the Gap refresh process, this model can be expanded beyond the existing eight sites to more communities seeking to work in a place-based regional governance approach and one that meets the needs criteria set by the Empowered Communities leaders. 


That will require stronger leaders. That's why we're committed to the Atlantic Fellows for Social Equity Program, who have also joined us in the chamber today. 


I've said before that our relationship must be based on mutual respect. We must also seek common ground, guided by the values that make us all Australian—values of mutual respect, equality and equal treatment under the law.


Our position on the Referendum Council's recommendation of a constitutionally enshrined national Indigenous representative assembly was not reached lightly. We came to our decision only after very careful consideration. The government remains absolutely committed, however, to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Australian Constitution. 


I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition on 8 December last year, concerning our shared commitment to recognition and the establishment of a joint select committee to work on it further, bringing together in its consideration the work of the Referendum Council from last year, a Joint Select Committee on Recognition in 2015 and the Expert Panel of 2012. I was pleased to receive the Leader of the Opposition's response last Friday and I expect we can now progress this important matter and establish the new joint select committee.


Last year I was humbled to participate in a Gumatj men's ceremony in Arnhem Land. Painted in ochre, these men carry traditions and knowledge that are tens of thousand of years old. Yet, later that afternoon, Nigel Scullion opened the Gumatj Mining Training Centre that has enabled local Yolngu people to gain skills to work in their own mine. Rather than walking in both worlds, these men and women have made their worlds into one seamless continuum. 


Participating in ceremony, and the economy, is self determination in action, just like the 16 Indigenous postgraduates currently studying at the world's leading universities—five at Cambridge, three at Harvard and eight at Oxford, thanks largely to the Aurora Foundation. So now three per cent of our Australian post grads at those universities are Indigenous—pro rata to the Indigenous percentage of the Australian population. 


These great role models, and so many others like them, remind us and reassure us that, as we embrace the diverse, resilient and powerful cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, we will build a stronger Australia for everyone. I present a copy of Closing the Gap: Prime Minister's report 2018 and my remarks.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Closing the Gap</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,7,1,speech
"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (12:24):  I thank the Prime Minister for his remarks. I acknowledge, with respect, the traditional owners of this land, from the Ngunawal and Ngambri people here in Canberra to the Yolngu people of Yirrkala in the north, from the Yawuru people of the north-west to the Yuin in the south-east, from the Noongar peoples of the south-west to the Meriam Mir of the Torres Strait Islanders. 


This parliament, and modern Australia, is built on what is, was and always will be Aboriginal land. I join the Prime Minister in acknowledging elders here, including so many Indigenous leaders in the galleries. I also, particularly today, want to acknowledge the surviving members of the stolen generation.


I'd like to briefly reflect on the apology which took place 10 years ago. When you think about it 10 years on, the apology, in so many ways, speaks for itself. I do think it should be recognised that, without the bravery, decency and leadership of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and the vital support he got from Jenny Macklin, it may not have happened. I think, like so many of the best moments of this parliament, the process afterwards makes you wonder what the problem was beforehand. It's a monument to the bigness, though, in particular to the spirit of our fellow First Australians and particularly members of the stolen generation. 


I don't know if the rest of us have the capacity to empathise, but imagine belonging to a stolen generation who had endured all manner of indignities and injustices and all kinds of trauma and tragedy. I wonder if the rest of us when, at long last, the government finally asked forgiveness could somehow find it in our hearts to grant it. Yet somehow, the stolen generation found it in their hearts to grant forgiveness in the spirit of healing.


Looking back on that remarkable day, there are two things that we ought to remember. Firstly, there were plenty of people who said it could not and should not be done, that somehow saying 'sorry' could be divisive or counterproductive and that it would diminish our history and burden us with guilt. The lesson to all those who spoke against the apology 10 years ago—just as it was for those who argued against land rights, who argued against Mabo, who argued against native title, just as it will be the lesson the next time that people talk about black armbands or the Aboriginal industry—is that there is nothing to fear from recognising and owning the failures of the past and nothing to lose from an honest debate about our nation's history and the way we mark it. In fact, it is how we move forward. It's how we learn. It's how we continue to grow as a people who understand our past and are intent on a better future. 


But there's a second thing I think we should remember. We must remember that the apology was so much more than a set of well-chosen words. I believe it was more than just an expression of sorrow and regret. It was a declaration of intent. It was a promise for action. The continuing weight and meaning of the apology comes from what we do now: from our actions, from the changes that we drive, the gaps that we close and the unfinished business that we resolve. And that's what I would like to talk about today—unfinished business.


In the past 10 years, state governments around the country, both Liberal and Labor, have established different forms of compensation schemes for the members of stolen generations. I do not say that they are all perfect, and I do recognise that there is work still to be done. But around 150 surviving members of the stolen generation who were the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth government—namely, First Australians in the Northern Territory and the Koori people of the ACT and Jervis Bay—have received no financial compensation whatsoever. They are still waiting for saying sorry to be matched by making good. It is time that the Commonwealth lived up to its rhetoric. It's time the Commonwealth stopped outwaiting the survivors.


So today I announce that Labor will establish a stolen generations compensation scheme. To each of these survivors removed from their families, country and culture we would offer an ex-gratia payment of $75,000, as well as a one-off payment to ensure the costs of funerals are covered. Compensation's not about restoring people to the position they would've been in before what happened happened, but it is about resolving some of the unfinished business of the apology, and it follows an original recommendation from the Bringing them home report, now 21 years old. Regrettably, this fund comes too late for many members of the stolen generation. Today I acknowledge those who are no more, who did not live to see justice done.


I also recognise that the trauma of forced removal ricochets down the generations. So a Labor government would provide $10 million to programs that assist with the healing of stolen generation members and their descendants nationwide, to be administered by the Healing Foundation. These programs support intergenerational healing, family reunion and return to country. This money would also provide some modest support for older members of the stolen generation, including help with aged-care services for those who, understandably, cannot bear the idea of moving to yet another facility in another institution.


Reconciliation is not just about confronting the past. It's about making sure that mistakes are not repeated. I think that most Australians would be surprised to learn that there are over 17½ thousand first-nations children growing up away from country and culture. This is twice as many as 10 years ago. How can this be—twice as many?


I think most Australians would be surprised to learn that, in 1997, 20 per cent of the children in out-of-home care were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, but today it is 35 per cent and growing. How can this be? Thirty-five in every 100 children in out-of-home care are Aboriginal kids. The Northern Territory royal commission into juvenile detention revealed that far too many young people from broken homes found incarceration to be a dead end, indeed. The responsibility for tackling this doesn't just belong to the Territory government, any more than the problems of youth detention stop at one set of state borders. We all have to do better.


It's why Labor has listened to First Australians and long called for justice targets to reduce incarceration rates and improve community safety. I actually think most Australians would be surprised to learn that a young Aboriginal man of 18 is more likely to end up in jail than university. In the same vein, it is why we encourage the government to urgently sign up to the remote Indigenous housing agreements for the states, because having a roof over your head is just essential to one's health, education and family safety. And it's why, in our first 100 days, a new Labor government will convene a national summit for first-nations children. We'd bring together the members of the Family Matters Coalition, Indigenous-controlled organisations like SNAICC, state and territory leaders and frontline service providers. We would use that summit to address the diaspora of first-nations children being placed in out-of-home care, to tackle the madness of massive overrepresentation of first-nations young people in youth detention, and to better understand and cure the curse of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and other health issues disadvantaging children's development and their consequent life opportunities. It would be a focus on giving every child the best start in life, ensuring they growth up healthy, in strong families and in safe communities.


Haven't we learned that children in out-of-home care lead different lives to the world we know? They lead lives of trauma and broken trust. In this place we talk about achieving a certain goal by 2028 or 2030, but these kids we are neglecting are the adults we hope will help us meet our targets. We put our faith in these kids getting a great education, finding decent jobs and being role models for others. But surely, if we're going to ask and expect that, we need to do more to provide a better start in life and at home? I believe this involves bringing everyone to the table and listening to Aboriginal people in frontline organisations. How do we tackling the addiction, conflict, violence and poverty? 


We all welcome the improvements in this year's Closing the gap report. I concur with the Prime Minister that it's heartening to see the goals for reducing child mortality and improving early child education back on track. Year 12 attainment remains strong. I acknowledge the progress of the procurement strategy. In this place we should certainly celebrate the successes, the blue sky, and there are many. But we also need to face up to the fact that on too many fronts progress remains far too slow. In the critical areas of reading and writing, numeracy, school attendance and finding good jobs we are not on track. It is hard to bid for a business contract if the reading, the writing, the numeracy, the attendance at school and the surviving family violence is so difficult. I think the most confronting harsh reminder of the road ahead is that there has been no significant change in Indigenous mortality rates in the past decade. We love to spend a lot of time in this place talking about rights: the right to freedom of speech or the right to freedom of enterprise. But what about the right to a fair trial? What about the right to a roof over your head? What about the right to control your own life? What about the right to grow old? 


I think every member of this place would agree that Australia can do better. We have to. So, before the talk of refreshing targets moves any further, we must also be clear about one thing. Falling short is no reason to lower the bar. I think it is uncomfortable for any of us to stand in this parliament and admit failure. I imagine it is hard for any Prime Minister of any political persuasion to stand in the people's house and say that too many of our first Australians endure second-class opportunities and suffer from Third World diseases. It should be hard for us as parliamentarians, and it should be uncomfortable to say it and hear it. But protecting our sensibilities is no reason to lower our sights. We, the parliament, the nation's leaders, must be held accountable. If a government cuts $500 million from Aboriginal services, it should have to answer for that. If a government walks away from a national agreement that is successfully building houses in communities, delivering local jobs and apprenticeships and skills, it should have to answer for it. If a government talks about partnership on health or justice but doesn't match words with resources, it should have to answer for that. 


Today can never be about pretending that low expectations and insufficient efforts somehow carry the virtue of pragmatism. When it comes to closing the gap we cannot be content with aiming for anything less than proper equality. In one vital respect, however, the promised refresh offers us all a new opportunity. The unmissable message from First Australians these past 10 years and, indeed, for far many more years than that, is, 'Nothing about us without us.' The most powerful improvement occurs when Aboriginal people take control of their lives, when governments support Aboriginal leadership and direct resources to those organisations. I have seen it myself. It is particularly true in health, where great Aboriginal controlled programs stand out among disappointing results overall. We know what doesn't work: government-invitation-only events, top-down decision making, hand-picked sources of advice, bureaucratic centralised service provision and the exclusion or minimisation of Aboriginal participation and authority. At Redfern, just over 25 years ago, Paul Keating had the wisdom to say that the problems started with us non-Aboriginal Australians. Today, let us respect that solutions must be authored, owned and controlled by Aboriginal Australians. This has to include a meaningful say for the First Australians and the decisions that affect their lives—a voice to parliament.


I know that the Statement from the Heart at Uluru caught many parliamentarians by surprise. I acknowledge it was not the proposal for change that I expected. It was not an idea that had been canvassed by various parliamentary committees or the Public Service. But, with our shared record on this question, as we look at our inadequate progress on Closing the Gap, who are we in this parliament to simply reject it out of hand? After years of parliaments delivering well-intentioned, incremental disappointment, who are we to suddenly say this idea is simply too big or too bold? Who are we to say that we're only capable of minimalism or symbolism? Who are we to say that, because previous constitutional referendums failed at the end of the last century, we should endure the longest drought of constitutional change in this country and that change is simply too hard? Who are we to tell 1,200 delegates from 12 regional dialogues: 'Go back to the drawing board and try again. We here don't like it'?


It's time for us to be better and braver than the path of least resistance. It's time we took the Statement from the Heart into our hearts. It's time we worked together to deliver on its key recommendations: a voice enshrined in the Constitution; a declaration to be passed by all parliaments—Commonwealth and state—acknowledging the unique place of the first nations in Australian history, their culture and connection; and a Makarrata commission to oversee a process of agreement making and truth telling. I know that some have characterised the concept of the voice as a third chamber of the parliament. That is lazy logic. That does a great disservice to the authors. It does a great disservice to our First Australians. It is not what the delegates at Uluru were seeking and it's not what Labor is advocating now. Nor will a voice supplant the parliament here or the First Australians in this place. Like the Prime Minister, I'm very proud that we now have first nations members represented in more numbers than ever before in this parliament and I'm very proud that Labor has so many first nations caucus members. The parliament could do with more. But, like every one of us, let us not sell them short. Every member of parliament, First Australian or otherwise, understands they have a duty to represent all their constituents. And they come with their loyalties to the parties that have supported them. But we cannot expect them to carry the weight of this issue on their own. We cannot have a process of consultation with Aboriginal Australia which relies on the ability of political parties to elect First Australians. The truth is that the Statement from the Heart calls for what both sides of the House say they are committed to: genuine partnership with, not to; real empowerment; and solutions constructed by first nations people.


In this parliament, we owe it to move past misleading scare campaigns and get recognition back on track. It was in August or September, after Garma, that I wrote to the Prime Minister proposing we establish a joint parliamentary committee to put momentum behind Makarrata and work towards finalising a referendum question. That invitation stands. After eight months, we appear to be resolving the process of a joint committee, but the work of that committee should be about establishing how we advance the voice. Members of this parliament mightn't feel totally comfortable with or were surprised by what was proposed at Uluru, but in this place we don't get to choose what the people tell us. In this place, we listen to what the people tell us and we implement their will. And let me also be very straight—we want bipartisanship. But bipartisanship cannot mean an agreement to do nothing. It cannot be used as an alibi for the lowest common denominator. 


I ask the government to reconsider their rejection of the statement from the heart. But, if we cannot work on this together, the next Labor government will, instead, as a first step, look to legislate the voice to parliament. I say to the Prime Minister and the government—we will work with you, but we will not wait for you. We will begin the detailed design work in opposition, work with Uluru delegates and many other first-nations people who've led the thinking on this issue. And, if we form a government, we will sensibly move to finalise legislation which establishes the voice and includes a clear pathway to constitutional change, enshrining that basic principle that you don't make decisions about people without talking to them. In fact, I think it will be easier for a referendum to succeed and harder for a scare campaign to be run, if we already have lived legislative experience of such a body. 


In conclusion, for 10 years and four prime ministers this has been a day of words. Sometimes we've heard good speeches in defence of not so good results. It is always difficult when constructing a discussion about the nation's progress in partnership with First Australians. If you just talk about the problems, you're accused of not looking at the successes. If you talk about the successes, you're accused of not understanding the problems. It is a mixed record. I understand that. But one thing I know is that, when we work with First Australians, when we genuinely empower First Australians to take control of their lives and when we don't have top-down but bottom-up decision-making, we will get it more right than we will get it more wrong. 


I understand, fundamentally, this parliament is for all Australians. This parliament also is charged to make sure that we spend the scarce taxpayer resources most wisely, most prudentially and most effectively. But the best way to be prudential, effective and equitable is to do it with the people upon whom the decisions are being made. We can close the gap. It is not too hard. And it'll be First Australians, as ever, who will show us how. 


So, with hope and heart, let us pledge, again, 10 years on, to greater cooperation, better results, stronger progress and with a voice of First Australians entwined in every decision. Then we will close the gap. I thank the House.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:49):  Just to conclude my speech from before the Prime Minister's statement, I want to turn to schedule 1, part 3. Since 1 July 2008, parents entering into a binding child support agreement have been required to receive legal advice. Since that time, a court may only set aside a binding child support agreement where there are exceptional circumstances, and a failure to change the agreement will result in financial hardship. Parents who entered into binding child support agreements before 1 July 2008 did not have to have received legal advice but must now meet this requirement before the court can consider varying their child support agreement. This part makes it easier for agreements entered into before 1 July 2008 to be set aside or varied by courts. In addition, this part also allows for child support agreements to be terminated or suspended if the payee ceases to be an eligible carer. Currently, the payer is required to apply to the court for a termination or suspension of the agreement in this circumstance. 


Turning to schedule 1 part 4, collection of overpayments, currently an overpayment of child support can only be recovered if the person who received the overpayment agrees to return the sum or if a court makes an order that the money should be repaid. The Child Support Agency cannot collect an overpayment from a recipient without a court order. This part alters the legislation so the Child Support Agency can collect overpayments on behalf of payers in the same way that it can collect arrears on behalf of payees. According to data provided at Senate estimates, approximately 86 per cent of child support recipients are female and 56 per cent of child support recipients also receive an income support payment from either Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Data provided at Senate estimates also shows the child support recipients have very low median incomes, ranging from around $22,195 in Tasmania to $42,225 in the ACT. Therefore, it's likely that those who are negatively affected by the collection of overpayments will be women who are already economically vulnerable. In contrast, almost one quarter—24 per cent—of active child support cases have arrears owing. The average amount of arrears is $5,800. These figures do not take into account any cases where the child is now over 18 but the paying parent still has arrears owing or any private collect arrangements where parents organise payment of child support between themselves. The implementation of this measure will need to be monitored to make sure that it does not further exacerbate inequities between payers and payees in the child support system. The changes to this bill only apply to overpayments which arise after the commencement of the act. 


In summary, Labor strongly support the No Jab, No Pay policy. We do support changes to improve immunisation rates in the community, and that's why we support the amendments to No Jab, No Pay, as set out in this bill. However, we do have some concerns about the changes relating to amended tax assessments. We're concerned that child support recipients who have received child support payments in good faith will unfairly owe debts. That's why I've made representations to both the former minister and the new minister about this issue. We remain hopeful that in the Senate a compromise on the contentious amendment can be reached. I commend the bill to the House. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,8,1,speech
"Crewther, Chris, MP",LP,2018-02-12,"



Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (12:53):  I'm very pleased today to speak on the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017. This is particularly the case as a number of my constituents in Dunkley will be affected by these changes. It is an unfortunate reality that children are often stuck in the middle, not receiving full support from both of their biological when splits in families occur. It is not fair to expect parents to stay together in unhappy or what may be violent or dangerous situations. The welfare of the children in any family situation must take precedence wherever possible. 


Our child support system in general is a good one. The premise that financial support from one parent assists in supplementing the custody and care of the other parent is fair. It works towards establishing a more stable environment for the children than otherwise. We have a responsibility in this place to ensure that safety nets and institutional measures are in place to ensure that no child slips through the cracks. The primary concern of all parents should be to ensure that their children have the greatest support, and where possible stability, to enable them to grow and learn in an environment that is conducive to their needs and aspirations—something I know well, having my own two-year-old daughter, as does my wife.


However, regrettably, this is not always the case. I'm absolutely a believer in small government. But the government is also in place to provide a safety net for those who are unable to provide for themselves and to provide opportunities for those who commit such time and dedication to care for children to ensure that they receive assistance from those who have a shared responsibility in also doing so. It is crucial to ensure that our child support institutions and legislation do that and can be implemented to secure the best outcomes for parents and children.


This legislation fills critical holes in existing legislation by making several amendments. Firstly, regarding child support amendments, it introduces a range of improvements to the processes and time periods over which changes to children's care arrangements are made. The extension of the interim period that applies for recently established court-ordered care arrangements should see positive changes to the transition of arrangements, providing incentives for the parent to increase their share of care of the children to participate and take an active role in family dispute resolution. Most parents who are involved in child support arrangements behave responsibly, but I have seen from discussions with a number of constituents that it is easy to get caught up in how things affect the individual and not just the child. It would be a positive outcome to bring all parties to the table wherever possible, and this legislation seeks to achieve better cooperation and thus better care for the children in question.


I have a number of examples of where these changes would have made a real difference to a number of my constituents. For example, my office has recently been dealing extensively with a person called Brett, a constituent of mine who lives in Frankston. Every case of family division and child support of course varies from situation to situation and is delicate in that no case is the same as another. However, aspects of Brett's case only emphasise the need for cooperation between the parents in order to achieve the best outcome for the children involved. In particular, an aspect of this legislation that would be of immense benefit to Brett is that it introduces provisions that will terminate or suspend the effect of a child support agreement if the person who was entitled to child support for a child under the agreement ceases to be an eligible carer of the child, when the person's percentage of care for the child falls below 35 per cent. In this example, Brett is the primary carer of four out of six children from his former marriage yet currently has to go through arduous processes through the court to receive child support from his ex-partner, despite being the parent with primary custody. We know that some parents may be in situations where they are unable to care for their child, and this does not penalise them. What we are doing is trying to ease the path for those who take on more responsibility, committing more time to care for their children in their custody, so that they don't then have child support arrangements overturned by courts when they are no longer accurately reflected in the care arrangements.


From 1 July this year, for these arrangements, as well as several other situations in which care arrangements change, child support agreements will be more fluid, in a way that more accurately reflects the modern reality, where lifestyles, circumstances, career paths and family arrangements change with many other factors. For agreements made before 1 July 2008 where at least one party did not receive independent legal advice, the agreement can be set aside by a court if it would be unjust and inequitable for the court not to do so. It would be absurd for new arrangements to continue to operate on outdated child support agreements. We want to encourage parents who may previously have had no care arrangements with their children to be able to share the care arrangements.


So I'm proud today to be supporting legislative changes that will make child support agreements and care arrangements more fair, more equitable and relevant to parents who commit so much time and financial support for their children. Many of the changes made to previous pieces of legislation through this bill are made with the intention of resolving inconsistencies with the objectives of the Child Support Scheme. I spoke earlier about the importance of child support, something with which I know all members of this House are in agreement. I stress that, through this legislation, we can fill some of these holes and make the scheme more seamless as parties to agreements transition to different stages of their lives. I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the chamber to support this legislation with their votes and keep at the forefront of their mind that these changes, each different measure and requirement, are all with the aim of improving the system, which is there to look after children, who often end up caught in the middle.


Another example from my electorate is from a person named Amanda. Amanda is a constituent of mine whom I have been engaged with since June last year. Amanda has been fighting the system for nine years. She experiences financial difficulties and struggles as a single mother yet does not receive sufficient child support payments from her child's father. As is so frequently the case, there are numerous claims and complications in this matter. As it is still unresolved, I will not presume to know all the answers but will continue to do all that I can to see the system improved. It is important to remember that there are always children involved in these situations, and it is their welfare and their support that is at stake when you delve to the heart of the matter. It is for them that we try to make family assistance and child support a more functional and fairer system for all. I sympathise with Amanda's situation and would very much like to see it resolved.


Should the changes to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 succeed as laid down in this bill that we are debating today, we will be closer to a fairer and more functional system and may see a number of child support disputes cease as a result. This specific bill is a response to recommendations 8, 12 and 22 from the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs report From conflict to cooperation: Inquiry into the child support program. In responding to the recommendations of the committee, I am glad to be a part of the process to make our child support system more fair, more equitable and, ultimately, more supportive of the children. I look forward to continuing to work with constituents like mine, such as Brett and Amanda, to see their disputes resolved, and hope that through this legislation fewer situations like theirs arise.


I primarily wanted to discuss schedule 1 of this bill, as child support is something that is so topical and tends to cause a great deal of stress and therefore draws much attention amongst my constituents in Dunkley. But flying under the radar for those who are unaffected by it on a day-to-day basis are the family tax benefit amendments contained in schedule 2, which I briefly want to address. While the No Jab, No Pay policy pre-dates my time being here, it is something that I am proud to continue to represent. Schedule 2 of this bill changes the structure of penalties for families on income support payments who do not meet the requirements for their children's immunisations. We on this side of the House understand that families on income support are in this position because they are in need of the payments. However, the importance of keeping up to date with immunisations cannot be understated. Immunisation coverage rates for one- to five-year-olds at June 2017 had reached more than 93 per cent, nearing the critical level of 95 per cent needed to provide what's known as herd immunity. It is important that all children who can receive immunisations do so to protect and cover those who can't, so that children who are allergic to vaccine ingredients are still surrounded by children who are immunised, leaving no chance that they may contract an illness that may be debilitating to their health and development.


The Turnbull coalition government proposes that, rather than withholding the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement, approximately $28 per child will be withheld from their fortnightly family tax benefit part A payment instead to provide a constant emphasis on immunisation requirements rather than risking the need to be silent for 51 weeks of the year. I must stress however that the value of the reduction is the same as is currently imposed on families whose children do not meet immunisation requirements but will operate in a timelier manner than the existing measures. Reducing fortnightly payments rather than withholding the supplement at the end of the year, as is currently the policy, will serve as a regular reminder to parents to have their children's immunisation requirements up to date. We have seen that, since our government introduced the No Jab, No Pay policy on 1 January 2016, immunisation rates across Australia have increased across all three target groups of one-, two- and five-year-olds. Following the introduction of these policies, more than 210,000 families have been incentivised to immunise their children, demonstrating that these compliance measures are indeed effective.


There are a number of subtle but important measures in this bill that will, with their implementation, go some distance to improving the health and wellbeing of children and families. One of the Turnbull coalition government's longstanding priorities is to support families. Through this legislation, we are committed to improving financial support in the case of separated families and maintaining resistance to serious illnesses by incentivising families to vaccinate their children where possible. I have thrown my support behind these measures, as previous measures have demonstrated that we still have some distance to go in seeing the child support system and children's health checks achieving the outcomes we would like. But, with the changes contained in this bill, we will be a few steps closer than we were before.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:05):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017. This bill does two things, and I'll speak to them in turn. It amends the child support program and strengthens the No Jab, No Pay policy. Both of the measures in this bill were announced in the 2017 budget.


I'll talk first about the amendments to the child support program. The Child Support Scheme was introduced by the Hawke government in 1988 and was designed to address the difficulties a parent could face when attempting to collect maintenance from the other parent. There were concerns at the time that women and children, particularly, were increasingly facing poverty after family separation. The government was increasingly bearing the cost of raising children when one parent was refusing to contribute to their own child's upkeep. The Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs conducted an inquiry in 2015 to report on the child support program. It was chaired by the member for Dawson and the deputy chair was the member for Newcastle. I was also a member of that committee. At the time of the inquiry, the Department of Social Services said 1.3 million parents were in the program and about 1.1 million children were covered by the scheme.


Child support is an emotive topic, as any member of the lower house would attest. This is understandable when the amount of support paid or received is directly linked to the amount of time spent with your children. It is also a gendered issue—90 per cent of receiving parents are female and 90 per cent of paying parents are male, perhaps bespeaking some other cultural barriers and prejudices in our society. The scheme was designed to make it simpler for the caring parent to receive child support from the other parent by giving the responsibility for collection and enforcement to the Australian Taxation Office. The tax office was also given responsibility for assessing the amount of child support to be paid. The responsibility for the administration of the Child Support Scheme has now been shifted to the Department of Social Services and delivery of the scheme to the Department of Human Services.


The social policy and legal affairs inquiry found that the Child Support Scheme works well in the majority of cases. I know that, as an MP, we often see people when it is not working. I understand that. The scheme supports the principle that both parents should contribute to raising their children through care and financial support. Assessments should reflect the realistic cost of raising children and a parent's actual capacity to pay. However, the committee made 25 recommendations to strengthen the scheme. This bill implements three of the recommendations of the committee report. Three out of 25 ain't good but, I guess it is better than nothing. As I've said, the amount of child support paid by a parent is calculated with regard to the amount of time the child spends with each parent. The nature of modern work means that parenting arrangements can change and can change quickly and, when they do, they are often contentious.


The first of these amendments provides for a greater period of time before a child support assessment is recalculated when there is a dispute about the care of the child. There is currently a 14-week limit imposed on interim determinations. The Family Court, sadly, is bogged down, with most matters taking much longer than 14 weeks to be finalised. Currently, the 14-week limit can mean that a parent's child support assessment may be increased just at the time they are trying to reach an agreement on their parenting arrangements. This amendment increases the interim period while one parent is actively trying to enforce their rights under a parenting order and is participating in dispute resolution processes.


The second of these amendments concerns child support agreements entered into between the parents. A binding child support agreement can be made pursuant to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. These agreements are similar in nature to a binding financial agreement made under the Family Law Act. Some might say the binding financial agreements are former Attorney-General George Brandis's only legacy to the Australian legal community—but I wouldn't be that unkind. These agreements require independent legal advice before a party can enter into such an agreement. In turn, they are difficult to set aside. Exceptional circumstances or a significant change in circumstances which have arisen since the agreement was made must be present before an agreement will be set aside.


However, there is an anomaly with binding child support agreements made before 1 July 2008. Those agreements were made without independent legal advice. The amendment that provided for independent legal advice was only implemented on 1 July 2008. Those agreements are currently still binding in the same way as binding child support agreements that were made after 1 July 2008 and have the benefit of independent legal advice. It is easy to see how this could disadvantage a party who has entered into a binding child support agreement between 1 July 2008 without having the benefit of legal advice and they now want to have that agreement set aside or amended. This bill will make it easier for parties to binding child support agreements made before July 2008 to have their agreements varied or set aside.


The third amendment in this bill that concerns child support is slightly more contentious. The amount of child support paid by a parent is assessed on a formula that uses the income of both parents—that is, each parent's income tax assessments. If a person's tax assessment has been amended, the child support assessment will have been calculated using the income from the original tax assessment but the child support assessment will actually not be varied until the next financial year—quite a time lag. This can lead to the actual child support being paid to the other parent being too high and causing distress to the payer or being too low and causing the parent in receipt of the child support to be under unnecessary financial stress and then obviously children can consequently suffer. This bill will allow a new assessment to be applied retrospectively so that the correct amount would have been paid for the previous year. Labor are concerned that this will lead to very large and unexpected debts for parents. We know the harm financial stress can cause to families. We know how important it is for parents to have some level of budget certainty so they can plan ahead for their families. Labor have raised these concerns about this part of the bill with the Turnbull-Joyce government and we will reserve on this final position on this part of the bill until this is addressed. 


Having been a member of the committee that inquired into child support in 2015, I am pleased to see some of our recommendations being implemented. I heard in that committee the raw emotion those issues around child support evince in parents. When love turns to hate, sometimes logic and common sense fly out the window. Families who are in the child support assessment scheme often have issues with payments not being made, assessments being too high or assessments being too low. Those families feel the fallout of these problems every day—each time they go to the supermarket, each time they pay the school fees or buy school supplies and each time they get their pay cheque. Australia's Child Support Scheme is good, but it can be strengthened. That is what the committee reported and why we made 25 recommendations. Without carping too much, it is a little disappointing that it has taken over two years for the Turnbull-Joyce government to take any action on the report.


The second part of this bill amends and strengthens the No Jab, No Pay policy. I want to say up-front and loudly that I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of childhood immunisation. My mother was a nurse and she made sure that all 10 of her children were fully immunised against preventable diseases. My wife Lea, as an adult and despite being vaccinated as a child, contracted whooping cough when she had young children to cope with as well as a husband that went off to Canberra regularly. Having seen the impact that whooping cough had on Lea, an adult who had some level of immunisation, I can't imagine what it would be like watching your own baby suffering from whooping cough. You wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy. It is important that we do all we can to improve the immunisation levels of all our children. Children are our hopes distilled. We know that vaccination works. It has eradicated diseases already in our own lifetime—polio and smallpox.


It might be hard to imagine now, for younger Australians, but Australia faced an epidemic in the middle of the 20th century, recording the highest incidence of poliomyelitis—commonly called polio. Poliomyelitis is an ancient disease, first described in Britain in 1789, that has no cure and can leave its victims with devastating nerve damage, causing paralysis of the arms, legs and diaphragms. Ten thousand mainly young Australians and many children were contracting polio each year. In 1966, which is not that long ago—the year of my birth, in fact—the oral polio vaccine was introduced into Australia. And in 2000 Australia was declared polio free by the World Health Organization. The number of polio cases worldwide has decreased by more than 99 per cent, from 350,000 cases in 1988 to fewer than 420 in 2013.


Do not listen to the antivaxxers. We know vaccination works. Measles was claiming 2.6 million deaths each year before there was widespread vaccination available. The World Health Organization announced in 2014 that measles elimination had effectively been achieved by Australia. There is now no local strain of measles circulating in our community. Obviously we still get individual measles cases in the community that have been brought in by people travelling from countries where the disease is still prevalent. But by keeping a high level of vaccination coverage—protecting the herd—we can prevent measles outbreaks from occurring.


We know vaccination works. All sensible people who believe in empirical evidence know this for a fact. And we know that the way it works is through herd immunity. High levels of immunity in the Australian community make it difficult for disease to spread from person to person. It is the collective community of our population that is important. And it is the responsibility of all of us to make sure we continue to have that high level of immunity. The No Jab, No Pay policy was supported by Labor. This policy has bipartisan support. We know it works. Since the program commenced in 2015, about 200,000 families have initiated or updated their immunisation coverage. That is great news, but we must maintain our vigilance. The amendments in this bill will strengthen this policy. The current policy provides that parents whose child does not have their immunisation up to date will not be eligible to receive the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement. This policy holds no incentive for families whose income is above $80,000, as they don't receive the family tax benefit part A supplement.


So, this amendment will be fairer. All families whose child is not fully immunised in accordance with immunisation requirements will have approximately $28 a fortnight withheld from their family tax benefit part A. This new measure will come into effect from 1 July 2018. The new provisions will ensure that families are notified if their child's vaccinations are overdue, and there will be a 63-day grace period. That will ensure that the family is given time to update the child's immunisation. If the vaccinations are not updated within that 63-day grace period the reductions to the fortnightly family tax benefit part A will be imposed from the beginning of the 63-day grace period. This amendment will make the policy fairer. Families who do not keep their child's immunisation up to date will face a financial penalty regardless of whether they earn above or below $80,000. It is hoped that this amendment will also encourage those families who earn over $80,000 and who've so far not updated their child's immunisation to do so.


The larger the percentage of immunisation coverage in the community the greater our herd immunity, the fewer disease outbreaks we will have and the more lives that will be saved. Labor believes that all children deserve the opportunity to have the best start in life. Strengthening the immunity of our population so that unprotected babies will not be inflicted with whooping cough or other life-threatening and preventable diseases is just the right thing to do. I would not want my children to become ill because other families did not immunise their children. And I'd hate to think that I had contributed to a baby becoming ill or even, heaven forbid, dying because I did not keep the immunisations of my own children up to date.


These are good policy measures, and I support this bill, with the caveat that Labor has concerns about the provisions regarding child support and amended tax assessments. Labor is hopeful that a compromise on that measure can be reached in the Senate. Labor will always support measures that protect our children. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (13:19):  Like the other speakers in this debate, I support the overwhelming majority of this bill and I have reservations about one aspect of it which goes to child support and the potential recovery of payments made to payees when a later tax return demonstrates that the assessment ought to have been less than it was.


The aspects of this bill that go to the other matters are, indeed, very commendable. It is pleasing that both the opposition and the government are in such furious bipartisanship when it comes to supporting the importance of vaccinations. We've all seen news of the damage that's done by antivaccination campaigns. We've all seen the concerns that doctors and other experts have raised in respect of misinformation and, in fact, disinformation in respect of the effects of vaccinations.


It is important to our community, as a whole, that people continue to trust the vaccinations that are offered by medical practitioners and to trust the vaccinations that are supported through the Commonwealth, and I think, sometimes, it's regrettable to see some of the people who are willing to make comments that tend to promote the anti-vaxxer movement. We all know that there's a senator in this parliament who, in the context of the Western Australian election, made some comments supportive of the anti-vaxxer movement. I think that was regrettable, not just because it spread this disinformation but, because when something is uttered by a senator, that tends to give it a cloak of authority and believability—not everyone would agree with that, of course. But when someone in authority speaks it can tend to, unfortunately, have that effect. When those comments were made, I think that they were quite rightly disagreed with and abhorred by people from across the political spectrum, and I was pleased to see that. 


It is absolutely important that we, in looking at this legislation, support the provisions that promote a pro-vaccination culture. It's important to do that not for the individual children who are vaccinated only—though, of course, it is very important for them to be able to avoid terrible diseases such as polio, as the member for Moreton discussed, and hepatitis and whooping cough—but it's also important for our entire community that we maintain herd immunity. That means that by failing to vaccinate you are not just putting your own children at risk; you are putting at risk the children of others.


I want to place on record, though, some concerns about the child support provisions of the legislation and, as other speakers have said, I'm very hopeful that resolution will be able to be reached and compromise will be able to be reached once this bill is in the Senate. The specific concern I have, as I said, arises from the provisions in respect of amended tax assessments. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, child support payments are calculated according to a formula. An important part of calculating child support payments is to look at your income. Child support assessment looks at the income according to your income tax assessment, and there are some serious issues with the use of income tax assessments in respect of child support by some people in the system. Those issues were ventilated during the social policy and legal affairs committee's child support inquiry, of which I was a member in 2014. I've certainly got concerns about stories that I hear of people deliberately failing to put in their income tax return in time, knowing they don't have a debt to the tax office so they won't be fined but that it would materially affect the amount of child support they're required to pay. 


That is a serious problem and I've raised, both in the social policy and legal affairs committee and the tax and revenue committee, my view that we should be doing more to ensure that people who are payers of child support do submit their tax returns on time. There should be more done to promote compliance amongst people who may not have a debt to the revenue but who do have obligations to their children. But that's not the specific issue that this bill seeks to deal with.


This bill seeks to deal with the situation where somebody does put in a tax return and ends up with a changed income tax assessment at some point during the financial year. This bill seeks, at the moment, to allow for that tax return to automatically change the child support amount that's calculated by reference to the formula. That's absolutely fine from my perspective, provided it's prospective. The difficulty arises, of course, when that is retrospectively applied. 


If you are a payee of child support and you have received money in good faith, spent it on your children's shoes, school fees or food, and you are then told that, through no fault of your own and without your knowledge, you now have a debt because of the retrospective application of a provision around somebody else's income tax return, obviously that's going to be quite challenging—particularly for people in lower income households. If you're a single parent in a low-income household and you are suddenly told that you now have a debt, which could be in the hundreds of dollars, as a consequence of something completely beyond your control—something you did not know was going to happen—that obviously gives rise to some concern. 


Similarly, if the money hasn't actually been paid—the money hasn't been received and hasn't been spent—the income tax assessment goes in and there's a new amount calculated by reference to the child support formula, it would not be my view that the payee should be able to recover against the payer for the period when the assessment calculation was different. But I am very concerned about a situation where single parents can be left with surprise debts.


This is a very sensitive area of policy, of course, and an issue that does require some thought. In my submission, the overriding principle that we should take into account when considering how this legislation should work should be the best interests of the children concerned. In a situation where someone is a child support payee and they're doing the majority of the caring for the children, it's going to be a rare case where the balance of considerations would, in my view, support the creation of a new, surprising debt that the person may have grave difficulty in paying. 


Whichever way you slice it, there will be some unfairness in this system. If you end up with a lower calculation and you have paid money, it's going to be a situation where it's either unfair to the payer, because they can't recover that money, or unfair to the payee because they thought they were entitled to it and spent it, as I said, on shoes. In a situation where you cannot avoid the prospect of some unfairness, I would encourage us to look to the best interests of the children concerned, with a view to resolving where the unfairness must fall.


There are certainly many reasons why you might get an amended income tax return. I certainly do not stand here to say that anyone who gets an amended income tax return deliberately delayed putting in their income tax return, but it is important that we are very careful, in making this area of policy, to take into account the impact on individuals' lives and on households, and that means working together to find a resolution. I'm quite sure it's not beyond us. In fact, the 2014 child support inquiry that I mentioned earlier gave a unanimous report, regardless of the fact that this is a highly controversial and contested area of policy. I obviously thank the member for Dawson, who was the chair of the committee at the time, for his cooperation and bipartisanship in the course of that inquiry. Given that the member for Dawson and I, and other members of the committee, were able to, in a consensus and on a bipartisan basis, find common ground in relation to child support bodes very well for our ability collectively as a parliament to seek to resolve the issues in this legislation once it heads towards the Senate for consideration.


I encourage the parties concerned, including the government—and, of course, we will—to ensure that we work cooperatively to seek to resolve these issues. This is important. We are talking about people's lives. We are talking about the lives of single parents, which, frankly, are hard lives to start with. Let's not unnecessarily make them any more difficult. Let's work together to find the best possible solution.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:49):  Just to conclude my speech from before the Prime Minister's statement, I want to turn to schedule 1, part 3. Since 1 July 2008, parents entering into a binding child support agreement have been required to receive legal advice. Since that time, a court may only set aside a binding child support agreement where there are exceptional circumstances, and a failure to change the agreement will result in financial hardship. Parents who entered into binding child support agreements before 1 July 2008 did not have to have received legal advice but must now meet this requirement before the court can consider varying their child support agreement. This part makes it easier for agreements entered into before 1 July 2008 to be set aside or varied by courts. In addition, this part also allows for child support agreements to be terminated or suspended if the payee ceases to be an eligible carer. Currently, the payer is required to apply to the court for a termination or suspension of the agreement in this circumstance. 


Turning to schedule 1 part 4, collection of overpayments, currently an overpayment of child support can only be recovered if the person who received the overpayment agrees to return the sum or if a court makes an order that the money should be repaid. The Child Support Agency cannot collect an overpayment from a recipient without a court order. This part alters the legislation so the Child Support Agency can collect overpayments on behalf of payers in the same way that it can collect arrears on behalf of payees. According to data provided at Senate estimates, approximately 86 per cent of child support recipients are female and 56 per cent of child support recipients also receive an income support payment from either Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Data provided at Senate estimates also shows the child support recipients have very low median incomes, ranging from around $22,195 in Tasmania to $42,225 in the ACT. Therefore, it's likely that those who are negatively affected by the collection of overpayments will be women who are already economically vulnerable. In contrast, almost one quarter—24 per cent—of active child support cases have arrears owing. The average amount of arrears is $5,800. These figures do not take into account any cases where the child is now over 18 but the paying parent still has arrears owing or any private collect arrangements where parents organise payment of child support between themselves. The implementation of this measure will need to be monitored to make sure that it does not further exacerbate inequities between payers and payees in the child support system. The changes to this bill only apply to overpayments which arise after the commencement of the act. 


In summary, Labor strongly support the No Jab, No Pay policy. We do support changes to improve immunisation rates in the community, and that's why we support the amendments to No Jab, No Pay, as set out in this bill. However, we do have some concerns about the changes relating to amended tax assessments. We're concerned that child support recipients who have received child support payments in good faith will unfairly owe debts. That's why I've made representations to both the former minister and the new minister about this issue. We remain hopeful that in the Senate a compromise on the contentious amendment can be reached. I commend the bill to the House.

"Crewther, Chris, MP",LP,2018-02-12,"



Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (12:53):  I'm very pleased today to speak on the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017. This is particularly the case as a number of my constituents in Dunkley will be affected by these changes. It is an unfortunate reality that children are often stuck in the middle, not receiving full support from both of their biological when splits in families occur. It is not fair to expect parents to stay together in unhappy or what may be violent or dangerous situations. The welfare of the children in any family situation must take precedence wherever possible. 


Our child support system in general is a good one. The premise that financial support from one parent assists in supplementing the custody and care of the other parent is fair. It works towards establishing a more stable environment for the children than otherwise. We have a responsibility in this place to ensure that safety nets and institutional measures are in place to ensure that no child slips through the cracks. The primary concern of all parents should be to ensure that their children have the greatest support, and where possible stability, to enable them to grow and learn in an environment that is conducive to their needs and aspirations—something I know well, having my own two-year-old daughter, as does my wife.


However, regrettably, this is not always the case. I'm absolutely a believer in small government. But the government is also in place to provide a safety net for those who are unable to provide for themselves and to provide opportunities for those who commit such time and dedication to care for children to ensure that they receive assistance from those who have a shared responsibility in also doing so. It is crucial to ensure that our child support institutions and legislation do that and can be implemented to secure the best outcomes for parents and children.


This legislation fills critical holes in existing legislation by making several amendments. Firstly, regarding child support amendments, it introduces a range of improvements to the processes and time periods over which changes to children's care arrangements are made. The extension of the interim period that applies for recently established court-ordered care arrangements should see positive changes to the transition of arrangements, providing incentives for the parent to increase their share of care of the children to participate and take an active role in family dispute resolution. Most parents who are involved in child support arrangements behave responsibly, but I have seen from discussions with a number of constituents that it is easy to get caught up in how things affect the individual and not just the child. It would be a positive outcome to bring all parties to the table wherever possible, and this legislation seeks to achieve better cooperation and thus better care for the children in question.


I have a number of examples of where these changes would have made a real difference to a number of my constituents. For example, my office has recently been dealing extensively with a person called Brett, a constituent of mine who lives in Frankston. Every case of family division and child support of course varies from situation to situation and is delicate in that no case is the same as another. However, aspects of Brett's case only emphasise the need for cooperation between the parents in order to achieve the best outcome for the children involved. In particular, an aspect of this legislation that would be of immense benefit to Brett is that it introduces provisions that will terminate or suspend the effect of a child support agreement if the person who was entitled to child support for a child under the agreement ceases to be an eligible carer of the child, when the person's percentage of care for the child falls below 35 per cent. In this example, Brett is the primary carer of four out of six children from his former marriage yet currently has to go through arduous processes through the court to receive child support from his ex-partner, despite being the parent with primary custody. We know that some parents may be in situations where they are unable to care for their child, and this does not penalise them. What we are doing is trying to ease the path for those who take on more responsibility, committing more time to care for their children in their custody, so that they don't then have child support arrangements overturned by courts when they are no longer accurately reflected in the care arrangements.


From 1 July this year, for these arrangements, as well as several other situations in which care arrangements change, child support agreements will be more fluid, in a way that more accurately reflects the modern reality, where lifestyles, circumstances, career paths and family arrangements change with many other factors. For agreements made before 1 July 2008 where at least one party did not receive independent legal advice, the agreement can be set aside by a court if it would be unjust and inequitable for the court not to do so. It would be absurd for new arrangements to continue to operate on outdated child support agreements. We want to encourage parents who may previously have had no care arrangements with their children to be able to share the care arrangements.


So I'm proud today to be supporting legislative changes that will make child support agreements and care arrangements more fair, more equitable and relevant to parents who commit so much time and financial support for their children. Many of the changes made to previous pieces of legislation through this bill are made with the intention of resolving inconsistencies with the objectives of the Child Support Scheme. I spoke earlier about the importance of child support, something with which I know all members of this House are in agreement. I stress that, through this legislation, we can fill some of these holes and make the scheme more seamless as parties to agreements transition to different stages of their lives. I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the chamber to support this legislation with their votes and keep at the forefront of their mind that these changes, each different measure and requirement, are all with the aim of improving the system, which is there to look after children, who often end up caught in the middle.


Another example from my electorate is from a person named Amanda. Amanda is a constituent of mine whom I have been engaged with since June last year. Amanda has been fighting the system for nine years. She experiences financial difficulties and struggles as a single mother yet does not receive sufficient child support payments from her child's father. As is so frequently the case, there are numerous claims and complications in this matter. As it is still unresolved, I will not presume to know all the answers but will continue to do all that I can to see the system improved. It is important to remember that there are always children involved in these situations, and it is their welfare and their support that is at stake when you delve to the heart of the matter. It is for them that we try to make family assistance and child support a more functional and fairer system for all. I sympathise with Amanda's situation and would very much like to see it resolved.


Should the changes to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 succeed as laid down in this bill that we are debating today, we will be closer to a fairer and more functional system and may see a number of child support disputes cease as a result. This specific bill is a response to recommendations 8, 12 and 22 from the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs report From conflict to cooperation: Inquiry into the child support program. In responding to the recommendations of the committee, I am glad to be a part of the process to make our child support system more fair, more equitable and, ultimately, more supportive of the children. I look forward to continuing to work with constituents like mine, such as Brett and Amanda, to see their disputes resolved, and hope that through this legislation fewer situations like theirs arise.


I primarily wanted to discuss schedule 1 of this bill, as child support is something that is so topical and tends to cause a great deal of stress and therefore draws much attention amongst my constituents in Dunkley. But flying under the radar for those who are unaffected by it on a day-to-day basis are the family tax benefit amendments contained in schedule 2, which I briefly want to address. While the No Jab, No Pay policy pre-dates my time being here, it is something that I am proud to continue to represent. Schedule 2 of this bill changes the structure of penalties for families on income support payments who do not meet the requirements for their children's immunisations. We on this side of the House understand that families on income support are in this position because they are in need of the payments. However, the importance of keeping up to date with immunisations cannot be understated. Immunisation coverage rates for one- to five-year-olds at June 2017 had reached more than 93 per cent, nearing the critical level of 95 per cent needed to provide what's known as herd immunity. It is important that all children who can receive immunisations do so to protect and cover those who can't, so that children who are allergic to vaccine ingredients are still surrounded by children who are immunised, leaving no chance that they may contract an illness that may be debilitating to their health and development.


The Turnbull coalition government proposes that, rather than withholding the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement, approximately $28 per child will be withheld from their fortnightly family tax benefit part A payment instead to provide a constant emphasis on immunisation requirements rather than risking the need to be silent for 51 weeks of the year. I must stress however that the value of the reduction is the same as is currently imposed on families whose children do not meet immunisation requirements but will operate in a timelier manner than the existing measures. Reducing fortnightly payments rather than withholding the supplement at the end of the year, as is currently the policy, will serve as a regular reminder to parents to have their children's immunisation requirements up to date. We have seen that, since our government introduced the No Jab, No Pay policy on 1 January 2016, immunisation rates across Australia have increased across all three target groups of one-, two- and five-year-olds. Following the introduction of these policies, more than 210,000 families have been incentivised to immunise their children, demonstrating that these compliance measures are indeed effective.


There are a number of subtle but important measures in this bill that will, with their implementation, go some distance to improving the health and wellbeing of children and families. One of the Turnbull coalition government's longstanding priorities is to support families. Through this legislation, we are committed to improving financial support in the case of separated families and maintaining resistance to serious illnesses by incentivising families to vaccinate their children where possible. I have thrown my support behind these measures, as previous measures have demonstrated that we still have some distance to go in seeing the child support system and children's health checks achieving the outcomes we would like. But, with the changes contained in this bill, we will be a few steps closer than we were before.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:05):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Bill 2017. This bill does two things, and I'll speak to them in turn. It amends the child support program and strengthens the No Jab, No Pay policy. Both of the measures in this bill were announced in the 2017 budget.


I'll talk first about the amendments to the child support program. The Child Support Scheme was introduced by the Hawke government in 1988 and was designed to address the difficulties a parent could face when attempting to collect maintenance from the other parent. There were concerns at the time that women and children, particularly, were increasingly facing poverty after family separation. The government was increasingly bearing the cost of raising children when one parent was refusing to contribute to their own child's upkeep. The Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs conducted an inquiry in 2015 to report on the child support program. It was chaired by the member for Dawson and the deputy chair was the member for Newcastle. I was also a member of that committee. At the time of the inquiry, the Department of Social Services said 1.3 million parents were in the program and about 1.1 million children were covered by the scheme.


Child support is an emotive topic, as any member of the lower house would attest. This is understandable when the amount of support paid or received is directly linked to the amount of time spent with your children. It is also a gendered issue—90 per cent of receiving parents are female and 90 per cent of paying parents are male, perhaps bespeaking some other cultural barriers and prejudices in our society. The scheme was designed to make it simpler for the caring parent to receive child support from the other parent by giving the responsibility for collection and enforcement to the Australian Taxation Office. The tax office was also given responsibility for assessing the amount of child support to be paid. The responsibility for the administration of the Child Support Scheme has now been shifted to the Department of Social Services and delivery of the scheme to the Department of Human Services.


The social policy and legal affairs inquiry found that the Child Support Scheme works well in the majority of cases. I know that, as an MP, we often see people when it is not working. I understand that. The scheme supports the principle that both parents should contribute to raising their children through care and financial support. Assessments should reflect the realistic cost of raising children and a parent's actual capacity to pay. However, the committee made 25 recommendations to strengthen the scheme. This bill implements three of the recommendations of the committee report. Three out of 25 ain't good but, I guess it is better than nothing. As I've said, the amount of child support paid by a parent is calculated with regard to the amount of time the child spends with each parent. The nature of modern work means that parenting arrangements can change and can change quickly and, when they do, they are often contentious.


The first of these amendments provides for a greater period of time before a child support assessment is recalculated when there is a dispute about the care of the child. There is currently a 14-week limit imposed on interim determinations. The Family Court, sadly, is bogged down, with most matters taking much longer than 14 weeks to be finalised. Currently, the 14-week limit can mean that a parent's child support assessment may be increased just at the time they are trying to reach an agreement on their parenting arrangements. This amendment increases the interim period while one parent is actively trying to enforce their rights under a parenting order and is participating in dispute resolution processes.


The second of these amendments concerns child support agreements entered into between the parents. A binding child support agreement can be made pursuant to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. These agreements are similar in nature to a binding financial agreement made under the Family Law Act. Some might say the binding financial agreements are former Attorney-General George Brandis's only legacy to the Australian legal community—but I wouldn't be that unkind. These agreements require independent legal advice before a party can enter into such an agreement. In turn, they are difficult to set aside. Exceptional circumstances or a significant change in circumstances which have arisen since the agreement was made must be present before an agreement will be set aside.


However, there is an anomaly with binding child support agreements made before 1 July 2008. Those agreements were made without independent legal advice. The amendment that provided for independent legal advice was only implemented on 1 July 2008. Those agreements are currently still binding in the same way as binding child support agreements that were made after 1 July 2008 and have the benefit of independent legal advice. It is easy to see how this could disadvantage a party who has entered into a binding child support agreement between 1 July 2008 without having the benefit of legal advice and they now want to have that agreement set aside or amended. This bill will make it easier for parties to binding child support agreements made before July 2008 to have their agreements varied or set aside.


The third amendment in this bill that concerns child support is slightly more contentious. The amount of child support paid by a parent is assessed on a formula that uses the income of both parents—that is, each parent's income tax assessments. If a person's tax assessment has been amended, the child support assessment will have been calculated using the income from the original tax assessment but the child support assessment will actually not be varied until the next financial year—quite a time lag. This can lead to the actual child support being paid to the other parent being too high and causing distress to the payer or being too low and causing the parent in receipt of the child support to be under unnecessary financial stress and then obviously children can consequently suffer. This bill will allow a new assessment to be applied retrospectively so that the correct amount would have been paid for the previous year. Labor are concerned that this will lead to very large and unexpected debts for parents. We know the harm financial stress can cause to families. We know how important it is for parents to have some level of budget certainty so they can plan ahead for their families. Labor have raised these concerns about this part of the bill with the Turnbull-Joyce government and we will reserve on this final position on this part of the bill until this is addressed. 


Having been a member of the committee that inquired into child support in 2015, I am pleased to see some of our recommendations being implemented. I heard in that committee the raw emotion those issues around child support evince in parents. When love turns to hate, sometimes logic and common sense fly out the window. Families who are in the child support assessment scheme often have issues with payments not being made, assessments being too high or assessments being too low. Those families feel the fallout of these problems every day—each time they go to the supermarket, each time they pay the school fees or buy school supplies and each time they get their pay cheque. Australia's Child Support Scheme is good, but it can be strengthened. That is what the committee reported and why we made 25 recommendations. Without carping too much, it is a little disappointing that it has taken over two years for the Turnbull-Joyce government to take any action on the report.


The second part of this bill amends and strengthens the No Jab, No Pay policy. I want to say up-front and loudly that I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of childhood immunisation. My mother was a nurse and she made sure that all 10 of her children were fully immunised against preventable diseases. My wife Lea, as an adult and despite being vaccinated as a child, contracted whooping cough when she had young children to cope with as well as a husband that went off to Canberra regularly. Having seen the impact that whooping cough had on Lea, an adult who had some level of immunisation, I can't imagine what it would be like watching your own baby suffering from whooping cough. You wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy. It is important that we do all we can to improve the immunisation levels of all our children. Children are our hopes distilled. We know that vaccination works. It has eradicated diseases already in our own lifetime—polio and smallpox.


It might be hard to imagine now, for younger Australians, but Australia faced an epidemic in the middle of the 20th century, recording the highest incidence of poliomyelitis—commonly called polio. Poliomyelitis is an ancient disease, first described in Britain in 1789, that has no cure and can leave its victims with devastating nerve damage, causing paralysis of the arms, legs and diaphragms. Ten thousand mainly young Australians and many children were contracting polio each year. In 1966, which is not that long ago—the year of my birth, in fact—the oral polio vaccine was introduced into Australia. And in 2000 Australia was declared polio free by the World Health Organization. The number of polio cases worldwide has decreased by more than 99 per cent, from 350,000 cases in 1988 to fewer than 420 in 2013.


Do not listen to the antivaxxers. We know vaccination works. Measles was claiming 2.6 million deaths each year before there was widespread vaccination available. The World Health Organization announced in 2014 that measles elimination had effectively been achieved by Australia. There is now no local strain of measles circulating in our community. Obviously we still get individual measles cases in the community that have been brought in by people travelling from countries where the disease is still prevalent. But by keeping a high level of vaccination coverage—protecting the herd—we can prevent measles outbreaks from occurring.


We know vaccination works. All sensible people who believe in empirical evidence know this for a fact. And we know that the way it works is through herd immunity. High levels of immunity in the Australian community make it difficult for disease to spread from person to person. It is the collective community of our population that is important. And it is the responsibility of all of us to make sure we continue to have that high level of immunity. The No Jab, No Pay policy was supported by Labor. This policy has bipartisan support. We know it works. Since the program commenced in 2015, about 200,000 families have initiated or updated their immunisation coverage. That is great news, but we must maintain our vigilance. The amendments in this bill will strengthen this policy. The current policy provides that parents whose child does not have their immunisation up to date will not be eligible to receive the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement. This policy holds no incentive for families whose income is above $80,000, as they don't receive the family tax benefit part A supplement.


So, this amendment will be fairer. All families whose child is not fully immunised in accordance with immunisation requirements will have approximately $28 a fortnight withheld from their family tax benefit part A. This new measure will come into effect from 1 July 2018. The new provisions will ensure that families are notified if their child's vaccinations are overdue, and there will be a 63-day grace period. That will ensure that the family is given time to update the child's immunisation. If the vaccinations are not updated within that 63-day grace period the reductions to the fortnightly family tax benefit part A will be imposed from the beginning of the 63-day grace period. This amendment will make the policy fairer. Families who do not keep their child's immunisation up to date will face a financial penalty regardless of whether they earn above or below $80,000. It is hoped that this amendment will also encourage those families who earn over $80,000 and who've so far not updated their child's immunisation to do so.


The larger the percentage of immunisation coverage in the community the greater our herd immunity, the fewer disease outbreaks we will have and the more lives that will be saved. Labor believes that all children deserve the opportunity to have the best start in life. Strengthening the immunity of our population so that unprotected babies will not be inflicted with whooping cough or other life-threatening and preventable diseases is just the right thing to do. I would not want my children to become ill because other families did not immunise their children. And I'd hate to think that I had contributed to a baby becoming ill or even, heaven forbid, dying because I did not keep the immunisations of my own children up to date.


These are good policy measures, and I support this bill, with the caveat that Labor has concerns about the provisions regarding child support and amended tax assessments. Labor is hopeful that a compromise on that measure can be reached in the Senate. Labor will always support measures that protect our children. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (13:19):  Like the other speakers in this debate, I support the overwhelming majority of this bill and I have reservations about one aspect of it which goes to child support and the potential recovery of payments made to payees when a later tax return demonstrates that the assessment ought to have been less than it was.


The aspects of this bill that go to the other matters are, indeed, very commendable. It is pleasing that both the opposition and the government are in such furious bipartisanship when it comes to supporting the importance of vaccinations. We've all seen news of the damage that's done by antivaccination campaigns. We've all seen the concerns that doctors and other experts have raised in respect of misinformation and, in fact, disinformation in respect of the effects of vaccinations.


It is important to our community, as a whole, that people continue to trust the vaccinations that are offered by medical practitioners and to trust the vaccinations that are supported through the Commonwealth, and I think, sometimes, it's regrettable to see some of the people who are willing to make comments that tend to promote the anti-vaxxer movement. We all know that there's a senator in this parliament who, in the context of the Western Australian election, made some comments supportive of the anti-vaxxer movement. I think that was regrettable, not just because it spread this disinformation but, because when something is uttered by a senator, that tends to give it a cloak of authority and believability—not everyone would agree with that, of course. But when someone in authority speaks it can tend to, unfortunately, have that effect. When those comments were made, I think that they were quite rightly disagreed with and abhorred by people from across the political spectrum, and I was pleased to see that. 


It is absolutely important that we, in looking at this legislation, support the provisions that promote a pro-vaccination culture. It's important to do that not for the individual children who are vaccinated only—though, of course, it is very important for them to be able to avoid terrible diseases such as polio, as the member for Moreton discussed, and hepatitis and whooping cough—but it's also important for our entire community that we maintain herd immunity. That means that by failing to vaccinate you are not just putting your own children at risk; you are putting at risk the children of others.


I want to place on record, though, some concerns about the child support provisions of the legislation and, as other speakers have said, I'm very hopeful that resolution will be able to be reached and compromise will be able to be reached once this bill is in the Senate. The specific concern I have, as I said, arises from the provisions in respect of amended tax assessments. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, child support payments are calculated according to a formula. An important part of calculating child support payments is to look at your income. Child support assessment looks at the income according to your income tax assessment, and there are some serious issues with the use of income tax assessments in respect of child support by some people in the system. Those issues were ventilated during the social policy and legal affairs committee's child support inquiry, of which I was a member in 2014. I've certainly got concerns about stories that I hear of people deliberately failing to put in their income tax return in time, knowing they don't have a debt to the tax office so they won't be fined but that it would materially affect the amount of child support they're required to pay. 


That is a serious problem and I've raised, both in the social policy and legal affairs committee and the tax and revenue committee, my view that we should be doing more to ensure that people who are payers of child support do submit their tax returns on time. There should be more done to promote compliance amongst people who may not have a debt to the revenue but who do have obligations to their children. But that's not the specific issue that this bill seeks to deal with.


This bill seeks to deal with the situation where somebody does put in a tax return and ends up with a changed income tax assessment at some point during the financial year. This bill seeks, at the moment, to allow for that tax return to automatically change the child support amount that's calculated by reference to the formula. That's absolutely fine from my perspective, provided it's prospective. The difficulty arises, of course, when that is retrospectively applied. 


If you are a payee of child support and you have received money in good faith, spent it on your children's shoes, school fees or food, and you are then told that, through no fault of your own and without your knowledge, you now have a debt because of the retrospective application of a provision around somebody else's income tax return, obviously that's going to be quite challenging—particularly for people in lower income households. If you're a single parent in a low-income household and you are suddenly told that you now have a debt, which could be in the hundreds of dollars, as a consequence of something completely beyond your control—something you did not know was going to happen—that obviously gives rise to some concern. 


Similarly, if the money hasn't actually been paid—the money hasn't been received and hasn't been spent—the income tax assessment goes in and there's a new amount calculated by reference to the child support formula, it would not be my view that the payee should be able to recover against the payer for the period when the assessment calculation was different. But I am very concerned about a situation where single parents can be left with surprise debts.


This is a very sensitive area of policy, of course, and an issue that does require some thought. In my submission, the overriding principle that we should take into account when considering how this legislation should work should be the best interests of the children concerned. In a situation where someone is a child support payee and they're doing the majority of the caring for the children, it's going to be a rare case where the balance of considerations would, in my view, support the creation of a new, surprising debt that the person may have grave difficulty in paying. 


Whichever way you slice it, there will be some unfairness in this system. If you end up with a lower calculation and you have paid money, it's going to be a situation where it's either unfair to the payer, because they can't recover that money, or unfair to the payee because they thought they were entitled to it and spent it, as I said, on shoes. In a situation where you cannot avoid the prospect of some unfairness, I would encourage us to look to the best interests of the children concerned, with a view to resolving where the unfairness must fall.


There are certainly many reasons why you might get an amended income tax return. I certainly do not stand here to say that anyone who gets an amended income tax return deliberately delayed putting in their income tax return, but it is important that we are very careful, in making this area of policy, to take into account the impact on individuals' lives and on households, and that means working together to find a resolution. I'm quite sure it's not beyond us. In fact, the 2014 child support inquiry that I mentioned earlier gave a unanimous report, regardless of the fact that this is a highly controversial and contested area of policy. I obviously thank the member for Dawson, who was the chair of the committee at the time, for his cooperation and bipartisanship in the course of that inquiry. Given that the member for Dawson and I, and other members of the committee, were able to, in a consensus and on a bipartisan basis, find common ground in relation to child support bodes very well for our ability collectively as a parliament to seek to resolve the issues in this legislation once it heads towards the Senate for consideration.


I encourage the parties concerned, including the government—and, of course, we will—to ensure that we work cooperatively to seek to resolve these issues. This is important. We are talking about people's lives. We are talking about the lives of single parents, which, frankly, are hard lives to start with. Let's not unnecessarily make them any more difficult. Let's work together to find the best possible solution.

They're frustrated about the fact that the promises they were given have not been delivered. They're frustrated at the fact that they've been promised oversold capabilities and those haven't been delivered. I have this from a member of the community: 'We presently have an ADSL plan with Telstra running at about 13.38 megabits per second download, 0.81 upload, with no drop-outs. We recently installed a wireless video doorbell. It will not work properly as it needs an upload speed of at least two megabits per second. A friend in Turner has recently been connected to the NBN.

So, after all the time, effort, money and political capital expended on the NBN, her basic NBN service is no better than my existing ADSL service, and it wouldn't properly run a doorbell.'

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:01):  The Leader of the Opposition, when he spoke in response to my tabling of the Closing the gap report, said that he believed there were 150 surviving members of the stolen generations. Our advice is that there are, in fact, up to 500. I just note that point. We noted the commitment that he made. 


We commissioned some work by the Healing Foundation to inform the government on how best to support surviving victims of the stolen generations and their families. As the honourable member understands, we're committed to doing things with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Australians, not doing things to them. The report is due in April. We will be considering that and the advice of our Indigenous Advisory Council and other Indigenous leaders, as we demonstrated last week at the special gathering. We'll be considering that report and then forming a response.


I understand the spirit in which the honourable member made the commitment, but I trust he understands that, as we've seen with refreshing the Closing the Gap targets, it's taking a few months longer than I would've preferred. The important thing is that we do things with Indigenous Australians, not to them—that's been one of the criticisms of the first set of targets. We've taken that on board, and the next set are going to be the result of very careful consultation.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (14:09):  I thank the member for Forde for his question. This side of the House believes in a lower tax burden on the Australian economy. That's why we're committed to ensuring that the tax burden doesn't rise above 23.9 per cent of the economy over the medium term. We're committed to that. The opposition is opposed to that. They will allow taxes to rise endlessly, as they propose to do. But, when it comes to corporate tax, our position is very straightforward. It's a very simple proposition: if you want businesses to pay workers more, you don't force them to pay the government more. It's pretty simple. If you want businesses to spend more on employing more Australians, you don't force them to spend more on higher taxes being paid to the government. If you want businesses to reinvest their earnings in their businesses so they can grow, expand and earn consistently higher profits so they can pay their workers more, you don't force them to hand over more of their earnings to the government in higher taxes. That's not a theory; that's just common sense. It is common sense that doesn't escape those on this side of the House, or the member for Forde in particular, but has completely escaped the opposition, who have lost their compass when it comes to managing the economy. They're stumbling around in this wilderness of economic policy, in a place where, many years ago, they used to have, in Hawke and Keating, what they referred to as their giants. They wouldn't be recognised in the Labor Party these days.


The Labor Party is about as useful to the economic debate in these times as a pig-shearing competition—lots of squealing and no wool! That's the contribution that has been made by the Labor Party when it comes to these issues. In trying to get these simple points across, the companies themselves have made it very clear. Incoming Woodside chairman and departing Wesfarmers chief executive, Richard Goyder, stated:


… I don't think business are going to have any option but to use some of the benefits of any tax reduction into paying more for people.


Business is making it very clear. BHP's CEO Andrew Mackenzie has said, 'We would invest more'. He said that if the Senate agreed:


… to reduce the corporate tax rate, it would make a strong contribution to Australian economic growth … you could see changes in a matter of months.


The Labor Party is standing between a wage rise and Australian workers. It is the Labor Party's policy to force governments to pay more rather than let those same companies pay their employees more. They have lost their economic compass. They have lost their way. I suggest they watch the Hawke retrospective. They might learn a thing or two about what Labor's economic policy used to be and no longer resembles.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2018-02-12,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (15:00):  I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and his interest in this area. As members would be aware, last year the government announced significant changes to the 457 visa class in order to put Australian workers first when it comes to Australian jobs. So, for example, we've already reduced the number of eligible occupations on the skills shortage list from 651 down to 461 to ensure that overseas workers are only brought in when there are genuine skills needs. We are about to introduce new rules for how jobs must be advertised so that Aussies get the first chance at those jobs. Further, we are investing in the Skilling Australian Fund, which will generate about 300,000 apprenticeships and traineeships going towards areas where there are skills shortages today. 


I can report that these things are already having an impact, because the most recent data shows the number of 457s granted last year was only 70,000. Compared to the last year of the Labor government, that's almost half the number granted. This is particularly impressive because, while we'd only granted half the number of 457s, we'd massively grown the economy and the number of jobs, as we've heard from the Prime Minister and Treasurer, and equally, the number of people on welfare had also shrunk to its lowest levels in 25 years. It's a great trifecta of more jobs, fewer people on welfare and, consequently, fewer overseas workers needing to come into the country to fill those positions. That's a great trifecta for Australian workers. 


It's interesting to contrast that with the Labor years. Whereas we created the positive trifecta of more jobs, more Aussies in those jobs and fewer overseas workers coming into the country, the exact opposite occurred under the Labor government. Let's go through each one, starting with the job creation. Believe it or not, in the last year of the Labor government, jobs actually declined, actually went backwards by over 17,000 people. Look at the welfare queues: the welfare queues increased by 250,000 people under the previous Labor governments. While that's happening, how many 457s came in? A record number of 130,000 457s came in—more people on welfare; more overseas workers coming in to take the jobs; and fewer Aussies taking those jobs. Guess who was in charge of that program? None other than the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:13):  My statement under standing order 143(c) is in relation to the member for Dawson's private member's bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take Home Pay Of All Workers) Bill 2017, which was referred to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for an advisory report on 22 June 2017. This bill does a number of things, including amending the Fair Work Act 2009, providing that any determination made by the Fair Work Commission on or after 22 February 2017 is of no effect and ensuring that penalty rates cannot be reduced in any future greenfields or non-greenfields enterprise agreement if an employee is worse off than they would've been under the award by virtue of the fact that the employee works only or mainly on days on which penalty rates were paid.


The committee notes that the two unions—United Voice, which represents hospitality workers, and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association, representing retail workers—challenged the Fair Work Commission's decision, referred to in the bill, in the Federal Court. On 11 October last year, a full panel of five Federal Court judges upheld the commission's decision. 


Our committee further notes that the Senate Education and Employment References Committee recently reported on matters relating to penalty rates and that the same Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee recently reported on Senator Rhiannon's Fair Work Amendment (Pay Protection) Bill 2017.


The committee has considered the bill. We've taken into account the decision of the Federal Court and the work of the Senate education and employment references and legislation committees and we feel that, as there are no issues requiring a formal report, an inquiry into the bill by this committee would not be a productive use of parliamentary resources. On those grounds the committee seeks to discharge its obligation to report on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take Home Pay Of All Workers) Bill 2017.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:30):  We hear constantly that mining is a big employer of Australians. It is. It is one of our largest industries in terms of directly employing people. It's not the largest. Many may not realise that in my own electorate of Bendigo we still have a lot of miners. We are going through another gold rush in Bendigo. Recent mining has discovered a new seam in our Fosterville goldmine, as well as in our Costerfield goldmine. The Forestville goldmine, in the midst of this gold rush, found more than a billion dollars worth of gold late last year, and we continue to find this high grade of gold. During a recent visit, they looked at a gold shaking table and said that, with good, old-fashioned shaking with water, they can see the gold. It's not that they have to put it through any particular process; it's gold that you can see. They were taking $1 million a day in gold off that table.


They've increased their employment to 500. Of those in employment in 2017, 82 per cent reside in Greater Bendigo. They say that they live in the greatest mining town in Australia. It's true; there are not many mineworkers who could say that they live in a regional city with 100,000 people, great shops, great community, great sporting clubs, great schools and yet they work in mining. Ten per cent of their personnel are women, and about the same are apprentices.


You could say that, in many ways, the goldmining company that the Fosterville goldmine is part of, Kirkland Lake Gold, is a good, old-fashioned mining company. They directly employ their workforce. They invest in the community. They make sure that people have the opportunity to live close to the mine. Some of the workers have chosen to live in Ballarat. They commute and stay in Bendigo during the week, but it's their choice. It is a very small minority. The mining company supports the community through sponsorship. It has a good working relationship with local suppliers. Last year alone, $55 million in wages went back to the Bendigo community. That's the commitment and good influence that mining can have.


Unfortunately, that is not the same—in fact, it is rare—for our large mining industry here in Australia. We know that mining is again going through a boom. In 2017, the Minerals Council of Australia announced that 53 per cent of total export revenue from goods and services came from mining. That is $207 billion. The value of coal exports was up 35 per cent on the previous year. There were record gold exports. It was another strong year for gold, which generated $18.3 billion in revenue. Most of that came from Bendigo, I note. Yet, despite the booms and the increasing profits, what we are not seeing from the majority of multinational mining companies is commitment to community. Gone are the days where they directly employed their workers. Gone are the days where they allowed them to live in a community and build community. An example of how the mining companies have really let down Australian workers and Australian community is Oaky North and the people of Tieri. It was heartbreaking to meet those mineworkers last week here in Canberra and hear them tell their stories. The hairdresser has closed. The local food store has shut down. They're losing their sporting teams. The number of kids going to their local school is reduced. Why? It's because the mining company prefers a fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out workforce. But, even worse, they've locked out their workers. So determined are they to break the community, they've locked out their workforce.


Fly-in fly-out is a problem. We see it increasingly—the way in which companies prefer easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire, fly-in fly-out workers. I've had wives and partners contact me about the impact that this is having on their families. If we're always going to be a mining nation, if we're always going to rely on export mining, then let's encourage our mining companies to invest in building Australian communities and Australian jobs.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:29):  My electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland is over 6,400 square kilometres and takes in most of Ipswich and all of the Somerset region to the north and west—country towns such as Kilcoy, Toogoolawah, Moore, Coominya, Esk, Lowood, Fernvale and Minden. I do mobile offices across this region on a regular basis. Most of the small towns in this region are supporting primary industries across the area. These towns and the people in these towns are resilient. They face hardships like the floods of 2011 and 2013, and like droughts. And there are the severe storms which racked Fernvale in the last few years. 


The people and businesses in the Somerset region have been delivered a delayed, substandard fibre-to-the-node national broadband technology. As I travel around the region, I get complaints again and again. Recently in Coominya and Lowood, I was inundated by constituents who were lined up to speak to me about this issue. I hear from businesses that they are falling behind because they can't get access to the technology they need. And there are more businesses in these country towns that are not in their high streets; they're people in their places of residence running businesses from home. 


Elderly residents with serious and ongoing medical conditions can't get access to online health services consistently. People are often isolated from their families. These country towns are isolated when there are floods. Also, the children in the Somerset region deserve every opportunity—the same as kids in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane—in terms of their education. They need access to digital technology in classrooms and online resources made possible with reliable broadband connections, and that's simply not happening. The multi-technology mix has increased in cost from $29.5 billion to $49 billion. There is more exposure to wireless competition and there will be higher costs over the lifetime of the NBN. It delivers slower speeds. There's less reliable service. Consumer complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman have hit record highs, and we've had the NBN executives confirm recently that the 30-year business case doesn't set aside any funding for upgrading the copper network, which gets flooded and damaged during floods. We saw that in 2011 and 2013.


This multi-technology mix is a real mess. It is a complete shemozzle. It's affecting businesses, farmers, children and agribusiness in the Somerset region. I'm doing what my constituents want me to do. They asked me to raise this issue in parliament. I'm doing it today in relation to this matter. We've also seen the HFC rollout to two million premises halted because of four years of cost blowouts and delays. The technology doesn't work reliably. This is a complete disaster and the government should look again at what they should be doing.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  Is the motion seconded?




Mr Pitt:
  I second the motion.




Mr VAN MANEN:
  The value of this motion is that we're seeking to once again share with the House and acknowledge the importance of open trade and investment policies in a growing Australian economy. Importantly, this is about the opportunity to create local jobs. This private member's motion seeks to commend the government for leading efforts to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership 11-nation agreement, TPP 11. It welcomes the recent conclusion of this landmark deal, which will eliminate more than 98 per cent of tariffs in a trade zone with a combined GDP of A$13.7 trillion. It notes the significant opportunities offered by the new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, and the greater market access to Japan, Chile, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. It recognises the importance of the agreement for Australia's farmers, manufacturers and exporters, and also, importantly, our service providers, who we're seeing being increasingly competitive overseas.


It was my pleasure to speak in the House last week about the anniversary of the Australia-Japan trade agreement, which was 60 years old last year. It was about the positive impact that these trade agreements have had on the local economy and, in particular, on businesses in my electorate of Forde. I have no doubt that in the near future we'll be sharing a similar story of how this TPP has delivered on its commitment to create significant opportunities for Australian farmers, manufacturers and service industries. The comprehensive and progressive agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement will create significant export opportunities for Australian businesses. 


I'd like to commend my colleague, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Steven Ciobo, on his tremendous efforts in the negotiations to deliver the TPP. I also note the former assistant trade minister, the member for Hinkler, Keith Pitt, who is here and who, no doubt, had plenty to do with this as well. The existing free trade agreements have already created new jobs and opportunities for businesses in my electorate of Forde, particularly in the areas of manufacturing and export, in particular, for one of the large businesses in my electorate, Teys, and their export of chilled and frozen meat products to Japan. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, as I noted earlier, will eliminate more than 98 per cent of tariffs.


What we see is that these opportunities are already providing work for people in my electorate of Ford on a daily basis. As I shared last week, Frosty Boy, whose powdered milk products go into frozen ice-creams around the world, employ over 150 people. I was there recently and they were testing new products for new markets. They have a laboratory there that ensures that the products that they bring to market in various places around the world meet the tastes of those particular markets. So, not only is it driving export opportunities and job opportunities, but it's also leading to innovation in the products that are being offered as well.


Now, sadly, when we look at those across the chamber, we see that those across the chamber have no plans to support Australian business. They declared the trade agreement dead and wanted to walk away from the opportunity that would see so many of our farmers and industries flourish. If those opposite got their way, and the Leader of the Opposition was the Prime Minister, they'd see Australia excluded from this historic agreement and deny our farmers, manufacturers and other businesses terrific opportunities. In 2016-17, nearly a quarter of Australia's total exports, worth around $88 billion, went to countries that now are part of the TPP. And now, thanks to the significant increase in market access the TPP provides, Australian exporters and Australian people can expect to see this figure grow significantly. And this is the important bit: it is about creating opportunity for Australian businesses to provide local jobs for Australians that create wealth and opportunity for the current generation and the generations to come. I commend the TPP to the House.

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (11:06):  Whether in government or opposition, the Australian Labor Party believes in transparency. We believe in transparency; we believe in accountability. However, the Prime Minister and his government's arrogant handling of the new Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership shows that they do not hold these values. Rather than an open, consultative process, this government has been working on this deal in the shadows—avoiding scrutiny and refusing to share any independent economic modelling with the parliament. What they're doing is marking their own homework, and it's just not good enough. What we need is someone to actually pull out the red pen.


Independent analysis has been called for by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It's been called for by the Productivity Commission, and even the Treasurer's own Harper review. Independent modelling and analysis was even called on by Liberal MPs who examined the original TPP. But it's funny how things change. The Turnbull government's 'trust me, I know better than you' attitude is out of touch. Labor will judge any deal on its own merits, of course. If this new CPTPP is good for Australia, if it's good for Australian jobs, then, of course, we'll support it—if it's good. However, there are some parts of the original agreement which we, on this side, have urged the government to renegotiate in the new CPTPP—like the inclusion of the ISDS mechanism, or the removal of labour market testing for six countries. We simply don't know the details of this agreement, and we won't until the Turnbull government shows some transparency and holds themselves to account to the Australian parliament. All we know is that without the involvement of the US, this deal will be radically different to the original TPP. 


Australia is a trading nation. About one in five Australians work in a job that's linked to trade, so we need to consider these agreements carefully. We need to see the detail. Rightfully so, Australians are sceptical about the benefits of trade, and we need to be able to provide them with evidence. They need to know what the details are. Will it create jobs in Australia? Australians need to be assured that local workers get first priority—first priority for Australian jobs. They shouldn't be waivered away through free trade agreements like the conservative governments have done with ChAFTA, or Korea and Japan, and the original TPP agreement. This isn't protectionism. This is just common sense. It's common sense when there are people all over the country struggling to get by, struggling to find work, especially in regions like mine in Longman or further up north in places like Townsville. We've got people who have been let down by this government. They've been let down time and time again, so they have every single right to be sceptical about a deal until we actually see what's contained in this agreement.


People in Australia don't want to see Australian jobs sent overseas. We've seen this already happen, with the government outsourcing countless Centrelink call centre jobs to Serco. We know that people in Australia don't want to see foreign workers flying in and doing the work that could have been done by Aussies, by hardworking people in regions, in places all over the country. They don't want to see a foreign worker flying in and taking a job that they can do. So, until this government steps out of the shadows and holds a proper conversation about this trade deal, well, we just don't know. 


Labor is completely committed to Australian trade. We're also committed to Australian jobs. So we're very, very willing to join in on any agreement that does right by this country. We're willing to join in on any agreement that does right by the workers of this country and by people who are still looking for work in this country. We just need to see the facts and the figures. When we do that, then we can make the decision. We can't do that until the independent modelling has been done and everybody is able to see the details of this agreement.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (11:11):  I congratulate Minister Ciobo for signing off on the TPP after many years of negotiation. And they said it couldn't be done. But here we are; we're moving forward. It will be assessed by the JSCOT and hopefully ratified by the parliament later in the year. We've got form. We had already signed deals with Japan, South Korea and China, and I think it is appropriate to reflect on just how successful those deals have been and just how successful the TPP will be once it is signed and in place. If we look at those agreements, we can see that, in recent years, agriculture in this country has expanded enormously. They are going pretty damn well, to be honest. They're having a great time of it. They are a shining star of our economy. In fact, they produced over $60 billion worth of farmgate production, and $48 billion of that was exported. Can we imagine what will happen to regional Australia if we do not continue to open up new trade routes and new opportunities, new areas that our growth products can move into, with the capacity to increase manufacturing, particularly in regional areas, to value-add, to fix the logistics chain? 


All these things do one thing and one thing only—that is, build the Australian economy. If we build the Australian economy, we will continue to build jobs, particularly in regional areas, and it's pretty straightforward. As the member for Longman said, one in five people in this nation are employed because of trade. More trade for Australia means more jobs, and, the faster we can provide better opportunities to Australian producers, the better off we will be, particularly in regional areas. There is only one interest in this agreement, and that is the national interest. There is no other consideration. We as the parliament must act in the national interest, and we should do that as quickly as possible. This deal has taken some time to put together. Everyone is aware of some of the challenges, particularly around countries which decided they didn't want to be a part of the TPP, but we have managed to put together a deal which is in this nation's interest, and we should act on it. 


All of us here are always interested in what happens in our electorates; I'm sure you are, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, as the member for Wright, being an agricultural producer yourself. My region in Hinkler between Bundaberg and Hervey Bay is now the biggest producer of macadamia nuts in this country. As someone who was born there and has lived there most of my life and been involved in agriculture for a long time I have to say that, when it kicked off, I was very surprised by the work that was undertaken. It was expensive; there were long-term returns. But it has been an absolute boon for our region, and nearly all of that product is exported. 


We are a nation of just 24 million people. We cannot consume everything that we produce. In fact, I know that any number of our organisations locally are exporting macadamia nuts, particularly to China and South Korea. Right now, they're going pretty well—they're going very, very well. South Korea is a great opportunity, and the further that we can expand our trade routes and opportunities, the less risk there is to this country. From when I grew up. as a tradesperson, it's what's called belt-and-braces policies. It means that you ensure that you have more than one opportunity, more than one location to send your product to, more than one place you can be shut out of and of course that can shut your business. So the TPP is a great opportunity. It is a boon. It will deliver 18 new free trade agreements between the TPP 11 parties. For Australia, that means new trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and greater market access for Japan, Chile, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei.


In my region, that includes sugar. Sugar has been an absolute basket case in world trade for many years, as we all recognise. But we now have further opportunities for the sugar industry in South Korea and Japan, and this will increase those opportunities in Japan, and also, particularly, if we can get it into Mexico. It is an absolute boon for our sugar growers. As someone who actually grew up in the sugar industry, who spent their entire life in it—through harvesting contracts, milling operations and right through to management—I know these are opportunities for our regional people right up the North Queensland coast. I certainly look forward to those opportunities coming to fruition, because nearly one-quarter of all of Australia's total exports, worth nearly $88 billion, goes to the TPP 11 countries.


We need to ensure that we continue to trade with those nations and we need to ensure that our producers have the best forward-facing price that we can possibly provide for them. That is why we do trade negotiations. That is why we have trade agreements. That is why we have so many people from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade out in these countries, ensuring they act in this country's interest.


So we should ensure that the TPP 11 is ratified and that the JSCOT sign off on it. It is a strong deal, it is in the national interest and I absolutely support it. I thank the member for Forde for putting forward this motion for consideration.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:16):  I read the motion and I listened to the mover's speech. No wonder he ran away—he made his speech and then ran out the door: this is completely absurd. We're debating a motion and the proposed benefits of a trade agreement that no-one has seen. We need to get that fact clear at the outset. No-one has seen this agreement.


We've got speculation and we've got random facts in the motion. I don't know what the assumptions are. We don't know who the winners and losers are. There are always winners and there are always losers in a trade deal. So table it. If the government were serious about wanting us to understand and evaluate the benefits of this trade deal, they'd come in here and put it on table. But it's a complete load of nonsense to have a self-congratulatory motion on a secret deal. Now, it may be the world's best deal; it may be the world's best deal and it will blow you out of the water. It may be the world's worst deal, but no-one would know. But, 'Trust us; we're the government,' says the government member. 'We'll just put a few little facts in the motion and then run out of the room.' He's probably gone to edit or check his Wikipedia page and check that this motion never appears in it!


Labor support an open economy; we do. Trade is good for Australia, and one-fifth of Australia's workers are in jobs that are linked to trade. Trade creates jobs and prosperity for us; that's the structure of our economy. But we hear this complete nonsense over and over again that Labor opposes trade deals: 'Labor, you oppose trade deals.' Then we hear we've betrayed the Hawke and Keating legacy. They are getting very jealous of the Hawke and Keating legacy because they can't point to much that John Howard did in 11 years, except replace a bunch of sales taxes with the GST and sit back for 10 years. The truth is that Labor in opposition have never opposed a trade deal. So despite all the rubbish we hear—'You're blocking the trade deal; you're all terrible'—we've never opposed or blocked a trade deal once we'd seen the detail and gone through it.


We hear about CHAFTA. Apparently we stopped the China free trade agreement, which is complete nonsense. We asked a bunch of questions and we forced some improvements to that deal before it was signed. That is our job as an opposition and, indeed, it's the job of every member in this place who takes their responsibilities seriously—to actually look at the detail. So what we're being asked to do here is: 'Let's go by the vibe of the deal. It's a really cool deal, man. Toke on this deal; it's going to be really awesome!'


Let me bombard you with a few random facts. What is the government scared of and what are they hiding? There will be, as I said, winners and losers. There were through the Hawke and Keating era. Overall, undoubtedly, Australia's economy grew, and our prosperity and national wealth grew as a result of the economic reforms. But there were losers. There were people who lost their jobs and there were businesses that closed and were forced out of business because they couldn't compete. And so we've said that a proper, principled position is to expose trade deals to independent scrutiny and independent economic modelling, for two key reasons.


The first is that this is good practice. At the moment, we have a situation where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade bureaucrats who run around and negotiate these deals are then marking their own homework. They go and negotiate the deal and say: 'This is the best we can get. Now we'll run some figures and say, ""Look what a good deal it is.""' That's not good public policy and not good practice. You expose the assumptions underpinning the deal to independent scrutiny so you can form a view.


The second reason, of course, is to build community confidence. There's enormous scepticism and concern about trade deals, particularly as the nature of the media and human psychology is to focus on loss. So we focus on the losers without giving a balanced perspective too often. Independent economic modelling and scrutiny would, I believe, help build community confidence and help the government understand where it needs to help out and assist people to transition. Of course, it's not just Labor that's saying this but the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Interestingly, the Treasurer's own Harper review said:


Trade negotiations should be informed by an independent and transparent analysis of the costs and benefits …


Indeed, repeatedly, Liberal MPs who examined the original TPP recommended:


… the Australian Government consider implementing a process through which independent modelling and analysis of a proposed trade agreement is undertaken by the Productivity Commission …


That's Labor's policy. The member for Warringah, when Prime Minister, commissioned independent economic modelling of Australia's agreement with Korea, and that was supported and people felt confident. So I do not understand what the government has to hide, and it's a complete nonsense to bring this motion in prematurely.


The ideal trade agreement is with the Asia-Pacific, and it would include India, China, the US and others. We'd see increased growth and interdependence, and that, of course, would contribute to regional peace and stability. But in the meantime we should get some independent economic modelling and be honest and up-front about it, and when this deal is released and we go through it, then we'll back it. Our record does support that. We have backed, ultimately, the trade deals put forward, but only when we've seen the detail. No-one would accept the complete nonsense that's thrown at us that, somehow, we should sign up to something we haven't seen. That would not be doing our job well by the Australian people.

Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (11:21):  The Labor member who just spoke loved to make the comment that Labor always backs FTAs. The only thing Labor has ever had the capacity to do with free trade agreements is back them, and here is why: not once in our history as a country has the Labor Party ever instigated, done end to end and closed a free trade agreement. Not once in its history has it done that. Yet it has the gall to stand in this place and try to lecture the coalition government on FTAs. Today we've heard from the Labor speakers that the great crime, apparently, is that they haven't seen the final text of the FTA document. If they'd ever gone through the process, they would know that the text is never made fully available until it is translated into its various languages. If they'd ever had that experience, they might know what they were talking about. Did they ever release any economic modelling for the three FTAs that they were involved in signing in government? No. They reek with hypocrisy.


I am very proud to be standing here today in support of this motion put by the member for Forde. From the first decades of the New South Wales colony and John Macarthur to the TPP 11—which will be signed in Chile, we hope, on 8 March this year—Australia's reliance on trade has been unquestionable. We produce amazing goods and services, and this government has been supporting our businesses to ensure we are competitive within the global economy. When it comes to ensuring that we knock off any tariff or non-tariff barriers, the apex of any such achievement, and the best and most sustainable outcome is an international trade agreement—a free trade agreement. Under the Turnbull government and, indeed, under the Abbott government, we have achieved historic FTAs, with Japan, Korea, China and Peru. The last, coincidentally being signed today, will remove 99 per cent of tariffs on Australian imports into the rapidly expanding Peruvian economy. How can that be anything but good for the Australian worker and for Australian businesses? Now we have the TPP 11, the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership which brings together 11 Pacific rim nations in a network of 18 new free trade agreements. Both the size and the promise of this deal are breathtaking.


As the member for Forde's motion notes, the TPP 11 is set to eliminate more than 98 per cent of tariffs across a truly immense trading zone, with a combined GDP of some A$13.7 trillion. The direct benefit to the Australian farmers, producers, manufacturers and service providers in improved market access and a sustained boost to exports is significant, with modelling finding that the TPP 11 would lift Australia's national income by 0.5 per cent or more than $15 billion while boosting exports by four per cent, which equates to more than $30 billion in additional exports. It was the leadership and determination of the Turnbull government, led by our trade minister, together with the government of Japan in particular, which worked so hard to keep negotiations alive following the decision of President Trump to withdraw, and finally got this deal over the line with all 11 nations still on board. The TPP 11 is clearly an outstanding win for Australian businesses and jobs, and the Turnbull government deserves to be congratulated.


But tellingly, this is a win that would have been missed completely if Labor had won the last election or if the government had been so desperate for guidance that we actually took the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, who, you'll recall, publicly declared on several occasions that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was 'dead'—dead. Really? That would mean $30 billion in additional exports just tossed away by the Labor Party. That would be an appalling judgement. Thank God for the coalition.

"Katter, Bob, MP",KAP,2018-02-12,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (11:26):  I have seldom, in this entire parliament, heard so much complete and utter drivel. You come in here and you present facts. What are the facts about our free-trade deals? The last one was with the United States. They wanted pharmaceuticals and they wanted phytosanitary quarantine removed. That was what they wanted. According to The Australian Financial Review, the Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian newspapers, we wanted dairy, beef and sugar. Did they get what they wanted? Yes. They got an open-door policy virtually for pharmaceuticals and for phytosanitary requirements quarantined. We have a board now which consists of half United States and half Australia. So they have 50 per cent control over our quarantine protection; not that there was any quarantine protection to start with, so I don't suppose we gave anything away. We pleaded with them not to allow the prawns in. If you allow prawns in, you will get white spot. Well, we got white spot. We got citrus canker. We got Panama disease. We got black sigatoka. We got papaya fruit fly. Our phytosanitary requirements are an absolute joke.


What did the free-trade deal do for us? It gave away the entire coal seam gas reserves of this nation; $23 billion a year was given away. We gave it away for six cents a gigajoule and we bought it back for $16 a gigajoule. In fact, it is cheaper to buy Australian gas in Tokyo and bring it back to Australia than to actually buy it in Australia. That was a magnificent free-trade deal. We freed up the wool industry–oh, what a magical achievement; it is now costing the nation $16 billion a year. Ethanol: 'Oh, we must have a level playing field; we must have a free market.' So, whilst Brazil produces ethanol and provides a $4 billion cross subsidy to its sugar industry, we're 'free trading', so we import $23 billion worth of petrol every year instead of producing one litre of petrol of our own, which, of course, we could do tomorrow with ethanol. Oh, and we wiped out the entire manufacturing industry of Australia. The car industry alone was $25 billion a year. Just in coal seam gas, wool, ethanol and motor vehicles, we have lost $40, $50, $60, $70 billion in just five items. In the last free trade deal that we did, what did we get for dairy? We got the equivalent of an ice cream a week. That was the benefit for the Australian dairymen. That's what we got. For beef it was, 'In 10 years time, we might open it up and have a free industry.' That's four administrations you'll go through before you get a freeing-up of the industry. For sugar, we were wiped like a dirty rag. So that was our success story on this wonderful free trade agreement. America's success story was marvellous. 


We see crawling, drivelling, sycophants. They belong to the colonial era. All they want to do is race out there and say, 'Oh, teacher, I'm the good boy in the class. I'm the one doing the right thing. I free up trade!' We all signed an agreement to reduce our protection and support levels by 30 per cent when we signed the agricultural free trade agreements. Every country on earth kept them just about where they were, except for two countries: Australia and New Zealand. They abolished all of their protection completely. It's very simple: you're sending your gladiator into the arena without a helmet and without a shield. He's still got his sword but he's got no helmet or shield. He says, 'Hold on a minute, mate. My adversary's got a helmet and a shield.' 'Oh, yeah, but if you fight without a helmet and shield, it'll make you tough'. No, it won't. It'll make you dead. That's where we lie at the present moment: with no manufacturing base, without any petrol and without any possibility of competing on a level playing field now or in the future. What drivel we have heard. (Time expired)

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (16:00):  Last Friday, I had the opportunity to visit St Abdisho's church in Coolaroo in my electorate and to finally meet with His Grace Mar Benyamin Elya, the bishop of the diocese of Victoria and New Zealand, newly appointed last year and finally come to us from Sydney. Bishop Elya heads the spiritual needs of the Assyrian community in Victoria and, in particular, in my electorate, which is a community that's a very large and fast-growing community. In more recent times, with the arrival of a large number of refugees from Syria and Iraq, we have seen members of the local Assyrian community swell up to about 1,500 families.


I've had many discussions with the bishop, but one discussion of importance was his desire to establish a school that will service the needs of the Assyrian community in my electorate—a similar school, I understand, exists in New South Wales. The vision for a school to service the needs of the community is very pertinent, especially in this instance because schools, like churches or places of worship, become a significant infrastructure for newly emerging communities. I'm looking forward to working with His Grace on this project. He represents a new generation of religious leaders in Australia. He came here when he was 12 years of age and he's best equipped to meet the needs of that emerging community.

Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (16:46):  I move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges the Order of Australia is the highest national honour award and the pre-eminent way Australians recognise the achievements and service of their fellow citizens;


(2) recognises that since being established by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, there have been more than 500 recipients of Companion of the Order of Australia, almost 3,000 awarded Officers of the Order of Australia, more than 10,000 inducted as Members of the Order of Australia and more than 23,000 honoured as recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia;


(3) notes the almost 900 recipients in the General Division of the Order of Australia on Australia Day in 2018, from an array of fields including education, arts, sport, science and social work; and


(4) encourages all Members to congratulate recipients from their electorates on this immense achievement.


Australia Day honours recipients reflect the best of our country. Australia's honours system allows us to shine a spotlight on our role models. Not only does it give us a chance to say, 'Thank you for your service,' but the recipients serve as a reminder of everything we can and should aspire to be. This Australia Day, I was proud to see Berowra residents being appointed to the Order of Australia.


Dr Diana O'Halloran, from Glenorie, was made an officer of the Order of Australia for her contribution to medicine and general practice. Diana's pioneering work in the field of general practice in Western Sydney has included her ongoing advocacy for reform in the provision of accessible, high-quality health care.


Judith Horton, from Middle Dural, was appointed to the Order of Australia for her contribution to horticulture and gardening. Judith has been involved in the Australian open gardens scheme, has edited Yates Garden Guide and has helped grow the Galston District Garden Club, which runs the popular Galston Open Gardens Weekend every spring. Berowra's bushland is a fitting home for a woman of Judith's talents. We're lucky to count her as one of our own.


Rosalind Carlson, from Arcadia, was recognised for her service to choral music and education. Rosalind's desire to impress a love of music on others has enriched the musical life of both Berowra and our nation. Rosalind wears many hats as an accomplished musical writer, performer and conductor—thus it's only fitting that she now adds Order of Australia recipient to her list of titles.


Julie Griffin, from Westleigh, was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her tremendous service to women in Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai. As a survivor of domestic violence, Julie's passion and drive have seen her involved in the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai domestic violence network for 25 years. Three years ago, she helped launch the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Women's Shelter. Julie is a source of great motivation for the many women she works with, and her award is a fitting thankyou to someone who makes a difference.


The Rev. Dr David Claydon, from Hornsby Heights, was honoured for his service to the Anglican Church, interfaith relations and refugees. David Claydon, I'm proud to say, has been a family friend for generations. He has been a much-loved Anglican minister in Berowra, and he and his wife Robyn are admired internationally for their work with Christians and for their great humanity. David and Robyn Claydon have travelled to more than 80 countries for their work with an impressive array or organisations, including human rights organisations for the Middle East and Africa. I often speak to David about interfaith and ecumenical works in this place. The recognition of David's work locally, nationally and, indeed, internationally is richly deserved. Unfortunately, David's recovering from major heart surgery. We wish him well for a speedy recovery.


Two other Australia Day honourees from my community also deserve special mention. Craig Easy from Hornsby was awarded the Australian Fire Services Medal for his contribution to the Fire & Rescue New South Wales over many years. Our firefighters, like Craig, are the backbone of this nation. And mathematics teacher Eddie Woo, from Cherrybrook Technology High School, was named Australia's Local Hero for his innovative and inclusive teaching methods. His 'Wootube' videos began as a way of keeping a student with cancer engaged and educated during his illness. What began for an intended audience of one has now evolved into an internet sensation, providing thousands of people with the opportunity to further their education and learn a love for maths.


Outside my electorate, I would like to make special mention of three other honourees who have personally inspired me. Danny Lamm's contribution to Australia-Israel relations was quite rightly recognised. I worked alongside Danny on the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. I know firsthand how deserving Danny is.


Greg Whitby's innovative and passionate work with Catholic Education over many years was recognised. I valued his experience during my work at the Australian Catholic University, and I continue to benefit from his counsel as Director of Education in the Parramatta Diocese.


My friend Brian Loughnane worked with every Liberal leader since 1994, and served both as the Victorian and federal director of my party, running outstanding campaign wins in 2004 and 2013. He has a well-deserved international reputation as being an outstanding political strategist. There are two sorts of people who become federal or state director: those for whom it's just a job and those who believe in the cause deeply. Brian is very much in the latter category. Turning 18 on that glorious day when Gough Whitlam was sacked, Brian used to maintain a list of 100 reasons why Billy McMahon was a better Prime Minister than Gough Whitlam. It was a list to which he was adding constantly.


Equally at home amongst seasoned campaigners or liberal and conservative intellectuals, Brian understood that the party operates in a broader cultural environment of global ideas and political activism in the liberal and conservative tradition. I was honoured that Brian's last function as federal director was addressing my branch in 2016 and that he came and helped me on my campaign. Brian Loughnane, Officer of the Order of Australia, I salute you.


All the people I have mentioned contributed in their own way. So it's right that we as a parliament take time to recognise great Australians who serve our nation in the way that they do.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:52):  I second the motion. On Australia Day in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, we also honour dedicated and hardworking citizens in a number of ways. In the Hawkesbury, Peter Webb was named Hawkesbury's Citizen of the Year. He has worked tirelessly with the Suicide Prevention & Support Network Western Sydney. He is also involved in the organisation of this Sunday's Hope Walk at Clarendon. His aim has been to break the stigma of mental illness, support people who've considered suicide and provide support to those who've lost someone to suicide. Adam Higgins of Blaxlands Ridge was recognised as Young Citizen of the Year, thanks to his involvement with the Rural Fire Service Cadet Program at Colo High School, where he has served as senior deputy cadet for the last two years.


The work to establish Pink Finns earned Jodie Amor the Volunteer of the Year Award. Jodie and her team assist women and their families dealing with cancer. The Blue Datto Foundation, established by the Vassallo family in memory of their son, Philip, was recognised as Community Organisation of the Year. Their educational program, Keeping Safe, has brought driver safety to the forefront of schools across Western Sydney.


The Local Hero in the Hawkesbury was Peter Ross, who saved a two-year-old girl from drowning at North Richmond. His efforts in rescuing and performing CPR on this child changed her future and her family's future. Both Jacki-Lynn Griffiths and 10-year-old Lily Spies received the Environmental Award. Ms Griffiths has been rescuing local wildlife for the past 20 years, while Ms Spies's school project on the impact of single-use plastic bags inspired her to take up the issue with local council.


The St Matthews Bicentennial Team received the Hawkesbury Cultural Award for their brilliant celebration of the church and its parish. And, as the eye at many local events, Hawkesbury Camera Club were celebrated through the Hawkesbury Community Arts Award. In terms of the Order of Australia medal, my friend former councillor Christine Paine was honoured for her 25 years of passionate and dedicated service as a local Hawkesbury councillor. We all know how much she deserved that award. Each of these citizens and organisations contribute to the strong and vibrant fabric that holds the Hawkesbury community together and reminds us of how lucky we are to be part of that community.


On Australia Day, the Blue Mountains recognises its citizens who give of themselves for their community and they award three local citizen of the year awards. Carmel Higgins was named Blue Mountains Citizen of the Year, recognising almost 50 years of service to St Finbar's Netball Club, and the Blue Mountains Netball Association. Carmel began as coach for the club in 1970 and has served in virtually every executive position, including president. Most recently, she was involved in the Walking Netball project, which allows women to continue to play their beloved sport even as their knees grow older. Young Citizen of the Year was Andrew Gunn, in recognition of his service as a youth counsellor. In this role, he's used the Youth Summit Radio program to raise awareness about issues of youth homelessness, abuse, mental health and LGBTQI rights. The Springwood Foundation Day committee has organised the formal celebrations of the town's heritage over the past 20 years. They were awarded the Community Achievement of the Year Award for their efforts in fundraising through this event and contributing to the vibrancy of the local area.


Four people in the Blue Mountains received Australia Day honours. Heather Gwilliam of Mount Riverview and Ian Ellis, known as 'Ike', of Springwood, were both awarded the Order of Australia Medal. Ms Gwilliam has been a volunteer with Anglicare Disaster Recovery and Gateway, which provides resources for local families. I certainly benefitted from her leadership during the 2013 bushfires. Ian Ellis, a former Assistant Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force and a hostage negotiator, was instrumental in the development of alternative approaches for young offenders. They're both to be congratulated. Dr Caroline Bowen of Wentworth Falls was celebrated for her work in speech pathology through the Member of the Order of Australia. This shows just how vital having good speech is, and Dr Bowen has done a lot of work in this area.


The Conspicuous Service Cross was awarded to Chaplain (Air Commodore) Kevin Russell for his work in bringing gender and age diversity to the chaplain roles at the RAAF. He doesn't think they should all be white males, and he's gone out of his way to make a difference to the chaplain's program there.


These members are some of the many enthused, dedicated and compassionate citizens who have helped make the Blue Mountains the strong community that it is. We celebrate them and we thank them all for their contribution to our community.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:57):  I thank my good friend the member for Berowra for the opportunity to recognise some of our great Australians this year. This year in the electorate of Fisher, the hard work and bravery of our local emergency services personnel was recognised. Mark Campbell of Moffat Beach received the Australian Fire Services Medal. Mr Campbell has more than 30 years experience in the service and has used that experience to benefit the next generation, training new recruits and experienced firefighters alike. SES Sunshine Coast leader Donald Patterson of Twin Waters and Acting Regional Manager of the Central Region SES, Andrew Wyatt, of Caloundra, also received the Emergency Services Medal for their many years of dedicated service.


Along with these great Australians in my electorate of Fisher, we are proud to have the Thompson Institute. I've spoken often in this place about the cutting edge work that is going on there in mental health research and treatment, and about the $5 million that the Turnbull government delivered to support that great work. What I've not spoken about is the man who the Thompson Institute is named after, Roy Thompson. Roy, along with his wife, Nola, are two of the Sunshine Coast's greatest philanthropists.


Like many great Australian stories, Roy's began in humble circumstances: in a single-income family with a father working hard in the local gasworks. Things were not much better for the Thompsons in the 1970s, when Roy and Nola brought up their eight children on a modest builder's wage. But in the end Australia rewards hard work, imagination and commitment. Roy went into real estate and he had a great deal of success creating or transforming a host of Sunshine Coast landmarks, like Chifley's Hotel, along the way.


The list of the Thompsons' contribution to our community is long, but they have focused their generosity on education. To date, they have donated more than $15 million to the University of the Sunshine Coast alone. Their first donations created 150 bursaries, providing regular financial support for students who otherwise would be unable to finish their degrees. Their donations have been as creative as they are generous. They've provided half of the money for a new multistorey car park for the USC as a means of raising further and ongoing funds for scholarships and bursaries. This car park project is predicted to provide $69 million, benefitting more than 1,000 students in the coming years. 


Most recently, their $10 million donation for the Thompson Institute, supported by a further $5 million from the federal government, has allowed this cutting-edge facility to be built and to begin treating patients. The facility is now up and running and is just about to take delivery of the next-generation MRI machine which the Thompsons have paid for. This year, the facility is expected to treat 6,000 patients suffering from mental illness as well as making breakthroughs in mental health research. Away from the USC, I can tell the chamber that Roy also provided the land back in the 1980s which allowed the Stella Maris school on the coast to go ahead, and he continues to support Stella Maris's work to this day. I'm delighted to say that, in this year's Australia Day honours Roy was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. On behalf of the people of the Sunshine Coast, I want to congratulate Roy on his well-deserved honour and to thank him again for everything he has done for our community. 


For each person who's awarded an honour, there are a great many dedicated volunteers, friends, colleagues and family members who make these achievements possible. I also want to do my bit to recognise those unsung heroes. That's why I've created the Fisher Community Awards. I want to help make the southern and central part of the Sunshine Coast the place to be for education, employment and retirement. My community awards recognise individuals and organisations who are leading the way in making that a reality with their contributions. I'm calling for public nominations for each of my nine categories covering students, teachers, education providers, businesses, employees and innovators, senior community groups and senior service providers. I strongly encourage residents of Fisher to get involved by going to my 'Get Involved' page and nominating someone today.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (17:02):  I thank the member for Berowra for bringing this motion forward for debate. It provides an opportunity for members to further acknowledge people in our communities who have made a contribution to the greater good. This year's Order of Australia awards have recognised three very worthy recipients in my electorate of Fremantle. Dr Philip House from North Fremantle has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his service to medicine as an ophthalmologist, for his contribution to the work of eye surgery foundations and for his personal efforts in supporting eye health in Timor-Leste. Dr House's research at the University of Western Australia has helped to deliver a better understanding of glaucoma and of the factors that underlie poor eye health in Indigenous communities. Indeed, Dr House is rightly commended for providing eye health services to communities in the Pilbara over more than 25 years. In addition to his academic and clinical work in Australia, he has been a regular visitor to Timor-Leste, where he lends his passion, humanity and expertise in training young local doctors to provide basic eye care. It's almost impossible, I'm sure, to overstate the positive impact of that kind of work. 


I also take this opportunity to congratulate Victor Paino, the owner of the iconic Fremantle business Sealanes, who has received a Medal of the Order of Australia for his significant and extensive service to the seafood-retailing industry and to the broader community's welfare through his support of charitable organisations. Mr Paino is a third-generation Fremantle fisherman in a city with a proud ongoing tradition of successful and sustainable fishing. He began working in his family's shop as a 15-year-old and soon graduated to driving the truck that transported freshly caught produce from Esperance to Perth. I can tell you that is some kind of drive to do on a regular basis. Victor and his brother, working together, have taken Sealanes from a small business to a veritable seafood empire, but his success has always been premised on giving back to the community, as evidenced, for example, by his work as the founding director of the Fremantle Hospital Medical Research Foundation. 


Finally, I'm very pleased to acknowledge and celebrate the achievement of Roger Underwood, who has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in relation to the extensive and leading work in the areas of forestry and bushfire management. As an historian and writer, Roger Underwood has brought to his work an understanding that our relationship with the land is deeply cultural as well as scientific. Of course, Indigenous Australians have known for thousands of years that fire is a potent tool for land management and regeneration, as well as being a sometimes catastrophic hazard. Mr Underwood's work has drawn upon and illuminated the history of bushfire. He's been an expert on and an influential advocate for sustainable land management for 59 years, following his distinguished career as a forester and then general manager of the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management, as it was then. Mr Underwood founded the volunteer Bushfire Front group in 2003. In a state like ours, in Western Australia, his work has undoubtedly helped to save lives and conserve our natural environment.


Today's motion gives me the opportunity to mention the achievement of the 2018 Young Australian of the Year, Samantha Kerr, who is also a Fremantle electorate constituent. She was born in East Freo and was a sporting phenomenon from a young age. She's gone on to become an national and international superstar. When she was 15, Sam was told that despite her skills she couldn't hope to play AFL professionally, because those opportunities simply didn't exist for women. They do now, but didn't then. So she turned her attention to round-ball football and began a journey that has included playing for Perth Glory, Sydney FC and the Chicago Red Stars, becoming, along the way, the all-time leading goal scorer in America's National Women's Soccer League. She is, arguably, the best player in the world, and I would happily make that argument. There's no doubt that Samantha Kerr is a leader within the Matildas and she's a leader and role model within the community. Her skill, athleticism, energy and dedication to the sport are an inspiration, but her character and determination are more impressive still.


I'll finish by making the point that the Order of Australia's honours program, like many aspects of Australian life, does need some rebalancing if it's to properly reflect the diverse make-up of our society. Western Australians are consistently under-represented, but that's largely the result, or it appears to be largely the result, of the fact there are just not enough nominees from WA. I also note that across the program only one in three award recipients are women, and that ratio is even worse in relation to nominees. I encourage people in my home state and across Australia to consider the full range of potential award recipients, because I know there are lots of women, and men, who deserve to be recognised for their contributions to the greater good in many areas of our national life.

Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (17:07):  I'm pleased to inform the House there were a number of Tangney residents and community leaders who were recognised as part of this year's Australia Day honours list within the general division of the Order of Australia.


Ardross resident, Commander Philip Leslie Orchard, a retired member of the Royal Australian Navy, was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to veterans and their families in Western Australia through his administrative roles. Commander Orchard was the chief executive officer of the Western Australian state branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia from 2011 to 2016. He's also been a board member and state secretary of the Western Australia state branch. I thank him for his services and contribution to our veterans and their families and congratulate him on this prestigious honour.


I'd also like to congratulate Wenda Packard who was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Also an Ardross resident, Wenda has been recognised for his service to aged welfare. She's well known in the community as the founding vice president and chief instructor of Prime Movers, which she has run since 1986. Prime Movers is a not-for-profit organisation which provides physical and cognitive exercises as well as social interaction for seniors. Wenda was previously recognised as the WA Senior of the Year for Sport and Recreation in 2004.


I would also like to recognise some of Tangney's business and education leaders. David Flanagan, the chair and chancellor of Murdoch University, which is located in my electorate, was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to the mining sector for a range of roles in higher education and the community. David is known for his work as a geologist and mining and mineral exploration pioneer in Western Australia. In 2014, David was named the Western Australian of the Year and Western Australian Business Leader of the Year. 


I join the member for Fremantle in congratulating Philip House who was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to medicine as an ophthalmologist, and his service to eye surgery foundations and the international community of Timor-Leste. Philip, who is an outstanding ophthalmologist, had the Applecross Eye Clinic in my electorate. He's also known for his extraordinary contribution to outreach services, including 25 years of services to the Pilbara in Western Australia.


Finally, I'd like to congratulate someone who was a great mentor to me and who remains a mentor to me today, Brian Loughnane. Brian was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his distinguished service to parliament and politics through contributions to public policy and as Federal Director of the Liberal Party of Australia. Brian was born on 11 November 1957 in Geelong, Victoria. After completing his studies at La Trobe University in 1981, the year I was born, Brian worked for Shell Australia. But politics was his true calling and, after being appointed as senior adviser to the Minister for Small Business in the Kennett government, Vin Heffernan, in 1992, Brian held a succession of positions, including as chief of staff to Alexander Downer and later to John Howard in opposition. Following a stint as chief of staff to Howard minister John Moore, Loughnane was state director of the Victorian—

Mr MORTON:
  As I was saying before the division, following a stint as chief of staff to Howard government minister John Moore, Loughnane was state director of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party from 2000 to 2003. Brian Loughnane was then appointed Federal Director of the Liberal Party and served as campaign director for the coalition parties at the federal election held in 2004, when the coalition returned with an increased majority. Brian was also at the helm for the 2013 coalition win. He retired as Federal Director of the Liberal Party in February 2016. 


Brian Loughnane and I have worked together, Brian in the role of federal director and me in the role of state director of the WA Liberal Party. As you can imagine, despite our close friendship and mentorship, sometimes those two positions did come with particular points of difference—I would stand up for the best interests of Western Australia and Brian would, quite professionally, run a national campaign. But, through all of that, Brian has been a great mentor to me. He has also been a great mentor to my wife, Asta, who was working at the Liberal Party here in Canberra when I met her. I call Brian, as does Asta, a friend of ours. I'm so pleased that Brian has been honoured in this way. When I spoke to him, he said this honour is recognition of the hard work of many campaigners from the Liberal Party who helped contribute to the success of our party around the nation.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (17:27):  I'm delighted to have the opportunity to speak today on the Australian honours system. Although I can think of a few improvements to the system, I am a great supporter of the Australian honours system. I'd like to congratulate all the recipients of this year's Australia Day honours. For any Australian, receiving an award of this magnitude will undoubtedly be one of the proudest moments of their lives, and rightly so. I'm pleased so many have been recognised for their dedication, commitment and achievement in the fields of education, the arts, sport, science and social work. 


In my own electorate of Brand, I would like to make special mention of Mr Gordon Hall of Secret Harbour, who was awarded the Emergency Services Medal for services to the community dating back to 1993, having served with the WA State Emergency Service, WA volunteer emergency services, the fire and emergency services authority, and the SES Volunteers Association of Western Australia. While this award may have come to him as a surprise, I am sure it is no surprise to the community that Gordon has served with distinction for 25 years. Congratulations, Gordon. I join with the rest of my electorate, the community and the rest of Western Australia in applauding your well-deserved recognition. 


Gordon was the only person from Brand to be recognised in the 2018 Australia Day Honours, so I will take the opportunity to reflect on the awards system more generally. Of the more than 900 people awarded honours on Australia Day, only a handful of West Australians were recognised—68 out of over 900 recipients. It is disappointing to see WA so unrepresented on the national stage, when I know that there are so many sandgropers who deserve such recognition and who offer services and knowledge that benefit not just their own communities but the rest of Australia. 


Also disconcerting is a lack of women recognised by the Australian honours system. Just 18 out of the 68 Western Australian awardees were women. Of all the recipients of Australian honours, less than a third are women, and this rate has remained stubbornly in place for some years. There have been efforts made to increase nominations and awards. There have been slight improvements. Progress is glacial. It is incumbent on everyone to nominate those among us who have achieved in their fields, served in the community and made a real difference to the lives of others. I urge Western Australians to become more proactive in nominating people for recognition and to nominate more women; although nominations alone will not necessarily see more women recognised. The Council of the Order of Australia fails to meet the government's aim of 50 per cent of women on boards and perhaps an effort to redress this imbalance might assist.


The motion presented by the member for Berowra loyally repeats accurately the words on the website of the Governor-General that the monarch instituted the Australian honours system but, of course, in the Australian constitutional monarchy, as it is in Britain, the Queen acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister who leads the elected government of the day, except for that one time also in 1975.


Prior to the Australian honours system, the states and Commonwealth made use of the imperial honours system. Labor governments stopped making nominations to this foreign system in around 1972. The federal Labor government under Prime Minister Gough Whitlam created the Australian honours system, and the Queen in her ceremonial role approved it in the anachronistic way that Her Majesty, her predecessors and successors, by the luck of their birth, are obliged to. The elected Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser retained Whitlam's honours system but in 1976, on the advice of the Fraser Liberal National government—because I bet it wasn't her idea—the Queen created the categories of knights and dames in the Order of Australia.


Thankfully, under the elected Labor government of Bob Hawke, the use of imperial awards to recognise Australians ceased, as did the absurd category of knights and dames. Ultimately, conservative governments made way for Labor governments that recognised an Australian honours system awarded to Australians by Australians and which conferred great prestige and honour upon Australian citizens deserving recognition. With our belief in Australians, Labor knew this could be done without the need to turn to Britain. In fact, it took the Queen herself in 1990 via a private secretary Sir William Heseltine to remind Australian governments that perhaps the time had come for Australia to honour its system exclusively with its own honour system. Sir William, I might add, is from Western Australia, born in Wyalkatchem, now retired in York, and was the only private secretary to the Queen who was an Australian. Perhaps if more Australians had had this role, the Queen might have let us know that, as a mature independent country, we could allow ourselves to appoint an Australian as our head of state.


And let us not forget who sought to diminish the Australian honours system as recently as 2014 with the reintroduction of Australian knights and dames. Yes, Prime Minister Abbott embarrassed the nation by reintroducing the anachronistic honour of knights and dames and awarded Prince Philip, the Queen's husband and consort, a knighthood. Yes, that actually happened. In his tone-deaf approach, Prime Minister Abbott presented the nation and four great Australians with a very awkward situation that never should have occurred.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (17:32):  Today I would like to congratulate the recipients of the Order of Australia awards in the 2018 Australia Day honours within my electorate of Boothby. I thank my colleague for moving this motion so we may do so. In the Australian honours system, appointments to the Order of Australia confer the highest recognition for outstanding achievement and service. This award is the pre-eminent way Australians recognise the achievements and service of their fellow citizens, and each of these recipients was nominated directly by people within our community. This is testament to the impact the award winners and their services had on our community and the appreciation felt by their peers. This year a number of the South Australian recipients are residents of my electorate of Boothby. I am honoured to be able to congratulate them today and to highlight their contributions to the community, not just in Boothby and South Australia but, indeed, for the nation.


I acknowledge the following residents of my community for their outstanding service. Professor John Turnidge was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his distinguished service to medicine as an infectious disease physician and microbiologist. The professor is particularly recognised for his contribution to the advancement of health policy in the area of antimicrobial resistance and professional medical organisations. Adjunct Professor Charlotte Champion de Crespigny was made a Member of the Order of the Australia for her significant service to nursing and to nurse education, particularly in the field of drug and alcohol care and to Indigenous health projects. Dr Mary Harris was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her significant service to community health, specifically to workforce management, administration, policy reform and to medical education. Mrs Anant Kaur Sandhu was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her significant service to the restaurant and catering industry in South Australia and to the community through her support for charitable organisations.


Emeritus Professor Grant Townsend was made a Member of the Order of Australia:


For significant service to dentistry in the field of craniofacial biology, and to dental education through research, teaching and mentoring roles.


Mr Roy Arnold was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to people with a disability. Dr Richard Cockington was awarded a medal in the general division for his distinguished service to medicine as a paediatrician. Mr Stephen Tasker, was awarded an Ambulance Service Medal for distinguished service to his duties and career in the South Australian Ambulance Service. Mr Rhys Roberts was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the community in a range of roles. I know Mr Roberts and his family well, particularly his wonderful wife, Helen, and I was delighted to see Mr Roberts recognised for his tireless service to our community. He is known to so many people in our area through a variety of roles, whether through Lions or the Blackwood Memorial Hall to name just two.


Mr Trevor Whitelaw was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia:


For service to veterans and their families, to lawn bowls, and to the environment.


I also know Mr Whitelaw, his wife, Jo, and daughter, Stacey, well. Several events that have been particularly special and memorable to me as the member for Boothby have involved Mr Whitelaw. These include the Anzac Day service at Brighton, at which I was privileged to speak last year, and the 50th National RSL Lawn Bowls Carnival, which was held at the Marion Bowling Club in my electorate, and which I was honoured to open and speak at on behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 29 December 2016. It was also where I famously said, 'I don't mind who wins as long as it's not the Victorians and the Victorians won!




Mr Tim Wilson:
  Shame!




Ms FLINT:
  Victoria won, my colleague will be happy to know!


I again recognise the contribution of the award recipients from Boothby for their tireless work, unrivalled commitment and personal dedication over many years. Perhaps the Prime Minister summarised their efforts best in his address to the 2018 Australian of the Year Award ceremony when he said:


Our Australian of the Year State and Territory recipients are shining examples of our best selves. All of them are outstanding and brilliant achievers and driven to succeed by a determination to help their fellow Australians and make Australia an even, better, brighter place to realise your dreams.


Whether through science or philanthropy, medicine or mentoring, their lives have made our lives better. And they are as diverse as the nation they represent.


Congratulations again to the newest members of the Order of Australia from my electorate of Boothby. I thank them on behalf of my community for the incredible, tireless service that they have provided to us in my electorate, to South Australia and also to the nation.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (17:37):  My electorate covers more than 30,000 square kilometres, nearly half the landmass of Tasmania. And it encompasses 12 councils. I had 13, but lost two of them in the recent boundary redistribution and gained another one. So Australia Day and its awards have a special significance for me, with plenty of events and ceremonies to attend.


This year, I had the pleasure, amongst others, of attending Australia Day breakfasts at Westbury and Chudleigh, both of them in the Meander Valley Council area. I can report faithfully to the House that I attended both breakfasts but only ate at one. I am already losing the battle of the waistline in my electorate, home to so much fruit, dairy, meat, cheese, beer and spirits, without running up the white flag by scoffing two breakfasts! My congratulations to the Deloraine Rotary and the Chudleigh residents' association for these wonderful annual events, which attract hundreds of people each year.


On Australia Day we honour people with memberships of the Order of Australia and with various medals. I was delighted to see Shane Gould, who lives in the north-east coastal town of Bicheno, made a Member of the General Division. Shane's swimming achievements are legendary. As a teenager she won gold in Munich in 1972 and she has kept up her competitive swimming throughout her life. In 2003 she broke the world record for the 200-metre individual medley for 45- to 49-year-olds. Shane has been made an AM for her significant service to elite swimming and for her role in developing water safety programs in developing countries. Since moving to Tasmania, Shane has been an active community member as patron of the Devil Island Project since 2007, and founding the Devil of a Swim ocean swimming event in Bicheno in 2010.


Sandra Atkins, of Osmaston in the Meander Valley, was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to equestrian sports. The list of Sandra's roles over the years is far too long to list, but what stood out for me was that she and her husband, Owen, bred The Cleaner, which was purchased by trainer Mick Burles for $10,000 and went on to earn more than $1 million in race money. The Cleaner was a great Tasmanian horse bred by two great Tasmanians.


Dr Ralph Peters, of New Norfolk, in the south of my electorate, was awarded an OAM for his services to medicine and the community of New Norfolk. He has been a practising GP since 1972 and knows and has treated just about everyone in the Derwent Valley district for 46 years. A life member and fellow of the Australian College of General Practitioners, he has a long association with the local St Matthew's church, including as an organist. That tickles my funny bone—perhaps no-one else's here. A GP who plays organs strikes me as funny and perhaps entirely appropriate.


Richard Chugg, of Relbia, in the north of my electorate, just before the Bass wall, was awarded an OAM for service to the community. His community life has included senior roles with Rotary in Evandale and Woolmers Estate in Longford. A justice of the peace since 1986, he was also president of the Liberal Party in Tasmania from 2010 to 2012. We may be on different sides of the political fence, but I do value his service to the democratic process and thank him for his community service.


Chris Draffin, of St Helens, on the north-east coast of my electorate, was awarded an Emergency Services Medal. Before moving to Tasmania in 2008, Chris played significant volunteer roles in the Northern Territory Emergency Service. He has kept up his great service as an active member of the Break O'Day SES unit and works tirelessly to improve volunteer recruitment.


Australia Day in my electorate is also a day to recognise the invaluable service of so many residents and volunteers. Being a regional electorate, we have volunteers across a vast array of organisations, from ambos, to firies, SES, Lions, Rotary, Country Women's Association and so many in between. Time prevents me naming the winners of the municipal citizens of the year, young citizens of the year and volunteers of the year across my 12 councils, but each and every one of these people deserves our thanks for the incredible work they do in our communities, across Tasmania and, indeed, across Australia.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:42):  It brings me great pride to celebrate the incredible achievements of many Goldstein residents who have been acknowledged in the Australia Day honours this year. The Australia Day honours of course are one of the pinnacles of Australian society and recognise people who have sacrificed and exercised charity and community support as well as success. We celebrate all of those things when we give out Australia Day honours and provide awards.


There are many in Goldstein who have been acknowledged this year in the awards: Associate Professor Peter Laurence McNicol AM, from Brighton, for his significant service to medicine, particularly in the fields of anaesthesiology, liver transplantation and transfusion medicine; Andrew John Plympton AM, from Brighton as well, for significant service to sports administration through governance roles, particularly to sailing and Australian Rules Football, the greatest code in the nation and the world, including as a board member for the Australian Sports Commission and executive board member for the Australian Olympic Committee; Ms Beryl Francis Campbell Foster OAM, from Brighton East, for her service to women in Victoria, including service to the National Council of Women Victoria, the League of Women's Voters Victoria, the Penguin Club Australia, and as a councillor on the Swan Hill City Council from 1969 to 1972; and Mrs Hatice Basarin OAM, from Hampton, who I know very well, for her long service to the preservation of Australian and Turkish military history, having co-authored a range of publications detailing the history of Australian and Turkish service in World War I. Congratulations, Hatice!


Mr Terence Black, from Black Rock, received an OAM for his service to veterans and families, having been secretary of the Beaumaris subbranch of the Returned and Services League of Australia Victorian branch from 2005 to 2015 and a member of the finance aid and audit committee of RSL Victoria from 2010 to 2016; Mr Don Joseph Cullen, from Black Rock, received an OAM for his service to the community through a range of roles, including chairman and founder of the Tibetan Village Project Australia since 2005.


Congratulations to Mr Michael Mace OAM from Ormond, for service to community theatre, including in roles with the Victorian Drama League; Mr Mark O'Leary OAM from Ormond, for service to choral music and education, including as founder, director and conductor of Young Voices of Melbourne since 1990; Mr Bruce Langford-Jones OAM from Beaumaris, for service to the building and construction industry and to golf, having served on the Housing Industry Association as a former president, vice-president and board member and as deputy chair of Golf Australia; Professor George Braitberg AM from Caulfield South, for significant service to medical administration and emergency medicine, education, health system design and to the community; Mrs Faye Haskin-Dubrowin OAM from Caulfield South, for service to interfaith relations and the community as the first female president and a member for 20 years of B'nai B'rith Victoria.


Congratulations to Mr Vincenzo Princi OAM from Brighton East, for service to football and to the community, including as president of the Hampton Dolphins Football Club since its formation in 2001; Mr David Thomson OAM from Brighton East, for service to education in the great state of Victoria and the community, having been a teacher at Caulfield Grammar School for some 36 years—and being 37 years old I can say that's almost a life sentence!—and a teacher in residence at Victoria University since 2005; and the late Mr John Siddons AO, for distinguished service to manufacturing, particularly to the mechanical and engineering sectors. I met his son Tony only a few days ago.


I also want to congratulate the other incredible citizens of Goldstein for their service and I give further congratulations particularly to Sergeant Arran Ferguson, who was announced Bayside Citizen of the Year in recognition of his outstanding commitment to law enforcement. The Glen Eira Citizen of the Year was awarded to Ian Butcher, acknowledging his 35 years of community service, particularly to the Bentleigh RSL where I got to know him. Finally, congratulations to the Glen Eira and Bayside councils' Young Citizens of the Year, Cara Morgan, who is a keen Scouts venturer; and Lital Weizman, an enthusiastic volunteer, particularly in the Sudanese community. Finally, congratulations to Millicent Roper and Stevie-Lou Answerth for their work in developing an inclusive culture at local Bayside schools, particularly focusing on LGBTI issues. To everybody who has been mentioned, congratulations on your wonderful work for our community.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-02-12,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:47):  It's with pleasure that I rise to speak on the motion brought before us tonight by the member for Berowra. On 26 January this year, some 900 people from across Australia were honoured with the Order of Australia. They come from all walks of life and have undertaken all sorts of endeavours, but they all share one thing in common, and that is their exceptional contributions to their respective communities or fields of endeavour.


In this year's Order of Australia awards, a number of people from my home city of Newcastle were awarded honours, and I'd like to take this opportunity to recognise them here this evening. I will start with Mr Warren Atkins from Merewether, who was granted the Medal of the Order of Australia in the General Division for his service to mathematics education. Mr Atkins has been helping to spark a love of maths in young Australians for decades both as a member of the Faculty of Education at the University of Canberra and as chairman and founding member of the Australian Mathematics Foundation, which he's involved with to this day. One of Mr Atkins' greatest legacies is helping to set up one of the world's largest mathematics competitions, the Australian Mathematics Competition. I know many, many students from Newcastle and across the country who compete in that each and every year.


The next recipient is Kay Fordham, who was given the title of Member of the Order of Australia for her longstanding contribution to community health. Ms Fordham is a regular face at the Calvary Mater hospital in Newcastle, where she has built a reputation for kindness, compassion and commitment over her two decades plus of service. She has been a member of the Calvary Mater Newcastle auxiliary for over 21 years and the auxiliary's treasurer since 1999. She has also been a member of the hospital's Community Advisory Council, assisting with community and stakeholder engagement, as well as being a member of the hospital's Heritage Committee. 


Also on the honours list from the medical field is Sandra Berenger, who recently retired from the John Hunter Hospital and was recognised for her groundbreaking achievements in the field of infectious disease control. Ms Berenger, who is now a Member of the Order of Australia, joined the Royal Newcastle Hospital in 1971. In the 25 years she was there, she pioneered infection control strategies, most notably working on the strategies to respond to and treat AIDS in the 1980s. As a result, she was recruited by the state government to help develop statewide strategies for responding to HIV. 


Another Novocastrian who received a Member of the Order of Australia award is prominent lawyer Mr Richard Anicich, who was recognised for his service to community, business development, and research and law. As well as being a conjoint professor at the University of Newcastle's law faculty, Mr Anicich has contributed to a number of very important institutions in our region, from the Hunter Business Chamber to the Port of Newcastle, Newcastle Grammar School, Hunter Primary Care and the Hunter Medical Research Institute—institutions that have really helped shape much of both the current and the future fabric of the Newcastle community. 


Another leading light at the University of Newcastle is Laureate Professor Scott Sloan, who is now an Officer of the Order in the General Division of the Order of Australia. This is the second highest recognition available. Professor Sloan is the director of the university's centre of geotechnical and materials modelling and also leads the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Geotechnical Science and Engineering. Most recently Professor Sloan has been working with his colleague Dr Brett Turner on a patented means of using hemp seeds to treat water contaminated by firefighting foam. This could literally change the lives of people living in Williamtown and surrounding areas, who have of course been living with the severe impacts of ongoing contamination, with no specific end in sight. 


I'd also like to take this opportunity to recognise Laureate Professor Nicholas Talley, who has been bestowed with the highest honour available, a Companion of the Order in the General Division of the Order of Australia. Professor Talley has had a long and distinguished career at the University of Newcastle and is a global authority on functional gut disorders. With only 35 Companion of the Order of Australia honours being granted, this is testament to Professor Talley's international standing and his incredible achievements in gastroenterological research in particular.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (17:52):  Thank you to my colleague the member for Berowra for raising this important topic. One of the greatest parts of Australia Day is the opportunity it gives us to recognise those in our community who often go unnoticed. There are thousands of such heroes across our country and dozens in Bennelong. Many remain without the appreciation they deserve. But this year we were able to identify a few more of our most worthy locals. I would like to talk about some of them today. 


Marilyn Singer of Epping is a constituent of Bennelong who received the Order of Australia Medal as part of the 2018 Australia Day honours for her service to people with scleroderma. Scleroderma is an uncommon autoimmune connective tissue disease which is both hard to diagnose and devastating in its effects. Ms Singer has served as the president and secretary of the Scleroderma Association of New South Wales and has over the years devoted herself to the very noble cause of improving the lives of Australians through a commitment to science and health. 


Dr Friedbert Kohler of Carlingford was another recipient of the Order of Australia Medal, for his service to rehabilitation medicine. Dr Kohler has served, among numerous other roles, as the director of the South Western Sydney Local Health District and has, since 2011, served as the clinical stream director of aged care and rehabilitation services. He has also been a conjoint associate professor at the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of New South Wales since 2009. 


I am proud to bring attention to the work undertaken by Mrs Singer and Dr Kohler, who have both worked towards making Australia a healthier and happier place. The wellbeing of a nation begins at the individual level, and working to ensure that we learn more about those less common conditions and diseases will guarantee that every Australian can achieve their highest possible quality of life. I'm proud to have these two champions, and those who share their devotion to such noble causes, in the Bennelong community.


I would also like to mention Mark Anderson, a constituent of mine from Epping. Mark was awarded the title of Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to secondary education in New South Wales through administrative and executive roles, and his service to educational standards. His services include his work at the Department of Education as the Director of Public Schools New South Wales, at the Hills School between 2016 and 2017 and also at the New South Wales Board of Studies, where he was a member of the teacher education policy advisory committee. Among numerous other roles, he was the founding college principal of the Sydney Secondary College from 2002 to 2004 and he served as the Principal of Davidson High School for four years between 1997 and 2001. We all understand the importance of education, which is well and truly the life blood of any nation. It is people like Mark who ensure that the education system in our country continues to provide Australian children and adolescents with a rigorous and rounded education. This ensures that they go on to be engaged members of our society with the knowledge and skills to maintain Australia's position. I'm proud to say that, as a member of the Bennelong community, he has received serious recognition for his lifelong commitment to perhaps the most important area, education. Our community is strengthened by the efforts of those like Mark, who display a commitment to ensuring that young Australians receive an education of the highest standard.


Finally, I'd like to recognise a posthumous award for a good friend of mine, a famous local and true national hero. Betty Cuthbert has been posthumously awarded the nation's highest honour, a Companion of the Order of Australia for eminent service to the sport of athletics as a fourfold Olympic champion, role model, fundraiser and advocate for research into a cure for multiple sclerosis. The Ermington Flash, as she was known in her youth, sadly, passed away last year, yet she remains Australia's second highest medal winner, after only Ian Thorpe, and is today the only person in history to win Olympic gold in 100-, 200- and 400-metre sprints. These are incredible achievements.


It is the selfless devotion to something larger than oneself that greatly enriches our communities but also our nation more broadly. All recipients of these awards deserve recognition and praise for the work they've undertaken. I'm pleased to see these four members of the Bennelong community receive the Order of Australia medal. Congratulations to you all and may your example encourage others in our society to give more to their fellow Australians.

Mr Dutton:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is:


For operational reasons, the specific information requested is not able to be provided. 


However, since 2 March 2015 Counter Terrorism Units (CTU) have conducted 596,777 real time assessments, and assisted with 680 passenger offloads – for a range of reasons, that includes suspected travel to conflict zones.


Since 2012, around 220 Australians have travelled to Syria and/or Iraq to fight with, or support groups involved in the conflict. Around 110 Australians are currently fighting or engaged with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. Around 40 people have returned to Australia after traveling to Syria/Iraq and joining groups involved in the conflict, many of whom did so prior to the declared 'caliphate'. 


Passport cancellations are the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
