"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-07,"—I was saying before the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 was adjourned yesterday that there is more to this legislation than meets the eye, or at least there is more to the change to modern communications than this legislation can deal with. At the outset I might just say that if there are some senators missing from the chamber this morning it may well be due to the traffic jams which have been casued by the V8 car racing being imposed on Canberra at the moment. I believe the delay is up to 40 minutes for some people making the approach outside Parliament House at the moment. That aside, I refer to Channel 9's Sunday program in May last year when reporter Ross Coulthart interviewed New Zealand author and researcher Nicky Hager. Mr Hager talked about the giant computer systems which use dictionary systems to track down selected phone calls, faxes and Internet communications coming in and out of Australia and indeed going between other countries. One of these facilities is at Geraldton in Western Australia, and most Australians know very little about it. Mr Hager said:
One of the defining features of the Echelon system—
that is, this giant computer tracking system on everybody's phone calls—
is that it is a move away from what is the most effective way to spy on our enemies to a system which is the most effective way of spying on everyone.
That is the reality of the modern world. While this bill points us towards intervention in phone calls for criminals, drug handlers and spies, in effect what it is not doing is saying that our whole spying system is being moved to an international system which spies on everybody's phone calls. Most Australians are not aware of that. 
The bill does refer to intervention in foreign phone calls—phone calls going out of this country—but what it does not say is that everybody's phone calls are being listened to, that everybody's phone calls are being scanned and, moreover, that the check on this system is not within our national boundaries. Australia has an arrangement with the UK, the United States, Canada and New Zealand whereby the downloading of selected phone calls—the intercepted calls which the Americans, in particular, want to listen to—goes straight to Washington. I will be asking the government during the committee stages of this debate what control Australia has over this spy system based here in Australia. I think we will find that it is close to zero; that in fact this information is being relayed straight to Washington and to other countries without proper intervention by the Australian authorities. When this bill says, `Let's intervene in certain phone calls made by criminals and people with an intent that is not in Australia's interests,' it is really missing the point—that is, that everybody's phone calls are being listened in to and, as far as I know, this parliament has no control over that. This parliament is not informed about it. This parliament is not a watchdog on behalf of citizens. This parliament does not know what our spy systems are doing and, more particularly, it does not know what the foreign spy systems are doing which are getting the information out of the Australian infrastructure.
We are not in an age where this is simply spying—or even primarily spying—in the defence interests of this country; we are in an age where commercial interests are at the forefront in spying. Indeed, President Clinton has made it very clear that, as far as the United States is concerned, the intelligence agencies are there in the interests of America's economic supremacy, its corporate interests. Information being taken from these spy facilities, including here in Australia, is passed on to the corporate system—the Forbes 500 and the big multinational corporations—because it is in the interests of those big systems to get the drop on their competitors around the world. The Sunday program pointed to a number of cases where an advantage had been given to either US or Canadian countries—in one case, a wheat deal in favour of Canada, because the Canadians had picked up a phone call coming out of a car in the United States—a call to do with a United States bid for a world market. There was another extraordinary case cited in the Channel 9 Sunday program of 23 May last year. Prime Minister Thatcher of the United Kingdom was presumably able to get information on two of her ministers through the Canadian connection of this spying system—that is, the UK arm of it was kept clean while the Canadians picked up information on two UK ministers about whom the Prime Minister of the UK of the day was not sure. Is that the intent of a spy system in which Australia is involved? What halt does this legislation put on that sort of activity occurring in the international arena against the interests of Australian people in general, let alone elected Australians? Maybe the government will be able to disclaim that extraordinary situation, as highlighted on the Sunday program. If so, I would like to hear how. 
This legislation does not allow overseas phone calls to be intercepted where an Australian citizen is involved at the other end. Tell me about it! I believe that that is already occurring all over the world through this massive intercept system of telecommunications. I believe that this piece of legislation is nothing more than a diversionary titbit. It does nothing to reassure me—and will do nothing to reassure those few Australians who know about this spying system—that there are very clear guidelines, controlled by the elected members of this nation, on this massive international spy system. I reiterate: it is no longer in the nation's interest that this spy system be contained. There are no guidelines —or, if there are, let them be brought before this Senate—to say that this spy system is confined to working in Australia's national interests and against the interests of those who might engage in criminal or political activities that are inimical to Australia's interests. Where are those guidelines? Let the government produce them—certainly before I will give assent to this legislation. As far as the international spying component of it is concerned, the legislation is loosely worded, ill-considered and certainly not transparent in the parliament laying down regulations—laws—which confine the activity of not just the Australian Security Intelligence Organi-sation but of the international operators like the American spy facilities which are using our facilities, as far as I know, and I will guarantee as far as any government representative here knows, against Australia's interests, for goodness sake.
Is the Channel 9 program wrong? Was it factually flawed? Is its information able to be countermanded by the government? If not, I say to the Senate: the facility at Geraldton and the similar facility in New Zealand—which Nicky Hagar broke into and got lists of citizens names out of because it was unattended at night—are set up in a manner which can have US, Canadian and UK interests working against Australia's economic wellbeing. For example, it can give multinational corporations the opportunity, through the interception of telecommunications, to get the drop on their Australian competitors—to give international markets the opportunity to beat Australia when it comes to international sales of commodities out of this country. This is laid down quite clearly on the public record.
I was amazed that that program, which went to air on 23 May last year, drew such little comment from the Australian political and business community. I am concerned as a democrat that this parliament is not in control; is not laying down guidelines as to what our intelligence operatives are allowed and not allowed to do. You look superficially at this piece of legislation and there is one sentence that says, `You can't spy on Australian citizens overseas,' but the evidence on the face of it is that every Australian citizen's phone calls are being spied upon. Moreover, Australia is allowing its facilities to be used so that foreign countries can download from this massive computerised selection of phone calls, can take that information for their own use and can pass it on to their own corporate sectors without Australians knowing about it, without the Australian security intelligence network intervening and without Australia's government or elected politicians knowing what is going on. This demands an explanation. 
The government has only one representative in this chamber at the moment. It is time for them to get up and explain what is happening at Geraldton, Pine Gap and the facility in Darwin with respect to the downloading of information out of the satellite systems and the conveying of Australians' phone calls, Internet communications and faxes—everything as far as international communications are concerned—all of which are being spied upon. One of the answers will be that in reaction to what is called the Anglo system—this massive Echelon computerised spying system—the French have responded with the same, and you could not blame the Chinese and the Indonesians for responding likewise. Everybody is into it, one presumes.
Let us have some light thrown on this system. In this democratically elected chamber, let us have an account of where we stand in the modern world of spying. Let us be clear about the fact that, post Cold War, the focus of spying has become commercial and that there is great opportunity—in fact, I think it is going on worldwide—for commercial interests to gain or to lose by what that spy system is doing. In fact, on the Sunday program there was an inherent complaint that the information going out of the Australian and New Zealand facilities to corporations overseas gives them the drop on their Australian counterparts and there was an inherent request that, if this is going to continue, ASIO should be put at the service of the Australian corporate sector. I am not calling for that; I am calling for an explanation from the government as to what is the state of play in this system. What are the safeguards at Geraldton, Pine Gap, Darwin and the New Zealand facility? What communications are occurring between Australia and New Zealand to safeguard our national interests against the much bigger players in this field who are using our facilities? I cannot give assent to this legislation, even though all other parties in the Senate have done so, because I am very concerned that we as parliamentarians are not up to speed on this issue that affects every Australian citizen.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-06-07,"—I share some of the concerns that Senator Brown has mentioned this morning. However, I remain unconvinced on certain aspects of his contribution, particularly those in terms of construing more in the bill than is being proposed in its written word. In truth, I feel that I am constrained to read the bill plainly and not read between the lines too heavily. In terms of being an authority on the Channel 9 program, Pine Gap and Geraldton, I would defer to Senator Brown in that regard. Pine Gap is a matter on which I do share some of his concerns. It is a matter that has come before the treaties committee in which I participate and where, in toto, I think you could say that the answers we received were not satisfactory, although the treaties committee was looking at it from a different perspective. But we were assured that the secrecy surrounding that is necessary.
Turning to the process itself, rather than taking Senator Brown's stand across from it, I took the opportunity to do two things. I spent some time during the estimates process asking Mr Crompton, the Privacy Commissioner, about matters that go to privacy, and to other matters that I will no doubt follow up during the next estimates process and about which I have some concern. I also took the opportunity of looking at the recent Centrelink issue regarding privacy matters. In addition, I asked whether the Privacy Commissioner could adequately deal with the extension of those requirements into the private sector. In addition, as I will mention later, I participated in an inquiry into the consideration of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999. During that time I had the opportunity to question witnesses about certain aspects of the bill that concerned me and I received, by and large, adequate replies. Rather than take a scaremongering approach to the issue, I took the issue to the appropriate forums, asked the relevant questions and sought relevant replies.
One of the problems the committee did find was that, on balance, there was a certain amount of grey area that surrounded the debate itself about the use of intercepted material. So, rather than dismiss it out of hand, we took the opportunity during the inquiry of asking for a review within three years to have a look at whether or not they have confined themselves to the matters that the bill seeks to address. On balance, I came down on the side of facilitating justice administration and law enforcement. There was not a lot of complaint in this area from what you would normally regard as the other side of the fence, the people who may raise the issues that Senator Brown has gone to—and more, and more broadly as well—and who would then, generally, uphold some of those aspects that are of civil concern and that surround the privacy and use of that information. 
The committee found that the process, although short, was in fact bereft of some of the people who might otherwise have taken an interest. The committee could take two views about that. One view, of course, is that the process was such a short-lived one that those concerns were not addressed or could not be addressed in the time available. But I have found that, where that is the case, people will complain about that and put in a reservation. Or, the committee could take a second view that the bill itself was targeted at a very narrow field, a particularly narrow scope, that went to a number of certain issues, as the explanatory memorandum outlined. I guess that is how I came to feel satisfied about the recommendations contained in the inquiry and that the opportunity for people to make submissions was there. The opportunity to raise those concerns was there. The opportunity to provide sufficient evidence of the things that might concern civil libertarians was there, but they were not raised and, thus, were satisfied, at least in the immediate term. If there are matters that are still outstanding that people have concerns about, they can be reviewed and looked at, as the recommendations have provided for in the inquiry.
Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, in essence, will bring about a new class of interception warrants. The primary legislation, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, provides for interception warrants to be granted for the investigation of narcotic offences, under the Customs Act 1901. As you would expect, the number of agencies authorised to apply for these warrants has increased. The aim was to allow interception warrants for identified telecommunications services. In shorthand these are referred to as telecommunications service warrants. The act sets out the purpose of the warrants, the reason for which they are obtained, and who can apply for and issue such warrants. It also details the form and content of the warrant applications and the criteria that must be satisfied, and provides for stringent record keeping and the like. 
The amendment has two basic purposes, the first going to national security and the second to law enforcement. In respect of the second area, where a law enforcement agency wishes to obtain an interception warrant, an application must be made to an eligible judge. They can be issued only in relation to the investigation of class 1 offences, such as murder, or class 2 offences, such as serious personal injury, drug trafficking and offences where the penalty is life or more than seven years. Agencies which can apply and have to be approved include the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority and state and territory police. Applications are made with an accompanying affidavit attesting to the contents. 
An example would be a class 2 offence where the judge considers the gravity and how much the privacy of the person would be interfered with. On that point, during the inquiry, one of the witnesses stated that they thought they had met all the criteria quite successfully. They had provided the affidavit, they had provided the gravity, and they had provided how the privacy of the person would be interfered with, but they were unsuccessful, because the judge found that not enough concerns were met. It was not a matter of the judge providing them with a warrant as a matter of course. This was from a senior police officer, who then went about his police work, as he relayed to the committee, reinvestigating the matter to substantiate the issue more fully.
A review of this area was conducted in May 1999, providing an avenue for people to raise concerns about privacy. The minister was subsequently presented with a policy review. The bill incorporates some of the recommendations of the telecommunications interception policy review. It provides for named person warrants to be picked up and an extension of the use to which intercepted material may be put in legal proceedings. On that point, it was reinforced during the inquiry that, in order to provide the thread in the evidentiary material that was presented to court, piles of material would have to be provided and the judge tracked through it to come to the essence of the evidence. It was hoped that most people were able to follow the bouncing ball through those proceedings. 
With this bill, the evidence can be compiled in a more cogent fashion and presented in a realistic way so that the courts can at least have a fair opportunity to look at the evidence. In relation to warrants of a particular identified telecommunications service, rather than having evidentiary import, the underlying rationale—as explained to us in the inquiry—is that the technology that has been around for the last 20 years and is developing rapidly is being overtaken by digital technology. Added to that is the change from a single provider of telecommunications services to multiple service providers. Simply put, we have gone from one telecommunications carrier with one phone service to multiple carriers, digital phones, SIMM cards, pay cards, prepaid mobile phones, email and computer technology. I think it goes on to things I could not describe accurately or well.
The policy review identified that this had in fact occurred, which was not particularly profound. The new telecommunications state of play is here, and the review highlighted that criminal elements could take advantage of these wonderful innovations, using them to assist in committing crime and avoiding detection. In addition, delays in obtaining replacement warrants were hampering speedy law enforcement. As it was described to me by a witness in the inquiry, this bill picks up some of the issues that were raised in UK and US experiences but follows closely local issues in Australia. Balanced against that, people have to be mindful of privacy concerns, centring on the possibility that non-targeted individuals could also be intercepted and the material used. 
It was highlighted in the policy review that those concerns were in existence; however, they were outweighed in the end, and the policy review recommended that a warrant be issued against named individuals. The policy review also dealt with the permitted use by a court to receive into evidence intercepted information where that information has already been entered into the public domain. This gave the inquiry some trouble in terms of the admissibility of evidence and the like, but the committee felt that if it highlighted the concern in a recommendation it could at least put it aside for the moment. The bill adopts this position, and the underlying rationale of the proposed amendments is to help our law enforcement agencies to be effective in the fight against crime.
In the House of Representatives the Attorney-General added that the criteria would be more stringent for issuance and that additional reporting requirements would exist. The inquiry looked at those particular matters and, on balance, was satisfied that the spirit and intent of the legislation would be met and that, in any event, a review would highlight any deficiencies that may come about. In essence, a balance had to be struck between security and law enforcement in protection of the individual from the power of the state. The bill, as I said earlier, was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which tabled its report on 11 May 2000. The terms of reference were sufficiently wide to examine the issues. They included the need for a new warrant, the adequacy of safeguards and the adequacy of reporting mechanisms. Disappointingly, the committee did not receive many submissions from non-user organisations from, at least, a privacy perspective. That was highlighted in the report so at least the committee's concerns could be noted and if there were further concerns then they could at least be met during the following review or generally through the processes that exist in this parliament. At 1.9 the committee stated:
The Committee notes its concern at the low level of participation in the inquiry by peak legal bodies and bodies focused on the privacy of the citizen.
In the end, the committee did recommend that the bill be reviewed.  
I was pleased to be given the opportunity to participate in that committee's deliberations. I think concerns still remain about a steady creep forward in this area, over the use to which material may be put, about third party usage, about other lines of inquiry by police investigators chasing down third party information which is not relevant to the current inquiry that they are conducting, and that they may apprehend a crime or suspected crime being committed which is outside the scope of the particular investigation. But I think the important matters as to security concerns—the additional reporting requirements and the ability of a judge to be, in essence, the final arbiter of these sorts of matters—and the stringent requirements in place for material that has been intercepted, in relation to third party material, to be destroyed once the bill process has been run balance against some of those concerns. Without those concerns being highlighted by the parties, I feel constrained not to take that matter any further.
In essence—and I keep saying this about it—the legislation enhances law enforcement. But, if you go to the major underlying rationale of this or to the problems, there is always a dichotomy that gets raised between the state and its power and the right to privacy of individuals. It exists in Australia. As we are well aware, there is no bill of rights contained within the federal Constitution, unlike the one adopted and expressed as amendments to the Constitution by the United States in 1791. The then Chief Justice Barwick expressed it—certainly not in 1791 but more recently than that—in this way:
Unlike the case of the American Constitution, the Australian Constitution is built upon confidence in a system of parliamentary government with ministerial responsibility.
Clearly, a representative democracy would, can and should protect its citizens' fundamental rights, and the amount of rights that are currently being protected through the legislation that has come into this field in the last 10 years is very encouraging. The Australian Constitution itself has few guarantees of individual rights—for example, `trial by jury' at section 80 provides some rights protection, as does freedom of religion at section 116—but they are, as I think many writers would agree, rather specific and ad hoc. 
A bill of rights containing statements about human rights with emphasis on civil and political rights is one manner that can be used to protect individual freedoms from government interference. Both Canada and New Zealand have a bill of rights as an act of parliament. In Queensland, my home state, a number of committees of inquiry have also looked at this process for some years to ensure that a bill of rights contain civil and political rights to protect from arbitrary interference by the state. Recently, in November 1998, they again looked at the process. They went into some depth on this but in the final analysis, as I stated earlier, they did recommend that there be no bill of rights in Queensland. They did, however, look at proceeding with an interim position to ensure that people were at least fully informed of their particular rights and of places where they could complain about an arbitrary interference in their particular rights. They looked at a guide, called Queensland Basic Rights, to at least deal with some of those concerns. I see that my time has almost expired so in summary: after going through the process at some length and in some detail, the concerns that I had are satisfied by the written words contained within the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2000-06-07,"—I have just a few things to say in response. I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. Senator Ludwig's contribution acknowledged the work the committee did. As to Senator Brown's contribution: Senator Brown, you might be lucky, it might be a slow news day and there might be a journalist who has not read the bill, who is happy to take your remarks at face value, and you will get a bit of a run. It is the easiest and oldest trick in the book to make all sorts of allegations in relation to a country's intelligence network knowing that they cannot be responded to and therefore hoping that what you say gets a run, because it cannot be answered. Can I put it in short form for you, though: as I understand it, what you are suggesting is that all calls can be listened to all of the time. What needs to be emphasised is quite simply that calls can be intercepted only under a warrant and that warrants can only be obtained by ASIO for foreign intelligence purposes. If you do not accept that, Senator, there is nothing more I can add other than to refer you back to the provisions of the bill. 
Senators have had the benefit of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's review that Senator Ludwig referred to. That committee made a couple of recommendations, which I now want to respond to. The first was a proposition that the bill be reviewed within three years of it coming into effect and that the review have regard to the matters contained in the original reference: the need for new forms of warrant, the adequacy of safeguards and the adequacy of the reporting mechanisms. The government agrees to a review of the operation of the bill as proposed by the committee. It will take place within three years of the bill coming into effect, and it will have regard to the three matters that have just been mentioned.
The second recommendation was that a note be inserted in the bill to make it clear that proposed section 75A, to be inserted by this bill, would be subject to the general rules of admissibility. I understand from the committee's report that it was concerned that the new provisions may have unintended consequences for the rules of evidence and that the committee wished to ensure that the rights of an accused person and the proper trial process would still be observed. I want to acknowledge that I appreciate those concerns recognised by the committee. However, an existing provision of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act actually achieves the purpose of the committee's recommendation. So I would draw the attention of senators and, in particular, of the committee's members to section 78 of the act, which provides that nothing in part 7 of the act has the effect of making particular interception information admissible as evidence in proceedings to any greater extent than it otherwise would be. Part 7 of the interception act contains extensive and detailed provisions setting out precisely when and how intercepted information might be used. It is the government's view that the provision I have just referred to meets the objective of the committee's second recommendation and that therefore no further action is required.
In conclusion, I want to highlight that this bill is critically important for law enforcement. Unfortunately, law enforcement and national security agencies have fallen behind in terms of technology development. When criminals are using more sophisticated technology, we need to make sure that our law enforcement agencies and our national security agencies have the most sophisticated and effective investigative tools available. It is, as Senator Ludwig said in his remarks, something that requires a balance between the needs of the agencies and the need for privacy, and we think we have achieved that balance. The already well-established procedural and accountability provisions of the interception act will apply to these new named warrants. I thank senators for their support of the bill.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-06-07,"—This bill is essentially a creature of the government's GST package. In many ways, as far as this government is concerned, the bill marks a failure and a loss for the Howard government in relation to local government. It is a mark of failure because the original tax reform package was designed to abolish financial assistance grants to local government. The ANTS package was meant to use the GST to transfer the Commonwealth's responsibility for financial assistance grants to state governments, in the process totally removing the Commonwealth government from any funding responsibility whatsoever for local government. However, at that point the Labor Party, with the assistance of the Democrats, was able to move an amendment in the Senate to the ANTS legislation to ensure that the direct financial link between the Commonwealth and local government was maintained. Subsequent to that amendment, the Democrats and the government struck a deal on the complete GST package, and that nexus remained in relation to that deal. The outcome of this deal is the bill before the Senate today. 
The content of this bill deals with a number of issues relating to financial assistance grants. Firstly, it abolishes the old link between financial assistance grants to local government and financial assistance grants to the states. In the past, there was a direct connection between local government grants and financial assistance grants to the states and then to local government. In effect the states were previously a postbox for financial assistance grants. This bill has the effect of changing the nature of that relationship. As financial assistance grants to the states have been abolished as a result of the GST legislation and will cease, as everybody knows, on 1 July this year, the connection between local government financial assistance grants and state financial assistance grants could no longer be maintained. That is the machinery aspect, if you like, in relation to this.
Secondly, the provision for an escalation factor in this legislation is retained. This escalation factor is an increase on a real per capita basis each year. This is simply a reflection of what has been occurring over the last decade. Local government grants have continued to increase on that basis in line with two major indicators in relation to the escalation factor: inflation and population increase. It is worth noting that the Treasurer still has a discretionary power to vary the escalation factor in special circumstances. This is a bit of a cause for concern and it is something that we will monitor for reasons that I will come to a bit later in my contribution. The assumption is that if the escalation factor is going to be revised, it will obviously, under this government, be revised downwards or be suspended rather than increased. We know from history that this government has no compunction at all in using this power to penalise local government, just as it did in the 1997-98 financial year—a penalty that has, in fact, cost local government over $61 million since 1997-98. I refer of course to the freezing of the escalation factor in the first Costello budget, which deprived local government of $15 million. That escalation factor and that money have never been returned. The aggregate is currently $61 million in terms of loss to local government. 
Thirdly, the legislation implements a provision in the intergovernmental agreement with respect to the GST package which provides that financial assistance grants to local government may be withheld from any council which refuses to pay voluntary or notional GST payments for which it should be liable. This arises directly from the GST package itself and the need to enforce compliance from the government's perspective upon local government for GST payments. This provision ensures that the part of the IGA that applies to the execution of those GST liabilities is in fact implemented by this legislation.
They are basically the objectives of the legislation before us today. We are not opposing this bill but we have opposed every piece of legislation that led to this bill. We opposed the ANTS package. We opposed the GST. We opposed it in relation to Australia and also in relation to local government. A number of issues ought to be highlighted in this debate, issues which in turn will highlight the Howard government's real agenda in relation to local government. From our perspective, local government has been abused and ignored by this government. They have every right to feel outraged and they are outraged by the way that they have been treated by this government. It is not good enough for this government to ignore or pay lip service to local communities, particularly in regional areas. Tokenism and rhetoric will not keep communities silent. Saying something is not so will not in fact make it not so. The Orwellian nature of this government and the rhetoric that it uses do not wash in regional Australia.
I notice Senator Kemp seems to think this is funny. I presume he thought the change of government in Victoria was similarly hilarious and the Benalla by-election was also extremely amusing. Both of those incidences show that the approach does not work. Nobody in regional Australia believes this government and nobody in local government believes this government.
As I said before, the biggest act of abuse of the local government sector by the Howard government came in the first Costello budget, when financial assistance grants to local government were dealt a major blow by this government. Financial assistance grants were cut by $15 million in that 1997-98 budget. This was never restored. Despite the fact—from Mr Costello's own lips—that there were budget surpluses, this was never restored to local government. As I said previously, this has meant a cut to the local government sector of $61.4 million. If we average that out across every council in Australia, we are talking a cut of $87,000 per council since this government came into power. That is only in relation to financial assistance grants. There are a whole lot of other things in relation to this that I will come to later on. I will bet London to a brick that every council in Australia would be desperate right now to have that money, given the cuts to this sector by this government. It is extremely disappointing, and it is not just disappointing from the Labor Party's position. Local government is very, very disillusioned with this government. If anybody on the other side has the intestinal fortitude to go out and have a chat to any councils, they will get that response. 
Essentially, this reveals the real nature of the coalition government's attitude to local government. It also, from our perspective, serves as a sharp distinction between the coalition and Labor when it comes to local government. The Democrats will obviously contribute later on in the debate. Let us do a quick comparison with what we did for local government in the final years of the Labor government leading up to 1996. It provides a very stark illustration of how this government feels about local government and how Labor feels about local government. Under the Labor government and the direct guidance of Brian Howe, who was the then minister for housing and regional government and who is spoken of extremely highly in local government around Australia—unlike the current minister, which is an understatement—local government was on the verge of entering into a new deal with the federal government. This deal would have left local government far better equipped to face this century than the non-existent policies of the Howard government. That is the best they could be described as. I suspect that they are not just non-existent; they are in fact retrograde.
During the final years of the Labor government we saw the signing of an accord with the Australian Local Government Association, between local government and the Commonwealth. We saw the establishment of a local government development program designed to provide project assistance across a range of areas that local government has responsibility for. It was $45 million worth, and of course that has hit the wall now. We saw a strong commitment to developing urban and regional Australia in terms of the nexus relationship that inherently exists between those two, through the Building Better Cities program, a program which went not just to cities but to provincial and regional areas. I was extremely interested to notice that the now minister's home town of Townsville recently got the remainder of some Better Cities money in relation to projects in Townsville. Better Cities was not simply cities—it was also regional.
—Why was it called Better Cities, then?
—The reason it was called Better Cities was because cities are not just Melbourne and Sydney. I know Senator Kemp comes from Melbourne. I know he rarely gets out into regional Australia as does his colleague Mr Costello, for whom regional Australians have an extremely interesting epithet these days. Cities actually exist in regional Australia as well.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Order, Senator Kemp!
—I might say—
—Order, Senator Kemp!
—I might say that Senator Kemp's laughter is an indication of the government's attitude towards regional Australia and local government. Senator Kemp and this government just do not get it in relation to regional Australia.
—Order, Senator Kemp!
—Senator Kemp, I have asked you about four times to control yourself. Please do so, or I will call you again and perhaps deal with you in another way. 
—The more that Senator Kemp laughs at regional Australia, the better it is for the fortunes of the Labor Party at the next election. What have we seen in relation to the local government development program? We saw the wholesale abolition of the entire regional development program—not just the local government program, but the entire regional development program. The first thing this government did was to abolish that under the then Minister Sharp, who is famous for saying, `Federal government has no constitutional role in regional development', something which this government is now attempting to pretend that it did not say. But nobody has repudiated former Minister Sharp's comment on that. 
This government has vacated the urban policy field entirely. This government's own back bench is now starting to scream about the lack of action on urban policy. This government thinks regional means rural—not regional in the way most Australians understand it. The abolition of this program is, from our perspective, typical of the mean-spirited and shortsighted approach of this government to local government, to urban communities and to regional communities. This mean-spirited and, from Senator Kemp's perspective, risible attitude towards regional Australia and local government has had an impact in this sector. 
The 1988 referendum on the constitutional recognition of local government is the most damning example. The Labor Party attempted to enshrine the role of local government in the Constitution in the 1988 referendum. This was torpedoed by—guess who? It was Minister Reith—Just Say No Reith. Despite the fact that the Labor Party attempted to enshrine constitutional recognition of local government in the Constitution and failed, we retain it in our platform and we retain it as a policy. We will at the appropriate time ensure it. I am sure that at that point we will have Mr Just Say No Reith trying to torpedo it yet again. Peter Reith singlehandedly sank local government's opportunity for constitutional recognition. 
Labor is also committed to a partnership with local government built on a common vision, not on imposing large cuts on financial assistance grants to local government. The challenge for any government is to listen to local communities and develop policies that address the issues in a direct and efficient manner. This is a challenge that this government has no intention whatsoever of taking up, but we are interested in this challenge. We have been in the past and we will be in the future. We believe that all three spheres of government must work together. We empirically attempted to enshrine processes which would make sure that happened through the setting up of COAG, something we have not yet seen since this government came to power in 1996. COAG, for the benefit of those opposite in their ignorance, is where local government sits at the table with the other two levels of government. We have not seen COAG at all. Labor pledged to restore the role of COAG and to restore the role of local government as an equal partner in governance in Australia. 
Since I was appointed to the shadow ministry I have spoken to a large number of councils right throughout Australia as well as to regional organisations and so on. One thing is crystal clear. This partnership needs to be re-established, something that local government correctly says will establish security to their operations. Something which this government will not accept is that councils are not simply a creature of the states. Be they in urban, rural, remote or regional areas, they are at the centre of their communities. 
Local government is the level of government which is closest to the people. If you are a councillor, which many in this chamber have been, and you are out there representing your constituency—Senator Calvert has been; I agree—you get questions about everything. You get questions about local government, you get questions about state governments and you get questions about federal government. You are the major interface, as a local councillor, between the community and government and the closest to the community. I might exempt Senator Calvert—because I know that Senator Calvert does have an appreciation and a commitment to local government—from my criticism of the federal government. 
—I am the only federal politician on the eastern shore. You left the eastern shore. 
—Pardon?
—You left the eastern shore.
—Senator Calvert, order! Senator Mackay, you have the call. Please address the chair. 
—I will remind Senator Calvert that the Labor Party holds the seat of Franklin. I know this is something that Senator Calvert does not want to hear. In fact, the Labor Party holds all five seats in Tasmania. 
—Five-nil. 
—Five-nil; that is correct, Senator Quirke. This is thanks to the efforts of Senator Calvert and his esteemed colleague Senator Abetz, who we are hoping and praying gets the ministerial spot. The day that happens and Senator Abetz comes to the front bench there will be a party in the Labor Party headquarters. I will not digress any further. 
Local government must be seen as a partner. Recently I made a speech to WSROC in Sydney in which I outlined the nature of regions. I will not repeat that, other than to say that regions are not just rural; regions are urban, regions are outer metro, regions are suburban, regions are provincial cities and regions are rural. Since the election of the Howard government nothing has happened. A classic example of the government's disregard can be seen in the delayed payment of FAGs moneys last year. This caused all kinds of difficulties for local government. The ALGA has estimated that it cost the states and local government approximately $500,000 a week. This is the kind of uncertainty local government does not need. 
The impact of the GST is something which I will touch on very briefly. The minister for local government was gracious enough to offer local government a measly $2,000 each to handle the implementation of the GST—$2,000 per council. We discovered in the Senate recently that the LGIP program had been underspent by $1 million. So the measly $2,000 could have been a measly $4,000 but it was underspent by $1 million. Anybody who goes out and talks to councils will tell you very sad stories about the cost of implementation of the GST. This is another issue that local government are very angry about. 
Local government are also very angry about the broken promise. Prior to the election, the New South Wales Local Government Association wrote to the Prime Minister and said, `What is the status of the GST in relation to local government?' Lynton Crosby wrote back on behalf of the Prime Minister and said, `You are exempt.' What was the first thing that happened after the election? Senator Macdonald said, `Lynton Crosby was wrong. We are reneging on that. We are breaking that promise.' This is an example of this government's real agenda in relation to local government. This is in stark contrast to our agenda in relation to local government. I will say this to the government and the members sitting opposite: local government know it; they know what this government has done to that sector; they are not happy, irrespective of whether they be Labor councils or National Party councils, in particular. We are committed to local government. We have been in the past, and we will be in the future. I move the second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate expresses its concern that the Government:
	(a)	has cut Financial Assistance Grants (FAGs) to local government in real terms since coming to office;
	(b)	attempted to terminate the 25 year Commonwealth local government funding partnership by trying to transfer responsibility for local government FAGs funding to the states;
	(c)	promised to exempt local government services from the GST before the 1998 election only to renege on this commitment within months of regaining office;
	(d)	through the GST, has imposed a regressive and unfair tax on essential services provided by local government to communities in regional Australia; and
	(e)	has hit councils with major GST compliance costs with inadequate compensation or assistance”. ",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-06-07,"—I am pleased to have recently taken on portfolio responsibility on behalf of the Democrats for local government because, as you may know, I have a background in that. I was honoured to have served for four years at the town of Vincent in Western Australia before taking up my Senate seat. It was in fact only roughly this time last year when I was still at the town of Vincent and making decisions for them. That was a great learning curve in terms of working with an identifiable constituency with identifiable borders; it is so much more amorphous when you are trying to represent an entire state. So, as with Senator Calvert—I am not quite sure of Senator Mackay's background—I have enjoyed that local government background. 
Yes, I agree with you, Senator Mackay. I was at Murdoch University in my final year in 1988 as a student activist and a member of the student guild. I was very involved in the `Yes, yes, yes, yes' campaign referendum, handing out how-to-vote cards at Cockburn Primary School on the day, only to see the vote come in as `No, no, no' at the end of the night, which was very disappointing, particularly for the potential to officially recognise local government within the Constitution.
My initial interest in local government began when I was living in North Perth some years ago. A decision was taken at the then Perth City Council to oppose a planning application for a daytime drop-in centre for people living with AIDS. That decision came down to the wire in terms of the numbers on Perth City Council and, ultimately, that proposal was defeated by one vote. It was made very clear to me—and there was a lot of media on that at the time—that the decision was a particularly appalling decision because a number of councillors said disgusting and repugnant things, particularly about gay men but also about people living with AIDS. Many councillors were mortified that this decision was defeated in the way that it was. One particular councillor at that time, Mr Peter Nattrass, leaned very heavily on his medical background—he is a gynaecologist—claiming in part and arguing amongst other things—I understand that he had some expertise with the issue of HIV-AIDS—that, if this drop-in centre were to go ahead, the streets would become littered with syringes, and that, if tissues were to blow over the fence into the surrounding neighbourhood, children could become infected with AIDS.
This particular misleading, untruthful and disingenuous argument was taken very seriously by the people who were lodging that particular planning application, People Living With AIDS (WA). They lodged a complaint of discrimination with the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission. At about the same time, the then state Minister for Local Government, Mrs Kay Hallahan, overturned that decision and allowed the drop-in centre for people living with AIDS to go ahead. As it happened, the investigation by the Equal Opportunity Commission concluded some months later in the affirmative—that is, the decision of the Equal Opportunity Commission upheld the claim of discrimination by People Living With AIDS. This case could have been heard under Western Australian jurisdiction in terms of grounds of impairment, which is covered under the state Equal Opportunity Act, whereas sexuality is not. I remind the Senate that Western Australia remains the only state where it remains legal to discriminate against gay and lesbian people in employment, housing and the provision of goods and services.
Those people on the council, including Dr Nattrass, who were found to have discriminated wrongly were reprimanded and fined. My recollection is that individual councillors were fined between $4,000 and $8,000. I do not recall whether that was a specific individual fine or a collective fine for those people found guilty of discrimination. Not letting it stand there, those councillors decided that they would not accept that and, quite shockingly I think, they then appealed to the Supreme Court of Western Australia, arguing that that decision was wrong and that the Equal Opportunity Commission was wrong to have found in that manner.
That case took some time, as these cases generally do in the Supreme Court, and my recollection is that ultimately the Supreme Court found in favour of the Equal Opportunity Commission, cementing the original decision that discrimination had occurred. But that was not enough for those councillors, including Dr Nattrass, who then took the matter to the Supreme Court. Of course, during all the time, people living with AIDS, their organisation and their commitment to servicing that community were placed in confusion in terms of their relocation as to where they were supposed to be, as well as the extraordinary time and money consumed in responding to that case. The Supreme Court found in that case on a legal technicality only that the original decision from the Equal Opportunity Commission in WA ought not apply on the basis that a planning decision by a local government authority could not be deemed a good or a service and, as such, the Equal Opportunity Commission had no jurisdiction over that.  
That was a spark of unprecedented public anti-gay hysteria, the likes of which we had not seen in Western Australia for some years. Then we come around to May 1995. Acting Deputy President McKiernan, you may recall that that was the time of the inaugural elections for four new councils within Western Australia, including the town of Vincent to which I was elected along with my friend and colleague, now Mayor of Vincent, John Hyde, with whom you would be familiar. Things were going well in the town of Vincent when I woke up one morning to find on the front page of the West Australian newspaper the now Lord Mayor of the City of Perth describing Councillor John Hyde and me as `disgusting poofters who controlled Vincent'. This was a stunning revelation, given that I had never met—or spoken to—Dr Nattrass, and I understand the same is true of my colleague Mayor Hyde. 
At that time I was particularly concerned about what that meant in terms of public leadership from the City of Perth and also what that meant in terms of the complete absence in Western Australia of antidiscrimination laws on the grounds of sexuality. We now see that that has evolved into an even greater alarming trend. As it happens, there is now a by-election in the City of Perth where, for the first time ever in WA, as I understand it, an enclosure is going to be inserted into the postal ballot for the electors of the City of Perth asking them whether or not they approve of the Lesbian and Gay Pride parade. This is a parade now in its 11th year which last year attracted between 70,000 and 100,000 citizens from Western Australia into the City of Perth and surrounding Northbridge area. It is a festival which the Northbridge traders argue brings in in excess of $1 million on that particular night. It is a festival that the police service which regulate that particular festival claim is one of the safest and friendliest nights of the year. It brings in an estimated $750,000 in parking fees alone. Yet, when the Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee approached the City of Perth for a humble—I think, quite pathetic—$13,500 in funding, Dr Nattrass not only said no but also gave a speech in the chamber which I would argue verged on vilification. Had he made the very same speech about Aboriginal people or Jewish people, in all likelihood he could have been prosecuted or at least charged under Western Australian incitement to hatred antivilification laws. The summary of all this is that there is a responsibility on those people in public office to be fair and to be reasonable. There is also the obligation to ensure that there is a duty of care in terms of funding through local government. 
Senator Mackay was quite right in saying that it was the Democrats who supported Labor and vice versa in terms of ensuring, at the other end of the ANTS package in June of last year, that ultimate funding responsibility for local government authorities remained with the Commonwealth. I think a part of the reasoning for that is that there is in some quarters a sense of mistrust about how state governments allocate particular funding sources to their local government authorities and a genuine fear on the part of some people that there is often political favouritism or political punishment in those kinds of funding applications. As the minister said in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives and to summarise, the core of this amendment bill before us is that, under the revised tax reform package—that is, revised following the intervention of the Democrats—the Commonwealth will retain, quite rightly, I believe, responsibility for providing financial assistance grants to local government. It is therefore necessary to amend the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 to remove that connection with the states' financial agreements grants, as those will be abolished from 1 July 2000—just some 20-odd days away—as a result of the intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. Of course, a key feature of that agreement is the payment of all GST revenue to the states. This amendment allows that local government financial assistance grants will be maintained on a real per capita basis. So, in essence, this is a stand-alone provision so that local government grants can escalate on a real per capita basis. Clearly, the urgency to pass the legislation is rooted in the fact that it is now necessary to pass this in order to ensure that the federal government is able to make those payments available to local government authorities after 1 July this year, which as I said is just a matter of days away. 
My experience and anecdotal evidence in dealing and maintaining a liaison, as I do, with local government authorities and councillors is that there is a general agreement that the ANTS package is good for local government. I have encountered no valid opposition to that. I find that most local government councillors are looking forward to the new funding arrangement and the opportunities that it provides. The information I received from the department yesterday on the budget estimates for 2000-01 for the local government federal agreement grants is that local governments will receive some $1.32 billion in local government assistance grants in the 2000-01 budget—an increase of four per cent or $50.85 million from an estimated final entitlement of around $1.271 billion in 1999-2000. Of the $1.32 billion, approximately $915.8 million is for general purpose grants and some $406.4 million for local roads grants. The four per cent increase comprises a population increase factor of 1.25 per cent and a CPI factor of 2.75 per cent. The CPI element of the adjustment factor to apply to local government financial assistance grants for 2000-01 excludes the impact of indirect tax reform, including the GST. This approach is similar to that being taken in relation to other specific purpose payments to the states. The adjusted CPI of 5.5 per cent measures prices rises to consumers who cannot claim input tax credits. As local government can claim input tax credits, the increase in funding through the CPI element reflects that. 
In summary, the Democrats support this bill. We support the ethos of the particular funding arrangements remaining principally with the Commonwealth. I also made the particular point in my second reading contribution that those of us in public office have a duty of care to administer those funds, when sought by individuals and community groups, on a fair basis—without fear or favour. The vilification we have seen in Western Australia is unreasonable and unacceptable but can continue because of the lack of antidiscrimination laws within that state. Once again, this brings home the very strong argument—that the Democrats have supported since 1995—for the passage of legislation through this chamber and the House of Representatives to ensure national antidiscrimination laws on the grounds of sexuality.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-06-07,"—I rise to speak on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000. I will highlight a number of concerns with this legislation and place on record the inequity which exists in the distribution of funding for local government, particularly in my electorate of the Northern Territory. The debate on this legislation provides me with an opportunity to address the issue of funding cuts the government has made through the financial assistance grants—or FAGs as they are known in the industry—to local government since it first came to office.
The real essence of this bill is the intent to terminate the 25-year Commonwealth-local government funding partnership by transferring responsibility for local government financial assistance grants funding to the states. In May 1984, following a national inquiry into local government finance, the Hawke government abandoned the tax sharing arrangements of the Fraser government and introduced the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act in 1986. The key feature of this act was that growth of local government general revenue funding was tied to growth in general purpose funding to the states. This linkage was retained in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995, the legislation under which the Commonwealth now provides for local government financial assistance and road grants. The formula is based on the annual increase in state financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance. Since 1994-95, the state grants—and, hence, grants to local government—have increased annually in line with population and CPI movements. Under the 1995 act, local government should receive around $1.32 billion in financial assistance grants in 2000-01. This bill breaks the link between the local government financial assistance grants and state financial assistance grants. From 1 July this year, the Commonwealth will cease paying financial assistance grants to the states and will replace them with the revenue from the GST. Consequently, the link between local government assistance and general revenue assistance to the states will be severed. 
This bill also provides me with an opportunity to highlight the failure to exempt local government services from the GST, which this government promised before the 1998 election, only to renege on this commitment within months of regaining office. The GST is the imposition of a regressive and unfair tax on essential services provided by local government to communities in regional Australia, and local councils now have to contend with major GST compliance costs, with inadequate compensation or assistance from this government. We will recall that, in the budget this year, an amount averaged out at only $2,000 per local council has been provided to assist in the implementation of this new tax.
At the beginning of May, the Darwin City Council announced that 270 fees and charges would be affected by the GST. These include: cemetery charges, car parking charges, hire of ovals, library fees, pool entry fees and community centre charges—to name but a few. This situation is the same for each and every town council in the Territory. It is unfortunate the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government has not been honest with local governments. He claimed that no council would be forced to increase rates or to cut services as a result of the GST. It is now known that most medium-sized councils are facing GST bills of more than $150,000, but this government fails to comprehend that, if services bring in increased costs, it is likely that fewer people will use these services and councils will be forced in future to reassess the level of services being offered in the community. Further, with councils looking at massive GST compliance bills, these will have to be recouped in some aspect of their business. Surely it will be passed on to the ratepayer and, as a consequence of the GST, an increase in rates and garbage collection will follow.
I want to take this opportunity to highlight a very important issue which impacts very severely on local governments in the Northern Territory. It goes to the method of funding and why there should be a review of the way in which the Commonwealth provides these funds to state and territory governments for the allocation of local government purposes. The states grants commissions determine the intrastate distribution of both these payments to local governments. Distributions must be made in accordance with the national principles, which require that grants be allocated as a minimum grant to all councils—that not less than 30 per cent of the total funds be distributed on an equal per capita basis, the remainder being on the basis of horizontal equalisation and effort neutrality; that individual council policies should not influence their grants; that the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are recognised; that account is taken of other grant support received by local councils, such as through specific purpose payments; and, that the identified road component should be allocated on the basis of relative needs of councils for expenditure on roads and to preserve road assets.
The interstate distribution on an equal per capita basis and application of these principles means that the distribution of Commonwealth grants to local government does not achieve horizontal fiscal equalisation among local councils across Australia, or within any one state. Work undertaken by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1991 suggested that a distribution very different from equal per capita would be required if state grants were allocated on the basis of fiscal equalisation principles. The guaranteed minimum grant means that equalisation within a state cannot be achieved because councils with no relative need or with more revenue than they need to fund standard service provisions receive funding. As a result, the needs of other councils cannot be met and they are not funded to enable them to provide standard services. 
The funding arrangements require that once these funds are received by the states, whilst they have a minimum, they use the fundamental principle of fiscal equalisation in the distribution. Yet when the Commonwealth makes funding available to state and territory governments for distribution to local governments they are not required to use the same principle. Of course, other Commonwealth grants are. All general revenue assistance made available as a result of Grants Commission recommendations is based on this question of horizontal fiscal equalisation. This means that all states and territories are then given resources to provide a similar standard of service for their citizens so that they are roughly equitable across Australia. This is not the case for local government. 
I am aware of a letter written by Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald in his capacity as Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government to the President of the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory. The letter is, effectively, a form letter in which he informs the association—as he is required to do, he says, under section 17 of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act—that a review of the act will be undertaken before 30 June 2001. He points out that section 17 of the act specifies that some areas must be covered by a review. The act also requires him to review other matters relating to local government that he may determine. He points out that he has drafted terms of reference, which followed discussions between his department and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Before finalising the terms of reference, he sent copies to the respective state and territory ministers. He points out that the review is to commence soon, as he wants comments by 3 May 2000. I would like to quote the following paragraph of his letter for the record: 
I am conscious that some in Local Government would have liked wider terms of reference to allow a review of the interstate distribution of funding—
so he knows it is out there—
I am also aware that there are some that do not want the interstate distribution reviewed at all—
of course, we all know the conflict occurring between the major capital cities and local government in places like the Northern Territory—
This has been a contentious issue between States for some time—
that is correct—
and was extensively debated as part of the negotiations over the 1999 Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations. The Federal Government does not support re-examining this matter as part of this review. For those Councils or Associations wishing to pursue this matter I suggest you approach your State Government for appropriate attention.
That is a most unfortunate response, and I believe it shows that the minister is either not aware of the inequities that occur as a result of this funding, although the response in the letter does not seem to lead us to believe that, or not prepared to tackle and confront the wrath of the major councils in the eastern states if this review was in fact undertaken. The President of the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory, Margaret Vigants, responded to the minister's letter on 3 May 2000. She said:
You have advised in your letter of 17 April 2000 that the review is “an important part of the Government's desire to enhance equity between councils”. In view of this objective, Minister, we would ask that before you approve the final terms of reference for the review, you examine the equity issues associated with the current funding levels councils in the Northern Territory receive under this act.
There are 69 councils in the Northern Territory under various forms of local governance. They include metropolitan councils such as the Darwin City Council, the Alice Springs Town Council, the Katherine Town Council, the Tennant Creek Town Council and others. They also include a number of community government councils, which are government councils under the specific legislation in the Northern Territory for Aboriginal communities. They also include incorporated Aboriginal communities and organisations that carry out local government services in Aboriginal communities around the Northern Territory. This is an important feature because local government in the Northern Territory does not share the same attributes as local governments elsewhere in Australia. One example is that they do not have any defined boundaries in remote parts of the Northern Territory, nor do they share the same responsibilities. Their responsibilities are different. What Mrs Vigants has done is provide some information to the minister on the way in which grants are made available to the Northern Territory and what impact that has. 
You need to know that grants to states and territories are done on a per capita basis of around $44 per person. As a result, because it is per capita, there is no allowance for remoteness, no allowance for disability factors and no allowance for the other issues that are raised when we distribute the funds on the fundamental principles of fiscal equalisation. The fundamental issue is that, because grants are made on a per capita basis, states with a larger population base get a greater amount of funds to distribute around the state to remote areas. This is significant when you actually compare the figures on a state by state basis. In the case of Queensland, for example, the Brisbane City Council is eligible for $38 million per year on a per capita basis but, because of the size of the base in Queensland and the way in which the Queensland government properly distributes those funds, it receives only $12 million, and the rest is distributed amongst other councils. The Northern Territory gets a total of $9 million. Of this, the Darwin City Council gets around $2.6 million, so there is not enough money left to spread around to remote communities on the basis of remoteness and the nature of the services they provide.
As a comparison of how funds are distributed across Australia for towns with approximately the same population—as outlined in the 1997-98 local government national report that I have with me here—Katherine received $849,000, which includes the general purpose and roads funding money; whereas Charters Towers, of roughly the same population, received $1.1 million. Similarly, Alice Springs was allocated $1.5 million but Mitchell in Victoria received $3.2 million, and it has the same population base. The following example is fairly amazing: Peppimenarti, which is an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory that has a population of 260, got $216,000 but Upper Gascoyne, which is a shire in Western Australia with 261 people, on the basis of this report—so that is one person more—received nearly $1.016 million. So, on the basis of one additional person, they got an additional $800,000. It is the same with Numbulwar in the Northern Territory. They received $245,000, but if you go to Jericho in Queensland, which has the same population base, they got $1.1 million, and Richmond in Queensland got $1.3 million. Port Keats, an Aboriginal community to the west of Darwin, got $200,000, with a population of almost 2,000; Barcaldine in Queensland, a town of an equivalent size, received $1.2 million.
You can see the obvious disparity which results from the way in which the funds are made available. Aboriginal communities get an operational subsidy from the Northern Territory Grants Commission because, significantly, they have no rates base. This is true of most of the local governing bodies in the Northern Territory, apart from the metropolitan councils. They do not have a rates base and they get short-changed in the distribution of funds, because they are distributed unfairly.
The letter from the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory compared the average funding for councils in the Northern Territory with the average for all other states in each of the categories for the 1998-99 year. To provide you with a quick example, the urban council in the capital city, Darwin, receives $1.3 million. The average grant paid to other councils in other states is $2.3 million. Where you have a small, remote council, of which there are 23 in the Territory, the average grant paid to councils is about $75,500, but in other states it is over $500,000. 
As the President of the Local Government Association in the Northern Territory says: 
With the loss of this magnitude being experienced each year by Northern Territory councils as a specific outcome of this Act, we regard this as a complete failure to distribute funding on a fair and equitable basis. 
In the context of local government, this government has a responsibility, I believe, to examine the equity issues associated with the funding which councils in the Northern Territory receive under this act. One of the major deficiencies is that the funding, which is not made available as a result of the formula to organisations and remote communities which carry out local government functions, is inequitable. If this government truly represents regional Australia, then this major issue will be addressed.
We have heard the minister brag in this chamber about his regional and northern consultations. You should be aware, Minister Macdonald, that the minute people leave your consultations and step outside the room, they are not impressed with your performance. They believe they are being used and that your efforts are not genuine. I would say to you: keep traipsing around northern Australia. You assist our campaign greatly when you talk about issues to do with regional governments. In fact, I think one quote from your meeting in Katherine was: `I'm here to listen but let me tell you there will not be one more dollar—not today, not next week, not even next year.' People were quite impressed with that statement in Katherine.
This is a major issue which is not being addressed, and the minister has determined that it will not be addressed in the review of the local government act. I note that in the letter from Mrs Vigants, she says:
Your specific exclusion of consideration of the interstate distribution of funds will not allow this review to genuinely achieve a more equitable outcome of funds to councils across Australia.
This bill also goes to the matter of road funding. I do not have the time to go through, in detail, local road funding in the Northern Territory, but it is a major issue. Put yourself in the situation of these small councils which might have 50, 100 or 200 people in remote communities and they are 200 or 300 kilometres away from another community. The local road funding they receive is based on a population of people living together in a very isolated place. The difficulty is that neither this government nor the Northern Territory government has accepted any responsibility for providing the necessary funds for transport infrastructure—the roads that link these communities. That is an abrogation of responsibility and, again, the way in which these local government funds are made available should be addressed; or, more specifically, the government should make available a suitable pool of funds for these purposes.
The identified local road grants have received no additional funding beyond the per capita funding and CPI indexes. The Local Government Association of the Northern Territory has said, `There are also major equity issues with the interstate distribution of local road grants, and the draft terms of reference for the review do not allow obvious road funding inequities to be revised.'
This bill is the legacy of the government's attempts to shift all responsibility for local government funding to state and territory governments. It will fundamentally change the role of state governments in relation to local government. It is about time this government was serious about addressing the issues being raised by local government and people in rural and remote Australia. It is about time this government stopped window-dressing its approach to rural and remote Australia by taking travelling roadshows out bush but, at the end of the day, doing nothing and ignoring the concerns that are being raised—particularly by people in local government in the Northern Territory.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-06-07,"—I rise to speak on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000 and take the opportunity to discuss how the GST will affect councils and the communities they serve.
Looking at the impact of the GST on local councils really drives home how insidious this new tax is. This GST will attack the heart of this nation. This GST will attack the very services that help hold our communities together. This GST will attack some of the most basic services that local government authorities around Australia offer. And that is not an exaggeration. Let me highlight some of the council services that will attract a GST in just a few weeks time. They include: cremation fees, fire maps, the sale of bins, sundry rubbish removal, library membership, library photocopying charges, library fax machine charges, sportsground hire, catering fees, dog obedience classes, plant and machinery hire, car parking charges, fire hazard inspection fees, sale of rainwater tanks, swimming pool admission fees, senior citizen centre hire fees, recreation centre fees, netball court hire, tennis court hire and fees for removing rubbish. Senator Abetz, could you tell me which of those is totally unimportant? 
 (Senator McKiernan)—Order! Address your remarks through the chair.
—Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Do not tempt me, Brenda.
—I would like any member of the government to stand up and tell me which one of those services is not important to any community. I would like any member of the government to stand up and say which of those services is so unimportant that everyday Australians deserve to pay more for them. Does the opposition really need to get up in this place and tell the government how important local swimming pools are? Three months out from the Sydney Olympics, do we really need to find examples of champion swimmers who had their first lesson in a council pool? Do we really need to explain to the government how important local halls are? Should we really have to explain how bad it is that not only will there be a tax on the books people buy but it will also be on any library services local governments charge for? I suppose we do have to explain all of these things because from 1 July the federal government will be making Australians pay more for these services. Some of them might not mean very much on their own but together they play a vital role in many communities, particularly small communities. Many of these services would not exist in rural and regional areas if it were not for the local council. Many of these services are not viable commercial activities in small regional areas: they simply do not make a profit. Make no mistake: when the federal government decided to tax these services, it was not just attacking local councils; it was attacking regional and rural Australia.
We are not talking about the odd fee here and an extra levy there. The Local Government Association of Queensland conducted a study for the Logan City Council which indicated that more than 260 of its charges could be subject to the GST. The Ipswich City Council is going to be hit very hard by this GST. Figures that have come from the chairman of the council's Finance Committee, Councillor Paul Tully, show how serious the situation is. The one-off cost of implementation of the GST for the Ipswich City Council is $200,000. That amount includes lost staff time. Since July last year, one staff member has been diverted from other duties to oversee the implementation of the GST. There are currently four staff working on the GST full time. The ongoing costs of GST implementation for the Ipswich City Council are estimated at $100,000 a year. The council also estimates that it will lose about $20,000 a year from lost revenue. That lost revenue comes from things such as parking meters and photocopying machines that have a fixed coinage charge, which are too expensive to change. Every time someone puts a dollar into a parking meter, the Ipswich City Council will pay 9c to the government, so by this time next year the ratepayers of Ipswich City Council will be $320,000 out of pocket. That is $320,000 that could have been spent on roads, $320,000 that could have been spent on parks and $320,000 that could have been spent on books for our libraries and other services that they provide. 
Councils will now have to include a 10 per cent GST in the price of these services. They are not commercially viable so councils will have to decide whether they will increase these fees and charges by 10 per cent—and take the risk of putting the price above the level the community can afford—or subsidise the GST increase out of their rates base. Whichever way you look at it, local communities will be the big losers. These services provided by the local councils were never designed to make a profit. The charges were levied by councils to help cover the costs of these valuable services but rarely did they actually cover those costs so, in reality, the rates residents pay to their local council subsidise these activities, sometimes quite heavily. Of course, the councils are particularly upset about this because they were originally told these things would not be a problem at all. In the 1998 election campaign the government promised local government authorities that the non-commercial activities of councils for which a nominal fee was charged would be GST free. That made sense at the time because the services had a large community service, non-profit element. The advice was given to local government authorities through a letter written by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynton Crosby, on behalf of the Prime Minister. The letter stated: 
The non-commercial activities of government will be outside the scope of the GST. This means that where a service is provided free of charge, or for a nominal charge, the GST will not apply.
That gave local government authorities a bit of reassurance. Having been assured by the head of the Liberal Party in Australia, they felt reasonably confident that the community services they offered their local constituents would not be taxed by the GST—and so did the Australian community—but they had been misled. Then, less than six months later, they found out the whole thing was a sham. At a Senate estimates hearing last year, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, revealed the truth. He told Senator Mackay: 
I am aware—and I guess you are coming on to this; perhaps I can pre-empt this long tortuous process—there is a letter from the Liberal Party campaign office prior to the election suggesting that nominal charges would be exempt. That is not correct. To all intents and purposes it is correct, because if the nominal charge is 10 cents the GST will be 1 cent. But it is on the charge that is made.
That is what Senator Macdonald said. So, from that statement by the minister, one would surmise that it was clear that the government was going to define all the activities of local government for which a small fee or charge was levied as commercial. The government either missed the point entirely or chose to simply ignore that these activities are community services—services which are very heavily subsidised by ratepayers; services vital to the community which are not attractive to the private sector. The current government has shown again and again its ignorance of the importance of local government. This government has cut financial assistance grants to local government in real terms since it came to office. It has attempted to terminate the 25-year Commonwealth-local government funding partnership by trying to transfer the responsibility for local government financial assistance grants to the states. The government has also hit councils with major GST compliance costs but has provided inadequate compensation or assistance. On several occasions Senator Ian Macdonald told us how much local councils were looking forward to the GST. In question time on 26 November 1998, Senator Ian Macdonald said:
Local government is keen on the GST and the tax reform agenda of this government. 
During estimates last year, Senator Ian Macdonald said that local governments understood the GST and were very positive about its introduction. We were dubious about that claim at the time, and now, as we get closer and closer to 1 July, more reports of councils complaining about the GST are coming to light. Let me take the Burdekin Shire Council, for example.
—Whose council is that?
—This is the same council that Senator Ian Macdonald once served on.
—Really!
—Absolutely. And I must tell you that the Burdekin Shire Council is not happy with the GST.
—I bet you they're happy that Senator Macdonald is no longer with them!
—I think so! 
—And what did they have to say?
—I will tell you what they said. This was in a short article that appeared in the Observer newspaper last week. The headline reads `Council fees will jump due to GST'.
—That is a lie.
—I have it right here, Senator McGauran. The article goes on to say: 
Burdekin Council has not ruled out fee increases of up to 20 per cent next financial year. Some service fees will rise at least 10 per cent due to the introduction of the GST but the Federal Government is yet to determine exactly which fees will attract the consumption tax. But coupled with the GST is a push towards the `user pays' concept for council services. Fearing public outrage, councillors gave the cost recovery principle a cold shoulder last week but stopped short of ruling it out altogether. A decision has been delayed until June 7, when a more detailed report will be considered.
A preliminary report at last week's council meeting claimed all current fees would have to be increased to ensure cost-recovery on services. But councillor Llew Davies said he thought council could not justify heavy increases. `Everyone hates the GST already and for us to double that impact is not going to make us any more popular,' he said. Other councillors agreed and refused to push approval for fee adjustments despite tight time constraints. Administration co-ordinator Tony Vaccaro explained cost recovery meant some fees would rise by 10 per cent which, when combined with the GST, meant the increases could add up to 20 per cent.
Get out your calculator, Senator. It continues:
`But it would not be a blanket 10 per cent increase. There would be some that rise by only seven per cent,' he said.
So there you have it: `Everyone hates the GST'. And that is from the very same council that the minister served on. Whatever you make of the arguments expressed in that article about cost recovery, there can be no doubt that the minister's claim that councils love this new tax is an absolute furphy.
But the impact of the GST on regional communities is not confined simply to local councils. Earlier this year I spoke on how the GST would impact on agricultural show societies. That situation needs looking at again. When I raised it, Assistant Treasurer Senator Kemp ridiculed me and said that I did not understand the implementation of the GST. However, on advice from the tax office, I can say that it will affect every small show society in Australia. These show societies will now have to pay GST on donated trophies, complimentary passes, sponsorships, gate entry fees, memberships, site fees and sideshow ground rent. They will also have to pay GST on the competitions that they run. So not only will the people in regional and rural communities have to pay the GST when they go to hire out a local hall or swim in the town pool, they will also have to pay the GST when they go to their local show. They are going to be hit from every side by this tax. I expect that Senator Ian Macdonald will stand up and tell us that local governments will not need to raise their prices for these services because they will enjoy savings in a range of areas. Senator Ian Macdonald has already cited the reduction in fuel costs and the removal of wholesale sales tax as potential areas of savings. Considering the blow-out in petrol costs over the last few months—and everybody has felt that—I do not see how anyone can now reasonably claim that petrol will be cheaper after 1 July. It just will not happen. 
The opposition are not opposed to this legislation. Indeed, we are pleased that the government will continue direct Commonwealth assistance to local government, although under the original GST package this was not the case. Unfortunately, there are a few things the bill has not done. The first is that the legislation has not restored the $15 million that the government cut in 1997. It is also worth noting that there is no real provision for any substantial support for local government with respect to the costs of implementing this new tax. For most medium-sized councils, the cost of upgrading their computers and training their staff for the GST is about $100,000. The Local Government Association of Queensland has estimated that their members will spend $7 million implementing the GST. That $7 million has to come from somebody, and it will probably come from ratepayers. At present the government has allocated less than half that amount nationally. 
The government tell us that after 1 July everything will be fine. They tell us that every Australian will be better off after 1 July. I do not think they are looking very hard, because every Australian out there knows that they are not going to be better off after 1 July. The government do not seem to have any idea that this tax is completely unfair and will hit regional and rural Australia much harder than it will hit the big cities. This is just another example of how the government are all talk and no action when it comes to the issues affecting regional and rural Australia.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-07,"—At the outset let me compliment Senator Gibbs on her excellent contribution on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000. The content was so detailed that it has probably enabled me to shorten my comments in this debate. Senator Gibbs has detailed very well the real impost that is going to impact upon local government when the GST cuts in in July. The minister is not yet in the chamber but I understand he is going to grace us with his presence for once and participate in this debate. This minister and this government have no idea about the problems that local government is facing and is going to face with the introduction of the GST. 
In her excellent speech, Senator Gibbs pointed to some of the comments that have been made by Senator Ian Macdonald regarding the GST and his claims that it will be of huge benefit and that he really does not have any concerns, and does not believe that local government has any concerns, about the GST. If you have ever had the torturous experience of having to sit in estimates hearings with Senator Ian Macdonald, you will know that he continually refuses to answer questions but nevertheless wants to give us the benefit of his wisdom on any number of subjects. When asked specific questions, he either refuses to answer them or, if he does not know the answer, invariably refuses to even take them on notice. Senator McGauran and Senator Mackay will recall that at the recent estimates hearings on 25 May it even got to the stage where Senator Macdonald was having an open dispute with officers of his own department about information and answers to questions that they were giving to us in those proceedings. Invariably it was Senator Macdonald sitting there saying to his departmental officers, `Look, I don't know, but I think you're wrong.' That was the tenor of his contribution. 
I will quote from the estimates Hansard on 25 May in respect of this issue of the impact of the GST upon local councils and what information this government and this minister have about that issue. It reads:
Senator MACKAY—Have you asked any of the councils how much GST implementation is going to cost?
Senator Ian Macdonald—There have been a number of independent studies done.
He does not answer the question. He says, `There have been a number of independent studies done.' It goes on:
Senator MACKAY—Have you asked any councils?
Senator Ian Macdonald—I don't think so. I do not think too many councils have raised the issue with me. Perhaps late at night over a beer one or two might have. There are a lot of independent studies around.
Senator MACKAY—So, Minister, you have not received or sought any information on the implementation of GST costs in local government? Is that correct?
Senator Ian Macdonald—I have not sought or received. As I say, one or two might have spoken to me, but I have received no formal submissions from anyone on them, no.
Senator Mackay asked a question of Ms Parsons, one of the officers:
Senator MACKAY—Ms Parsons, has the office asked any councils about the cost of implementation of the GST, and whether they are happy with the LGIP?
Ms Parsons—No.
Further down that page, Senator Macdonald makes this classic statement:
We have said any number of times at any number of estimates that we have not done any assessment or analysis from within the department, nor do we intend doing it.
What an arrogant attitude for a minister and for a government to have to the implementation of what they themselves claim is the biggest ever change in the tax system in this country. Local government is an incredibly important aspect of the levels of government in this country. For many people it is essentially the area of government that they have most contact with. Senator Gibbs and Senator Mackay in their contributions pointed to the range of services that local governments around Australia provide. As federal members of parliament, we know—indeed, state members of parliament know—that when people need to approach government in their day-to-day lives, very often the particular issues of concern are local issues: roads, provision of community services and so on. 
You would think that the government would regard it as an obligation, as a priority, to go out and ascertain the impact of the GST on local government. Of course they have not done that and they do not intend to do it. Why? It is all based upon this belief that they have, and they continue to believe it because they have to. They know, if they are not correct, that the consequences for them at the next election will be catastrophic. They continue to have blind faith in the view that the GST will be of benefit to everybody. Treasury has told us that and Mr Costello has told us that, so they do not have to even investigate that premise any more. This has occurred right through all the departments. Whenever any senator has attempted to ask questions in estimates hearings about what a particular department have done with respect to the implementation and application of a GST in their area, they say, `It's not our business. We have not done anything.' If you talk to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, where the GST will have a huge impact right across the portfolio areas, they say, `No, we haven't done any work on it.'
—Regional?
—Transport and Regional Services particularly say, `No, we haven't done any work. That's all Treasury and the department of finance. Let them worry about it.' This is an incredible attitude but one we are not surprised at, because it demonstrates the arrogance of the government. When he came to office, Mr Howard claimed he was going to set new standards, he was not going to break any promises and he was going to remain true to his word. He is on the record as having broken one of the most solemn promises ever made in an election campaign. Remember `there will be no GST'? He broke that promise and it is going to cost him dearly at the next election.
In respect of local government in particular, which is what this legislation is directed at, I have to compliment the previous speaker, Senator Gibbs. She drew attention to the commitment given by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party that the GST would not apply on non-commercial activities—all those many services that Senator Gibbs read out. But Senator Macdonald, having a flash of insight, said one day at a hearing, `Mr Crosby is wrong. Don't believe what he tells you. Don't believe the solemn commitment that local government will not really be affected by the GST.' We know, and he has admitted, that the GST will be applied to those non-commercial activities.
Is it any wonder that councils would not even bother raising their concerns with this minister and this government? In the Labor Party, we have been out there talking to many councils in New South Wales. We know that each one of them is grappling with the implementation of the GST and the problems it has raised for them. They are very concerned. Senator Macdonald hides behind the defence, `They haven't rung me up.' First of all, why would they bother? Secondly, Senator Macdonald is disingenuous in the argument that because they have not necessarily rung him with their problems, therefore one can conclude there are no problems.
What has been the factual position about this issue? The factual position is that it was not until the end of January this year that the draft determination on exempt taxes, fees and charges was made available. So local government in particular were not even made aware of precisely the range of areas where the GST would apply until the end of January this year—only a couple of months ago. They have been waiting for months for that information. I understand it had been sitting on the Treasurer's table since about August last year. So when Senator Macdonald told us at estimates, `They never raised any of these issues with me in the last 12 months,' they have not had an opportunity to because they have not been given the information by the government upon which to then examine precisely the impact. Further, presumably they were relying upon the guarantees given by various ministers in the government that they would be only slightly affected, if at all. Since January, and particularly since March when that list was finalised, they have known the full extent of the application of the GST on their services. They do not now have time to worry about ringing up Senator Macdonald because they are working overtime, spending thousands and thousands of dollars of ratepayers' money, trying to come to grips with exactly how this system is going to work. 
Only a couple of weeks ago, after the budget, I was visiting northern New South Wales, talking to local councils up there. Senator Mackay was there—she will recall it. They were telling us that they have just had to get on with the job of trying to work out how they are going to continue to fund the services that they have to provide, one, with the implementation of the GST and, two, having regard to the fact that the federal government really have no interest in local government and have said, `With all of your issues now, go and talk to the states.' That is their attitude. It is just like their attitude to regional Australia generally. I think it was Minister Anderson who said the national government really do not even have any constitutional role in regional Australia. In rural Australia, it is local government that often provides basic services which, in other parts of Australia, particularly metropolitan areas, may be provided by other agencies.
For instance, many councils in rural and regional Australia are responsible for the water supply service. They are responsible for providing the sewerage service. These are services for which, in the big cities, there is often a state department or a statutory authority or even, in some cases, a privatised body; but when you get out to the local councils in rural and regional Australia, they are the last men standing in terms of providing these sorts of services. They are finding it increasingly difficult because this government has not provided any real increase in funding for local government. That was pointed out earlier by Senator Mackay. They are very much like small business—the basis of the economy of many of these country towns—and they are trying to understand and grapple with the implementation of this system. They have real problems with it. But this minister and this government are not even interested in finding out about that.
What is this minister really interested in? He is interested in interfering in local government when it suits him for political purposes. He is the minister for interfering in local government; he is not the minister for representing local government or the minister for solving the problems of local government. As I pointed out earlier, at estimates Senator Macdonald can never answer a question. He wants to sit there and argue but he will never answer a question. Yet when there is a council election on, he can answer a dorothy dixer from his own side, like he did yesterday. He was asked a question yesterday about the South Sydney Council. He tried to take the opportunity to attack the South Sydney Council. Why would he do that? Why would he pick on the South Sydney Council? He was not going to pick on the Burdekin council, was he? There might be a bit of local embarrassment.
He picked on the South Sydney Council because he knows that there is going to be an election soon. I think he probably knows what the result is going to be. His attacks in this chamber on the South Sydney Council are not going to make any difference to the result, because just as he did when he tried to attack the Brisbane City Council, again through dorothy dix questions in this chamber, he will again end up with egg all over his face. Just as the Labor Party won a resounding, overwhelming, historic victory in the Brisbane City Council, I am certain that Vic Smith and his team, who have been serving the community of South Sydney so well for so long, will again triumph at the council elections.
Let Senator Macdonald come in here and answer his dorothy dix questions, have a bit of fun and try to make a few political attacks upon the Labor councils and upon local government—but it is sad. As you travel around rural and regional Australia, as I do whenever I get the opportunity, when we can get away from these hallowed halls here in this building, you really get to talk to people who are out there, in local government particularly, endeavouring to provide the services that their citizens need and to plug the gaps that have been created by this government federally and, at times, by state government. 
When the federal government pulls the funding out, when it says it is not even interested in finding out their concerns, what do local councils do? They cannot just walk away from the problems like Senator Macdonald tries to do; they have to confront those ratepayers, those citizens, every day. They know that they just cannot put up the rates willy-nilly, because in many of these areas the rate income base is very low. They are going to be hit hard in a whole range of service areas, but they are going to continue to struggle to provide those services because people living in those areas are entitled to them. Whilst we are supporting this legislation because of its technical nature, we want to put firmly on the record that this is a minister and a government that have lost interest in local government. If you do not believe that, all you have to do next week when parliament is not sitting is get out there and talk to them. But I think it is going to be too late.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-06-07,"—Any council that goes around saying, as Senator Forshaw has just led us to believe, that it is going to be hit hard by this GST is utterly misleading its ratepayers and ought to front before the ACCC with a few of the others, like Woolworths, who have attempted to mislead. Of all the sectors of society, local government will benefit the most from the introduction of this tax package as a whole. Senator Gibbs spent 19 minutes of her speech, which was patronisingly praised by Senator Forshaw when he knows the truth of the matter, running down this government's tax package and its effect on local government. It was all wrong, of course. Then she spent the last minute, for those who were listening on broadcast, saying, `But we don't oppose this bill.' What empty rhetoric. If you do oppose it, what are you going to put up in its place? The benefits of this bill are actually supported by the New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan, a Labor Party Treasurer no less. He issued a statement totally undercutting everything you have said, Senator Forshaw, as you scuttle out of this chamber. The Treasurer of the New South Wales government, a well known Labor government, said himself that local government stands to benefit greatly from the introduction of the goods and services tax.
It is pretty simple arithmetic: $25 billion or thereabouts will be collected in respect of the GST and that full amount goes back to the states. It is more than they are receiving at the moment and it is attached to growth—to retail spending, predominantly. The states will have more to distribute amongst local government. Local government know that. The Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Egan, knows that. Those on the other side are about the only ones who do not know that. I would say Senator Forshaw knows that, because his whole speech at least admits to being a political speech, whereas Senator Gibbs has been totally and intellectually misled. Senator Forshaw has not been misled because he is an old political player from way back. He mentions the South Sydney Council. He said it was an attack by Ian Macdonald because there is a forthcoming election. That may well be true, because we wish to alert the ratepayers of the deceit of the South Sydney Council. You never mentioned what that deceit was, nor did you deny what that deceit was. They issued a statement to their ratepayers that they will be worse off with the GST—that the rates will be GSTed. That is utterly untrue. The South Sydney Inner City News said:
Financial officers from the South Sydney and neighbouring councils fought long and hard to limit the impact on ratepayers and residents of the Howard GST—
intimating, and no doubt saying publicly, that there will be GST on rates. When the package was first announced, rates were GST exempt. This is a falsehood by the South Sydney Council. What a bunch of misleading—
—Senator Mackay, you have done nothing but interject right throughout the last 40 minutes. 
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.
—I am speaking, Senator Mackay. I would ask you to refrain from constant interjection.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. There were continual interjections from Senator Abetz previously. I notice you did not pull him up, so I would ask you to be equal in relation to your rulings.
—There is no point of order, Senator Mackay, and you know it.
—Now that we have seen Senator Mackay enter the debate, disorderly as it was, I should take up Senator Forshaw's comments in regard to the rural and regional estimates committee, which I happen to be on. That would have to be the most banal committee any senator could have the misfortune to be on. When Senators Mackay, Forshaw and O'Brien enter the room, it goes for a day longer than any other estimates committee. There is not one strike. Name one strike. At least Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner get the odd strike—the curtains in the Prime Minister's office or some little run in the Telegraph, which always loves to run those little banal issues. But let me tell you, Senator Mackay, you have not had a strike. Nor has Senator O'Brien. Nor has Senator Forshaw. Your questions go nowhere but they go for a very, very long time. Is it any wonder Senator Macdonald's patience is tested like a saint's? The man in fact does reply, but how many times—I am sorry I do not have the Hansard here—does a man have to reply to the same question? You know that. When he put the question to you, `Well, what's your policy?' you said, `We're not announcing any policies until we are in government,' which is in direct contradiction to Senator Sherry. At least he gave us some hope there would be policy. Some 18 months ago he told us, `There'll be policy at the Hobart conference coming up in a couple of weeks.' I thought, `Well, I'll sit and wait for the Hobart conference.' That has just been put aside now, because Senator Mackay tells us on the record, `No policies until we are elected.' Senator Mackay, you will never get elected under that, but it is pretty dumb logic, nevertheless. I urge you to maintain that thought.
—That is an indication of the dumbing down of this committee, Senator Forshaw. Senator Macdonald cannot take any more of the dumbness of this committee. It is the most banal committee—
—Maybe they should get you off it, then.
—Senator Forshaw, this is not a football match.
—I feel I make one of the better contributions of the committee.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Throughout the last five or 10 minutes, Senator McGauran has been directing his remarks directly at me. I have to confess I fell to the temptation and responded. But maybe he should be required to address his remarks through the chair.
—It would be helpful if Senator McGauran did address his remarks to the chair but it would be equally helpful if opposition senators did not treat this place as a football match and keep screaming out.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I will henceforth direct my comment through you. Back to the central issue, local government. As I said, of all the sectors of society which on balance will benefit from this legislation, local government will benefit the most. As you scuttle out of the chamber, Madam Acting Deputy President, through you—
—I am not scuttling out of the chamber.
—I admit I lapse in concentration. Back to the issue. Local government will benefit from the tax reform through removal of the embedded wholesale sales tax. We are going to keep drumming that in. I know you have heard it a thousand times through this debate, which is coming to its end now. It is becoming contradictory for you. It is becoming highly political. It is becoming absurd for you. We only have another two weeks of parliament for this debate and then we will see. After 1 July, let us see. You are banking so much on this because there is nothing for you on the other side of 1 July. In regard to local government, the wholesale sales tax will be abolished. There is no greater payer of wholesale sales tax than local government itself. On all its transport costs there will be huge savings. General rates, such as water, drainage, sewerage and compulsory rubbish will be exempt. I should pick Senator Gibbs up on that. She said rubbish would be GSTed. Rubbish is not GSTed; it is GST exempt. Fines and penalties and so on will be GST free. All in all, in conclusion I would have to say that local government is a great beneficiary of the whole tax package, as are their ratepayers.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-06-07,"—In this debate on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000 I would like to make a few comments on how this bill, and the way it facilitates the introduction of the GST, will impact on areas that I am associated with in Sydney. The Labor Party of New South Wales has a very fine record of having members in this federal parliament who have had extensive experience in local government. Mrs Crosio, the member for Prospect, was the Mayor of Fairfield. The Chief Whip, Leo McLeay, was on Marrickville Council. Bob Horne was on a council up on the north coast; I cannot recall the name of it. Roger Price was the Deputy Mayor of Blacktown. John Murphy was, I think, the Mayor of Drummoyne. A number of other members in the federal parliament have had a distinguished career in local government. 
People who have had that experience—I note there would be very few people in the government who would have experience in local government—can tell you exactly and directly the impact the GST will have on local government services and facilities. I have never had any experience in local government, but I have been involved in many local government campaigns in my life and I make sure that we get them up. 
—I have. 
—For the benefit of Senator McGauran, we have a term in Sydney called `Pitt Street farmers'. I am told that in Victoria you call them `Collins Street farmers'. I talk from experience, having been involved in regional and rural councils in New South Wales. I have been advised by my colleagues of the detrimental effect the introduction of this GST will have on council services and facilities. In the 1997-98 budget the Howard government cut assistance to local government by $15 million, which has not been reinstated. We were told before the 1998 election that nobody would be worse off under the GST. As I will demonstrate in a moment, that is clearly untrue. 
One of the areas I look after as a duty senator, Parramatta—a council that has a Labor lord mayor but is not controlled by the Labor Party—have advised me of what they see as the start-up costs of the implementation of the GST. Among the expenses they will have to find as a result of the GST coming in after 1 July will be the following. They believe that the use of their swimming pools will cost an additional $35,640 to their ratepayers. The hiring of sporting fields will cost $10,908. Library fees and services will cost $5,172. Parking fees will increase by $315,000 and golf course fees by $74,000. The hire of council halls will incur an additional cost to the ratepayers of $16,061. 
These higher costs will affect school holiday programs, senior leisure centre learning, site inspection and testing fees and senior leisure learning activities. But that is not the end of it for a council the size of Parramatta. What they will have to do in addition—which they are already budgeting for—is to work out the derived costs of the GST. They are budgeting for expenses of over $160,000 this financial year to cover the imple-men-tation of the GST. This money will go to the pur-chase of new software for their ac-counting systems, computer upgrades, and labour associated costs for training and re-tention of an additional accountant to co-ordinate the council's quarterly tax returns. 
This council will have to find another half a million dollars to continue the services they are currently providing to their ratepayers. Yet the government have only budgeted for $2.5 million to assist councils throughout Australia with the implementation of the GST. Parramatta Council, which is not a large council in terms of the size of Sydney, will have to find an additional half a million dollars. The Howard government went to the last election and said `No-one will be worse off.' That is clearly untrue. I would like to say more at the end of my comments about the truth that we should be trying to articulate as politicians.  
I turn to another area I am involved with. I am a ratepayer of Penrith. Once again, we have an independent mayor there and a Labor minority. So these councils are not Labor controlled. I have been advised that for the hiring of sporting fields, say, the netball courts in Penrith—I think there are 28 or 30 or maybe even more netball courts—they are going to have to find an additional $14 per court per season, that is, little girls who run around on the netball courts all day Saturday are going to be slugged with an additional cost. If you hire a sporting field to play rugby league or rugby union or soccer, costs in the same category will increase by between $28 and $68 for each sporting club. You may notice, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I did not mention AFL because it is not all that popular up in Sydney, but it may be down in Tasmania. 
The cost of hiring council halls in places like Cambridge Park, Andromeda Drive, Kingswood Park and Autumn Leaf Neighbourhood Centre, which may be used for twenty-firsts, weddings and sporting club presentations, will go up anywhere between $10 and $20. A yearly pass for a family into Penrith pool will cost an additional $64. The cost for that family will go up to $484. The Gold Squad Swimming Coaching Team there will have to pay an additional $13.50 per month per child. That adds up to $162 per annum. These are our future Olympians. They are going to get slugged by this mean government. 
The council estimates that they will have to spend over $20,000 initially to upgrade and comply with the costs of collecting this tax. But it is not only there that the people of Penrith are being taken for granted. Miss Kelly, the member for Lindsay, seems to have some sort of direct pipeline to the Prime Minister. She might have a pipeline to the Prime Minister in publicity but we cannot get anything out of the Howard government for the residents of Penrith. The people of Penrith have been asking for funding for the preservation of parts of the ADI site at St Marys—refused. They have been asking for assistance in the flood mitigation works along the Hawkesbury River—refused. They have been asking for funds for the hydrotherapy pool at St Marys—refused. They have sought funding for several Federation Fund projects, and they have similarly been refused.
But I suppose one of the worst aspects of what the government has done that has been identified out there is a problem of community safety in the ramps off the M4 onto The Northern Road. The residents of Penrith went to the Commonwealth and asked for assistance in the black spot funding and, once again, it was refused. One lucky thing that came out of Western Sydney is the fact that we have a sympathetic and caring state Labor government and, because of community safety, that money was found and the problem has been fixed up. They are some of the difficulties that local governments will experience come 1 July. It is simply untrue that people will not be worse off. They simply will be worse off. Already councils are rightly preparing themselves for the backlash that will occur.
I said earlier that I wanted to speak briefly about people making promises that they cannot keep. I think it is really a difficulty for politicians, whatever side we are on, that, if we keep making these sorts of undertakings, then we should keep them because people despair of public affairs at the moment. I do not think we do ourselves any good by making outlandish promises that we never have any intention of keeping. If the government had made promises and they are going to keep them and look after their constituency—all well and fine. That is the nature of things. But when the they go to an election, when they mislead people, when they try to pull the wool over their eyes, people are rightly angry and frustrated when they do not deliver. If we look at it in terms of the politics of the day, you will note that both parties can get only between 77 per cent and 80 per cent of the primary vote—that has slipped in the last 20 years. It does not matter whether it is us or those on the government side, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, and you have misled people time and time again. I will tell you one thing, Madam Acting Deputy President—and I suppose senators here are lucky: your colleagues in the House of Representatives are going to get it in the neck next federal election, no matter what you do.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-06-07,"—I believe that Senator Hutchins during his speech made the assertion that hardly anyone in the government has experienced local government. I am not too sure what the situation with the coalition is in the other place, but in this place—
—This is not a point of order.
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Calvert, to the best of my knowledge, has not raised a point of order. He is speaking to the bill.
—You are not on the list!
—So what!
—I would ask honourable senators to resume their seats. Someone does not have to be on a list to get a speaking—
—You know the procedures of this place. You are breaking the procedures of this place.
—Senator, if you wish to challenge the chair, I suggest you do so formally. I am trying to advise the Senate of procedure. The procedure is that a senator will be called from alternate sides. If a senator jumps on the other side and seeks the call, he or she is entitled to be given the call. I call Senator Calvert.
—I rise on a point of order. My point of order goes to the understanding of the way procedures operate in this place. You well know them, and particularly the Government Whip well knows the procedures that operate in this place. If those procedures are to operate so that this chamber can operate effectively, then speakers such as Senator Calvert cannot jump the speakers list. That is well known. If we are not to follow those procedures, then this place will not operate effectively.
—On the point of order: there is normally a speakers list for each bill and, more often than not, that is followed. What you said is correct: speakers are taken from one side and then the other. During the 16 years that I have been here, if someone decides that they want to speak, they come in and, if there are no other speakers on their side and they jump, they are given the call. The speakers list is there as a means of trying to give everybody the best understanding of what is happening. This has been the case when I was in opposition and has remained the case while I have been in government. If people want to speak, they are entitled to, unless the whips have come to an agreement that there is a limited—
—What is the speakers list then—an agreement between the whips?
—Senator Sherry, Senator Vanstone has the call.
—Unless there is a formal agreement, as there sometimes is in relation to some debates that there will be a limited number of speakers who will all speak for a limited number of times, the rule remains that any senator who wants to speak can come in and get the call. 
—There is no point of order, Senator Sherry. I call Senator Calvert.
—I did not want to create all this fuss and bother. All I wanted to do was put on the record, which I am entitled to do—
—At the correct time.
—I point out that Senator Julian McGauran spoke a while ago and I do not see his name on the speakers list. I can tell you this as whip: speakers lists change all the time as we are going through. People drop off, people jump up the list, people come down the list. I am not particularly interested in that. All I wanted to do was to put on the record for those people who may have thought that there were no people in the Senate, in particular, who did not have local government experience that there are 10 members of this government who have been members of local government. I would like to know how many on that side of the chamber have been members of local government. ",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-07,"—In respect of Senator Calvert's contribution, it is well known in this chamber that there is a speakers list. It is agreed to by the whips on both sides. For this chamber to operate effectively, we all know that these informal mechanisms that are agreed to have to be followed. I find it appalling that, because the Government Whip in particular, Senator Calvert, wants to make a point, he should jump the speakers list. I do not object to him making a point; it is where he does it and how he does it that is important. This chamber will not operate effectively unless these informal mechanisms are followed. This is a matter that I am sure our leader and our whip will take up in the appropriate forums. But to come to the legislation before us, which deals with local government financial assistance and relates to amendments—
Government senators interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, I wish to raise a point of order. I am sorry you have not been here, because you have been in this chamber as long as I have and you will understand that a speakers list is put together in order to give everybody some idea of what is meant to be happening, but speakers go from one side to the other. If someone comes in and they are not on the list, they are entitled to get the call in order. The point is that Senator Sherry was wanting to speak and was not on the list. Now a revised list has come around because he has had himself popped on. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am just asking you to confirm that, if people come in who are not on the list, they can in fact get the call if there is no-one on their side on the list. 
 (Senator McKiernan)—I understand that the matter was resolved during the course of an earlier series of points of order. I lost the train of the debate from my office to the chamber, and that is why I allowed you to make a more lengthy contribution than I would have normally done. There is no point of order. I call Senator Sherry.
—This matter will be dealt with in another forum. It is an important issue.
—We're shaking in our boots.
—If you want to get through your legislation, Senator Vanstone, I suggest you pay some attention to it. The claim you just made, Senator Vanstone, was incorrect: I am on the speakers list. I was informed by a whip, and you well know how these informal arrangements operate, Minister. If you want to get through legislation—
—Order! Senator Sherry, you should address your remarks through the chair.
—in the time that has been allocated—through you, of course, Mr Acting Deputy President—you will not pull stunts like this again. I will return to bill that we are considering. The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000 makes amendments to the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act with respect to tax reform. Of course, tax reform is a euphemism for the implementation of the goods and services tax. The formula to be applied by the Treasurer each year to determine the increase in the level of local government financial assistance grants is the issue that we are considering. This formula is based on the annual increase in state financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance. Since 1994-95, the state grants—and hence the grants to local government—have generally increased annually in line with both population and consumer price index movements. Under the 1995 act, local governments should receive around $1.32 billion in financial assistance grants in the year 2000-01. I think it is worth while reminding the chamber that Commonwealth government grants to local government were an initiative of a Labor government—the Whitlam Labor government. Up until that time and since the initiative of the Whitlam government, this government and previous Liberal-National Party governments have generally ignored the financial interests of local government. 
The bill we are considering has two main effects. Firstly, it breaks the link between local government financial assistance grants and state financial grants. The state financial grants will be abolished from 1 July, consistent with the intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. Secondly, the legislation provides for the continuation of the escalation factor for local government financial assistance.
—You're not reading your speech, are you?
—Do you want to take a point of order on that, Senator Vanstone, because you will have even more problems in the coming weeks. You dill!
—Bully, bully! I might have a heart attack out of fear!
—Senator Vanstone, order!
—I will come back to the comments I was making before I was interrupted by Senator Vanstone. There will be the continuation of the escalation factor for local government financial assistance on a real per capita basis for previous years. As with the existing provisions, the amendments provide the Treasurer with the discretion to increase or decrease the escalation factor in special circumstances. This bill also amends the act to implement clause 18 of that intergovernmental agreement to require states and the Northern Territory to withhold from any local government authority that does not pay voluntary or notional GST payments a sum representing the amount of unpaid voluntary or notional GST payments. In other words, it puts the onus on state governments. This is an interesting aspect that I will return to later.
This legislation is a legacy of the government's attempt to shift all responsibility for local government funding to state and territory governments. In the negotiations that have occurred on GST legislation in this chamber, it was in fact the Labor Party and my colleague from Tasmania, the shadow minister, Senator Mackay, who quite rightly led the debate on this particular issue. Of course, in the later stages of that debate, the Democrats finally accepted the points that our shadow minister and the Labor Party were making with respect to this issue. I would note that, like so many other issues on the GST that the Democrats missed, they had to be alerted by the Labor opposition on this matter. So the Commonwealth will still have a direct financial link to local government. I said earlier that the current Liberal-National government were attempting to shift all responsibility in this area to state governments, in the same way as they have attempted to portray the GST as a state tax when clearly the GST is not a state tax; it is a Commonwealth tax. The GST is legislated for under a Commonwealth head of power. If you go to Budget Paper No. 1 at 4.14 and look at note 4, `Indirect taxation', it lists GST revenue as Commonwealth revenue. No matter what pretence this government attempts to make about it being a state tax, it is clearly not. Interestingly, the GST revenue is listed for the year 2000-01 at $24,053 million, rising to $30,737 million in the year 2003-04. What a massive new tax the GST is with respect to the Australian community.
I will deal more directly with the so-called assistance that is being given to states. In the case of my own state of Tasmania, there will be a base allocation of $67,000 and a notional council allocation of $58,000—a total of $125,000. I will come back to that matter a little later. One of the central arguments by the government in the lead-up to the election and since is that local government will not be hurt by the GST. But this is not correct. The direct rate charges of local government will not be subject to a GST, but there is a long list of what are classified by this government as commercial services that will be subject to a GST. This is on the basis of the so-called competitive neutrality principle. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has defended the application of the GST with respect to a wide range of local government services on the basis of competitive neutrality. I will come back to that issue a little later.
There is an enormous list of areas that local government are involved in where the GST will be applied. The list includes cremation fees, fire maps, sales of bins, sundry rubbish removal, library membership, library fax machine charges, sports grounds and reserve hire fees, catering fees, netball court hire, dog obedience classes, plant and machine hire fees, car parking charges, fire hazard inspection fees, sale of rainwater tanks, swimming pool admission fees, library photocopying charges, senior citizen centre hire fees, recreation centre fees, tennis court hire, basketball court hire, adult day centres and fees for removing rubbish. And that is not an exclusive list.  
The competitive neutrality argument is that, where a council delivers a service such as those I read out—and there are others—because there is either in reality or potentially a commercial competitor, the GST should apply. This is not an easy principle to apply in practice, particularly in rural and regional Australia, because in many areas of rural and regional Australia the only organisation in a community that will provide many of these services is local government. The fact is that it is simply not commercially viable for a private sector organisation to provide these sorts of services, so why should residents—particularly in rural and regional Australia—be disadvantaged by the impractical application of the so-called competitive neutrality principle?
I will turn to a couple of examples of particular problems that have arisen on the north-west coast of Tasmania. These were highlighted in an excellent article by my local paper, the Advocate, which did a survey of various problems being encountered by councils on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I acknowledge that this survey was also prompted by our shadow minister and my colleague from Tasmania Senator Mackay. I will go through this survey by the Advocate briefly. I make the point that the people who were asked in local government were not councillors; they were not politically biased or motivated in any way. With respect to the Circular Head Council, the financial services manager, Mr Brett Russell, said that the council was unable to estimate how much compliance would be, but that costs were certain to outweigh the savings. The article goes on. The Latrobe general manager, Mr Grant Atkins, estimated that $40,000 had been spent in recent months. He did admit that this was only a guess, but he is in a good position to know. The accountant of the Waratah-Wynyard Council, Ms Lisa Dixon, said that GST factors were putting pressure on the council's resources. The general manager of the West Coast Council, Mr Paul West, said that he had not kept count of its total compliance costs, but he believed the figure would be very significant. I referred earlier to the allocation made to councils to cover these costs. With an allocation of approximately $2,000 per council, it is obviously woefully inadequate. I think the most revealing comment was from the Burnie general manager, Mr Paul Arnold, who said that the council would lose half a million dollars in productivity costs due to the implementation of the GST. Local government, in some areas, is going to have to wait until 1 July to know what the true costs of the implementation of the GST will be.
I will conclude with a few other remarks. I do attend Senate estimates, usually Finance and Public Administration, and Economics—
—Big deal!
—It is certainly not a big deal, Senator Vanstone, when you have Senator Kemp before you, let me assure you of that. Senator Kemp is well known for his approach to questions, both in question time and in estimates. Senator Kemp answers by being very evasive or irrelevant. But when you compare his performance, which is very poor, with that of Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Ian Macdonald is the worst performer. At Senate estimates Senator Ian Macdonald does not even attempt to answer any questions. He tries to shut down the estimates by not addressing any issues at all, particularly on the GST, but when Senator Ian Macdonald comes into question time, he can answer questions posed by his side—dorothy dixers—particularly in relation to local government elections. He has done that on a number of occasions. He answered a dorothy dixer in respect of the Brisbane City Council elections. He was attempting to support the Liberal team that was running in those elections. In doing so, he thought he would increase the profile of the Liberal Party team and increase their vote. Of course, we all know the result. The Labor Party won with a crushing majority. One other aspect of those local council elections, of course, is that the Liberal Party attempted to run a fundraiser for the Liberal candidate. They had to cancel the fundraiser. Guess who was the guest speaker scheduled to attract the Liberal Party faithful to the luncheon? It was none other than Senator Ian Macdonald. 
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Senator TAMBLING,",CLP,2000-06-07,"—There has been an enormous amount of publicity recently regarding the issue of mandatory sentencing. It is an unfortunate reality that, amidst this publicity, many of the true issues and facts that should have been addressed in this debate were ignored, derided as being untrue or politically incorrect or described as political propaganda. There is no greater example of inflammatory or misleading statements than those made by the Leader of the Opposition on 4 April 2000 in the parliament. Mr Beazley claimed that a pregnant mother with three young children had been jailed for 14 days as a result of mandatory sentencing. This is totally false and was very obviously part of a campaign by the federal Labor Party to overturn the Territory's mandatory sentencing laws to benefit their Territory colleagues politically. This was a shameful act by Mr Beazley and his party. He should apologise to the federal parliament for the statement and also to the Northern Territory government.
By virtue of all the misinformation being bandied about, it is also an unfortunate reality that some people will still continue to attempt to overturn the legislation of a democratically elected parliament. I am astounded that Senator Brian Greig can say in this chamber:
There is, I think, a strong feeling in the general community and certainly with the government that the issue of mandatory sentencing is over, that it is finished, it is complete and should no longer be dealt with because it has been finalised.
He then went on to say that the Democrats do not think it is finalised. So what will they do? They will effectively ignore the wishes of the Northern Territory voters, and the wider community, by attempting to once again ignite this debate and overturn the legislation of a democratically elected parliament. Senator Greig is attempting to do this by tacking on an amendment to the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, which attacks the Territory's mandatory minimum sentencing legislation. It is an arrogant and inappropriate response to a very serious issue. Even Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, thinks that Senator Greig's actions are inappropriate. He said:
I think we have to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of dealing with the mandatory sentencing issue in portfolio bills such as the one we have before the chamber at the moment.
I agree with Senator Faulkner, and it is not too often that that happens. Senator Greig should recognise that the debate has been had; it is over. The legislation will remain. It is appropriate, though, that I as the Country Liberal Party senator for the Northern Territory take this opportunity, now that the hype has died down to a quiet roar and sensible debate can finally take place, to put on the public record many of the facts and positives that were totally ignored amid the hysteria and political opportunism over the last few months.
The media and others totally ignored the most important fact relating to mandatory sentencing: it is legislation that was introduced by a democratically elected government that had put forward mandatory sentencing as one of its main platforms at an election in which it had its most resounding victory ever. The vast majority of people in the Northern Territory agree with mandatory sentencing. They wanted it to be implemented and they want it to remain. Senator Greig must understand that, although he does not like it, Territorians do and that is their right. He must not continue to interfere in the legitimate governance of the Northern Territory.
The issue of juvenile justice and mandatory sentencing attracted the greatest interest in the debate. It should be noted that mandatory sentencing only applies to juveniles aged 15, 16 and 17. I would first like to outline the options for juveniles that are available through the many diversionary programs that have already been approved by the Northern Territory government. These programs may be used when a juvenile appears before a court for the second time and is found guilty of a property offence. The court may require the juvenile to participate in a diversionary program as an alternative to spending time in a detention centre such as the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, which I believe has been described by Amnesty International as one of the best facilities of its type in the world—a model facility. 
If the juvenile satisfactorily completes a diversionary program, the court may discharge the juvenile without penalty. There are 21 approved diversionary programs and they include, amongst others: the community services component of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia; a Somerville Functional Family Therapy/Intervention Program; a Tangentyere Council Indigenous Five-a-Side Soccer Program; a Victim/Offender Conferencing Program; and programs at Imanpa, Santa Teresa, Papunya, Yuendemu and Titjikala. Proposed programs by 10 Aboriginal communities throughout the Territory are still being considered.
There was a quite absurd situation in the Territory during this debate where the government was criticised because some diversionary programs had not had any juveniles go through them. There is a simple answer for this: the number of juveniles in detention or in need of the programs is so low that, inevitably, there will be programs with no participants. At this very moment, there are 13 juveniles in detention, and only one of them is detained for offences under mandatory sentencing. It is important to note that mandatory minimum sentencing laws are only a part of the Northern Territory government's broad range of programs to deal with antisocial behaviour. There are many innovative schemes provided by both government and non-government agencies that offer prevention, intervention and diversionary programs aimed at minimising antisocial behaviour and assisting those with problems. The vast majority of these schemes receive substantial Northern Territory government funding.
A major cause of social problems in the Northern Territory is alcohol and alcohol related issues. It is an unfortunate fact that this is a very big problem in the Territory, and the government has many schemes aimed at addressing the issues. I would like to point out that, for the past six years, the Northern Territory government has been recognised by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia as the No.1 ranked jurisdiction in Australia in terms of funding for alcohol and other drugs programs. That is but one example of a Territory health program at work.
Returning to the issue of young people at risk, funding has been provided by way of the wine cask levy to some 17 organisations throughout the Northern Territory which have a particular youth focus. The Anyinginyi Congress is receiving funding to implement a community development program addressing antisocial behaviour in Tennant Creek, with youth as a priority. There are two Palmerston Town Council programs, one of which aims to develop recreational and developmental strategies for young people in Palmerston, particularly drug and alcohol diversions, and another which develops and implements a strategic plan for young people in the Palmerston region. The Katherine Youth Group funds a camp during school holidays for at-risk teenage girls, and the Barunga Manyallaluk will progress a junior warden scheme with youth volunteers.
In spite of its efforts in implementing many innovative and highly successful schemes, the Northern Territory has been painted by some in the media—and, unfortunately, even some here in this chamber—as being uncaring, unresponsive and irresponsible when dealing with many social issues. This is simply not true, and it is unfortunate that I do not have more time to describe the innovative and successful social programs the Territory is undertaking. 
I would like to table a document entitled Mandatory Minimum Sentencing: what it is all about, the facts and myths. This document not only debunks many falsehoods relating to mandatory sentencing but also gives a good outline of the many programs relating to social issues. I would draw it to the attention of senators and, very particularly, to the attention of the media. Some of the myths that this document debunks include the following: juveniles are jailed the first time they commit a crime; mandatory minimum sentencing laws target Aborigines; people are being sent to jail for trivial offences; a person will receive the same sentence for a trivial offence as for a more serious one; jail should be the last resort for a juvenile offender; a mother of five received 14 days' jail for stealing a pram for her baby; Aborigines, particularly juveniles, are being jailed in large numbers because of mandatory sentencing; mandatory sentencing is sending women to jail in large numbers; mandatory sentencing is wrong in principle; and innocent people are being jailed because of mandatory minimum sentencing. I believe all senators should peruse this document, because it shows the innovative attempts that are taking place at the community level in the Northern Territory to address these very significant problems.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-06-07,"—Senator Ludwig asked me a question yesterday—I apologise for calling him Senator Hogg; it is Tweedledum and Tweedledee over there—and I said that I would provide an answer. I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Ludwig, asked Senator Herron, who is representing the Acting Minister for Family and Community Services in the Senate a number of questions which Senator Herron took on notice.  The answers to these questions are now supplied:
a)	Can the Minister inform the Senate how many pension or benefit recipients have been contacted by the Morgan research organisation in its current or recent broad polling excercise?
In the current (May/June 2000) round of customer research, as at the close of Sunday 4 June 2000, 64,899 customers had been interviewed.
b)	Can the Minister confirm Centrelink has passed personal particulars on to Morgan polling including contact details? 
Yes. 
c)	What other personal details have been forwarded to the polling organisation for this survey?
The `personal information' provided to Roy Morgan Research is limited to the minimal details necessary to ensure that the results of the survey reflect a good cross-section of Centrelink's customers.  However, the Roy Morgan Research interviewer only has access to the customers' name and telephone number.  
The details provided are:
Regional Office Code (a 3 digit identifier of the customer's local office)
Date of last contact
Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms)
First Name
Last Name
Address 1 - street number and name (this is a 'care of' address - most records do not have one)
Address 2 - street number and name (the customer's address)
Suburb
Postcode
State
Phone
Sex
Age
Payment type (a 3 digit code), subpayment type or activity code 
Country of birth
Language of birth
Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander identifier (either `Y' or `N').
d)	What privacy safeguards have been put in place to protect the privacy of these Centrelink clients?
Centrelink's contracts for customer satisfaction research have legally binding provisions to ensure that customers' personal information remains confidential. The provisions include:

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-06-07,"—Let me underline the matter that we are discussing this afternoon: the failure of the federal government to adequately respond to the crisis in the Australian sugar industry. Let me emphasise that I am not saying that the federal government has done nothing.
—Back-pedalling from almost the first minute!
—I am not back-pedalling; if you read the motion properly, that is exactly what it says, Senator McGauran. The problem is that the federal government have responded in a manner which is too little, too late. They have addressed one issue amongst a host of issues which concern sugar growers in Queensland. They have addressed one issue which is important in one local area. But in terms of the crisis which is facing the whole sugar industry in Queensland and in northern New South Wales, it is a minor issue compared with all the issues which are vexing sugar growers in those areas at the moment.
I want to deal with the issue of the South Johnstone mill—and I will get to that in a minute—because I think there are some things that need to be said about the government's action on that issue. Having met with sugar growers and people concerned about the sugar industry on the Atherton Tableland, in South Johnstone, in Ayr and in other parts of Queensland in the last couple of months, I can tell you that there are many issues which the federal government is simply not addressing at all.
I am going to read into the record some of the issues which have been put on the record in all those places, and I did not mention Ingham, where I spent at least a day with those people. They all asked me to bring the message to Canberra that, while the federal government is addressing one issue amongst many—the issue of the South Johnstone mill—many other issues are vexing the minds of these sugar growers and in fact there is a very deep crisis in the Australian sugar industry. Fixing up the South Johnstone sugar mill, whilst it is welcome in that area, is simply not going to save the sugar industry in this country. I want to put on the record some of the things I discovered, and in fact I will read into the record some of the things which were given to me in writing. But first of all, let me address the issue of the South Johnstone sugar mill. I read from the minister's press release: 
“The Federal Government has offered to underwrite Canegrowers for a loan to provide the necessary capital to enable the crush to proceed on schedule next month,” Mr Truss said.
It is good that they did that. But let me relate what I discovered when I visited South Johnstone. I want to ask whether the federal government's initiative will actually address, even in that local area, all the issues that surround the problems in the South Johnstone mill. One of the problems is to do with the whole area of preparation to open the mill, which takes quite a bit of time, a bit of capital and also a lot of work. I discovered that none of those preparations have been able to begin. There is a problem with the drainage into the creek system, and that has not been cleared for a number of years. There is the problem of maintenance of the tracks which lead into the mill and carry much of the sugar. 
—What are we supposed to do?
—There is an incredible problem in terms of roads, Senator Boswell, particularly up on the Atherton Tableland, as much of the sugar that is being grown in the southern Atherton Tableland comes into the South Johnstone mill. The roads are falling apart. So these are some of the issues—Senator Boswell might like to address them in his contribution—and I need to know whether or not they are being addressed by the government in addressing this one particular issue in the sugar industry in North Queensland. I wonder whether that mill's debt is going to be just too big to jump over and whether this is just a temporary relief for this year. I wonder whether the federal government is prepared to put in funding. I could give a figure but, because that could be commercial-in-confidence, I will not mention it. But I understand that the debt on the mill is very large indeed. Part of this was caused by the mill's purchase of land near Tully from the King Ranch, and that itself increased the debt. I visited a number of businesses in South Johnstone and there are many of them ready to close their doors. Is the federal government's package for South Johnstone really going to address those issues? That is the question that needs to be answered.
Let me note that it says in the minister's press release on the South Johnstone sugar mill that `cane farmers in North Queensland are currently facing a difficult situation with poor seasonal weather'. I certainly do not expect the federal government to be able to do anything about that, Senator Boswell. But let me say that low prices and a corrupt world market are mentioned in the minister's press release, and I have to ask whether or not the federal government is taking enough account of that. The problem is that, once we removed the very small tariff which helped to support the domestic price for sugar in Queensland and we moved to export parity pricing, immediately we exposed the sugar growers in North Queensland to that corrupt world market. That meant that not only our export sugar but also sugar sold into the domestic market, which is about 20 per cent of the market, had to cop a price which is just unsustainable. This is one place where the Democrats disagree strongly with the major parties, in that we believe that domestic markets at least ought to be supported by government and that, while we are subject to export markets and it is difficult to do anything about the prices that we get for our export product, in terms of our domestic markets we do have control over the price. To expose domestic markets to that same export parity pricing means that growers cannot, even in their own domestic market, control the price that they get.
I notice that the minister said:
The loan is dependent on the growers contributing to a 5 per cent levy on their proceeds for the next two seasons' supply, as already agreed. 
I again ask whether the assistance that the government says it is giving is really about farmers themselves paying for their own government assistance. I notice also that Mr Truss said:
By the end of this year a plan must be in place to rationalise industry infrastructure. The loan does not avoid the need for restructure.
I must say that rural communities and primary industry have come to fear the word `restructure' because what it really means is less farmers, lower incomes and a decline in the population of rural communities.
—And higher domestic prices for the consumer.
—That is right. I have addressed the issue of the South Johnstone mill. Even though I commend the government for the initiative, even that one initiative which has been taken I believe will be only a very temporary measure that will be paid for by farmers in the end and will not address many of the other issues surrounding that one particular place.
In my visits to North Queensland, I discovered a number of other things. A group of sugar farmers in Ayr drew attention to the fact that, while we are subject in this country to export parity pricing, African cane farmers and those in the United States get three—
—Are you talking about state governments?
—Yes, I will give them a bit of a serve, too.
—Order! Senator Boswell, cease interjecting.
—Sugar farmers in the USA and African cane farmers get three times the world market price because of support which is given to those farmers. How do we expect our farmers to compete at world parity prices when other sugar exporting nations give support to their farmers to the extent that they get three times the export parity price that our farmers have to survive on?
The farmers in Ayr said that refiners in Australia—who really pushed the whole issue of getting rid of the sugar tariff—are now paying $200 a tonne less for sugar. At the same time, the consumer price has increased—the same story as with dairy. While the middle people, the processors and refiners, are getting cheaper sugar, at the same time consumers are paying more to buy sugar in the supermarket, more for soft drinks and more for confectionery. One has to ask what is happening and why it is that this government seems bent on taking money out of the pockets of farmers and transferring it to food processors, because that is what is happening in so many of our industries.
—What about Golden Circle?
—You can talk about that.
—You have to tell them it is going to—
—Order! Senator Boswell, you will have your turn shortly.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I guess we should not have these kinds of discussions.
—No. You should be addressing the chair.
—Let me go to the meetings I had in Ingham. It might be good if I read to you a speech which was handed to me. This person, a woman, asked me to talk about these things. She said:
Not only are we facing severe hardship with low world prices—the lowest on record—since 1997 we have had 6 floods in this district within four years. We have had unseasonal rains as well which has produced the lowest CCS on record and over 2 years our crops and ratoons have been damaged to such an extent that a lot of us have not been able to meet our bank payments and have had to operate on overdrafts larger than normal.
I am not blaming the federal government for weather conditions, but in these kinds of conditions, the federal government is the one who must respond. She continued:
It has been a very stressful experience when, as farmers, we have worked for 12 months and are not even making the basic wage ... It is a very distressing fact that we are not going to be paid money from harvesting our cane this year that will even cover our costs ... 
We cannot fight seasonal weather, low world prices and government policies—and the banks—anyone who has borrowed money needs between $25 to $27 a tonne just to survive.
The federal government is saying to these farmers, `Borrow more money,' but even at a lower interest rate it just cannot be done. She continued:
This money still has to be paid back. Even when prices lift we would be no better off than we are now because of these extra borrowings.
And she goes on. She talks about stress on the family and wants to know why governments are bent on killing farmers and small businesses in this country. In closing she said:
I would like to say we have had a gut full. We are not going to take any more of what has been dished out. We are going to come out fighting. The fight has already started. Please take this message to Canberra.
I hope that today, at least in this debate, we are able to address some of these issues. The other issues which are biting in the country are national competition policy and the whole issue of global free trade which is certainly not fair trade. Our farmers are having to compete, without any real support from governments, against subsidised and corrupt world markets.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-06-07,"—Words fail me after that contribution by Senator Woodley. He has picked absolutely the wrong time to move an MPI in these terms. Only today, there is a person up from Warren Truss's department negotiating and putting the final touches to the South Johnstone loan. Three weeks ago, I had a phone call from South Johnstone saying, `We have about eight days to go. Can you help us?' Bob Katter was in my office. We sat down and worked this through. Three weeks later, this government has agreed to underwrite the South Johnstone mill. It took three weeks to get it through. That is the response to your MPI—three weeks to get underwriting in place for $3½ million.
About two weeks ago, I was invited to open the Australian Canefarmers Conference. No-one understands the plight of the sugar industry more than I. Some of the propositions that Senator Woodley raises about weather and low CCS prices are totally accurate, but then to come in and say that the government has not done anything to support the sugar industry is totally wrong. About three months ago, I addressed their management committee.
—How long ago?
—About three months ago, and I said, `If you want the government to help you, then you have to put a plan together and present that plan to the government.' De-Anne Kelly has been running around Queensland and she has been in charge of the sugar task force. Only a week or maybe three or four days after the conference, which was about two weeks ago, or even later than that, the sugar industry, the milling council, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Queensland Canegrowers presented a united package of support on behalf of the sugar growers. Does Senator Woodley expect that the government should respond to this package in less than a week? 
The Prime Minister was up at the sugar growers conference. By some chance he turned up in Cairns when I was opening it. I rang his office and I rang his mobile phone and I said, `Would you come around and say a few words to the growers?' He did come around there and he gave a very good address. He said that their package would be looked at sympathetically. Senator Woodley, how can you do anything more? Within three weeks we responded to the South Johnstone mill. Within one week the Prime Minister invited the sugar industry to put a plan together and to come to the government and present that plan to Warren Truss. And now you are up here demanding that we do something.
Senator Woodley, there are always people who are going to be unhappy. There are always those types of people. I understand them and I understand their needs. But you cannot go around rural Australia like a scavenger looking at some people who are unhappy and then reflecting their prejudices back to the electorate. That is One Nation stuff—but you are making One Nation look like half a nation the way you are carrying on. You are an opportunist, Senator Woodley. You go out there and cost this government millions of dollars by traipsing around rural Australia demanding that we have inquiries on everything, from dairy to sugar, so it gives you an opportunity and a platform to grandstand in front of rural Australia. What has it ever achieved? Not one thing. I defy you to get up in this place and say what you have ever achieved for rural Australia. You are using it like a scavenger, and that is not the purpose— 
—Address the chair or he will get angry with you.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Woodley is not acting in any way that enhances the Senate—the way he goes around promoting these Senate inquiries to give himself a platform.
Let us just have a look at the tariff issue. I have press releases here that I will table from the Australian Cane Farmers Association. These press releases relate to the sugar industry report tabled. Mr Allison, General Manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, said that he believed the general industry would accept the report as a `united, solid approach to the future direction of the industry'. In so doing, he believes the report `reflects the maturity of the industry'. That is a report from one of the industry's peak bodies supporting the removal of the tariff. And then the Canegrowers come in and say:
The sugar industry is a balanced package of measures recommended by the working party and now accepted by the government. It vindicates Canegrowers' consistently stated argument that total deregulation would be disastrous.
The representatives of those two industry bodies came down to Canberra and asked the federal government members and senators to remove the tariffs. We responded to the needs of the industry. Yet Senator Woodley goes out there and continues to stir the industry up.
We talk about tariffs and global group trade reform. Together with 13 other sugar producing countries, the global alliance of sugar producers supports the government's efforts and shares the aim of dismantling tariffs and non-tariff barriers and the elimination of all export subsidies and trade distortions that provide domestic price support for sugar. Average tariffs are three times higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture goods. It seems beyond comprehension that in US terms $362 billion was given to farmers in wealthier countries last year to support less than three per cent of their economies. The EU, Japan and America support their farmers by $362 billion. I ask Senator Woodley: does he think that with our economy, if we get into a subsidy war, we can possibly match those subsidies? The sugar industry do not think so. They think the only way out is to try to remove trade barriers. They think that, and 13 other leading sugar industry countries think it. The only way through to them is to reduce the tariff barriers and get out there. Senator Woodley, I do not know whether you were here at the time, but when the embargo was lifted it was I who called for a Senate inquiry and actually did something. We actually had a report that said there should be a tariff on sugar. Do you recall that? I do not know that you were here.
—You got rolled.
—No, we did not get rolled. There was a tariff that went on sugar when the embargo was lifted. Then the Labor Party tried to remove the tariff, and it was I and a couple of others who crossed the floor and supported it.
—You voted to remove the tariff, too.
—No, I never voted to remove the tariff.
—Yes, you did.
—You are correct; I certainly voted to remove the tariff when the sugar industry requested it of me. The two peak bodies and the milling council requested that the tariff go, and that was when I voted for it to be removed.
In these inquiries that you run around Australia, which cost the taxpayers millions and millions of dollars, you fail to lead with the facts and fail to tell the people the real options facing them. You take an easy, populist path denying rural families the truth about world sugar. You exploit the position. 
—Senator Woodley, it does not become you at all, doing this. You really should not do it.
Let us just look through some of the things that we have done. As a government, we have supported the amalgamation of the refining of Mackay and CSR, a thing that the sugar industry asked us to do. We have given the industry a $19 million infrastructure package. We put a $13.45 million package together for research into low CCS in the northern region where it is declining. We have underwritten the South Johnstone. We have put out guidelines for restructuring which the industry understand. The Prime Minister attended the sugar growers conference two weeks ago. The Deputy Prime Minister also attended the conference and had someone there all the time. The PM gave an undertaking to consider a package coming from the whole industry and agreed to by the whole industry. This came from groups representing the whole industry. The ACFA put that package forward together with the Canegrowers, together with the milling council. 
We recognise that commodity prices are low around the world. We recognise that the prices have been the worst in Australian history, down as low as 4c a pound and now gradually climbing back to around 7c a pound. We understand that and we understand the five cyclones that have gone through the superwet belt and we have responded to that by inviting the sugar industry to put forward their package—their ideas. We said to them, `You put forward a package that has the support of your total industry.' It has taken them a couple of months to get that package together. They will have a very early response as to what this government is going to do.
We have supported a number of initiatives that the sugar industry has required. In fact, I do not believe there is anything the sugar industry has asked of us that we have not responded to positively. When I opened the conference three weeks ago, I announced there would be no 43c excise on ethanol. That was greeted with great acclamation. The government has made it a policy position that there would be no ethanol excise and that has shown the way forward for a positive, new industry based on sugar. We have supported the bagasse cogeneration. We have put a very substantial package into that, to plough electricity back into the grid from the by-product, bagasse, burnt off in their furnaces. There probably would not be a week go by when I would not speak to this industry once or twice a week, either the Australian Cane Farmers or the Australian Canegrowers. I cannot recall anything that we have not responded to as a government. When they wanted the single desk legislation placed, it was this government that stopped the native title debate to squeeze through an amendment on the Trade Practices Act that would put the single desk selling in place in the best way possible under legislation.
—Until national competition policy reviews it.
—The national competition policy cannot review it at all, because it is in legislation put into this parliament, put in by this government, rock solid and cemented in. One desk selling of the sugar industry is a fact of life and it will never be taken away unless this government is rolled. We had the support of the Labor Party and the Democrats. Senator Woodley, I appeal to you. I know what you are doing. You are playing base, crude politics. You are going to some of the industry, but not the leaders of the industry, the people that are elected to represent their industry. I did not see you at the conference. You were not even there. I take it that you would have got an invitation, but you were not there. You do not want to deal with the elected leaders. You want to find some people that are hurt and downtrodden and you want to take them back into the fifties. Senator Woodley, you cannot do it. Ninety per cent of the sugar crop of Australia is exported. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Sugar Industry</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-07,"—I am just amazed at that contribution from Senator Boswell. About three-quarters of it was a personal attack on Senator Woodley and by implication an attack upon all the other members of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. On a number of occasions, often at the suggestion of members of the government, the Senate committee has conducted inquiries into a range of agricultural industries, including this industry, and brought down unanimous reports in just about all cases. But Senator Boswell thinks that is a waste of taxpayers' money. He probably thinks the report we brought down the other day on the salmon industry was a waste of taxpayers' money, even though members of both coalition parties took a very active interest in that inquiry, which travelled around various parts of Australia.  
Senator Boswell also tried to make out that this was a problem that really only arose a couple of weeks ago. He said that it has only been in the last three or four weeks that the issue of the crisis in the sugar industry really came before the government. I do not know where Senator Boswell has been. If, as he said, not a week goes by when he does not talk to the industry once or twice, then he must have heard about the concerns within the sugar industry, about the parlous state of their industry because of low world prices. This is not something that has been hidden in the back pages. You only have to pick up the Land newspaper or get onto the net sites or even contact the Parliamentary Library here and you will get reams and reams of paper. Senator Boswell can keep in touch with what is happening in the industry whilst he is sitting in this chamber, let alone go and talk to them.
This problem has been around for a couple of years. At the ABARE Outlook conference earlier this year, ABARE predicted a substantial further drop in world sugar prices: world sugar prices for the year 1999-2000 would end up being about 16 per cent lower than they were last year. Further, as the industry associations themselves have been saying for some time, historically low world prices, record production levels over a number of years and the highly regulated industries in the EU and America have brought about huge production levels, far exceeding consumption. Our industry has been suffering for some time as a result. It has not just come to light because of the situation at the South Johnstone mill. The situation at the South Johnstone mill is the end result of a problem that has been around for at least a couple of years. 
The minister, Mr Truss, and other members of the government have been aware of this. They have visited these areas, like other members of parliament, and they have been informed of the problem. An added problem in Queensland—on top of the other ones I have mentioned—has been the huge rainfall and the floods and the devastating cyclone, particularly Cyclone Rona. This industry has copped everything. Even an industry as efficient as the sugar industry is going to have trouble coping when it gets hit with four or five problems such as the ones I have identified. 
Mr Truss, the minister, visited the Burdekin region, I am advised, in August of last year. An article in the local newspaper, the Ayr Advocate, on 25 August described his visit as `a lacklustre visit'. The farmers up there did not get any comfort from Mr Truss's visit at that time. His response to requests from the industry for assistance was, in the words of the newspaper article, `You are on your own.' Parliamentary secretary for agriculture, Senator Judith Troeth, told the sugar industry on 6 September last year that the solution to its problems lay in further tightening its belt. She said about the sugar industry: `It has to find ways of reducing on-farm costs.' This statement was made to an industry which is widely acknowledged as being one of the most efficient in the world. It has not had the levels of protection that exist in the EU and in the US. The PM is on the record as saying that he sympathises with the plight of the sugar industry and the farmers but that it was really all Bill Clinton's fault or the WTO's fault because they did not get any resolution in Seattle. He was hoping things would get better, maybe after the next US presidential elections. 
—What about the next Australian election? 
—I have no doubt that things will get better for all Australia after the next federal election. In the last few weeks the situation at South Johnstone mill has reached a critical point. The government has been forced to act. Minister Truss announced on 2 June a loan package to assist that mill. The government is talking to the industry about a broader and longer lasting package, we understand. But once again it has been far too late.  
This is a government that has not been proactive when it needed to be. We saw that in the dairying industry. Minister Truss sat on his hands for months and months. The same attitude was adopted that Senator Boswell has just acknowledged here today. The government's attitude to the industry is `If you get into trouble and it is not your fault, if your industry gets hit with world economic problems and cyclones and all these things, you have to develop a plan and then bring it to us.' The attitude of this government is that it will sit here and wait until the industry develops the plan. God knows, they have enough to do to survive. That is what happened in the dairying industry. 
There is nothing about this government, and particularly this minister, that would give any confidence to agricultural industries that the government will take notice of the advice they get from their department, or from ABARE, a specialist body, or that the government is maybe going start to think ahead, to think, `Maybe this industry is going to need some assistance, maybe this industry is going to need a plan to help it restructure and survive.' No—it sits back and waits, unlike the previous Labor government. As a government we developed plans for industry in consultation and cooperation with industry: the Kerin plan, the Crean plan, and the Button plan for the motor vehicle industry. 
We did not sit back and just wait till industry finally came crawling through the door on their knees, saying: `Please help us.' We did not say, `You go away and develop a plan, bring it back to us and we will think about whether or not we can support it.' And if they do happen to support it, what will happen? This government will claim the credit for it. They claimed the credit for the dairying industry restructure plan, even though it was never their idea and it is being funded ultimately by taxpayers and by the industry itself. So we can criticise this government. They are far too tardy. They have come to this issue, again, far too late. 
I want to make another point: whilst this proposal is certainly welcome for the South Johnstone mill, there are other mills in danger of closing and there are workers at those mills who are in danger of losing their jobs. We should not be focusing purely on the situation in terms of the farmers. For instance, the workers at the South Johnstone mill have for a number of months been working reduced hours by agreement between the union and the management to help reduce some of the costs of that mill in order to help it to survive. They have been aware of the problem and they have been accepting reduced working hours and, therefore, lower take-home pay in order to help the mill. It is about time Minister Truss started to recognise that he has a responsibility as a minister to think forward, not backwards, to not just be reactive but to start to get proactive in dealing with some of the very important issues and some of the problems that exist within his portfolio, particularly in the sugar industry.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Sugar Industry</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-07,"—In speaking in this debate, perhaps I should first of all declare an interest, as I am required to do. I am the only senator in this chamber who has a direct interest in the sugar industry. That is because my biggest investment, like the biggest investment of most Australians, is my residence in the town of Ayr, in the very successful sugar growing district of the Lower Burdekin, Ayr, Home Hill and Giru. These cyclical difficulties that the sugar industry has been facing impact not only on home owners like me—the value of my house falls quite considerably when sugar prices are low—but also on small businesses in areas that rely on sugar for their livelihood. Whilst we, in this debate, talk about the sugar industry as such, there is a wider difficulty for all those people who rely on the sugar industry right up the coast of Queensland and the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales.
The government recognises that if the sugar industry were to be in real difficulty and to hypothetically fold—I am sure that will not happen—it is not only the farmers who will suffer but all the townspeople and all the people who have businesses in those areas and all the people who work in the mills or who work in councils or who work in other businesses that rely on the sugar industry. The government has been very concerned about that over the years. I have to say that Minister Truss has done a very good job in managing, in negotiating and in working with the sugar industry. Whilst I appreciate that Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley from their homes in the capital cities—Senator Forshaw in Sydney and Senator Woodley in Brisbane—mean well, it is obvious from their contributions to this debate that they really have no idea of the sugar industry or how it operates. 
The sugar industry has over a long period of time been one of the better organised rural industries, and it has a very professional, aggressive—I say `aggressive' in a positive way—and forward-looking group of industry leaders right across the state of Queensland, which is the state I know best. These people do not get up like Senator Woodley or Senator Forshaw and wave their hands and promise the world when they know they cannot deliver it. They sit down and rationally go through the difficulties. They understand that the problems in the sugar industry at this time are to do with world prices being at a very low level. But they know, as I know, and as people who are involved in the industry know, that that is a cyclical problem. You will have times when the sugar industry is very buoyant; you will have times when it is very low. We happened to be, at the present time, at one of those very low points with world prices on the overseas market.
There are additional difficulties at this time, particularly north of Townsville in the Ingham, Herbert River, Tully and Babinda area where exacerbating the very low world prices are four years of absolutely unseasonal rainfall. Senator Forshaw would not understand, but the way the rain has fallen at the wrong time of year and very heavily for four years in a row has meant that the cane has become waterlogged. Rain has come at the wrong time and when the sugar should be generated within the cane stick, it is not being generated because of the rain. The result of this is that the sugar content of cane is much lower in those areas particularly than it has been elsewhere. So there are real problems, and that is one of the difficulties that has happened with the mill at Innisfail. That section of the industry is in very great difficulties. There has been some restructuring in recent times. A lot of farmers in that Innisfail-Tully area have gone on to bananas and other crops, which they have found consistently more profitable than sugar. But there is still a huge infrastructure in sugar, and the towns, businesses and people's livelihoods that need to be supported.
That is why this government has contributed quite a substantial amount of money over the period in support of the sugar industry. We have provided some $33 million in recent times for much needed support for the industry. Money has been provided for a variety of projects, including research, infrastructure, development and renewable energy. A package of about $13½ million dollars is being spent by the federal government over four years for research into increasing the sugar content levels of cane and related priority research. That is very important to the issue I was talking about. I could spend most of my speech going through and relating the financial assistance the government has given in any number of ways to the industry, but I want to go on to other issues—that is, to look sensibly at where we are going.
I heard bits and pieces of Senator Woodley's speech, and I agree with Senator Boswell that Senator Woodley picks up some people who have a particular concern. They are not usually sugar industry leaders. As I said, the leaders in every town are a very professional, forward-looking group of people who sit down with governments and understand that no government ever is going to come along and offer them buckets of money in subsidy. The federal government—including me, my Liberal colleague who represents the northern electorate of Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, Peter Lindsay, Bob Katter and De-Anne Kelly—have done some work. There is a lot of government commitment going into finding the right results and working cooperatively with the sugar industry leaders, not listening to those who really seek the Pauline Hanson response, which is, of course, no response at all. Regrettably, Senator Woodley has fallen into that trap and is, I would suggest, being perhaps—I will not say `manipulated'—used by some people not in the best interests of the long-term viability of the sugar industry. 
The government is working with the sugar industry leaders, cane growers and the Australian Cane Farmers Association to come up with some sort of package that will tide the industry over. Senator Forshaw derided the government for working with the industry. Let me tell Senator Forshaw this: it is far better having the industry work these things out than for he public servants in Canberra to do so. The industry will work through this much better than the public servants in Canberra. You were deriding this government for relying on the industry to come forward with an approach to the industry. We continue to work regularly with the industry, because we are there and we interact with Warren Entsch, Bob Katter, Peter Lindsay, De-Anne Kelly, Warren Truss—from a sugar electorate—Mr Neville and the members in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales. As a government we are currently working with the industry. We said to them, `Times move on. Much as we would like to go back to the days when a farm with a couple of thousand tonne peak could make a fair living out of the sugar industry, those days are gone. You now have to look at broadacre farms with 10,000, 20,000, even 100,000 tonne of cane as their contribution to the mill.' That is the way the industry has to go, and that is understood—you cannot move backwards. Regrettably, that is not going to be in the best interests of every single person. But the industry has this realism. They know that they have to work sensibly towards a resolution. They are working with the government. They are looking at the best way to restructure. We as a government and the minister, Mr Truss, will work very cooperatively with them to make sure that we do get the very best result possible for the sugar industry in Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Sugar Industry</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-07,"—I am very pleased to follow the minister, Senator Macdonald, particularly given the comments that he made because I wanted to deal with some of the very matter that he raised. He referred to some of the government's programs—the millions of dollars that the government is allegedly laying out to assist the sugar industry—and the solutions that this government has for the sugar industry. The last round of estimates was most revealing as to how the government generally and the minister for agriculture, in particular, go about their business. Firstly, in last year's budget the government set itself a range of performance targets, and those targets were set for programs designed to assist the sugar industry. But when I sought advice from the department as to exactly what those targets were for 1999-2000 and how the government performed against those targets, the answers I received were certainly not illuminating. To me, they were alarming, and I am sure that they would have alarmed cane growers and processors. For example, as you will see from the Hansard of Monday, 22 May, on page 67 of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, I asked:
On page 53 of last year's PBS a number of performance targets were set for the Sugar Industry Program and the Sugar Industry Assistance Package.
Mr Wonder said:
This was from the 1999-2000 PPS?
I said:
Yes. The performance indicator for the package was given as `a more competitive cost structure and increased productivity'. Firstly, what baseline data was to be used to measure the performance indicator?
I essentially put to Dr Samson, who was answering the questions, that the baseline data may be found in the annual reports, and Dr Samson said, `I would expect so.' He did not know. I then said:
Dr Samson, when you say `I would expect so', does that mean that the statement in the PBS last year did not actually have in mind a performance indicator for the package?
Mr Roseby then jumped in to try to protect his fellow public servant, and said:
The programs had performance objectives. At that stage we probably did not have baseline data. 
He later said:
It is an interesting question as to how you would say to what extent, in terms of baseline data, this industry has improved. We do not have figures to say that their cost structures have come down at this stage, because a lot of these projects are under way, but it would be certainly in that area, where you are looking at the efficiency of the handling and the processing operations, which we would expect to derive from the expenditure. 
I said:
That is all reasonable as far as it goes. The point that, I guess, my questions lead to is: if you have, say, as a performance indicator `a more competitive cost structure', what is it more than? You must have a baseline or it is a meaningless performance indicator, is it not?
Mr Roseby answered:
At the initial stages we did not have a set of data which was basically set out as baseline data saying, `Here is a cost structure they are all working from.' 
Later I asked:
There is the sugar industry program and the sugar industry assistance package, which I was referring to.
And Dr Samson said:
Correct. The sugar industry assistance package is the one that is administered through the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The sugar industry improvement program is the one that has a series of projects in Queensland, New South Wales and WA. 
Later he said:
With the sugar industry improvement program, as you are aware, there is a number of projects. I think it is fair to say some of them have been slower to take off than anticipated. The thinking at the moment is we would be looking to evaluate the entire program probably in the 2001-02 year. 
Later that day I asked:
If I asked you the same questions—I think I have already asked these about the sugar industry improvement program and the sugar industry assistance package ... would the answer in relation to the baseline data that you would use to judge those achievements be the same as the answers you have already given me?
The answer was, `Yes, Senator.' In other words, there is no baseline data—no means of judging the performance of the measures that the government say that they are funding. The government have said, `We're giving you some money to do something. We have no idea what baseline we are working from. We are going to set these grandiose targets in our budgets for achievement, but you will have no way of measuring what we achieve. We do not really intend for you to be able to measure those achievements.'
I also pursued the fact that, while the conditions confronting this important industry continued to deteriorate, the government just plodded on. They did not review the programs they had in place. They did not say, `We are spending millions of dollars here, but the industry continues to slide so perhaps we should have another look at where and how this money is being used and whether there should be an increase in funding to help sugar growers.' There was a budget only a matter of weeks ago but, despite it being well known to everyone that the sugar industry is in crisis, nothing new emerged in that process. Based on the evidence to the estimates committee, the minister did not even try to get more assistance for the industry through the budget process, and that has been revealed again in the estimates Hansard. The department revealed that there was no work done on this industry in the lead-up to the budget, but now the industry is being asked to come up with a plan. There is no plan for this industry emanating from the government.
There has been no cooperative approach by this minister and his department with the sugar industry to deal with these problems. Like the dairy industry, the sugar growers have to come up with their own plan, and only then will the government start to look at the problems of the industry and see if there is a solution which is available to the government. If there is any need to confirm what the government knew and where the government was, one only needs to look at page 70 of the Hansard of 22 May 2000. Mr Roseby, a very senior officer of the department, said:
...we know, with poor weather in combination with a very difficult period of low world prices. That is a problem which is emerging now. We know there is a problem in that area, and we have some idea of what the problem is.
Some idea! This is after the budget. He continued:
Governments generally encourage industry to take initiatives and come forward with proposals; that is now under way. We are aware that that industry is putting together a proposal for the government and we await that proposal. 
As Senator Forshaw said, there is nothing proactive about this minister or his party. It is hardly surprising that the National Party is becoming irrelevant in this country. There are four representatives of the National Party in this place, and three have their offices in the capital cities of their respective states and territories. I am not sure where Senator Sandy Macdonald will place his office—to his credit, in the past he did have his office in regional Australia, and I expect that he will. One cannot say the same for Senator Boswell, Senator McGauran or Senator Tambling. Their offices are all in the capital cities—Senator McGauran's is in Collins Street, Melbourne; Senator Boswell's is in Eagle Place, Brisbane; and Senator Tambling's is on the Esplanade, Darwin.
Senator Boswell had the nerve to criticise the Senate committee for going to rural and regional Australia—for taking the parliament to the bush so that they could have a say. Senator Boswell had the gall to criticise Senator Woodley for spending the taxpayers' money—for taking the parliament to the people. I am proud that I was part of those exercises. They have done a lot of good. They have given a lot of people in rural and regional Australia the opportunity to see their senators. They certainly would not see their National Party senators if we did not take them there through the committee process, because three out of the four of them have their offices in the metropolitan areas of Australia. The National Party, the former Country Party—I am glad they changed the name because the ACCC would have had to take them on for misleading and deceptive conduct—pretend that they still have a connection with rural and regional Australia, but you only have to look where the offices of three out of four of their senators are to know that where they really want to be is the big city. They want to get out of the bush, they want to line up for the perks of office, and they really do not look after the constituency that they pretend is theirs.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
This is our Review of Auditor-General's Reports for the first quarter of 1999-2000.
Madam President, the Committee held a public hearing in December last year to discuss these issues with relevant Commonwealth agencies. I will briefly discuss each issue in turn.
The audit report on the use of financial information in management reports found that there was substantial scope for improvement.
The Committee's review focuses on the issues of the costing of outputs, the need for cultural change within agencies and the time frame for implementation. The report makes two recommendations in this area, each of which is designed to confer a greater degree of responsibility on managers, particularly those at senior levels. 
The Committee takes the view that the most effective way to ensure the success of the new framework is to clearly define the responsibilities of managers, provide the necessary support, and then hold those managers accountable for implementation. Once accountability mechanisms are established, managers will have a strong incentive to implement the new framework successfully.
The audit report on control structures found that an important pre-condition for the effective use of financial information is reliable and timely information. The audit report found there was considerable scope for improvements in this area.
It was brought to the Committee's attention that control structures were lacking in the areas of information technology, asset management, accounting systems, and financial management information systems. The report makes a recommendation, regarding information technology systems, which is designed to prevent unauthorised access to certain information.
The Committee believes it is necessary for management in each agency to demonstrate its commitment to establishing effective control structures. However, before this can be undertaken, I urge agency heads to have a fully operational financial system in place as soon as possible. This will in turn, provide management with relevant and accurate information in a timely manner.
May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee those people who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review hearing.
I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated much time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports. As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiry, Dr Margot Kerley, the Committee secretary, Ms Jennifer Hughson, Ms Rose Verspaandonk, Ms Rebecca Perkin and Ms Maria Pappas.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-06-07,"—I rise to speak on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000. This bill is to give effect to the government's undertaking to retain responsibility for the payment of general assistance to local government and to maintain the level of such assistance in real, per capita terms. This is despite an attempt by the government in its initial package to abolish financial assistance grants to local government directly from the Commonwealth and to essentially hand over responsibility for providing that finance to the states. Labor successfully moved an amendment in the Senate ensuring that direct Commonwealth financial assistance for local governments would continue. This was the desired outcome for the local councils throughout Australia.
This legislation also abolishes the link between financial assistance grants to local government and financial assistance grants to the states. The previous arrangement was that local government grants were directly connected to the financial assistance grants to the states. Given that financial assistance grants to the states will cease to occur as a result of the introduction of the GST, this arrangement can no longer function. Although I am pleased that we will continue to see local government receive direct payments from the federal government, it is concerning to say the least that this legislation does nothing—and I say that again: this legislation does nothing—to restore the $15 million that the government cut from federal assistance to local government in the 1997-98 period. There is also no provision made for any real growth in payments to be made to local governments. You only have to be out and about in local government to understand the full impact of that. It is unfortunate that this issue was not addressed in this legislation. It is unfortunate but not surprising, given the government's record on providing for local government.
Local government is one of the biggest service providers in this country, as we well know. Councils, together, spend over $10 billion each year providing a broad range of infrastructure, economic and community services. Local councils employ some 140,000 people. Despite this enormous contribution to our community, the federal government has failed to give councils the vital information they need about how they will be affected by the GST and about adequate compensation. Councils are still wondering if the information they have been given is conclusive or if it will change again prior to 1 July, depending on the government's whim.
On the wider issue of the government's treatment of local councils, the complete disregard for the strain the GST implementation is putting on local councils is reflective of their attitude towards local government generally. Since coming to office in 1996, the government have treated local councils with nothing short of contempt. Not only have they lumped local governments with a GST, they gave them six months of confusion and mayhem where local councils were left scratching their heads as to what was and what was not GST exempt and how the GST was to be implemented. The government failed to give councils the vital information they needed about how they would be affected by the GST. The former President of the Local Government Association of Queensland, Tom Pyne, spoke for most local councils earlier this year when he made the following comment: 
How is local government to deal with the GST if the federal government is still working things out?...The delays have meant councils' decision-making processes have been halted. This means councils are unable to put in place future pricing strategies, begin the budget process, or implement the software a new system requires. The federal government runs a very real risk that the GST will collapse even before it starts.
Finally, at the end of January 2000, the government released a draft determination of exempt taxes, fees and charges. This draft lists those taxes, fees and charges levied by state and local governments that are to be GST exempt. All council services not listed in the draft are subject to the GST, as I understand it. This has left councils with something in the order of only four months to finalise their planning and procedures to ensure they will be GST compliant by 1 July 2000. Not only were councils given very little time to plan for the introduction of the GST, they now face exorbitant costs for the implementation process. The Local Government Association of Queensland—the LGAQ—has estimated a total state bill in the order of $7 million to implement the GST. However, in response, the federal government has agreed to allocate only $535,000 to Queensland councils for the GST implementation assistance.
The shortfall between the government's funding for implementation costs and estimated costs by the LGAQ is significant and concerning to say the least. The government knew a long time ago about the level of complexity and the strains that would be placed on local government with the increasing burden of the GST. Yet they still chose to waste $410 million on the Unchain My Heart propaganda campaign rather than adequately compensate local councils for their implementation costs. The $410 million would have gone a long way towards compensating local councils for the increased costs of GST compliance—the software, staff training and costs involved with GST implementation. Local councils do not need emotive, politically biased, wasteful propaganda campaigns. They need genuine compensation that will cover their costs in complying with this complex, confusing tax.
Rural Queensland councils in particular are going to feel the brunt of this government's broken promise on the reduction in fuel costs. The government's election promise that the costs of petrol would not rise under the GST has already been thrown into doubt, with the Treasurer admitting that this promise has limits. This is despite the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, indicating that councils would benefit from a reduction in fuel costs and the removal of wholesale sales tax. This government went to the last election promising that petrol would not increase under the GST, as the government would reduce the excise on petrol by the amount equivalent to a 10 per cent increase. However, this was based, as I understand it, on a 77c per litre price. Since then, petrol prices in some cities have threatened to reach the $1 a litre mark and have been higher in many rural areas. The government now concedes that there are limits to its election promise and has said that in many areas it will be unable to ensure that petrol prices do not increase with the introduction of the GST. Yet again, the areas that will be primarily affected are rural and regional areas. 
The government has since considered a regionally based fuel rebate, in an acknowledgment that in the current environment it cannot deliver on its promise. Local councils were right to be suspicious of this government's promise that councils would benefit from the implementation of the GST. The Australian Local Government Association's comments to the Senate inquiry last year in relation to the introduction of the GST paint a picture of exactly what local councils think of the GST. It is a long quote but I think it summarises quite well the position that local councils find themselves in. They said:
The primary concern of Local Government is that aspects of the Government's tax reform proposals will impact negatively the provision of adequate and equitable services to local communities throughout Australia—
—I will take that interjection, Senator McGauran. You might know, from your town address, but it might be worth listening. They continued: 
·	The removal of a direct contribution by the Commonwealth to national standards of local services and the real risk of unfavourable treatment of Local Government at the hands of the States;
·	Lack of attention to future adequacy of Local Government means to meet increased demand and need for local services;
·	Inappropriate taxation of regulatory services and those provided solely for their community benefit;
·	Costs of administration compliance.
That was an extract from the Australian Local Government Association's submission to the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System.
The minister has claimed on numerous occasions in the Senate and in meetings with councils around the country that local government would do well out of the tax package and that local government is very happy with the tax package. The government claims that councils will benefit from substantial cost reductions following the introduction of the GST. However, no concrete studies have been undertaken by the government to substantiate this claim. The quantum of any perceived savings is unclear and would obviously vary considerably, particularly depending on the size and location of the council in question. 
The amount of GST compensation given to Queensland councils is hopelessly inadequate, given the cost and complexity of the GST implementation program. As a Queensland Labor senator, I am extremely concerned about the burden that GST implementation is placing on councils throughout Queensland, and I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the enormous costs some Queensland councils are having to endure prior to the start of the GST. And it is not only the larger councils in the urban areas. There are a couple of examples that I wish to mention. The Brisbane City Council, being the largest municipality in Australia, is facing an extraordinary burden with the GST. The Brisbane City Council will be facing a bill—
—Have you asked about yours in your local council? The Brisbane City Council will be facing a bill of $25 million in the first year and $15 million every year thereafter. This includes an initial $10 million in set-up costs and $200,000 annually to maintain those systems. It is expected that the council's own GST bill will come to $14.8 million per annum. The number of staff that the council has employed to look at the impact and implementation of the GST has risen to 35, as I understand it. This is an enormous outlay, for which this federal government has provided very little compensation.
Similarly, the Gold Coast City Council has a GST implementation budget of $2.1 million and has devoted 23 full-time staff to the task of putting in place the appropriate GST systems and procedures, as I understand it. The council has chosen to raise the cost of services which are subject to a GST rather than incorporate the GST into a general rates increase. Unfortunately, those valuable services provided by the Gold Coast City Council will have to cost more now to avoid losing the services altogether. This situation is faced by all local councils as they worry about unknown factors eating into their bottom lines, including compliance costs involved in administering the new tax system and a potential decrease in community support for local councils and their services in the face of increased charges with the 10 per cent GST.
The Diamantina Shire Council has only eight full-time staff—it is a small council—dealing with the administration of the council as a whole. Due to cost restraints, the mammoth task of administering the GST will have to be done internally, among the already overworked staff. Although a lot of rural councils do not have a specific budget for GST implementation, they are extremely concerned about the effect of the GST on other budget line items. For example, the Tambo Shire Council is expecting its budget for office maintenance, which is currently about $26,000, to increase by $5,000 for GST related software alone. This is about a 20 per cent increase for this line item. Again, the increased burden on council services of administering the GST will be worn by the existing council administration employees. 
These compliance problems are just the start of the pain which local councils are going to have to endure from 1 July 2000. Councils will have to include a 10 per cent GST in the price of council services. Many of these services are community services that are not provided, or not likely to be provided, by private operators. Councils are therefore left with the dilemma of whether to increase these fees and charges by 10 per cent—and risk making them unavailable to those who most need them—or to absorb this cost by increasing rates. We do not hear you now, Senator McGauran. This is despite the coalition's promise during the 1998 election campaign that non-commercial activities of councils for which a nominal charge is applied would not be subject to the GST. This was in line with the community service, non-profit nature of these activities, which has seen the bulk of charitable organisations also exempted from the GST. It then became clear that the government would define all activities of local government for which a nominal fee is charged as commercial, even though these activities are community service obligations. The result of this government's habit of making and breaking promises is a confused and suspicious situation and makes the local government sector worry even more.
Councils provide many local community services at low cost and often in situations where the services would not otherwise be provided by a private operator. These services can be provided at low cost because they are subsidised by rates. In many remote areas, the swimming pool is often run by the council as a non-profit activity, as well as other services such as library services, sporting and recreational facilities and essential community services for the elderly. It is extraordinary that the government would define all activities of local government for which a nominal fee or charge is levied as commercial, even though these activities are often community service obligations heavily subsidised by rates and not attractive to the private sector. A GST on these services is unfair and inequitable and is further proof that the GST will hit hardest those who are least able to afford it. A further headache for local councils is the unfair distinction being made between activities which have been contracted out and those which councils still undertake themselves. Some local councils have chosen to contract out activities, including some regulatory activities such as building inspections. Under the government's determination of GST exemptions, activities provided by the private sector will attract the GST. However, the same activities provided directly by the council will not be subject to the GST.
Rural councils are going to suffer the most under this GST. Again, this is not surprising given this government's pitiful record on providing assistance to rural and regional Australia. The National Party and, in particular, the National Party senator from Queensland should be ashamed of their record on regional, rural and remote Australia. The Nationals are now indistinguishable from the Liberals. Federal National MPs have supported every anti-farmer, anti-country town and anti-regional development measure introduced by their citycentric coalition partners. The big end of town Liberals have won out again. The federal Nationals have voted to sell off Telstra, voted for the GST, stood silently while their government withdrew services and jobs from country towns, allowed vital infrastructure to run down, cut funding for roads, tried to con farmers that the impact of the GST would be offset by a reduction in transport costs, and slashed over $200 million from the popular AAA package and tried to dress the fact up as a funding increase. They cut $3.9 million from Landcare and supported the deregulation of Australia Post. In recent state and federal elections, country communities have turned to Labor in increasing numbers. They demand parliamentary representatives who listen and respond to their everyday concerns in practical ways. Labor has a proud tradition of standing up for rural concerns and working well with rural councils to improve the services available to their constituencies.
The government needs to do some serious rethinking on its approach to rural and regional Australia. What is needed are some effective targeted programs that the government is committed to and a genuine attempt to provide assistance to rural councils in a way that will actually produce results. In the rural and regional areas which this government has ignored over the past four years, as usual it has been the local councils which have provided the community services necessary for these towns to survive. Yet it is these very community services which are now going to be slugged with a GST. It is clear that local governments will be struggling to meet the requirements of the GST in terms of both implementation costs and subsequent costs, threatening community services. Local government is too important to be left to struggle to survive. This level of government is closest to the community and has an important and integral role to play in the delivery of services to local communities and in allocating priorities in the delivery of those services. The federal government should clearly recognise this and provide adequate resources to ensure that local councils can properly fulfil their role in council and local community development.  
It is worth mentioning two other matters that come to mind. The RTCs, or rural transaction centres, are an interesting initiative, one that this government has said will provide significant benefits. Senator Macdonald has sung their praises for some time. There is only a handful in Queensland and I want—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-07,"—If I can finish the words for Senator Ludwig, not only have I praised rural transaction centres but the Labor leader, Mr Beazley, has also praised them. So I guess, like the GST, it is a bipartisan approach to life: we all agree on the GST and we all agree on rural transaction centres.
Opposition senator—What about post offices?
—Our policy on post offices is different, Senator; you are quite right.
—You close them.
—Under your regime 277 post offices were closed across Australia, many in rural and regional Australia; under our government they have been maintained. I thank those senators who have made a sensible contribution to this debate. In particular, I note Senator Greig's contribution—parts of which, with respect, were difficult to follow. But certainly in some other parts Senator Greig was right on. He is, of course, a former member of a local government council. He said that as he travelled around councils he found that they had no major concerns. No major concerns have been raised about the GST or its impact on councils. He is only agreeing with the Labor Treasurer for New South Wales, who has said it is good news for councils. So we have agreement across the board—the ACCC, the Labor Treasurer for New South Wales, Senator Greig and the councils that Senator Greig has gone out to see. I do not want to dwell on the Democrats approach to this, but I could say to you, Senator Mackay, `Please go out and talk rationally with councils. Don't try to raise political points and to play petty politics. Go out and talk to them and you will find, as Senator Greig has done, that, while some of them have some problems with implementation, by and large they understand the benefits.'
In the first part of her contribution, Senator Mackay set out what the bill before us is about. Its purpose is outlined in the second reading speech, which I have tabled, and I will not repeat it. Suffice it to say that the amendment allows for local government financial assistance grants to be maintained on a real per capita basis as we have promised. It also contains provisions for the unlikely event that councils for some constitutional reason say that they do not have to pay the GST. In that event, if they happen to be right, the relevant state or territory would be required to retain the same amount from their grants—the impact of that being that even if councils are inclined to do it, they will not. But I know most councils around Australia—they are run by responsible people, and I am sure that they will abide by the law.
I regret that I was not able to sit through the whole of the contributions on this debate. However, some points were made that require a response. I am not going to respond to those speakers who made the vicious, personal attacks on me that have become typical of some of the Labor Party senators. I am a big boy; I can take it. But they always do this when I am not here. In question time, when they have an Australia-wide audience, not once do I get a question from anybody on the Labor side. We would welcome some contribution to the debate. Perhaps Senator Mackay lacks the confidence to do it—I am not sure what it is. But not since 19 October last century did Labor ask a question on rural and regional Australia or on local government. That shows the Labor Party's involvement and interest in this issue. 
Some comment was made about the cutback of some funds by this government when it came into power. The reason for that, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well know, is that Mr Beazley, as finance minister, left us a $10.8 billion black hole, which had to be met. As a result of his black hole and his government's mismanagement of the economy, councils were paying huge amounts of interest on loans. I was on a council immediately before I came into this place, and we were paying about 14 or 15 per cent on our loans because the national economy was in such a rotten state because of Mr Beazley's leadership. As a result of our government's good management of the economy, those same councils are now paying about six or seven per cent. In many public speeches, I have been through the real savings to councils that that represents—of far more value than a cutback to meet Mr Beazley's black hole. Our financial management has meant that councils pay less, and it has more than compensated for the cutback we had to make to get councils—as we did with state governments—to contribute to Mr Beazley's black hole.
Senator Mackay also spoke about the ANTS package generally, which has real savings for councils. Again, I quote not only Senator Greig, not only the Labor Treasurer of New South Wales, not only the ACCC, not only the Victorian government's Arthur Andersen report into Victorian councils, but councils right across the nation, who recognise that the ANTS package is really good news for local government. Admittedly, there are some start-up costs, but they are more than overcome by the annual savings that councils will make.
Senator Mackay made some mention of regional Australia—I think she was saying that I never went there. I will give you my itinerary, Senator Mackay; I very rarely get home. In fact, I do not think even my cat recognises me now, because I am always out going around rural and regional Australia and talking to rural and regional Australians. Neither Senator Mackay nor Mr Ferguson can help it if they live in a capital city.
—I live in Tasmania, you idiot!
—I thought you lived in Hobart. That is not Tasmania, obviously! But that is okay. There is nothing wrong with that; we cannot help where we live. But, Senator, it is a little bit rich for you to start lecturing me about rural and regional Australia.
From the bits and pieces I heard of the speeches, I understand I was being lectured about not having an empathy with local government and that they were talking about those of us who had been councillors. This is a good game we can play: `We've got this many and you've got that many.' If only you had confined it! Senator Mackay, on our side in the Senate we have my colleague Senator Calvert, a very distinguished warden—and for those of you who are not from Tasmania, that means mayor—of the Clarence Municipal Council for many years, from 1976 to 1988. He was on the council and was warden from 1983 to 1987. His record is very distinguished, and if I ever need any advice on local government Senator Calvert is always willing to give it, because he knows what it is all about. Senator Eggleston was mayor of the town of Port Hedland for three years, from 1993 to 1996, and was on the council from 1988 to 1996. My colleague Senator Heffernan was president of the Junee council during the periods 1989-90 and 1991-93 and was on the council for some 15 years. I have been on the Burdekin Shire Council for 13 years. Senator McGauran was on a council for three years, and Senator Tambling was on a council for a number of years. 
I give credit where credit is due. There are some Labor senators who have been on councils. Senator McLucas was on the Cairns City Council for four years and that great expert on rural and regional matters, Senator Conroy, was on the Footscray City Council for some period of time. Senator Greig, as I mentioned, has been on a council and Senator Allison from the Democrats was on the Port Melbourne Council for a couple of years in the early 1990s. Not much turns on that, but on this side of the Senate there are people who understand local government. That is why the package is so good for local government—because people on this side of the chamber made a contribution to the development of the tax package.
I heard Senator Mackay say something that is going to go down well in regional Australia. Rest assured, Senator Mackay, that I shall tell people in regional Australia. I will get the exact quote from Hansard, but I heard you say that regions are urban and urban is regions. I am sure people where I go out in rural and regional Australia will be delighted to know that your definition of regional—
—I didn't say that.
—Be careful. The Hansard never lies. I actually wrote this down. I was listening to you then.
—Why didn't you come into the chamber?
—Because I was meeting with a high-level group of bankers, working out how we could provide better banking services to rural and regional Australia. And all day I have been involved in meetings that are positive contributions to government policy. I was not in here defending myself from the vicious, politically personal attacks. Have fun with that. I don't mind that. Go your hardest; I don't worry about it. I am sure the people listening on the broadcast day will shun me as a result of what the Labor Party have said about me, but never mind. It is a pity that, instead of attacking me personally, we did not hear some policy exposition from the ALP.
—I told you about Labor Party policy.
—You told me when you were going to give us your policy. You said it will be after the next election. That is great. `You will find out about the Labor Party's rural and regional policy, Senator Macdonald'—so Senator Mackay told me in estimates—`when I am sitting there,' that is, after the next election. So after the next election they will release their regional affairs policy. It is now the Cook-Mackay approach to policy release: after the next election. That is beaut. We look forward to that.
Senator Crossin raised the interesting issue of horizontal fiscal equalisation—quite a sensible approach. It is a difficult issue. For those of you who are not familiar with it, when the Commonwealth give out the $1.25 billion grants to local government each year, we give them out principally on the basis—if I can put this simply and not technically—of making sure that Australians, no matter where they live, get roughly equitable access to standard municipal services. That is what the financial assistance grants are all about. We proceed under an act of the former government that provides that. As I recall, when it came to the Senate as a bill the coalition supported it. It provides that that $1.25 billion annually goes to the states on a per capita basis. Obviously New South Wales and Victoria get much more than the other states because of the per capita distribution. Once it gets to the state level, it is then distributed from the state base on a horizontal fiscal equalisation basis. That is trying to give a fair share to some of those councils that have lesser rating capacity or greater needs. 
In bringing forward a review of the financial assistance grants and getting the Commonwealth Grants Commission to conduct that review for me, I did approach local government associations across Australia and the various state governments as well. I indicated that the government had decided that it was not appropriate in this review to look at the question of the interstate distributions on a per capita basis. I got responses from a number of states. I suspect it is not appropriate for me to say what ministers say to me in private correspondence. Suffice it to say, Senator Mackay, that you would be surprised at which states actually said, `No, we don't want you to look at that.' I will give you a little tip, though: they were Labor states. I will not say a couple, a few or many because that might give it away, but there were Labor states which said, `Yes, you shouldn't look at that.' Senator Mackay, you might be interested in doing a bit of research on that before you say too much about it, and perhaps you should counsel Senator Crossin.  
I suppose Senator Crossin could easily say, `I wasn't in the parliament back in 1992 when the Labor government looked at this issue,' but I understand that Mr Snowdon in the other place made a big point about this. I think he said he was going to make it his life's work to make sure this happened. Mr Snowdon had 13 years. He was out for three but he had a lot of years when Labor was in power and did not do anything about it; not a thing about it did Mr Snowdon do. It is easy to stand up and talk but, when you were there and had the opportunity to do it, what was the action? Absolutely nothing. I do not think you were here, Senator Mackay, but I was when the Grants Commission came out and said they had looked at this and they thought it should be distributed interstate on an equalisation basis, but there was no data so they recommended against it. I would not say this, of course, but one wonders what the attitude of the government of the day and the relevant ministers might have been. I think the minister at the time was a Victorian, and one wonders what his view on it might have been. So the Labor Party had every opportunity to do it and did absolutely nothing. Senator Mackay, you might counsel Senator Crossin on just what she is going to do.
—So what are you doing?
—Senator, if you have not seen the terms of review I will make them available to you, but I think I have sent them out to everyone who might be interested in them, and I am sure you would have got a copy.
There were a number of anecdotal questions raised. Perhaps issues of South Sydney were raised in the debate. A more scurrilous and dishonest publication I have never seen. The South Sydney Council should be absolutely ashamed of itself for trying to mislead its electors in the way it did. The mayor of that council is quite openly a Labor mayor. He is from the right, so not many of you in this chamber would know him. He is from the Sussex Street mafia, I am told. He stood in Bligh against Clover Moore last—
—Go outside and say that, Ian!
—Say that he is from the Sussex Street mafia? I do not want to get a writ for defamation from the mafia. The mafia would sue me if I said that outside. I do not want to defame the mafia by aligning them to the Sussex Street group. That publication would have to go down as the worst piece of dishonest dissembling that one has ever seen. It is littered with deliberate untruths: `A bottle of water gets the GST at the swimming pool, no GST outside.' Senator Mackay, even you must have cringed at that.
—How would you know? You don't even know.
—Even if there were GST on it, it would be on it whether it was sold inside the pool or outside the pool. There is no difference in the application of the GST depending on who sells it. Of course, bottled water is to be GST free. That is the sort of thing, I regret to say, that the Labor Party is distributing. Even in your worst moments—and your party has been, if I can say it politely, fairly borderline in some of the things it has said about the GST in this chamber and in the other chamber—you have never gone to deliberate lies on how this would impact. I am so disappointed that an elected local government authority in Australia could deliberately be that misleading in its publications.
I can contribute little further to the debate. I understand the other parties have agreed with the base approach of the act to make sure that councils continue to receive their $1¼ billion in grants from the Commonwealth government. I thank the Labor Party and the Democrats for their support for the bill. I notice that Senator Mackay is moving an amendment to the second reading motion, expressing concern that financial assistance grants to local government have been cut in real terms. I have explained that, but I emphasise that what local government have gained out of the government's financial management is much lower interest rates. That will mean substantial dollars to them. We are criticised for attempting to terminate local government funding. That is an issue of a past time. I agree with it. At the last election, our approach was that the states would get their GST money only if they agreed to pay to the local governments what we were paying to them. So we protected and guaranteed local government in putting that onto the states. Unfortunately, we were not able to get that through, but that is all history now. (Time expired)

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-06-07,"—I want to make some comments in relation to the celebrations of World Environment Day and a couple of related issues. In several days time, as the entire nation knows, the Olympic flame will make its way to Uluru. It will begin its journey around the country before the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Sydney on 15 September. It not only marks one of the most important stages of Olympic preparation but also is an element of our celebrations of World Environment Day. This is a day which aims to raise community awareness of environmental issues and their importance, to encourage the community to act responsibly towards the environment and to involve the community in actions that show concern for the environment. There is not much better way for Australia to achieve these aims than to commence the Olympic torch relay in the heart of one of our world heritage listed areas. The United Nations established World Environment Day as an annual event in 1972 and, as a means of promoting global concern for the environment, the General Assembly also created the UN environment program at the same time. 
So each year, on 5 June, nations around the world mark the event, offering the opportunity for communities and governments to consider their approaches to natural surroundings. Communities are encouraged to participate, just as governments are encouraged to use the day to highlight their work on the environment and give consideration to the importance of these issues.
Each year, official World Environment Day events include the presentation of Global 500 Awards, the United Nation's roll of honour for environmental achievement. Previous Australian winners of Global 500 Awards include Greening Australia and Ian Kiernan. Each year, the United Nations selects one nation to host the World Environment Day celebrations. This year, we are proudly that host. This is the first time it has been held in Australia and, indeed, the first time in the Pacific region. This celebration presents Australia with an important opportunity to engage our communities in the acknowledgment of the day and its aims and to acknowledge those who have made significant contributions to caring for the nation's environment and the pursuit of sustainability.
The theme this year is celebrating excellence, innovation and enterprise in the pursuit of a sustainable Australia, the initiative of the Prime Minister's Environment Awards. They were tremendously well received with over 400 nominations considered. The winners from my state included Coffs Harbour City Council for outstanding sustainability achievements in partnership with their local community and Charlie Carp, a very innovative New South Wales firm which turns environmentally harmful introduced European carp into garden fertiliser. 
As the Australian community and the government have celebrated the day, it is disappointing that some people have chosen to criticise rather than acknowledge the contributions of the coalition in this important area. People are very quick to criticise, but it is worth looking at the Liberal Party's track record, in particular in the area of environmental concern, before taking too much notice of empty criticism. Many are pleased, as we know, to jump on the environmental bandwagon, but it was the Liberal Party that prohibited sandmining on Fraser Island and banned whaling in Australian waters. It was the Liberal Party that declared the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and placed the Barrier Reef, Kakadu, Willandra Lakes, Lord Howe Island and south-west Tasmania on the World Heritage List. Many people might not realise that it was 25 years ago that a coalition government established the first Commonwealth environment department. In 1982, it was the Fraser government that established the National Tree Program to reverse tree decline throughout Australia.
Now it is the Howard government that is implementing, through the Natural Heritage Trust, the largest and most comprehensive commitment to action on the environment by any national government in Australia's history. And it would be remiss of me, in discussing our environmental credentials, not to mention the role of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator the Hon. Robert Hill, in that process. He has provided an enormous amount of experience, leadership and stability to those pursuits. I understand he is Australia's longest serving minister for the environment, an achievement that indicates his commitment. 
As I have previously mentioned, the coalition have taken an expansive approach to the environment portfolio, with a view that it is very much a mainstream issue. The $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the almost $1 billion allocated to greenhouse gas reduction programs are the largest environmental funding commitments in Australia's history. The government are supportive of development and wealth creation. We also have an approach which has been to focus on promoting environmental standards that are in line with the commitment to continued growth. We try to combine our objectives for long-term wealth for the benefit of all Australians with environmental protection in partnership with communities, business and other tiers of government.
In the last budget, the government continued to provide significant levels of funding for environmental and natural resource projects around Australia, including an allocation of over $880 million to the Environment and Heritage portfolio. That allocation funds the Australian Greenhouse Office, the National Oceans Office, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—now very well run by former president of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Virginia Chadwick.
—Hear, hear!
—Thank you, Senator Macdonald. It also funds the Australian Heritage Commission. The Natural Heritage Trust has been allocated $361 million for projects over the next year. That continues the work undertaken in programs like Bushcare, Landcare and Coasts and Clean Seas. Greenhouse gas abatement, a key issue, has been allotted $400 million over the four years. Provision has also been made for the development of a product stewardship system for waste oil and, importantly for my state of New South Wales, the preservation of five prominent former Defence sites around Sydney Harbour.
Some are keen to fire barbs in regard to the environment budget. It is worth noting the legacy that was left to the coalition by the former government. Over five million hectares of native vegetation in this country were cleared during the decade between 1983 and 1993. Australia was allowed to take its extraordinary endowment of natural resources for granted. That is not necessarily a trend that you can lay entirely at the feet of any one political party, nor is it a concern that is unique to this country, but it is important to note the rapid change in mindset in regard to the environment that has developed in recent times.
Increasingly, communities are aware that efforts to protect their natural surroundings have to be made before you lose the opportunity to do so. We now have to take that next step, moving beyond recognition to take action to ensure that governments and communities are working together to achieve their environmental aims. It seems that globally there is a number of obvious issues which communities and governments have to consider. Recently I have had a couple of those highlighted around New South Wales. Balancing the competing needs of rural activities with those in urban communities is a significant challenge. Those competing demands were obvious to me in a series of meetings I conducted recently, the first in a large regional city in north-western New South Wales, where community concerns regarding the farming practices of cotton growers in the state's north-west and issues such as salinity were considered.
On a subsequent visit to an enormous cotton farm in that region, a local cotton grower showed me the substantial efforts—mirrored by many others—he had gone to in order to make his farm as environmentally sustainable as possible, including diversification of the products he farmed, creating very exciting new export opportunities. These are not easy conundrums to resolve. Creating economic growth and development while at the same time ensuring environmental protection is a difficult balance to achieve. What is abundantly clear is that the balance is increasingly important as environmental degradation across the globe causes ripple effects. As the world population increases, placing greater strain on our natural resources, with increased demand for food, clean water, power and other essentials, that balance becomes even more precarious. 
Australians and residents of most countries want environmental safeguards, but they also want development, jobs and higher living standards. The approach that the coalition has taken is to ensure that government, industry and the community work together. Community education and engagement are particularly important. We are all able to make a contribution in that process. Once again this year, on Clean Up Australia Day, for example, with my colleague Ross Cameron, the member for Parramatta, Parramatta Liberals banded together to help clean up our local area. We selected a section of Parramatta Park, one of the Greater West's most historic and most important public spaces. With a dedicated group of members and supporters, including scuba divers cleaning the river, we did our part for that day, including discussing some of that work with Ian Kiernan, the founder of Clean Up Australia Day, who was also at Parramatta Park.
These are important initiatives for several reasons. Clean Up Day achieves a real difference in the environment by cleaning up literally thousands of tonnes of rubbish. I was interested to learn that in last year's clean-up a significant proportion of the rubbish cleared was cigarette butts, meaning that the habit costs Australia doubly, impacting substantially on health and, in fact, on the environment. It is also a day that provides another valuable service in raising the environment as an issue of concern for all Australians. Environmental issues present one of the most difficult areas for government anywhere. As our societies change and become more technologically advanced, and literally larger, our relationship with our natural surroundings is also forced to change. Hand in hand with this, governments and communities need to be prepared to adapt to new ways of protecting their surroundings and to ensure that events such as World Environment Day are truly a celebration.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>World Environment Day</title>,Adjournment,19,1
