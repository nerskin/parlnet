"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-09,"—We moved an amendment to the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 in this place. As a consequence, when the bill was sent to the House, they were then faced with the prospect of either agreeing to the bill as provided to them or, as in this case, amending the bill to effectively remove the amendment that we proposed here. In this case we are disappointed that the government did not take up the Senate’s amendment in the House, which was to impose a rebuttable presumption of insolvency where (a) the bankrupt has made a transfer of property while at the same time has an outstanding tax return or (b) the bankrupt has made a transfer of property and has failed to keep adequate books, accounts and records in accordance with their obligations.
Labor believe that our amendment would have made a real and positive contribution to the bill. In our view, which does not appear to be the government’s view, it is simply unacceptable that high-flyers can fund an extravagant lifestyle by avoiding their tax obligations, effectively living at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. The Attorney-General said in the House that Labor’s amendment would ‘go part of the way to resolving the issue’. We were comforted by that statement, but his actions failed to speak louder than his words. What he then did was, of course, not support even our amendment that might go part of the way.
Reform is part of the government’s discussion paper on this issue. It is worth repeating that, after all that has passed by us in the last three years or more, it is unacceptable that the government has only just reached this point of issuing yet another discussion paper on this topic. Labor will, as we have since 2000, watch the process carefully to ensure that the government does not botch it like it has in the past. In this instance we have also been particularly diligent in ensuring that the government does provide and come up with something at the end of the day. It has not, in our view, met all the issues that needed to be met, and our amendment would have gone some way to ensure that high-flying professionals were caught by the legislation.
We also call on the government to make this consultative process open and transparent. We know that they have not been open and frank in the consultative process in the past. That is not only disappointing in itself but also disappointing in its inability to provide some confidence in this area of bankruptcy reform. The consultative process is not a principal area, and one wonders why it cannot be an open and transparent process where submissions are provided and it is done in such a way to ensure those who have an interest can be heard.
The government, however, in Labor’s view should stop dragging its feet on bankruptcy reform. In relation to these issues on bankruptcy reform—issues that I have spoken to in this house since at least 2001, and it is now 2005—it appears likely, and the minister can always confirm or deny this, that we will not see reform until the end of this year, which means that potentially we may not even see legislation until early 2006. In that instance it has been a significant amount of time, and there will have been at least four, perhaps five, tax return periods before some of these professionals, in their flagrant disregard of the law and the spirit of the law, have been reined in. For every day the government delays there is an opportunity for these people to avoid their tax and credit obligations.
Labor will, however, support the passage of the bill without our amendment, because the technical changes that are provided in this bill are in fact necessary. We have always said that and not resiled from it. It is not a case where we would hold up these important changes—although they do not go far enough—on the basis of not getting further and better change. The bill will address the competing rights of creditors and the non-bankrupt spouse. It will also provide a more effective means of collecting income contributions from bankrupts who do not receive their income as a salary or wage, and prevent the misuse by bankrupts of financial agreements in relation to marriage as a means of avoiding payment to creditors. Labor support these aims and changes, and we could not stand in the way of their passage. But we call on the government to immediately undertake to address the issue of high-flyers using bankruptcy loopholes to avoid their obligations to the tax office and particularly to their creditors.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-09,"—I speak to the motion by the Minister for Justice and Customs concerning the House of Representatives message on the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. As I noted when the bill was debated in the Senate last month, this bill tackles some of the anti-avoidance practices that have been used to manipulate Australia’s bankruptcy laws, and the Democrats support its three main objectives, which I will recap. Firstly, the bill provides a more effective means of collecting income contributions from bankrupts who do not receive their income as a salary or wage. Secondly, it seeks to prevent the misuse of financial arrangements as a means of avoiding payments to creditors. Finally, it addresses longstanding issues concerning the interaction between family law and bankruptcy. The government has freely acknowledged and the opposition has confirmed that there is much more to be done in this area, and they are looking at ways in which those further issues can be dealt with.
In the debate last month I spoke about barristers and judges, in particular, and some disturbing statistics from the ATO and other sources concerning the way tax returns are dealt with and the way bankruptcy has been an issue of concern. On the day of the debate, the Australian newspaper had a front-page story on this issue. I was pleased, Minister—and I do not know whether you had anything to do with it—to read that a chief justice in one of the states had already made a statement to both the judiciary and the legal practitioners in the state expressing concern that his profession should be behaving in any way which indicates a failure to behave properly with respect to tax declarations, tax returns and their financial affairs in general. That is a pleasing precedent. I hope, Minister, that, with respect to the questions I asked you in the debate concerning that matter and which you said you would discuss with the Attorney-General’s Department, you will be able to make some remarks in your closing remarks on the motion.
Back in February when this bill was debated, we did support the Labor Party’s amendment to the bill. The amendment was a recommendation of the Law Council. We thought it a sensible amendment. It created a rebuttable presumption of insolvency if the alleged bankrupt makes a transfer of property and has either outstanding tax returns or failed to keep proper accounts. Unfortunately, the House has not agreed to that amendment but we do accept and acknowledge that the Attorney-General has released a discussion paper on possible further amendments to the bankruptcy law, including the option that was passed by the Senate, and that comments are due by 31 March. In line with the views of the opposition, we would hope that the turnaround once those comments are through will be rapid and that this matter can be dealt with later in the year. Since we support the main provisions of the bill and since the issue at hand is being considered by the government further, there is obviously no point in holding up the bill. The Democrats will not be insisting on the amendment.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-03-09,"—I thank senators for their contributions of the House of Representatives message on the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. To remind those who are new to the debate, this bill addresses problems relating to the interaction of bankruptcy law and family law, and implements key recommendations of the joint task force report on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid the payment of tax. There have been longstanding concerns about the uncertainty facing both bankruptcy trustees and non-bankrupt spouses when these two areas of law operate concurrently. I think it was agreed when this was last before the Senate that there were very good measures in this bill.
Today we are dealing with the message from the other place in relation to an amendment which was moved and passed in the Senate and which the House of Representatives has subsequently disagreed with. The opposition amendment which we are dealing with would have created two rebuttable presumptions of insolvency for the purposes of the clawback provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966. These presumptions would arise where a bankrupt had an outstanding tax return or returns and where a bankrupt had failed to keep adequate books, accounts and records when required by law to do so. It is, however, unlikely that these presumptions would be wholly effective as they would be quite easy to rebut and would not operate in circumstances where the bankrupt had transferred property shortly after lodging a tax return but then lodged no further returns and became insolvent.
Further, since parliament removed the taxation commissioner’s priority in bankruptcy in relation to unpaid pay-as-you-earn instalments, it has been the clear intent of parliament, which the tax office has accepted, that generally the tax office should be seen as a creditor similar to other creditors. This status of the commissioner as a normal creditor is no more evident than in the case of bankruptcy where, following any secured creditors, employee entitlements protection and other priorities out of the administration, the distribution received would be the same as for any other unsecured creditor. By creating a rebuttable presumption of insolvency where a debtor transfers property at a time when he or she has an outstanding tax return, the amendment would distinguish the tax office from other creditors in relation to bankruptcy and go some way to restoring the special position of the tax office in that context.
The opposition proposal is included in the suggestions canvassed in a discussion paper which the Attorney-General released on 8 February 2005. That discussion paper will allow stakeholders to give their views on a comprehensive package of reforms needed to address the problem of high-income earners using bankruptcy to avoid paying debts that they can afford to pay. Senator Ludwig raised the question of when the response to the discussion paper could be implemented. I think the Attorney-General has stated that he would be looking to implement that this year. Senator Ludwig’s inquiry as to whether the end of the year is an achievable goal is therefore answered by the Attorney-General’s comments.
It would of course be preferable to allow this consultation to occur to ensure that the most effective package of amendments is developed. The opposition amendment had not been subject to any consultation, and the government believes that it was therefore premature. It is also important to note that, while the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the withdrawn Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Anti-Avoidance and Other Measures) Amendment Bill 2004 acknowledged many suggestions from stakeholders, including those embodied in the opposition amendments, the committee did not recommend that those changes be implemented. The committee instead presented a bipartisan recommendation that there be fresh consultation on strengthening the existing clawback provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. Consultation in that regard has now commenced.
When debate was last conducted in the Senate on this bill, Senator Murray asked a question on 9 February 2005 about the effect of possible bankruptcy on maintaining constructive dialogue between the Australian Taxation Office and a taxpayer and whether bankruptcy would close down that dialogue and make bankruptcy inevitable. I am advised that the answer to Senator Murray’s question is that the tax office is prepared to continue dialogue and to attempt to negotiate repayment with taxpayers at any time prior to bankruptcy. However, once a person becomes bankrupt it is contrary to the Bankruptcy Act for the tax office—as with any other creditor—to make arrangements with the bankrupt for payment of that creditor’s debt. Accordingly, any dialogue between the tax office and the bankrupt will cease on bankruptcy. It should be noted that even if a creditor, such as the Australian tax office, receives payment shortly prior to bankruptcy the trustee may be able to recover that payment as a preference so that money can be available to creditors generally.
That deals with the outstanding question on notice that Senator Murray asked in the committee stage last time, although I think Senator Murray has raised another issue today. I understand from recent advice that the Attorney-General has spoken to all heads of federal jurisdictions—that is, chief justices and chief federal magistrates—in relation to the lodgment of tax returns by judges. Of course, senators would appreciate that the Attorney-General does not have jurisdiction in state and territory judiciaries and that it is a matter for the respective attorneys-general to raise with those states and territories. I might add that I think the debate that was conducted in the committee stage last time this bill was before the Senate and the questions asked by Senator Murray were indeed catalysts for some of the action that we have seen. By raising this issue, Senator Murray may be achieving his desired consequence.
These are important reforms and they need to come into effect as soon as possible, and I thank those senators who have indicated support for the bill. There is a discussion paper, and the government is intent that it be a full and comprehensive discussion and that it result in good law. For the reasons that I have outlined, the government argues that the committee agree to the amendment made by the House of Representatives, and I believe that during the ensuing consultation period these and other issues can be canvassed. Certainly people will be cognisant of the issues that have been raised during the debate on this bill and, indeed, in the debate concerning this message. I commend the bill to the committee.
Question agreed to.
Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-09,"—In the 2002-03 budget the Liberal government announced a range of reforms to Australia’s international tax regime and reforms to international taxation. Those reforms had three broad aims: encouraging foreign investment in Australia, encouraging companies to set up regional headquarters in Australia and removing impediments to the competitiveness of Australian multinationals operating overseas. The New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 represents the final tranche of legislation implementing these reforms.
Schedule 1 deals with capital gains tax and foreign residents. Currently, foreign residents investing in Australian assets directly or through a foreign resident fund are given more favourable taxation treatment than foreign residents investing through Australian managed funds or fixed trusts. The tax law therefore discourages foreign residents from investing in assets through Australian managed funds, and this impedes the employment growth in the managed fund industry in Australia.
The amendments in this bill aim to more closely align the capital gains tax treatment of investments made by foreign residents directly, or through foreign managed funds, and investments made through Australian managed funds. Clearly, if a foreign resident disposes of an interest in an Australian managed fund, a capital gains tax event is triggered. This occurs even where the underlying assets of that fund are without the necessary connection to Australia to trigger a capital gains tax event if those assets were held directly. Foreigners are therefore penalised for investing in the assets through Australian managed funds, rather than investing directly in those assets. The changes will result in a capital gains tax event being triggered only if more than 10 per cent of underlying assets of an Australian managed fund has the necessary connection with Australia to trigger a capital gains tax event. This will provide closer alignment between the tax treatment of foreigners investing directly and foreigners investing through Australian managed funds.
In addition, capital gains or losses made by foreign residents due to the disposal of assets by an Australian fund will also be disregarded where the gain or loss relates to an asset without the necessary connection to Australia. This change will again ensure that foreign residents are not penalised for holding assets through Australian managed funds. A CGT exemption will also be provided where distributions of foreign source income are made from a fund to a foreign resident. This effectively allows foreign income to flow through an Australian managed fund to a foreign resident. This is appropriate as foreign residents investing directly in assets generating foreign source income are in general not subject to capital gains tax.
Schedule 2 deals with treaty source rules. Schedule 2 will ensure that foreign residents are taxed in the same way on foreign source income derived from foreign assets held through Australian managed funds as they are taxed on income from directly held foreign assets. These amendments effectively allow foreign income to flow through an Australian managed fund to a foreign investor without being subject to Australian tax. These amendments will improve the competitiveness of Australian managed funds in providing services to foreign investors. Schedule 3 deals with interest withholding tax. Withholding tax is generally applied to interest payments made to overseas creditors. This effectively increases the cost of capital for Australian firms, which reduces their profits, investment and employment.
The bill contains three amendments to the imposition of interest withholding tax. The first amendment broadens the range of financial instruments eligible for IWT exemption by including debt interests. The second amendment complements the government’s decision to treat certain upper tier 2 capital instruments as debt interests for taxation purposes by ensuring that non-capital payments on such instruments are treated as interest for IWT purposes. The third amendment allows assets and debts to be transferred from Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks to their Australian branches without losing IWT exemptions.
The Australian Labor Party, which I am speaking on behalf of in this chamber today, is committed to the process of international tax reform. My colleague the shadow Assistant Treasurer in the other place, Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, in a recent speech to the Sydney Institute raised the issue of international tax arrangements acting as a barrier to attracting the best and the brightest minds and entrepreneurs to this country.
For the reasons that I have outlined, Labor will be supporting the international tax arrangements bill. We believe there are some other issues that need some examination. One important matter is the capital gains tax deemed disposal rule that applies to certain foreign citizens—presumably foreign residents—working in Australia. The rule means that, after a period of five years residing in Australia, if they become a nonresident they incur a capital gains tax liability, irrespective of whether they have disposed of specific foreign held assets. This does not appear to be good tax design.
The issue has been pursued through the UK and US double tax treaties. To date, the Liberal government has not done a great deal on the matter. It needs to have more attention paid to it. It impacts on the so-called brain drain from this country, and further action is needed to eliminate tax impediments to attracting the best people back to Australia or non-Australians into Australia. This is becoming a more critical issue due to our productivity performance. There has been a great deal of public debate about some disappointing economic news in recent times. The public debate has focused on some of the causal issues and possible solutions. Amongst those is the need for Australian industry to retain and attract the brightest and most knowledgeable persons who can contribute to restarting the growth of the Australian economy, which in the last quarter was almost zero.
More attention needs to be paid to the couple of matters that I have touched on by the current government as part of a much more comprehensive approach to restoring economic growth and to reducing our national debt and our current account debt. The national debt has reached record proportions and carries with it serious consequences. Having made those comments, I conclude by saying that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-09,"—The New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is the third tranche of legislation in response to the Board of Taxation’s review of international tax arrangements. These changes are designed to improve the ability of financial service providers to hold investments in Australia as their regional headquarters. For anyone who thinks tax reform is an easy matter—and I doubt there is anyone who thinks that—we should recognise that it is now at least three years since the initiative was first taken.
On 2 May 2002, obviously after some consideration of the issues, the Treasurer announced details of a review of international taxation concentrating on at least four principal areas: the dividend imputation system’s treatment of foreign source income, the foreign source income rules, the overall treatment of what is known as conduit income, and high-level aspects of double tax agreement policy and processes. A consultation paper resulted. Then, after extensive public consultation, the Board of Taxation reported to the Treasurer and the government responded—which was about a year later. A year after that, the first two tranches came into effect in time for the financial year 2004-05. These things take time not because the bureaucracy is a slow-moving kind of beast, although sometimes it is, but because of the complexity of the arrangements affected by such changes, the complexity of the entities and the need for consultation and for double-checking as to the effect.
The Australian Democrats have supported the previous bills and we intend to support this bill too. It has three schedules. The first two schedules ensure that foreign residents who invest in Australian unit trusts are treated the same as if they owned the investments directly. Schedule 1 to this bill would make changes to the tax treatment of foreign residents who make a capital gain or loss in respect of an interest in an Australian fixed trust. Schedule 2 to the bill includes amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953, aligning the tax treatment of foreign residents investing through managed funds that derive some or all of their income from sources outside Australia with the tax treatment that would apply if those foreign residents made such investments directly.
The revenue impact is stated in the explanatory memorandum to be ‘unquantifiable but insignificant’ for the first two schedules and only $5 million per year for the third schedule. We should note that the effects of the bill are likely to be far greater than the financial impact on revenue. The explanatory memorandum to this bill correctly observes:
The reforms in this bill are aimed at removing tax impediments that discourage foreign residents from investing in Australian trusts, including managed funds. This is expected to make Australia’s managed funds industry more internationally competitive, enhancing the ability of Australian funds to attract foreign investment. If, as expected, this results in an increased flow of funds into Australian funds it will increase scale and efficiencies in the Australian managed funds industry. This will put downward pressure on the cost of managed fund services which will benefit all investors in Australian managed funds.
If you decipher that, what they are effectively saying is that tinkering with the law at relatively low cost to the revenue may in fact have very considerable multiplier effects and beneficial effects economically and in business terms. Those sorts of changes are obviously to be welcomed.
On 9 May 2003 Allesandra Fabro wrote in the Financial Review that business looked to this package of international tax reforms as steps that would ‘lower the cost of capital for Australian multinationals and reduce the incentive for them to move offshore’. She also noted:
A number of surveys in recent years have decried Australia’s international tax regime as onerous and discouraging to offshore investment.
I have always thought that that threat of moving offshore is singularly overstated. I remember that at the time it was being whipped up in public debate and being repeated in here. Some time afterwards there was a survey as to how many businesses were relocating to Australia and establishing regional offices in Sydney—partly as a result, I might say, of the government’s rather good bills which encouraged Sydney to become a financial centre for our region. In fact, the reverse was happening. It was not what business was claiming—that people were going to go offshore. What was happening was that large numbers of businesses were coming onshore.
There is a salutary lesson in that for all of us who have to deal with these matters and that is that businesspeople are no different from other spruikers. If they are spruiking their particular campaign they are prone to exaggerating the points of their argument to try to encourage us to agree with them. You have to have not a cynical eye but sometimes a sceptical attitude to some of the claims they make. I feel the same way about the surveys that decry Australia’s international tax regime. In many respects we understate our competitiveness. That is not to say we should not continue to reform our law, and this is yet another step forward, which is to be welcomed.
While the Democrats support these particular initiatives and with the remarks that I have just made in mind, I want to say to the Senate that another campaign of which we should all be cautious is under way. The Democrats do not believe that Australia should participate in an illusory international race to the bottom in terms of international company tax rates. There are those who argue that in this country we should aim to be competitive with the very lowest company income tax rate in the world. From a self-interested point of view I can understand why they would say that. I have said before that we are not a party that believes in high taxation; we are a party that believes in high revenue, which is a different matter when you are referring to rates. We strongly supported reductions in company tax rates, from 36 per cent to the present 30 per cent, stepped over a number of years, because they were accompanied by base broadening, they simplified the system somewhat and delivered greater competitiveness. We see no reason at this point in Australia’s economic life to consider that company tax needs to move below the existing rate of 30 per cent, which of course is a nominal rate.
Despite the forecast $10 billion government surplus, which the newspapers were full of yesterday, our priority will always be to fund health, education, housing or infrastructure to satisfy the reasonable and legitimate needs that Australians have from their governments. It is likely that the Treasurer and the government will decide that if there is a surplus of that size they will dedicate it entirely to tax cuts. In our opinion the case has not been made that those tax cuts should be directed towards lowering the company tax rate. In our opinion it does not need to be reduced from 30 per cent at this stage, but we strongly support the view that there is a need for income tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners. In our opinion, if the government wants money to fund tax cuts for high-income earners, it can do it by simplifying the system and broadening the income tax bases. With respect to low-income earners, we think that certainty and equity in income taxation are vital. Certainty and equity should be delivered by a three-part plan, phased in over a number of years in order to ensure affordability. We recognise, of course, that selecting any threshold is arbitrary, but if you are going to deliver certainty, equity and a more acceptable income tax regime you should have objectives in mind to be implemented on a stepped basis, as affordable. We would put the priorities in this order and with these objectives in mind: a $20,000 tax-free threshold, indexation to end bracket creep, and possibly a $120,000 top rate threshold, or something of that order. That would be a structural reform to the system.
At the very least, the income tax system needs to accept that it is entirely inappropriate to tax income below $12,500, which is the estimated minimum subsistence income. In the meantime, the priority is to keep addressing the needs of low-income workers, increasing their disposable income and living standards, reducing cripplingly high effective tax rates which operate for them and moving poorer Australians from welfare to work. The best single way to do this is by raising the tax-free threshold, which has the side benefit of flowing on to all Australian taxpayers, and in that way is seen as an equitable measure.
I make those remarks about individual income tax in the context of this bill because I think the debate in business is focusing far too heavily on company tax rates and far too little on the needs of individual taxpayers. In making those remarks with respect to company tax, I always remind people that we have to remember that it is an intermediate tax, because the dividends that are ultimately paid end up in the hands of the ultimate taxpayer, which of course is the individual. We have to look at their marginal and nominal tax rates and what that dividend will be categorised as finally in the hands of the share owner. To me, in the debate about what to do with surpluses, the intermediate taxes are less important than the final taxes. With those broad-ranging remarks, I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the bill without amendment.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-03-09,"—The New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is a further step in implementing the government’s package of international tax reforms designed to enhance the competitiveness of Australian managed funds, facilitate investment into Australia and assist Australia’s development as a global financial service centre. This bill is a reminder that this government is committed to working with business in the way that tax policy is decided and implemented. The measures contained in this bill reflect the expertise and hard work of a broad range of participants, from officials and business groups to individual businesses and the members of the Board of Taxation. In 2002 the Treasurer announced a review of international tax arrangements. Subsequently, a consultation paper was prepared and released by the Treasury, including a range of options for consultation. That consultation was undertaken by the Board of Taxation, and the government certainly appreciates the tireless efforts of those involved in that process. In 2003 the government received the board’s report and released its response.
A further round of consultation then commenced on the design of the legislation. The main components of the government package include the following. Firstly, it simplifies the application of the controlled foreign company rules for Australian companies operating in countries where tax arrangements are comparable to Australia’s and also eases these rules for certain services provided in international markets. Secondly, it moves towards a more residence based treaty policy, consistent with the directions set in the US protocol, where the overall treaty package is in Australia’s national interests. Thirdly, it exempts Australian companies and their controlled foreign companies from capital gains tax for the sale of certain non-portfolio interests in foreign companies and extends the existing tax exemption for foreign non-portfolio dividends and certain branch profits. This will assist Australian companies operating offshore as well as regional headquarters operations based in Australia.
Fourthly, it proceeds with the previously announced foreign income account measure. Fifthly, it better targets the foreign investment fund rules to reduce compliance costs for Australian managed funds and superannuation entities investing offshore by increasing the balanced portfolio exemption from five per cent to 10 per cent for all taxpayers and exempting compliance superannuation funds from the FIF rules. Sixthly, it seeks to revise certain aspects of the cross-border taxation of resident trusts to improve the international competitiveness of Australian managed funds. It also seeks to proceed with the simplified treatment of foreign trusts and the tightening of the transferor trust rules, both previously announced. It also extends aspects of the separate entity treatment given to foreign bank permanent establishments to branches of other financial entities. Further, unfranked dividends received by foreign owned branches generally will be taxed on assessment instead of being subject to non-resident withholding tax. Finally, it addresses the double taxation of employee share options. A previously announced measure requiring security from departing residents for deferred CGT liabilities will not proceed. The legislation is now being introduced in tranches. The bill which we are considering today relates mainly to managed funds. This bill was preceded by bills concerning foreign investment fund rules, interest withholding tax, controlled foreign companies and a range of other matters, which were all designed to improve Australia’s business and investment competitiveness.
I would like to take this opportunity to outline some broader perspectives on the tax reform process—in particular, the process by which this bill and other legislation is being implemented as part of the government’s international tax reform package. The process by which the government has developed these bills has been exhaustive in its preparation and has been characterised above all by consultation. There have been public discussion papers, advisory boards, consultative groups, roundtable discussions, reports, government responses and publicly released draft legislation. Consultation is continuing on outstanding aspects of the international tax reform package. It is further evidence of this government’s determination to work with business to maximise Australia’s economic potential. Consultation is ongoing with the Permanent Establishments Working Group, Conduit Working Group, Foreign Investment Funds Working Group, Controlled Foreign Companies Working Group, the Tax Treaties Advisory Panel and the Foreign Trusts Working Group. This work goes on behind the scenes and attracts little of the public attention that some of the trench warfare style debate about other tax issues does, but it is certainly necessary.
International tax, although it does not get the same publicity, is still very important. The work done as part of consultation process is a great credit to our business community and the officials involved. It also reflects the trust and cooperation which has developed between this government and the business community. This is a government which works with business and listens to business. It does not always do what business wants, but it always consults and listens to their perspective. Where business has a reasonable point of view, it will act. This is in contrast to the Labor Party. Labor, as I said in the Senate yesterday, has not had to control or run a tax system for about nine years now. But we can get an idea about how it will handle tax policy in future by taking a brief look back at the election. Firstly, Labor was evasive about when its tax policy would actually come out. On 5 September last year Mr McMullan was asked when Labor’s tax policy was going to come out. He replied, ‘Soon.’ Then, helpfully, he added, as though it was a great revelation, ‘It will be before the election.’ How thoroughly decent! Despite promising it months before, there was a concession that it would be released before the election.
Mr Crean was interviewed on Business Sunday on the same day last year. While talking about Labor’s economic management credentials, he said, in terms of Labor’s consultation with business: ‘We have been prepared to engage the business community. Myself, Bob McMullan and David Cox’—how lucky can business be!—‘have all had exhaustive meetings over long periods of time with the business community to explain them.’ Mr Crean was then told by the journalist, ‘But they still don’t know what your tax policy is.’ Mr Crean replied, ‘We’ll be announcing that very soon and I think people will be very impressed with it.’ They were not. Labor’s tax policy has since been withdrawn, as have other large elements of their policy. Labor yet again are without a tax policy at this point in time.
Following the election Mr Swan commented on how things needed to change in Labor’s approach. On 31 October he said: ‘It is a great challenge. I am going to be knocking on a lot of doors over the next 12 months as we flesh out Labor’s new economic growth agenda. In fact, I think I will probably need a new fitness regime to cope with all of those boardroom lunches and dinners. I think it is going to be a bit of a chicken salad offensive, actually. I have to learn out there and we are going to take our time to flesh out our new economic growth agenda for this country.’ So a chicken salad offensive is at the heart of Labor’s new process of consultation. He added, ‘I and other members of the shadow cabinet will be moving around the boardrooms, the lunch rooms and the community to get their feedback so that we can put forward a fresh agenda for the future.’ So there is lots of moving, talking and listening, but will it produce any policy? I would not expect it any time soon.
Only yesterday Mr Beazley said that his approach will be to ‘hold them to account’. He said: ‘ You subject them—the government—to questions and you put up, as the election approaches, a few decent alternatives. From the Labor Party’s point of view we are going to find much more focus on the sorts of questions that we ask.’ It sends a chill down my spine! That is much the same as what Mr Beazley said in July 2000. He said, ‘Well, accountability is critical for our parliamentary process, so you actually have a role to be carping. But, carping, yeah, there is a role for that, unfortunately.’ He then went on to say: ‘You have to present an alternative vision’—the same words as he used yesterday—‘but only as you get closer to an election.’ Again, policy? No. It is a case of waiting, waiting, waiting. At the death knock, just before the election, if we are lucky we will get something from those opposite. We have seen this play book before and we know what to expect.
International tax is not a topic which enlivens the hearts and imaginations of the average Australian, but it is a vital issue which requires very careful consideration and ongoing monitoring to ensure that arrangements continue to operate as intended. Taxation can affect decisions about the location of foreign investment, as Senator Murray indicated. Australia is a great location to invest. In large part that is due to the government’s strong economic management during the past nine years under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.
—What has happened to economic growth in the last nine years?
—This government has delivered strong growth. This government has delivered strong growth, budget surpluses, low interest rates and the lowest levels of unemployment in over 20 years. Those facts do not change despite the interjections opposite. Political and economic stability are important issues for determining investment, but we also need an international tax system which makes the most of Australia’s economic potential. Taxation can affect decisions about direct foreign investment, but it is a more significant factor for portfolio flows of capital. Taxation is likely to become increasingly important to decision making as world markets continue to integrate and liberalise.
The bill we are considering today relates particularly to managed funds. Managed funds are sensitive to tax on the income flowing to investors, and for this reason it is important to get Australia’s tax arrangements right. This bill focuses on making the Australian managed funds industry more attractive to foreign clients. Australia’s managed funds industry is robust, helped by a strong and stable economic performance, an educated work force, low-cost infrastructure, world-class regulatory systems and highly developed financial markets.
This bill makes changes in schedules 1 and 2 which are designed to reduce taxation impediments to the further growth of managed funds. These changes will allow Australian managed funds to become more internationally competitive, increasing their attractiveness to nonresidents. Under current capital gains tax arrangements, nonresidents investing in assets through an Australian managed fund may be taxed more heavily than if they invested directly in those assets or through a foreign fund. Measures in this bill will eliminate those distortions. Complementary measures will reduce the taxation on foreign-source conduit income earned by nonresidents by interposed Australian managed funds.
In schedule 3 the bill also amends interest withholding tax arrangements to bring them up to date with recent changes to the debt equity rules. These changes will ensure that the current IWT exemptions are consistent with the way that companies raise finance. The changes will also remove tax impediments to the restructuring of foreign bank operations in Australia from subsidiary to branch structure.
The CGT measures in schedule 1 of this bill apply to capital gains and losses made on or after the date on which the bill receives royal assent. The tax treaty measures in schedule 2 apply from the beginning of the year of income in which this bill receives royal assent. The IWT measures in schedule 3 apply to interest paid on debt interests issued on or after royal assent, to payments made on the relevant capital instruments issued on or after royal assent and to debentures or debt interests issued after 18 June 1993 which are transferred on or after royal assent.
As I noted previously, the business community has provided invaluable input to the preparation of this bill and we appreciate the contribution made by the business community in developing the international tax reform measures which are being progressively introduced. The bill again demonstrates that this government will listen to business and work with it to create a better environment for doing business.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-09,"—I thank all senators, including those opposite and the Democrats, for their contribution to the debate on the New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004. I also thank Senator Fifield for his contribution, but I must take issue with him on one very important point. I think this is very exciting legislation, and the measures in this bill are in fact another exciting instalment in the package of international tax reforms being rolled out by this government. Having said that and having listened closely to Senator Fifield’s speech, I think he has canvassed all the matters I was going to canvass in my summing-up speech, so there is no need for me to say anything further, other than to invite anybody who wants to find out what the government’s position on this bill is to read Senator Fifield’s excellent speech. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-03-09,"—On 2 March the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Brendan Nelson, released an issues paper entitled Building university diversity: future approval and accreditation processes for Australian higher education. The document framed several of the policy choices which the government will be required to make during the current parliament for tertiary education in Australia. I expect that the debate which Dr Nelson has initiated will be the most important reconsideration of the role of Australian universities since the Dawkins review.
A central issue in the debate will be the centrality of the role of research in universities. Under one option under active consideration, which is canvassed in the discussion paper, a class of institutions would be recognised which would be engaged in teaching only. Research would not be regarded as an important or even a necessary role for such institutions. A model for such institutions is said to be the so-called liberal arts colleges in the United States. I do not for a moment doubt that there is an important and valuable role in post-secondary education which perhaps teaching-only institutions could fulfil.
Such institutions would in some respects resemble the colleges or institutes of advanced education which existed pre-Dawkins and which one of the effects of the Dawkins ‘reforms’ was to convert into universities. I say ‘reforms’ because I think it is now widely recognised—and it is a view which I have had for a very long time—that the Dawkins model was a deeply flawed model. It was a model which, by subjecting some 38 institutions which differed fundamentally in character, size, capabilities, levels of expertise, student needs and academic priorities to the same template, created distortions and inefficiencies and in some cases—this is, of course, the old Labor Party trademark—resulted in a levelling down of standards.
The needs and priorities of an internationally acknowledged major research institution such as the Australian National University, the University of Melbourne or the University of Queensland and those of a small institution which serves a modest student population and, due to economies of scale, is unable to offer more than a small number of courses or to compete successfully for significant research funding, are very different. I do not want to see as one of the outcomes of the current debate repetition in a different form of the same error which Dawkins made—in other words, the imposition of a false uniformity upon institutions which are of a fundamentally different character. Teaching-only post-secondary colleges, in which research and advanced scholarship do not take place, are not the same as universities and, while they would no doubt fulfil a valuable and socially desirable role, we should not pretend that it is the same role which universities have traditionally fulfilled.
In saying that, I am very mindful of the fact that the reputation of a university is not a function of the number of students which it teaches or the number of degrees which it confers but the excellence of its scholarship and research. And, in that regard, Australians do ourselves no favours by depreciating the contribution our universities have made to higher learning. We Australians are very conscious of our country’s international competitiveness in so many fields: business, cinema and, most notably, sport. Last August, when Australia came fourth in the league table for medals at the Athens Olympics, that achievement was a source of justifiable pride and national celebration. But I wonder how many Australians are even aware of a much more important index of national excellence which was published only three months after that?
In November last year, the respected British educational journal the Times Higher Education Supplement published the World University Rankings, which listed the top 200 universities in the world. And do you know how many Australian universities were in the top 50? There were six: the Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, Monash University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney and the University of Queensland. We only have 38 universities in this country and six were assessed to be among the top 50 in the world! The best of them, the Australian National University, was ranked 16th—ahead of such internationally renowned universities as Columbia, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, UCLA, Toronto and the Sorbonne. Other league tables have also placed Australian universities among the world’s best—and, almost uniformly, it is the Australian National University and the University of Melbourne which are adjudged the two leading universities in the nation.
The reason Australian universities have achieved such international success—success which we celebrate in our sportsmen and our actors but not, sadly, in our professors—is the excellence of their standards of scholarship and research. Of all the things Australia does well, the field of endeavour in which the world rates us most highly is our intellectual achievement. Our universities are not elitist institutions—because entry to them is by ability. But they are elite institutions because they are among the world’s best.
So, in contributing to the public discussion of the future of Australia’s universities initiated by Dr Nelson, I want to make a plea for the rigorous maintenance of those high academic standards which have won for Australian universities such international renown. Those standards will only be maintained if universities continue to be devoted to research, scholarship and higher learning. And, at a time when so much of the focus of public debate is, for understandable reasons, upon vocational education, I also want to say a word in defence of pure learning—the pursuit and advancement of knowledge for its own sake—because, without a philosophical and institutional commitment to the advancement of learning as an end in itself, there will not be the beneficial application of that knowledge to the advancement of mankind, nor will there be the intellectual excellence for which Australia’s elite universities are internationally respected.
In making that case, I am in good company. My party’s founder, Sir Robert Menzies, of all the Prime Ministers this country has had, was the one who valued scholarship most highly; who regarded the aspiration of people of modest background, such as his own parents, to see their offspring achieve a university education as one of the noblest aspirations which a parent can have for a child. During his first term as Prime Minister, Menzies made a speech at Queen’s University in Belfast, upon the occasion of receiving an honorary degree—a doctorate of laws—from that institution on 3 April 1941. In addressing the chancellor, he said:
I have a life-long interest in the work of universities. I have, Sir, and I say it without shame, an almost passionate belief in pure learning. I have never been able to accept the view that a university is a mere technical school. If time permitted … I should be prepared to discuss . . . the value of pure learning in a world in which too much applied, or misapplied, learning has brought humanity to a very strange pass.
Why, Sir, do I defend pure learning? Because to me pure learning, the freeing of the mind from the inhibitions of ignorance, is one of those great moving forces that distinguish the civilized world from the uncivilized world, one of those great underlying things for which this war is being fought. And because I believe that, because I believe that this precious thing, this scholarship for which universities stand, is an essential ingredient in the freedom not only of the human mind but of the human spirit …
In his second term in government, Menzies did more for Australian universities than any Prime Minister has done before or since. In a speech to the House of Representatives on 26 July 1945, Menzies set out his conception of what a university should be. He said:
The university is not a professional “shop”, though I confess that in my day we used to identify our own by that mercantile name. As the word implies, the university must not be narrow or unduly specialist in its outlook. It must teach and encourage the free search for the truth. That search must increasingly extend to, but is not to be confined to, the physical resources of the world or of space. The scientist is of great and growing importance, and what we propose to do will, I believe, enable many more scientists to be trained in proper circumstances …
                  …         …           …
Let us have more scientists, and more humanists. Let the scientists be touched and informed by the humanities. Let the humanists be touched and informed by science, so that they may not be lost in abstractions derived from out-dated knowledge or circumstances. That proposition underlines the whole university idea. It warrants and requires a great variety of faculties and the constant intermingling of those who engage in their disciplines. To perform those vital tasks our universities must be equipped . . . to meet the challenge which, both in quality and quantity, becomes more urgent and insistent every day.
Nearly 30 years later, on 31 March 1973, another Liberal leader of great intellectual distinction, Sir Paul Hasluck—by now Governor-General—gave an address at the opening of Mayne Hall at the University of Queensland. It was entitled simply ‘On Learning’. It was subsequently published by the University of Queensland Press, but it is little known today. Sir Paul Hasluck captured in that speech, better than any Australian I can think of, the point of university education: why universities are not, in Menzies’ phrase, ‘mere technical schools’.
Allow me to finish by quoting what he said and to express the hope that, when the current debate on Australian universities is conducted, it will be informed not merely by pragmatism, utilitarianism and functionalism but also by the ideals which Hasluck so well understood and so eloquently expressed:
We live in a period when all manner of men are expressing views about education and advancing ideas about the best ways of spending more money … on education. An industrial and commercial society is demanding that the education system be an assembly line to produce a regular supply of skilled hired hands. Various persons who customarily speak in the name of the nation talk of the nation’s need for this or that kind of expert or specialist.
It is a long time since I heard anyone make a speech about any need for learned men. I have an inkling that if our universities or any other tertiary institution or research centre did produce a few men and women of great learning, the nation would be proud of them just as it is proud if some other course of training, in which the nation has taken little part, produces a youngster who can swim a hundred metres faster than anyone else in the world . . .
Yet learning is important. It is important, not so that we can do some national boasting at the number of medals we get in some Olympic Games of scholarship, but so that we establish the quality of the whole of our educational endeavour in Australia. It is important, too, so that we shall have in Australia a body of learned men and women whose standards of judgment and level of knowledge will be such as to create an intellectual environment in which all that is cheap, shoddy, glib, ignorant, ill organized, and unverified will be revealed in its ugliness and pettiness and rejected and so that our people will become accustomed to and require a better level of learning from those who purport to instruct or to lead them. It is important, too, so that we shall be a country in which scholars in all disciplines will be recognized for their assiduous search for truth and that search will continue with constancy and faith.
How do we achieve this? I do not suggest that it can be done by selecting this or that educational institution and describing it as a hall of learning. I think rather that it can be done in all institutions and that the basic need is personal and group loyalty to the ideal of learning and devotion to the search for truth.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Education: Higher Education</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-09,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the minister to his answer to my question yesterday seeking an explanation of the dramatic increase in Australia’s foreign debt to historic levels, which he explained was due in part to Australia’s high growth rate relative to its trading partners. How can he claim this when Australia’s growth rate of 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter was amongst the lowest in the developed world? In relation to his other excuse that high foreign debt was the fault of a strong Australian dollar, is the minister aware that the value of the Australian dollar, as measured by the Reserve Bank’s trade weighted exchange rate, was actually unchanged over the year 2004? Given that these two attempted excuses have bitten the dust, does the minister have any other explanation for Australia’s ballooning foreign debt?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, the reasons you advanced yesterday in other answers, which I have referred to, were just plain wrong. Given that both your explanations yesterday were wrong, how can the Australian people have any confidence in the Howard government’s ability to develop policies to reduce Australia’s record high foreign debt?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-03-09,"—It is remarkable that Senator Sherry should purport to have a much greater insight into the state of the Australian economy and the causes of our current account deficit than the International Monetary Fund. What I relied on yesterday was a reference to the IMF’s recent article IV report on Australia, which said that the widening current account deficit mainly reflects ‘the sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar and the relatively strong cyclical position of the economy’. That is what I relied on. I would much rather rely on the IMF than on Senator Sherry or anybody else in the opposition. For the opposition to be credible on economic matters, surely they must recognise that the build-up of a current account deficit and foreign debt is over a long period of time. It is ridiculous to suggest that, because the national accounts for the September to December quarter showed 0.1 per cent growth, therefore an argument put by the IMF and every other single expert commentator about the relatively strong cyclical position of the Australian economy does not have foundation. That in itself is laughable.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-03-09,"—I do not want to go on repeating myself, but I do rely on the IMF and others to demonstrate that the critical reasons why the current account deficit is growing do relate to the appreciation of the dollar, especially vis-a-vis the United States dollar and the countercyclical position of the Australian economy, which has been growing faster than most other economies. In fact the growth in the Australian economy from 1991 to 2004 was the highest in the OECD.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-03-09,"—My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware of the findings of the Cole royal commission which exposed widespread union thuggery, intimidation, violence and corruption in the building and construction industry? Will the minister update the Senate on what actions the government is taking to reform this industry? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations: Building Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-09,"—I thank Senator Santoro for his question and for his ongoing interest in the area of workplace relations. I note in passing that he was a most distinguished Minister for Industrial Relations and Training in Queensland, with a special emphasis on apprenticeships. Senator Santoro is absolutely right: Justice Cole did find that the building and construction industry in Australia was riddled with intimidation, thuggery and unlawful behaviour. The findings of the royal commission present a most compelling case for the reform of the building and construction industry.
Unlike the smorgasbord of former shop stewards opposite, the government have heard the pleas, especially from small and individual contractors. That is why we will be doing something about this situation to rectify the concerns—by introducing a bill that will do two things. Firstly, it will increase the penalty provisions in the Workplace Relations Act and, secondly, it will finally give the building industry task force the powers it needs to effectively prosecute illegal activity. There should be no doubt in the minds of employers and unions that the government are serious about taking action in the building and construction industry. There is an old African saying: when two elephants mate, the grass gets trampled. When big business and big unions get together, the small and independent contractors, the workers and the apprentices are the ones who get trampled. We as a government are willing to ensure that that no longer occurs.
If those in industry on either side, be it in big business or in big unions, think that somehow we are not serious about this, I indicate to the Senate that the proposed increased penalties are up to a maximum of $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 in other cases. No Australian ought to be above the law and no Australian union ought to be above the law either. Unlike those opposite, we will not turn a blind eye to the scandalous situation that was exposed so cogently by the Cole royal commission.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Those opposite are still interjecting. They are still in denial about this, as they are on Medicare Gold and their forest policy. If they want to become a relevant party for the Australia of 2005 and beyond, they will have to make some changes to their industrial relations policy, which includes telling all their parliamentarians to vote against the bill that we are about to introduce. Their policy was formulated at their last ALP conference, where over 50 per cent of the delegates were trade union officials or former trade union officials, so of course they were told how to vote on this important piece of legislation. The simple fact is that Labor, if they want to, can now send a clear signal to the Australian people that they are relevant and are going to cut themselves free from the Norm Gallaghers, Craig Johnstons and Doug Camerons of this world, but they do not want to do that. They somehow suffer from the Stockholm syndrome. We could call it the ‘craven captives of the construction commissars condition’. That is what they on that side suffer from. We as a government will overcome the situation and, as a result, the building and construction industry will be a lot better off.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations: Building Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-09,"—by leave—Pursuant to notice of intention given on Tuesday, 8 March 2005, I withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 1 to 27 standing in my name for nine days sitting after today. Before doing so, I understand that agreement has been reached for me to seek leave to make a short statement on the matter.
Leave granted.
—The Greens moved this disallowance within the appropriate time, as laid down in the standing orders, because we have consistently opposed the deregulation of the higher education system by this government and we hold legitimate concerns about the process which has led to 27 institutions listed in our disallowance motion gaining higher education provider status. The Greens’ intention in moving this disallowance was to allow for there to be public debate on the deregulation of the higher education system, which is something that the Minister for Education, Science and Training was calling for just last week, at the same time that he was proposing that these 27 institutions be listed as higher education providers.
The Greens do not support the deregulation of the higher education system, but at the very least there needs to be a more transparent process in deciding which institutions get listed as higher education providers. Our intention was to delay this wave of regulation until the debate had occurred. However, it appears that some of the institutions listed in our disallowance motion have already engaged students on the basis of future access to FEE-HELP—that is, they have led students to believe that they will be able to access higher education status before the disallowance process has been completed. Many of these students have already made decisions and moved interstate. On the basis of these arrangements, they were given their institutions.
We do not intend to impact on those families or those students, therefore we are withdrawing the motion. But it is important to note the criticisms of these institutions having informed their students that they will be able to access higher education provider status before the process for parliamentary debate on this disallowance has occurred. As a result, senators have been put in an invidious position regarding this disallowance, and the proper functioning of the parliament has been compromised by this process. It has undermined the ability of the Greens to represent the views of our constituents through the proper process of the parliament, and we will be raising these issues with the minister.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,NOTICES,16,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the documents.
I will speak very briefly to the motion and indicate that I welcome the tabling of this memorandum of understanding and the associated guideline. The proposal for the memorandum of understanding was put forward by the House of Representatives in a report from its privileges committee in October 1995. I understand that the committee acted on the suggestion of former President of the Senate Michael Beahan. The Senate Standing Committee on Privileges first became involved in 1999 when it tabled the 75th report, which included a declaration of support for the proposal. Since that time the committee as well as the President and his predecessors have been actively engaged in the process of creating the memorandum of understanding throughout its long gestation period. I thought it appropriate that we acknowledge those facts today. I think this is a very important step forward, one that will be of great benefit to both chambers and all parliamentarians in this place.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Memorandum of Understanding on the Execution of Search Warrants in the Premises of Members of Parliament</title>,DOCUMENTS,21,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2005-03-09,"—I also rise to speak to Senator Faulkner’s motion. The issue of security for documents that a constituent has sent to either a member or a senator for their assistance on those documents is a very crucial part of our democracy. It is very pleasing to see that this memorandum of understanding has actually been achieved between the parties relating specifically to the federal government. Before continuing with my remarks I will raise the issue that we still do not have a similar procedure where a state based police force applies for a warrant. I would recommend that both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the future look at this aspect also. In the memorandum of understanding I think the crucial issue that I have just raised is very well put in the second paragraph of the preamble. It says:
The process is designed to ensure that search warrants are executed without improper interference with the functions of parliament and so its members and their staff are given a proper opportunity to raise claims for parliamentary privilege or public interest immunity in relation to documents or other things that may be on the searched premises.
As a Senator for Queensland, I do not want to give, in any way, shape or form, the impression that a member or a senator ought to be above the law. I do not imply that in any way at all. However, because of the significance and the stature of the positions and the roles that we fulfil, there are certain steps that should be taken into account if it is deemed necessary to execute a warrant on the premises of a member or senator—and that is irrespective of whether it is in their suite here in Parliament House, in their official electorate office or within an authorised privately funded office. Many senators and members have their official offices both here in Parliament House and in their respective state or electorate, and quite a few, like me—generally because of the vastness of the areas they represent—have elected to fund private offices as well. I believe it is important that these documents also cover those authorised privately funded offices.
Item 2 of the AFP guidelines says:
It is also possible that a document held by a member will attract public interest immunity even if it is not covered by parliamentary privilege. The High Court has held that a document which attracts public interest immunity cannot be seized under a search warrant.
The reference is Jacobsen v Rogers (1995) 127 ALR 159. They go on to say:
Public interest immunity can apply to any document if the contents of the document are such that the public interest in keeping the contents secret outweighs the public interest in investigating and prosecuting offences against the criminal law. Amongst other things, public interest may apply to documents if disclosure would damage national security, defence, international relations or relations with the states or if a document contains details, deliberations or decisions of the cabinet or executive council, or if disclosure would prejudice the proper function of the government of the Commonwealth or a state.
I place on record an additional issue: confidentiality between a constituent and their elected representative. If a person cannot have absolute assurance that any document they give to their member or a senator from their state cannot be taken by another person, irrespective of whether it is under the power of a warrant or without a warrant, then that will seriously undermine the confidence of that constituent. It would also seriously undermine the ability of each and every senator in this place and every member in the House of Representatives to represent their constituents.
I welcome the tabling of these documents and their formally being brought into effect. I reiterate the importance of the Senate and the House of Representatives taking a similar action in the future in relation to a warrant that may have been acquired by a state based police office. Parliamentary protection and the confidentiality between members and their constituents must be protected in those cases as well.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
I realise it is not overly common to take note of documents like these but I thought, given the program we have this afternoon, it would not be too problematic to spend a few minutes briefly noting their contents. The Treasurer, as I understand it, today tabled in the other place legislation relating to this matter—the tsunami assistance legislation—and I thought it appropriate, given the historic nature of the commitment to this issue of not just the federal government but indeed the Australian people as a whole, to make a few comments on the matter.
The federal government’s overall contribution, according to reported statements, for tsunami assistance will be in the order of $1.3 billion, which is a very significant contribution in anybody’s language. I commented on the public record at the time of the tsunami that I was sure that government contributions would be forthcoming beyond the initial amount and that the real focus was on encouraging the public to give as much as possible while the issue was before them in such a graphic way.
The challenge after that phase is to follow through and make sure that all of that assistance is delivered as effectively as possible and to continue to focus on the long-term needs of the people, the communities and the nations affected. We all know that it will be many years before the areas affected fully recover from this. In many respects people directly affected, including Australians and many other people around our region, will in some ways never recover, particularly from their personal losses. The death toll is staggering, the number of people made homeless or displaced is even more staggering and the impact is in many ways literally inconceivable.
Nonetheless, the enormous response from the Australian community should be acknowledged. I understand that Australia has committed more per head of population than any other nation in the world and that the public contribution is over one-quarter of a billion dollars. The government’s contribution, as I mentioned, is also unprecedented in its significance. I also wanted to comment on this because I believe this presents the opportunity for a real shift in public attitudes and government approaches towards development assistance and foreign aid assistance.
We all hear the comments that charity should begin at home and we should fix up our problems here first. Of course we need to make sure that problems in Australia are given appropriate attention. But I hope that this tragedy has made clear how valuable it is to the entire human community and the community of our wider region when we provide ongoing assistance to help other people through immediate difficulties and to assist them more broadly to develop their communities, economies and societies in a way that increases their stability and security. That is inevitably in our national interest as well. I hope that this provides an opportunity for an increased contribution from the Australian government and the Australian community to development assistance and to greater consideration of the wide-ranging needs of our region—not just the Indian Ocean region affected by the tsunami but other countries to our north and east. Pacific Island nations also have a significant need for ongoing assistance and understanding. We could do a lot more than just providing money.
The other big test for the government—and for the various agencies that have been the recipients of the hundreds of millions of private donations from Australians—in spending the large amounts of money that will be appropriated is to demonstrate that the assistance is provided effectively. Nothing could be more damaging after such a huge outpouring of generosity and genuine human concern than for stories to come through of the money being misused or wasted.
This tragedy and the generosity that has flowed from it provide a real opportunity for a shift in consciousness towards a more positive attitude of considering other countries in our region, almost all of whom are nowhere near as fortunate as we are here in Australia. But there is the hidden danger as well, the flip side of that coin—that, if this opportunity is squandered, attitudes may harden in the future. Certainly we have seen examples in the past of significant amounts of public donations going to areas and being spent in ways that have not seemed to make the difference that people thought they would. That can be counterproductive, not just in that the people whom we are trying to help are not helped but in that people are less willing to give a second time or a third time.
It is in many ways a crucial time with this package, the particulars of which have just been presented to the Senate and will be debated later on via the legislation when it gets here. Because of its significance, I think it is appropriate to draw attention to it. I note that half of the $1 billion package specifically aimed at Indonesia is a long-term interest-free loan. Nonetheless, it is obviously a significant amount of assistance. The initial meeting to consider how it will be spent is yet to happen. We certainly do not want to rush things unnecessarily, but we do need to make sure that it is provided as promptly but effectively as possible.
I think it behoves all of us to try and continue to monitor the expenditure of this money over the years to ensure that it provides maximum value, not just for the benefit, obviously, of the people it is meant to help or for the long-term security of our region but because of the opportunity it provides for this not to be the be-all and end-all of ongoing assistance. Perhaps it will signal a renewed commitment to increased financial, social and political support to other countries in our region, most of whom do not have the benefits and the prosperity that our nation is so fortunate to have.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-03-09,"—On behalf of the Economics Legislation Committee, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Bill 2005, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In tabling this report, I want to make a few remarks about an issue arising in relation to schedule 3 of the bill. Schedule 3 of the bill, if passed, would amend the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. It would increase the amount that companies undertaking new exploration for oil and gas in designated frontier areas can claim for the purposes of determining their resource rent tax liability. Petroleum resource rent tax was introduced in 1987 with the intention of ensuring that the Australian community received an appropriate share of the large returns that can follow the development of rich oil and gas deposits, while ensuring that companies that explore for and develop these resources receive an adequate return on their investment. It applies to offshore areas under Commonwealth jurisdiction, with the exception of the North West Shelf, where a revenue-sharing agreement between the Commonwealth and the Western Australian government is in place.
Australia both imports and exports oil. Imports exceed exports by a substantial margin. In 2003-04, 23,649 million litres were imported and 17,660 million litres were exported. This margin is expected to widen such that the proportion of imported oil in primary consumption will rise from 37 per cent in 1998-99 to 52 per cent in 2019-20. This change results from a combination of increasing domestic demand and declining domestic reserves. Australia has substantial natural gas reserves but limited and declining oil reserves.
Australian gas reserves represent about 2.2 per cent of the world’s total but oil reserves account for only 0.4 per cent of global reserves. Nonetheless, Australia has thus far enjoyed a high level of self-sufficiency in oil and gas, at least for the last three decades. However, the rate of new discoveries of oil and gas has lagged behind rising domestic demand. We are increasingly dependent on imported oil. Reserves peaked in 1994, declined by 19 per cent by the year 2000 and are continuing to decline. Australia’s current reserves of crude oil totalled 819 million barrels with a further 671 million barrels of condensate as at 1 January 2003, equivalent to only about five years of consumption at current rates. Production declines as reserves diminish. Geoscience Australia expects production to decline by 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the medium term and then to decline steadily even further.
Exploring for oil and gas is expensive. This is particularly so in the offshore frontier areas of Australia’s coast because drilling activity is carried out in very deep water. Estimates of the costs vary. Geoscience Australia costs a single offshore exploration in the region of $8 million to $10 million, while the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, advised the committee that the costs of a deepwater exploratory well may well exceed $50 million.
Australia is also considered a risky place to explore. Success rates are low compared with other countries. Australia ranks 46th in the world in exploration-drilling success, with a commercial success rate of a little over six per cent. This compares with other locations such as Malaysia, with a commercial success rate of over 50 per cent, and Angola, with over 40 per cent. Nonetheless, substantial sums of money continue to be spent on exploration for oil and gas in this country. In 2002-04, explorers spent a total of $995 million. The amount spent fluctuates from year to year. The total spent in 2002-03 represented a 14.7 per cent increase over that spent in 1998-99. However, the overall trend for the last two decades has been for the levels of exploration to decline, particularly when the number of wells drilled and the quantity of seismic surveys carried out are considered. That trend can be expected to continue.
While exploration has declined, there appears, nonetheless, to be further exploration potential for new petroleum resources. Australia has 40 offshore basins, of which half remain unexplored. The measure considered by the committee recognises the need to extend exploration into areas previously unexplored. The government has indicated that, when specifying designated frontier areas, the relevant minister is likely to favour those areas which are at least 100 kilometres from a commercialised oil discovery and not adjacent to an area designated in the previous year’s acreage release.
In these circumstances, there is international competition for the exploration dollar. This is where the rates of taxation applying to commodities are quite important, particularly when the rate of exploration in this country continues to decline. During the course of its inquiry, the committee’s attention was drawn to the differential rates of taxation that apply in relation to different parts of the resource sector. Offshore oil and gas may be subject to petroleum resource rent tax and, in this time of very high oil prices, taxation of windfall gains from established fields such as the Gippsland oilfield seems entirely reasonable. However, there is no equivalent tax on coal, despite the very heavy prices that industry is enjoying at the moment—and neither is there any tax on renewables such as water for hydro power.
APPEA were clearly not happy with the way the resource rent tax was applied in this country. They argued that there was a case for having a level playing field across all energy resources. To quote Mr Jones of APPEA:
If the decision is that there should be some sort of resource use tax—which is the case, both for mining and petroleum—and if this resource tax is based on the grounds that these are public resources, community resources, being used by industry for a commercial reason and a public benefit, then it should be a level playing field for everyone—and that does not exist, even within the fossil fuel sector—and it should cover everyone.
He went on to say that he thought that the petroleum resource rent tax, as currently applied, was not entirely consistent in how it treats risk in the petroleum sector. Levelling the playing field in relation to resource taxation would not be an easy task. There are a number of important externalities that would have to be taken into account—for example, Mr Jones referred to the public good of discovering new oil resources in this country. That is true in the sense that, unless more oil is found, the import bill will steadily rise in the years to come.
The committee is of the view that these issues need to be examined. It considers that there is a persuasive case for considering the differential taxation treatment within sectors of the resources industry as well as factors that affect its international competitiveness. The committee therefore, in recommending that the bill be passed in its entirety, is also making a further recommendation—that is, that the government institute a public inquiry into the impact of differential tax regimes in the resources sector, in particular with a view to identifying and removing any anomalies arising from differential tax treatments within the sector.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-03-09,"—Before I was so rudely interrupted by question time and other business, I was discussing some of the inequities not addressed in the Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005—inequities concerning the issue of family payments and the government’s social welfare system generally. That is why I think Labor remain very firmly committed to the single family payment—the consistent income test for all Australian families. We believe this is the best way to ensure that Australia’s family payment system is fair, consistent and directly targeted at those families who need the most help. Struggling families have every right to demand an explanation from the Howard government about why its policies continue to reward the super-rich at the expense of people who have a genuine need for assistance.
I also want to take the opportunity today to highlight some of the inequities in the new payments for self-funded retirees and aged pensioners that were created last year. Labor raised some of these concerns during the debate late last year on the Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004. Since that time, a number of Australians have contacted my office and the offices of other members and senators to voice their concerns about the inequality that has been created as a result of these new payments. While the first $200 payment to self-funded retirees was paid immediately upon the passage of the legislation last year, aged pensioners are still waiting for the first instalment of the utilities allowance, which will not be paid until later this month.
But the inconsistencies do not end there. Under the legislation, the full rate of the self-funded retiree payment, now known as the seniors concession allowance, can be paid to both members of a couple provided they have individual Commonwealth seniors health cards. This is clearly inconsistent with the government’s treatment of the utilities allowance, which is available at a couples and a singles rate—the utilities allowance cannot simply be claimed twice by both members of a couple. So an aged pensioner couple on the maximum couple rate of pension of $786 a fortnight receives a utilities allowance of $100 a year, while a self-funded retiree couple can earn up to $80,000 a year, qualify for individual Commonwealth seniors health cards and also receive $200 a year each in the form of the seniors concession allowance. People can draw their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that the aged pensioner couple struggling on barely $20,000 a year is in far greater need of additional assistance—
—Talk to your Victorian colleagues about that!
—than the self-funded retiree couple on $80,000 a year. This is another classic example of poorly targeted—
—See how hard it is to talk with someone talking over you, like you were doing in question time?
—Minister, if you cannot read your scriptwriter’s questions, don’t blame me.
—I am just giving you a dose of your own medicine.
—Good for you! Grow up, will you. This is another example of the poorly targeted, bandaid assistance measures that have become the hallmark of the Howard government.
—You will never see things from this side of the chamber. You will never be over here.
—That is probably why the Prime Minister has taken all of your responsibilities off you, Minister. It is very hard to find out what you are responsible for now, because most of your job has gone to Mr Hockey and—
—Sticks and stones.
—I do not know what you do now, except go from one disaster to another—but that is your business.
—Cabinet: you will never see it!
—Senator McGauran, coming from you! You cannot even do the deputy whip’s job properly! Finally, I would like to make some observations about the government’s plans for what it describes as welfare reform.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—Senator McGauran, I would like to thank you for electing the last Green to the state parliament of Western Australia on the weekend, on National Party preferences! I am sure the Greens and the Labor Party appreciate that. I thought you ought to refer that matter to Senator Abetz; it was a very clever decision! But I digress.
Finally, I would like to make some observations about the government’s plans for what it describes as welfare reform. I say ‘what it describes as welfare reform’ because we all know that the Howard government’s plans are not really about reforming the welfare system to assist payment recipients move into employment. If the government’s record is anything to go by then the proposals it puts up will be about cost cutting, pure and simple. This is all about making it harder for those in need to access payments so that the government can save a few dollars and improve its budget bottom line. The government does not seem to understand that real welfare reform is about making the social security system simpler, fairer and more accessible for the six million Australians who access income support payments each year. Real welfare reform is not about cutting costs by simply making it harder for those in need to access payments. Successful welfare reform should actually develop opportunities for the full work force participation of welfare recipients.
As always with the Howard government, its plans are simplistic and narrow. The narrow, cost-cutting focus of the government’s agenda is best summed up by its failed attempt to limit access to the disability support pension. By now recycling these plans, the government has again showed that it cannot tell the difference between cost cutting and reform. Labor recognise that encouraging people to move from welfare to work is a policy objective in its own right. We want fewer people on welfare and more people in work. By helping people make the transition from welfare to work, we can deliver social and economic benefits to individuals, their families and communities, and the nation as a whole.
I will conclude with some observations on the difference between Labor and the coalition in terms of attitudes to and management of social security. Unlike the government, Labor are committed to a fairer social security system which offers the necessary level of income support for Australians when they need it. We also believe that the social security system should supplement Australians on low incomes, particularly families who face additional costs in providing for children, people with disabilities and people who make sacrifices to care for others.
Labor believe we should support Australians in need but also provide incentives to assist those people with the welfare to work transition. The social security system is most effective when it rewards hard work and increases people’s access to opportunities and skills so they can improve their standard of living. As I have already said, this bill does nothing to address the long-term structural deficiencies in the government’s social welfare framework. By failing to fix these problems, the government has again failed to do the right thing by the six million Australians that access income support payments every year. Labor will pass this bill but will continue to argue for a fairer, simpler and better system of social welfare to benefit all Australians.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2004 ELECTION COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-03-09,"—I too rise to speak on the Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The Democrats welcome the bill, which amongst other things makes aged care accommodation bonds exempt assets under the social security and Veterans Affairs assets test. Many older Australians are faced with paying an accommodation bond for entry into an aged care hostel. Having paid the bond, they do not receive interest on it and have no control over the funds until they either leave the facility or pass away and the balance is returned to their estate. The family home is exempt from the assets test for social security benefits. This bill applies the same rules to the assessment of accommodation bonds, the size of which continue to grow. Removal of the treatment of the bond as an asset for the purpose of calculation of income support is a sensible change and represents a fair and reasonable outcome to what was becoming a considerable problem for many low-income pensioners and veteran residents.
We also accept the changes that this bill brings to the child income cut-out amount for family tax benefit. The child income cut-out amount formula provides that, firstly, the following amounts for a year per child must be added: taxable income, the value of any adjusted fringe benefits, target foreign income, net rental property loss and tax-free pension or benefit. Secondly, from this value the amount of deductible child maintenance expenditure is subtracted and then, finally, by dividing the part B standard rate that applies when the youngest child is five years old or over by 0.3 and then adding the part B income-free area, you get the cut-out amount. The complexity of this formula would challenge the best of us, and I seriously doubt that any parent could independently and readily satisfy themselves that it was being applied correctly. So it is with some relief that we note the formula is now to be replaced by a specified cut-out amount, if for no other reason than that it is less complex. We accept the department’s assertion that it preserves the true value of the cut-out amount.
I turn now to the third change brought about by this bill, which the minister explains as an increase to family tax benefit B, in this case delivered as an end-of-year bonus payment once family tax benefit B families lodge their annual tax returns—except that this is a misnomer. From reading it, families would reasonably expect a $150 bonus per child, which would come in very handy midway through the year, particularly for single parents who struggle to meet the costs of raising children alone. Many will not receive it, however. There will be no $150 bonus for them. There will be no bonus because it will be eaten up by a flawed payment system that causes families to repeatedly incur family tax payment debts at the end of the year through no fault of their own. This is a matter that we Democrats have consistently raised in the five years since the government introduced the family tax benefit system. Time and time again in this place we have outlined the difficulty that families incur in the requirement that they accurately estimate their income.
If the formula I outlined a moment ago seemed complex then consider what the general income estimate process is for every Australian family who wants to claim their entitlement to cover the cost of children. The process is this: they multiply the amount they receive before tax, the gross amount, by 26 or 52, depending on whether they are paid weekly or fortnightly; they have to take into account any pay rises or other changes in their regular earnings since 1 July; they have to add any bonuses, lump sum payments, gifts or extra money that they owe or their partner has received since 1 July or that they expect to receive during the year; they have to add the value of fringe benefits or any salary package for the financial year, and they may need to seek assistance in calculating this from the Family Assistance Office; they add any foreign income; they add any income from rental property, that is net income; they add any pension or benefit paid since 1 July; they then subtract any tax deductions that may be allowed, such as work-related expenses; and, finally, once they have added these together, they must subtract their own and/or their partner’s child support and maintenance payments made that year—and there is no margin for error allowed in that calculation.
This does not just happen once a year; families are encouraged to do these calculations monthly. Single parents raising children alone, struggling with work and family responsibilities, are faced with this in order to claim family tax benefit B. How they find the time in their busy schedules to do this concerns me. It goes without saying that families, even if they rigorously apply the previous nine steps that I have outlined, will inevitably be unable to estimate their income accurately. Many future changes simply cannot be accurately predicted. These families incur an overpayment, and it will need to be offset by this advance payment of $150 and likely the next one as well. It remains that the family tax benefit system creates poverty traps. It will be even worse at the end of this financial year because of the anomaly of 27 fortnightly paydays for that year for many workers.
Every family’s circumstances are different, but many who would normally expect to receive a small tax refund at the end of the year, as well as the $150 family tax bonus, are likely to find instead that they owe money to Centrelink. The $300 increase in family tax benefit B—whether it is paid this year, next year or even last year—will not fix the major problems in this flawed payment system. This is a case of the more things change, the more they stay the same. These families who incur family payment debts are neither Centrelink cheats nor welfare frauds, but the government insists on putting them in that category, and then attempts to mask the flaws in the system by paying bonuses, which many will not receive.
In September 2002, the Minister for Family and Community Services announced that changes to the family assistance scheme were aimed at improving the administration of the scheme and providing more choice and flexibility for families. The minister also indicated, ‘The changes will see the number of overpayments greatly reduced.’ Masking the true extent of overpayments by denying families bonuses is not providing low-income families with more choice and flexibility. Just two years ago, the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s inquiry into the family tax benefit reported in response to the changes. It said:
However, the analysis suggests that, even if my recommendations are adopted in full, the scheme is likely to continue to result in significant numbers of unavoidable debts for families.
Clearly, the Ombudsman’s predictions have been borne out. The Australian Democrats support this bill, because those low-income families who manage to avoid the estimate pitfalls and actually receive the bonus will be provided with some short-term relief. It may mean that for one week they will not have to line up at welfare agencies for assistance with the costs of daily living.
The government’s double standards in relation to families are further promulgated by this bill. It is not only low-income families who will receive this; wealthy families—millionaires even—where through wealth, opportunity or good fortune one parent can choose to stay at home, will also receive the bonus. The government pays family tax benefit B to wealthy families with a stay-at-home parent at the same time as it intends to compel single parents to leave children as young as six years of age to go out to work. So in addition to all its other flaws, family tax benefit B is mistargeted. The Australian Democrats support this bill and will continue to press the government to address the fundamental systemic problems of the income estimate system and change the fundamental basis on which FTB part B is paid.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2004 ELECTION COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-03-09,"—I am pleased to rise to support the Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The effect of this legislation is both to honour commitments made by the Howard government at the election last October—commitments which were obviously recognised by the electorate as further securing and improving the position of Australian families and their capacity to face the future with confidence—and to simplify a number of arrangements within the family and veterans legislation and social security legislation that deal with calculations so as to ensure that access to benefits is more easily obtained.
It is worth commenting first of all on the increases or supplement being offered under family tax benefit part B. As senators are aware, under the commitment made by the government last October, families will benefit from the introduction of the new part B supplement to the family tax benefit. They will initially benefit to the tune of $302.95 per year. The first payment of the new part B supplement will be made at the daily rate for the remaining portion of the income year after the commencement of the measure on 1 January 2005. So, proportionately, of that $302.95, recipients would expect to receive $150.23 for that first six-month period. Of course, after that point the measure will be indexed—the part B supplement will be annually indexed on 1 July in accordance with movements in the consumer price index.
There was a complaint by the opposition during the election campaign, and before that point, about the government’s supposed failure to index these benefits provided to the Australian community. But it is clear from this measure, and others, that indexation is provided for, across the board, in cases where indexation will benefit the community. Senator Greig has criticised these measures but not so much the measures themselves as that he claims many of the benefits provided here, including the provision of a part B supplement, will be eaten up or cancelled out by overpayments that are made to people in the course of a given year. This inequitable situation, as he sees it, somehow cancels out the generosity of the measures that the government has put in place with this legislation. I have heard those criticisms by the Australian Democrats and, of course, by the Australian Labor Party, but what I have not heard yet is a clear, concise alternative to the government’s arrangements.
Of course the government expects people to estimate their income in some way as a device to allow people to receive the benefits to which they are entitled. It is a fundamental feature of social security legislation that you provide benefits to people who are in particular categories or classes of need and that you provide resources where they are most beneficial and not where they are not deserved or needed. If you have a simple system you have anomalies. If you have a very simple system, an oversimplified system, you have anomalies. People receive benefits that should not receive them on any equitable assessment and others that may deserve benefits do not receive them. Necessarily, a system which is fair is complex to some degree. If the Australian Democrats have an alternative, I would like to hear it. I have not heard it from Senator Greig this afternoon and I certainly have not heard it from the Labor Party in the past. When they provide that alternative, then we can have a real debate about what better way there is of structuring family benefits of the kinds which are referred to in and improved with this legislation.
As I said, there is also simplification in this bill of other arrangements under which benefits are paid. The bill will make further arrangements to repeal the existing formula set down for the FTB child income cut-out amount. A child whose income equals or exceeds the cut-out amount cannot attract payment of the family tax benefit. The formula is being replaced with a specified amount of $11,233, which represents annual indexation of the existing amount for 2004-05 of $10,948. The new cut-out amount, which will apply from 1 July this year, will be indexed to inflation on each following 1 July. The new amount is higher than the amount of $11,218 that would have been applicable from 1 July under the existing formula. As Senator Greig pointed out, this simplifies the arrangements in respect of child income by not creating any propensity for the system to throw up anomalies or undeserving cases of benefits being paid.
The third and perhaps most important measure, certainly for older Australians, is the change being made to the classification or assessment of accommodation bonds. The government made a commitment during the recent election campaign that it would give older Australians peace of mind and greater capacity to manage their transition to aged care, so it determined that there would be a measure to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans’ entitlements means test. If a customer pays an accommodation bond to an aged care facility, the refundable balance of the bond is currently assessed as an asset of the customer under the means test. This may reduce the customer’s payment or rule out payment altogether. These amendments will significantly improve that situation so that many older Australians will receive more or will receive a payment that was previously not available to them.
Furthermore, consumers who pay their accommodation bonds through periodic payments will now be able to rent out their former home without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment. They will also keep the asset test exemption for their former home while it is rented out. This advance is in line with the current concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. Customers who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans’ entitlement payment because of these changes may be able to have their payments backdated to 1 July this year. All that will be necessary is for these customers to claim payment from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs before 30 September or, in special circumstances, before 30 June 2006. That is clearly an improvement on the present situation, and I think it will provide important relief for a large number of Australians who deal with the issue of accommodation bonds in aged care facilities.
Those are the measures that the government has put on the table—measures to simplify accountability arrangements around family benefits or concessions relating to accommodation bonds. They are measures designed to honour commitments made during the election campaign last October. In looking at the improvements in payments and the simplification arrangements, it is worth comparing what the government has put on the table with this legislation with the sorts of things that would have been facing the Australian community had the election gone differently and there had been a Latham government ruling Australia at the present time.
There is a list of measures that would have very deeply affected the Australian community in that eventuality. For example, under the family tax policy of the Latham opposition, single-income and sole-parent families would have lost their family tax benefit part B—worth $60 a week for under fives and $40 a week for over fives—but they would have gotten a new tax threshold worth only $20 a week; meaning that something like 400,000 families would have been worse off under that arrangement. All families under the Latham arrangements would have lost the coalition’s $600 per child a year payment. In particular, families with a larger number of children would certainly have been significantly worse off under those arrangements.
Families where mum has a baby and stays at home after the birth of the baby would have lost out because they would not have got the family tax benefit part B and they would also have missed out on the $600 per child per year payment. Families not on family tax benefit part A would have lost the coalition’s $3,000 maternity payment because Labor would have means-tested that payment—deserting the idea that the payment should be available to every Australian mother who has a child and takes the responsibility of raising that child. Families who were unemployed or were on low incomes would have been worse off because of the loss of the $600 per child per year payment and family tax benefit part B.
Some families who were unemployed but then went back to work would have become worse off under Labor’s tax and family policy. For example, a family with two or three children that increases its annual income from zero to $30,000 would have been worse off under Labor’s arrangements. Families who rely upon the spouse tax offset would have been worse off because it would have been means-tested under Labor’s arrangements. Parents with children under three who used child care and who otherwise would have had access to the coalition’s 30 per cent child-care rebate would have missed out on Labor’s one free day, which would have applied only to three- and four-year-olds.
They are some examples of how badly targeted Labor’s alternative measures are and how difficult it is in these circumstances to accept criticism now because the measures that the electorate clearly preferred when we went to the last election campaign are being brought forward and implemented as promised. It is something of a tribute to the success of the government’s present policy settings with respect to family support and family benefits that the only way that Labor could devise alternatives and put them on the table was to create losers—and losers on a large scale. Hundreds of thousands of Australians would have been worse off under Labor’s arrangements—even though, of course, others would arguably have benefited. They had to create losers to find some point of differentiation—
—Low-income families.
—Low-income families were the biggest losers in those arrangements. Indeed, it was many low-income families that delivered the victory to the coalition government in October last year, because they saw the inequity of what was being provided as the alternative from Labor.
The measures in this bill are very appropriate. They will deliver greater security to Australian families. They will also provide greater security and peace of mind for older Australians. I am pleased that, despite the somewhat reluctant tone taken by some others in this chamber, this legislation will pass today and the benefits will begin to flow to Australian families.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2004 ELECTION COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-03-09,"—I want to make a few comments concerning the Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The purposes of the bill, as has been discussed by previous honourable speakers, are threefold: firstly, to introduce a new family tax benefit part B supplement effective from 1 January 2005; secondly, to replace the existing formula for the child income cut-out amount for FTB with a specified cut-out amount of $11,233 and a new formula for its indexation; and, thirdly, to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the assets test. These amendments, as previous speakers have identified, directly flow from the government’s election platform. Consistent with Labor’s approach on election commitments, and despite our criticisms of some parts of the family tax benefit policy, we support the bill.
The second part of this bill, exempting the capital value of an accommodation bond from the assets test, is good policy. It has long been a serious anomaly that one’s house is not counted as an asset for benefits but its realised cash value is counted and considered. This is worse when that realised asset is not available because it is tied up in an aged accommodation bond. No doubt many senators have received, as I have, extensive representations on this matter in recent years. The result will be that a considerable number of people, including veterans, will now receive an age or service pension increase. Some may have such a pension restored or in fact receive the pension in part for the first time. In passing I would observe that at least now there is some consistency and fairness in the overall policy in this area. Our support for this item is therefore unequivocal.
Our position on the family tax benefit supplement, however, is one of criticism. The payment of family tax benefits as part of the tax regime has been a major problem for the current government for the best part of the last five or so years. The fundamental design feature which asks a family to predict its income for a year in advance is, to say the least, problematic. Of course, it is okay for anyone with a steady income, and pay-as-you-earn taxpayers with an unvarying income do not have the problems. End of year outcomes are unlikely to vary much from their predictions. It is a different matter, though, when there are working partners and one or both are part time or casual. Their hours vary, and their income often varies on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. The system simply does not cope where income is variable and less predictable. The payment of the supplement, therefore, is nothing more than a remedy to reduce the inevitable debts that have become a matter of public notoriety in recent years. The pity is that it has taken so long to have a system with some features that might remedy some of those problems. We would suggest it was only the pressure of the pending election last October which resulted in the promise of this lump sum supplement. However, it must be said that the government has now reneged to some degree on that promise.
As part of its election bribes, the government promised to increase the FTB part B by $300 commencing 1 July 2005. It is understood that the Treasury costing of this promise was that it would not be a lump sum but an increase to fortnightly payments. But now we have an ongoing fraud. It is to be a lump sum—that is, a credit against any debt can be offset—and it has been cut in half for the first year. Instead of $300 to be paid after 1 July this year, it will be $150, and not until tax returns are lodged with the ATO. So the full $300 promised will not be paid until the next financial year, 2005-06. We would suggest that this is simply a fudge to push out the budget outlays by another six months; but, more to the point, it reneges on promises, undertakings and commitments made prior to the last election. Hence Labor’s protest by way of our second reading amendment.
The other aspect of the bill concerns the introduction of a new cut-out limit for child income and the ongoing indexation of that figure. We note that the new cut-out is marginally higher than it is at present; so that element, at least, is supported. The FTB part B supplement, however, was portrayed as an additional benefit. In fact, it is intended to fix the overpayment problem that I referred to earlier. For those with overpayments, as the explanatory memorandum explains, it will be shown as a credit.
Let me turn to some veterans issues which are relevant to this bill. First among these is the discrimination by the government, implicit in this bill, against veterans’ carers. As part of its election promise, the government undertook to pay a $1,000 bonus to those in receipt of a carer payment from Centrelink. These payments of $470.70 per fortnight are available on a means-tested basis to those caring for a disabled dependant. They must be unable to work and receive no other form of income support. The anomaly is that other carers, also looking after disabled dependants, are not eligible for the bonus of $1,000. This is because they are on the age or service pension. Needless to say, these people feel they have been cheated.
Veterans’ partners often write to me—as they undoubtedly write to other members of parliament—about a lack of support where they care full time for their disabled veteran partner. Often, as I think is known, this entails the sacrifice of a working career or other opportunities to supplement the family income. The point they make is that, through their efforts, they effectively save the taxpayer significant sums of money. Instead of a veteran being institutionalised or nursing services being delivered, the partner performs that task. Historically, veterans’ wives and families have provided the care, with little question and little reward or recognition. I think it is fair to say that this has always been the expectation. Yet, as they say, the disabilities result from military service, and the government ought to be liable. Further, the carers of these disabled veterans believe they suffer a double jeopardy. Not only has their partner been denied a full working life; they too are unable to work, as they are obliged to provide a degree of care to their partner. This in turn obviously impacts severely on family standards of living.
This is a circumstance not limited to veterans; it is true of all those who are called on to sacrifice their own lives for the care of a loved one. In the case of veterans, it is perhaps worse simply because a veteran has been disabled in service to our nation. Hence the observation and complaint that the government has ignored them in the provision of the carers bonus. Clearly, the policy is arbitrary, made on the run in the lead-up to last year’s election—intended to attract votes, but in the clear hope that those who missed out would not realise in time.
The tandem operation of the Social Security Act and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act is messy in a number of places, and there is no particular blame to be attached to that fact; it is simply the result of history and hundreds of amendments made to both acts over a period of almost 100 years. Over time, different approaches to means-tested income support benefits have been gradually brought together. Hence this combined bill amending both principal acts.
One of the great areas of conflict has been the conflict in policy with respect to the definition of income. The disastrous creation of the defence force income support supplement, DFISA, is one such example. I will not repeat my previous criticisms of this unholy mess, but I do want to refer to another downstream consequence. That concerns rent assistance. DFISA is a refund of the reduction made to Centrelink pensions by the means testing of the DVA disability pension. In effect, this is an admission by the government that a disability pension is not income. But, as we know, the Department of Family and Community Services objected quite strongly. The outcome of this unresolved conflict was that the means test for rent assistance remains unchanged. That is, disability pension from DVA remains as income in the means test for rent assistance. What is more, the DFISA itself is also treated as income. It is little wonder that so few understand this particular mess. It simply makes your head spin to try to get on top of it. The bottom line is that there is no policy—it is just ad hoc reactions made to cater to particular demands at particular times.
The effect for those receiving rent assistance from Centrelink is that the DFISA is swallowed up. They simply receive no benefit from the policy and the promised increase in income that they had anticipated they would receive. How perverse is that! No wonder so many veterans and war widows despair at this ongoing up-and-down in their income. It is no wonder that so many are simply unable to understand their entitlements. What was once a policy of legislative simplification has now turned into a deep and almost impenetrable fog. The tragedy is that many no doubt fail to apply for benefits they need, and others may not be getting what they anticipated to be their full entitlement.
I apologise to the Senate for raising this issue, as it is almost unintelligible—I have done my best to simplify it as I can. Indeed, I very much doubt that any minister involved with the decision would have understood the consequences of what they were doing at the time. I simply hope that the public servants who read this speech in due course and who do understand the mess created by cabinet and the government last year might be reminded of the consequences of the decision and the need to keep it on their list for remedial action as soon as the opportunity arises. The original amendment needed was no more than three words to section 8 of the Social Security Act. It did not need a program costing, as I recall from estimates last year, some tens of millions of dollars to administer. Those dollars clearly would have been better spent on rent assistance, so avoiding the creation of this whole new separate, different and additional set of problems. In that context, it is important that these comments are recorded so that we can return to them in future debates.
Before closing, I wish to raise an issue concerning the seniors concession allowance. This allowance of $200 per year is payable to self-funded retirees with income of less than $50,000, or $80,000 for a couple. Entitlement also requires possession of a Commonwealth seniors health card. War widows who qualify, however, are not entitled to the allowance, simply because they have a gold card and not the Commonwealth seniors health card. The remedy is that they must separately apply for the Commonwealth seniors health card. Unfortunately, as I am advised, it seems that a lot of widows are not aware of this and so do not receive the allowance. The suggestion made to me by the War Widows Guild is that the Commonwealth seniors health card ought to be provided automatically, to save these now ageing members of our community the trouble. It seems to me that their suggestion is sensible, but it would be just as easy to provide the allowance to those with the gold card—that is, if their income limit is not exceeded. I mention this particularly for the attention of the minister at the table, Senator Patterson. It would be nice to think that a useful solution could be found to this minor administrative complication. A response in due course to the issue raised by the War Widows Guild is requested and would be appreciated.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2004 ELECTION COMMITMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-03-09,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions. Older Australians and families with children will gain from the two major measures contained in this bill. The measures are the last in a series of legislation based commitments made by the government to Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs customers before the 2004 election.
The first of these commitments is to introduce a new family tax benefit part B supplement. The new supplement will be paid as a lump sum on income reconciliation after the end of the income financial year, additional to the standard rate of the FTB part B—a benefit that was going be eliminated by Labor had they got into government. The lump sum payment is similar to the approach used for the FTB part A supplement that the government implemented last year. The new FTB part B supplement will commence on 1 January 2005 and, unlike Labor’s claim, will be six months earlier than originally announced. The claim has been made by members on the other side, both in the chamber here and publicly. In the election, we announced that this measure would start on 1 July 2005—in other words, for the 2005-06 financial year. Families receiving FTB would receive an extra $300.
The claim that this government is ripping families off is ludicrous and typical of Labor’s tactics of misinformation and mendacity. It never ceases to amaze me how they can twist the truth. We are bringing forward this payment to 1 January 2005. Families receiving FTB B will be entitled to up to $150 more than they would have been under the original commitment. Whatever Labor says—whatever twists and turns and dives with double pikes they do—the facts are that, in respect of this financial year, families will get $150 more than the commitment in the election. They will get $150 in respect of this financial year in family tax benefit and, as promised, $300 in respect of next financial year.
But Labor cannot get its mind around the issue of a financial year. It cannot get its mind around the fact that these payments are made in respect of a financial year. If Labor wants to continue to claim that this $150 is not real, let them go ahead—like they claimed the $600 per child payment was not real. We know what families thought of their claims about that. When they got that money in their pockets when they put their tax returns in, families knew how real that was. They will know how real this $150 is. That is in respect of this financial year—six months earlier than the original commitment of it being for next financial year at the rate of $300.
For 2004-05, which is now the first income year of the new supplement, the annual amount will be $302.95. The first supplement payments will be made in the second half of the 2004-05 income year, representing the period 1 January to 30 June 2005. That is a maximum of $150.23. That difference is the indexation factor. Subsequent supplement payments will payable in the full income year of eligibility. The FTB part B supplement will be indexed annually on 1 July based on annual movements in the consumer price index. However, the first indexation on 1 July 2005 will be a one-off six-month indexation arrangement because of the supplement’s 1 January 2005 commencement, which I will reiterate is six months earlier than the commitment made in the election.
In an additional amendment relating to FTB, the bill will repeal the existing formula set down for the FTB child income cut-out amount. A child whose income equals or exceeds the cut-out amount cannot attract the payment of FTB. The formula is being replaced with a specified amount of $11,233, which represents annual indexation of the existing amount for 2004-05 of $10,948. The new cut-out amount, which will apply from 1 July 2005, will be consumer price indexed on each following 1 July. The new cut-out amount is higher than the amount of $11,218 that would have applied from 1 July 2005 under the existing formula.
The last of our election commitments is to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans’ entitlements means test. This important measure is being introduced by the government to give older Australians making the transition to aged care greater reassurance and options for managing that transition. Under the current means test rules, the refundable balance of any accommodation bond paid by a customer to an aged care facility is held as an asset of the customer. This could have the effect of lowering the customer’s payment or making the payment not payable at all. Now, because of these amendments, many older people approaching aged care will be paid more or receive a payment that they would not have been paid before.
As a complement to this, customers who pay their accommodation bonds by periodic payments will now be able to rent out their former home without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment. These customers will also keep the asset test exemption for their former home while they are renting it out. This policy approach is consistent with the current concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. Customers who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans’ entitlements payment because of these changes will have their payments backdated to 1 July 2005 as long as they claim payment from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs before 30 September 2005 or, if they have special circumstances, 30 June 2006.
There have been a number of comments about the utilities payment to pensioners and the concessions payment to assist self-funded retirees with their concessions. We have indicated that self-funded retirees who have provided for themselves throughout their lives and are now in a position where they provide for themselves in their retirement ought to receive some of the benefits that they would otherwise have got had they been on the pension. One of those is concessions. An offer went out to the states for some considerable period of time. It was not responded to. One or two states were nibbling at the bait on the end of the line but had not got hooked onto the line at all in real terms. We saw Victoria rip over $250 million out of the pockets of pensioners by taking away their concession for car registration and not coming to the table to look at some ability to assist self-funded retirees. In order to overcome that, we have given assistance to self-funded retirees in the form of a payment to assist them in paying some of their utility bills.
There are some variations across the states. I cannot remember exactly but concessions for pensioners vary from about $450 in some states to, I think, over $900 in one other jurisdiction. There is quite considerable variation between jurisdictions in their assistance to pensioners by way of concessions. We believe that we should give self-funded retirees some assistance. The states did not come on board, and that is why that commitment was made. When people make a comparison between the assistance to pensioners and the assistance to self-funded retirees, we indicate that pensioners were already receiving concessions—as I said, ranging quite broadly across the jurisdictions. No such concessions were given to self-funded retirees. That is why we believed it was important to do that. The benefits of self-funded retirees do not exceed in any state or jurisdiction the benefits that pensioners receive before you even take into account the concession assistance that the Commonwealth is giving to pensioners.
I note the comment that Senator Bishop made about the Department of Finance and Administration costings. The Department of Finance and Administration costings, the Charter of Budget Honesty and the revision of the published estimates in the portfolio additional estimates clearly show that the half-year bring-forward of this measure is real. We are talking about the $150 for FTB part B for this financial year. As I said, you might not believe it is real. As you argued, the $600 per child FTB part A supplement was not real. I indicated before that the Labor Party will know where that argument got them. Australian families receiving FTB part A know that the $600 for each child was real and they will know the $150 is real, too. The Labor Party can go on ad infinitum about the $150 not being real. It is, and they need to have a look at the Charter of Budget Honesty and the portfolio additional estimates. If you do that comparison, you will know it is real.
The other thing that Senator Bishop raised was the issue of widows of veterans. That has not been brought to my attention personally. There may be a letter from the veterans’ widows association but I have not had that brought to my attention. If what Senator Bishop has said is correct—and I do not always go by what somebody says here in the chamber, because it is not always right—and it is a case of an administrative situation and not something else, I will have a look at that because it would be inappropriate for people to be having to fill out extra forms.
With regard to the health care cards and the ramshackle system that existed for self-funded retirees under Labor, where it was very complicated and people did not apply, Labor might want to go back and look in the mirror at their own policies and their own record. I appreciate Senator Bishop bringing it to my attention. It would have been more collegiate had he done that earlier and by way of a letter to me. We might have been able to respond faster. Now it has been brought to my attention, I will have a look at it. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-09,"—By way of assisting Senator Allison and Senator Lees, I will continue the remarks I was making during the committee stage yesterday. As I was saying at that time, this amendment will be accepted by the Labor Party. It improves on the amendment that Labor moved in the House of Representatives. The fact that there will be a review will provide some comfort to consumers and to hospitals.
The Democrats amendment goes to the question of the adequacy of informed financial consent arrangements. Labor are certainly very happy to support that notion. We canvassed that during the inquiry into the legislation. That has been one of the concerns expressed to the committee and to the Labor Party by many people. It is often only when people get into traumatic situations that they need to deal with the question of the cost of a prosthesis. Unfortunately, it is at that point that informed financial consent is in fact hard to deliver, because the person is concerned, troubled and looking for the best possible service that they can get. We all know it; we have all been there with our family or perhaps ourselves—we want the best possible thing that can be provided. It is important that at that stage the practitioner who is providing that prosthesis ensures that the decision is made fairly and in full knowledge of what the costs will be.
We are now moving to a regime where there will be out-of-pocket costs for the use of prostheses. It is very important that patients make those decisions on an informed basis. So Labor support the proposal by the Australian Democrats to ensure that the review looks at the adequacy of informed consent arrangements. We also support—and I think it is inherent in the amendment that Labor moved—the examination of the extent of the out-of-pocket costs experienced by patients for clinically appropriate prostheses. With those few words, I put on the record that Labor will be supporting the amendment moved by the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech

I think we have reached a consensus. It is perhaps not as strong as I would have preferred, but it is a consensus agreement, and I hope that it will gain support.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-09,"—I will express a concern that I have had for a long time about making policy in this chamber without the fully informed consent that we were just talking about of all the participants. Labor is not opposed in principle to a broader discussion of the inclusion of podiatric surgeons or podiatrists into the regime that Senator Lees is proposing. But, on a number of occasions this week, I have expressed concern that decisions are being made about major health policy that may have flow-on effects into other areas of health policy. These decisions are potentially being made in a vacuum of data and a vacuum of information about what that will do to the budget. I am not sure that that is the best way for us as a nation to be making these sorts of decisions.
It has been put to me that these amendments will probably decrease costs, and they may. But I would like to see a little more firm data from health economists and from others that I can actually validate and ask questions about before we make these sorts of decisions. I have said, and I refer to the committee report, that basically we agree in principle that the introduction of podiatric surgeons into the regime is probably a good idea. We have talked a lot about this bill of hope. We hope that this last part of the bill of hope will actually decrease costs, but we do not know. I need to lay on the table the fact that we do not make decisions on the run and that we do not make decisions that are contingent potentially on other events in this chamber. I am very concerned that we are making a decision in that vein. Labor will support the amendments that have been placed before us but with the reservations that I have expressed.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-03-09,"—I will now talk to the amendments that I thought we were dealing with before. We accept these amendments about the private health insurance treatment of podiatric surgeons. Besides having very constructive discussions with Senator Lees, the government has also considered the majority report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on this bill. I acknowledge Senator Lees’s strong commitment to working with the government to make a good bill better with practical suggestions. That is her typical style, for which she has sometimes paid a heavy price. Working to achieve what she thinks is an improvement rather than just opposing things is to be commended. I want to say on the record that she will be missed in this place.
Senator Knowles has also shown a particularly strong interest in this bill. I am not sure whether it is because she has recently had some surgery on her foot. Her commitment to health and to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee has been exemplary. She is also going to be missed. Two senators with very strong interests in health are leaving the chamber in June. I just wanted to say that they both have made a strong commitment in this area—particularly Senator Knowles with regard to this issue.
I note that senators from all sides of the chamber expressed concerns about this issue in the committee hearings. In light of the available evidence, including the report of the community affairs committee, it is clear to the government that there is a case for some changes to be made to the bill to recognise services provided by podiatric surgeons. The government has sympathy with the case for services provided by these surgeons for prostheses to be included in hospital benefits. After all, if you go to hospital for any reason, you have hospital cover. It is only reasonable that you can claim hospital benefits. Amendments to legislation last year clarified this for nursing and hospital accommodation costs. It is justified that prostheses benefits should be covered in the same way.
The amendments also refer to theatre fees, which are subject to contracts between health funds and hospitals. There are administrative arrangements to facilitate and improve the contracting arrangements for theatre services involving funds, hospitals and providers but, as a hospital cost attracting a benefit, it is appropriate to reflect theatre fees here. The government notes that nothing in these amendments compels health funds to offer cover for podiatric surgery services and related costs but we acknowledge that they do make the case for such cover more persuasive.
The Minister for Health and Ageing has written to Senator Lees giving certain assurances in relation to the treatment of podiatric surgeons and their services. I am happy to table that letter. The government acknowledges that Senator Lees has some specific concerns about two particular matters: providing equity of access by podiatric surgeons to hospital and day surgery facilities; and ensuring that, simply because the provider is a podiatric surgeon, health funds do not provide a cut-rate benefit compared to, say, a medical specialist.
Senator Lees’s amendments, following negotiations with the government, propose to have the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman’s powers clarified to ensure that he can deal with these issues and act on related complaints. That is acceptable to the government. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has been consulted and has indicated that his office has the capacity to take on this additional reference. In conjunction with these amendments, we believe that the minister’s letter addresses Senator Lees’s overall concerns, but the government is happy to undertake that it will ask the Ombudsman, when the minister writes to him after the bill is passed, to look specifically at them. The government therefore will not be opposing the amendments; it will be supporting them.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-03-09,"—The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004 is a short bill which makes a relatively minor amendment to operation of the antisiphoning regime. The bill is important, though, because it gives the Senate an opportunity to examine whether the antisiphoning regime is operating effectively and achieving its intended objectives. As senators would be aware, this legislation was recently the subject of an inquiry by the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. The inquiry was conducted against the background of considerable public concern that the Ashes may not be shown on free-to-air TV. The inquiry raised important issues about whether the regime is operating as intended and whether it is being effectively monitored. I will return to these issues later in my remarks.
Firstly, I would like to talk more generally about the antisiphoning regime and the changes made by this bill. The key operative provision of the antisiphoning scheme is a licence condition which is imposed on all subscription or pay TV broadcasters under schedule 2 of the Broadcasting Services Act. Simply stated, the licence condition provides that pay TV broadcasters are prohibited from acquiring an event that is included on the antisiphoning list unless it has also been acquired by a free-to-air broadcaster.
At present, around one in four Australian households has access to pay television services. The antisiphoning regime was introduced into the Broadcasting Services Act in 1992 to prevent events that had traditionally been shown on free-to-air television from migrating exclusively to pay TV. The current list covers events in 11 sports as well as the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. Iconic events such as the Melbourne Cup, the AFL, the NRL grand finals, test matches and one-day cricket matches involving the Australian cricket team are all included on the list.
The scheme is designed to allow free-to-air broadcasters to purchase rights to listed events free from competition from pay television broadcasters. The objective of the scheme is to maximise the likelihood that listed events will be broadcast on free-to-air television. It is very important to remember, however, that the fact that an event is on the antisiphoning list does not mean that it will be shown on free-to-air television. Free-to-air broadcasters often decide that they do not want to show a listed event. Examples of listed events that free-to-air broadcasters have chosen not to show in recent years include: overseas tours by the Australian cricket team to New Zealand, India and South Africa; and the French Open tennis.
The Broadcasting Services Act contains an automatic delisting process. Events are taken off the antisiphoning list six weeks before they commence if a free-to air broadcaster has not picked up the rights. The minister does have the power to override an automatic delisting if, in the minister’s view, a free-to-air broadcaster has not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to an event. The only change made by this bill is to extend the time for the automatic delisting of events from six weeks to 12 weeks. The object of this procedural change is to allow pay TV licensees more time to promote and prepare for the broadcast of events that are not taken up by the free-to-air broadcasters. Labor believe that this is a sensible amendment and we will support these provisions. I should, however, probably declare at this stage that I am a subscriber to a pay TV station.
—Which one?
—Which one? Foxtel. If the free-to-air broadcasters fail to pick up the rights to events that are important enough to be placed—
—That’s Packer, isn’t it?
—Murdoch—on the antisiphoning list, pay TV broadcasters should be given every opportunity to promote their coverage to the community.
I would now like to talk about some of the other issues that were raised during the Senate inquiry. The key issue was whether there is a loophole in the regime as alleged by free-to-air broadcasters. This debate focused on the implications of the fact that the antisiphoning regime only prevents pay TV licensees, such as Foxtel, from acquiring the rights to events on the antisiphoning list before the free-to-air networks. It does not prevent third parties related to licensees, such as channel providers, from acquiring the rights. This matter of course was the subject of heated debate between the free-to-air and pay TV sectors.
As I stated earlier, the Senate committee hearings took place against the backdrop of public concern that the 2005 Ashes test cricket series would not be shown on free-to-air television. Free-to-air broadcasters contended that the commercial viability of broadcasting the series had been undermined by a loophole in the antisiphoning regime. In the case of the Ashes, Fox Sports, a channel provider to Foxtel, acquired the pay rights from the England and Wales Cricket Board through its agent, a company called Octagon. Free-to-air networks argued that they did not have a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights before they were sold to Fox Sports. While the free-to-air rights were available, until they were recently purchased by SBS, the free-to-air networks stated that it would not have been commercially viable for them to broadcast the test matches given that they could not obtain exclusive coverage.
The committee heard claim and counterclaim about when the rights to the series were first offered to the free-to-air broadcasters, whether they had the first opportunity to purchase the rights and the reasons why they declined to take the rights on offer. The committee stated in its report that it is not its role to determine the truth of these competing claims. Labor agrees with this conclusion. The job of assessing whether the law was complied with in this case properly resides with the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The ABA told the committee that it had already provided the minister with advice on these issues and that a further report was pending. Labor believes that the minister should release details of the ABA’s findings as a contribution to the debate on the operation of the list.
In assessing whether there is a loophole in the antisiphoning regime, Labor has not relied on the particular facts involved in the Ashes case. As senators are well aware, after considerable public agitation, SBS and Seven eventually acquired the rights to cover the test and one-day matches. Labor applauds the recognition by SBS, Seven and the ABC, the losing bidder for the test rights, that the broadcast of these matches on free-to-air television was in the national interest. One newspaper played a very critical role in this debate and the West Australian newspaper also deserves credit for galvanising a grassroots campaign about this issue. Nevertheless, the fact that the rights were eventually picked up does not, of itself, demonstrate that the scheme is working effectively. The effective operation of the scheme should not depend on a public outcry and/or a campaign by a major newspaper. Labor has focused on the issues of principle behind the scheme. Labor has looked at the fundamental objectives of the scheme and tried to determine whether current practices are undermining them.
It should be noted that debate about the loophole is not new. Evidence received by the Senate committee showed channel providers like Fox Sports have been acquiring the rights to listed events since 1994. Sometimes they have acquired pay TV rights only; on other occasions they have also bought free-to-air rights which were then on-sold. Free-to-air broadcasters have been expressing concern about these practices since 1995. In assessing the case for amendment, Labor focused on examining the original intent of the legislation and the objectives to which it was directed.
Labor agrees with the argument made by the pay TV sector that the regime was never intended to guarantee exclusive coverage for the free-to-air networks of the events included on the antisiphoning list. At the time the first antisiphoning list was released, the then Minister for Communications, Michael Lee, stated:
This is not a list of events that are reserved solely for free to air television. Rather, it is a list of events for which pay TV licensees cannot acquire exclusive rights. It does not mean that these events cannot be broadcast on pay TV.
So there is no question that the list is not meant to guarantee exclusivity. In Labor’s view, however, the list was meant to ensure that the free-to-air broadcasters did get the first opportunity to acquire the rights to listed events. It is this opportunity which is undermined by the loophole.
The explanatory memorandum to the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill 1992, which set up the antisiphoning regime, provides evidence of the original intention of the parliament. The EM states the objective of the regime in the following terms:
This process should ensure, on equity grounds, that Australians will continue to have free access to important events. It will, however, allow subscription television broadcasters to negotiate subsequent rights to provide complementary or more detailed coverage of events.
Labor believes that the reference to subscription TV broadcasters negotiating subsequent rights indicates a clear intention that the free-to-airs should get the first opportunity to bid for listed events. This interpretation was endorsed by the ABA during the Senate committee hearings. At the time he introduced the first antisiphoning list, the then Minister for Communications, Michael Lee, stated:
... free-to-air broadcasters must have the first opportunity to acquire the rights to broadcast. I expect that pay TV will complement and expand the coverage of sport provided by free-to-air television.
Labor believes that when the pay TV regulatory regime commenced in Australia, it was not envisaged that channel providers would be purchasing the rights to sporting events. This may seem strange given that channel providers like ESPN were well established internationally by the early 1990s when the regime was drawn up. However, there are other examples which indicate that the drafters of the legislation thought that pay TV would operate in a similar way to free television. For example, initially the obligation to spend 10 per cent of program expenditure on local drama was imposed on pay TV licensees. In 1999, the government recognised that it is channel providers not licensees who make most of the expenditure on programs. The government subsequently amended the Broadcasting Act to impose the obligation on channel providers.
Labor believes that parliament intended to put free-to-air broadcasters in a privileged position to maximise the chance of listed events being shown free-to-air. This position is undermined if entities that are associated with pay TV licensees acquire the rights to listed events. There is clear potential that the commercial viability of the rights on offer to free-to-air broadcasters could be limited. Labor will therefore move amendments in the committee stage which ensure that the operation regime conforms to the parliament’s intention when the scheme was established.
In the time remaining to me, I would like to briefly canvass a number of other issues which were raised at the Senate inquiry. Representatives of ASTRA argued that the antisiphoning scheme contains a safeguard against third parties denying free-to-airs access to listed events. The minister can refuse to delist a program if any free-to-air network has not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights. ASTRA claimed that this would mean that pay TV licensees would not be able to broadcast the event. The department provided the committee with legal advice which endorsed ASTRA’s position on this issue. However, the effectiveness of the safeguard was challenged by free TV. Free TV submitted legal advice that a pay TV licensee could broadcast listed events without having to acquire them in breach of the act. As the Senate committee report notes, this issue has not been settled. Labor believes that the effectiveness of the minister’s powers should be put beyond doubt. We will move amendments to achieve this objective in the committee stage.
Another issue raised during the Senate committee hearing was the need for effective monitoring of the antisiphoning list. I am a great believer in the ‘use it or lose it’ principle in these matters. If free-to-air networks consistently refuse to show listed events, they should lose their privileged position in relation to the acquisition of the rights. In my view, the application of this principle will maximise the incentive for free-to-air networks to broadcast events on the antisiphoning list. At present, there is no independent, publicly available monitoring of the broadcasting of events on the list. ASTRA does some valuable work in this area, but I think that even they would concede that monitoring the regime should not be their job. The ABA does require free-to-air broadcasters to file returns with it every six months, but neither this information nor the ABA’s analysis is publicly available. Labor urges the government to give consideration to giving the new Australian Communications and Media Authority responsibility for regularly reporting on the scheme.
In concluding my remarks at this stage of the debate, I again indicate that Labor will also support the procedural change in the antisiphoning scheme made by this bill. The extension of the automatic delisting period from six weeks to 12 weeks in no way undermines the key objectives of the scheme. The change should enhance the ability of pay TV broadcasters to promote their products to the community. Labor remains committed to a strong and effective antisiphoning regime. Events of national importance should be available to all Australians, not just those who can afford pay TV. In the committee stage of the bill, we will move amendments to ensure that this continues to be the case. I will leave more detailed comments on those amendments to the committee stage.
I note Minister Coonan has arrived in the chamber. I welcome the announcement today that the minister has reversed her decision to drop the soccer World Cup from the antisiphoning list. I am very pleased to acknowledge that the minister has restored that onto the list where it belongs. It is a national icon and the Socceroos deserve the chance to be viewed by all those Australians who want to watch them when they qualify for the 2006 World Cup and the 2010 World Cup.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-09,"—I speak for the Australian Democrats on behalf of Senator Cherry, who is otherwise engaged. The issues around the rights and access to broadcasting sporting events for free TV and subscription television have been fraught with emotion and the subject of continuous debate amongst many people. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004 proposes to extend the automatic delisting period for the antisiphoning list from six weeks to 12 weeks. The pay TV providers support the extension, arguing that it provides a better opportunity for subscription television operators to acquire rights to events and market and promote these events. The Premier Media Group submitted that the reason they and other entities have used the formal delisting process on so many occasions is to do with the necessity to have the events removed so that their group can confirm both publicly and with distributors that it will include these events on the Fox Sports channels and provide them to Austar, Foxtel and Optus. The Premier Media Group also noted that the reform would have a positive efficiency effect because, once the automatic 12-week window is in place, it is likely that there will be few requests made of government to delist events.
The free-to-air broadcasters oppose the bill and are concerned that the proposed extension of the period for automatic delisting from six to 12 weeks will provide greater opportunities for subscription broadcasters and rights owners to circumvent the antisiphoning rules by stringing out negotiations for rights until the automatic deadline approaches. The ABC submitted that extending the automatic delisting of a designated event to 12 weeks would ‘put pressure on rights negotiations’. The free-to-airs argue that if the list is to be extended then the parliament should address a perceived loophole in the rules that is allegedly being exploited by the subscription television broadcasters.
The legislation places a condition on subscription television broadcasting licensees that they will not acquire the right to televise, on a subscription television broadcasting service, an event that is specified in a notice unless it has been acquired by a free-to-air or it has been delisted. The provision in the legislation only applies to licensees—that is, Foxtel—and does not apply to shareholding entities such as News Ltd or to channel providers such as Fox Sports.
The free-to-airs argue that Fox Sports have been able to utilise the loophole to negotiate broadcasting rights for sporting events before free-to-airs have had such an opportunity. According to the free-to-air people, the best case in point of where the loophole has been exploited is the rights to the 2005 Ashes tour, which of course has been the subject of significant discussion and debate in the community, right around the country. Free TV argues that Fox Sports purchased the rights to the 2005 Ashes tour before any rights were offered to free-to-air broadcasters and then, when they were offered to the free-to-air people, they were only on a non-exclusive basis. Fox Sports argued that free-to-airs were approached before Fox Sports purchased the rights. Frankly, it seems that the jury is still out on this matter and there appears to be confusion resulting from informal and formal discussions; perhaps the perception of the processes is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.
Once again, it has been up to the Senate committee process in particular to examine these issues and determine as objective a view as possible and a view that is likely to serve the best interests of the Australian public, rather than specifically look at the commercial interests of competing operators. It is a process that Senate committees have done exceptionally well—not perfectly by any means, but nonetheless, exceptionally well—for quite some time, and it is worth taking the opportunity to note the necessity of ensuring that Senate committees are still able to operate in that way after 1 July. After 1 July, of course, the government will have control of the Senate and both houses of parliament and has the opportunity to curtail the Senate committee process—the number of inquiries, the length of inquiries or the nature of inquiries that the Senate undertakes.
The government also has the opportunity, even if it allows the process to continue to operate, to ignore much or all of what the committees discover. It will be absolutely critical to try and ensure that that process continues to operate as effectively as possible. It is certainly something that I will continue to focus on, because it is in the public interest to make sure that as many views as possible are taken into account. The parliament is not just an opportunity for vaudeville and soap opera to entertain people, even though it might seem that way. It is actually a mechanism for determining the laws of the land that affect people’s lives in all sorts of ways, and we do need to make sure that it operates as objectively and effectively as possible.
Using the example of the Senate committee inquiring into this bill, in their report on page 14 they say:
… it is not the intention of the anti-siphoning rules to provide free-to-air broadcasters with exclusive … rights to a listed event, it is important to note that the rights were sold to Fox Sports on a non-exclusive basis, meaning that they were still available to free-to-air broadcasters. Ultimately, the decision as to whether or not to acquire these rights is a commercial one for the broadcasters concerned.
The Senate committee report also noted on page 17:
When queried about whether the ‘privileged position’ was maintained where a channel provider has purchased rights (non-exclusive) prior to free-to-air broadcasters securing rights, Ms Debra Richards from ASTRA stated:
Certainly, because the operator cannot actually broadcast the event until the free-to-air broadcasters have obtained those rights or decided they did not want them or do not want to show them and the event is delisted. So they still retain that.
The subscription TV providers, of course, oppose the loophole amendment and argue that the amendment will significantly change the nature of the industry—that, for example, it would make it difficult for them to negotiate multiyear deals. The National Rugby League submitted that closing the loophole would hamper its ability to negotiate television arrangements and make other strategic plans to assist in the development and growth of the sport in Australia.
If we turn to the intention of the provision, the free-to-airs argue:
It would seem that at the time those responsible for the legislation believed that pay TV would operate in a manner similar to free-to-air television in that all content providers would be licensees. The technical distinction between channel providers and licensees was not anticipated.
This belief was supported by the Senate committee report, which stated:
… when the legislation was drafted, subscription television was in its infancy, and specific channel providers like Fox Sports did not exist in Australia.
This is further supported by evidence provided in Free TV’s supplementary submission to the committee, where they note:
… the same assumption was made in the first drama expenditure rules for subscription television in the Broadcasting Service Act. Originally the rules only applied to licensees, but it was subsequently realised that this did not cover most of the entities actually responsible for the content of the service. That part of the Act was subsequently amended to specifically capture channel providers …
But the most compelling argument in support of closing the loophole—as has partly been alluded to already by Senator Conroy—is actually in the government’s explanatory memorandum to this bill. The explanatory memorandum states:
The BSA—
Broadcasting Services Act—
contains provisions which prevent subscription television broadcasting ... licensees from acquiring exclusive broadcast rights to events, the televising of which the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts considers should be available free to the general public.
It continues by stating that subscription TV licensees:
... must not acquire broadcast rights to a listed event unless free to air broadcasters have previously acquired broadcast rights to that event ...
It is clear from this statement what the intentions of the provisions are. That a subscription TV content provider can acquire broadcasting rights before free-to-airs clearly goes against the stated intent of the legislation. For these reasons, the Democrats support an amendment. But while we support an amendment to rectify what we believe was an unintentional anomaly, the Democrats are sympathetic to some of the problems which the current regime creates for subscription TV operators and some sporting leagues.
The free-to-airs have admitted in the past to giving priority to regular programming over broadcasting an entire match or game. The Premier Media Group cited a recent example where the Seven Network elected to leave coverage of the Australian Open women’s semifinal in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania midway through the second set so that they could televise Home and Away, Today Tonight and the news. Of course, if they had had the Senate proceedings on instead, everyone would have rushed across to watch that, but for some reason that has not been put on by the free-to-airs in prime time recently.
I encourage the government to undertake further consultation with pay television and the free-to-airs to consider further changes to meet the needs of the Australian sport-viewing public and the commercial imperatives of TV operators, sporting leagues and sponsors, starting with regular monitoring of the amount of broadcast coverage of listed events.
Finally, I have a concluding comment regarding the FIFA World Cup for soccer—or what we are trying to more regularly call football in Australia. Senator Conroy mentioned this and recent decisions in relation to it. I note the ongoing campaign by Senator Conroy and others to try to ensure that the World Cup football tournament is able to be viewed by Australians on free-to-air television. I could engage in personal observations about the desirability of that particular activity as opposed to other sporting endeavours, but this probably is not the time or the place. I simply indicate that it is certainly appropriate for that event to be available for Australians to watch without having to subscribe to a pay TV operator.
I hope Senator Conroy has not put the mocker on the Australian football team in suggesting that it is a done deal that they are at the World Cup. As past experience shows, there is still a lot of interest for Australians in watching that event, regardless of the sad absence of an Australian team since 1974—but I am sure that they will be there again. It is some indication of the rich tapestry of nations that Australians have come from over the years. It also suggests the strong interest in significant sporting events of a large section of the Australian community. So with those comments—I will speak relatively briefly in the committee stage if we get to that—I think it sufficient to conclude that we will be supporting this legislation. As I have indicated, we have sympathy with the amendments that have been foreshadowed.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-03-09,"—The provisions of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004 have been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee over the last two weeks. The committee received 14 submissions and held public hearings in Canberra on 21 and 28 February this year. The purpose of the antisiphoning scheme is, as has been said, to ensure that certain sporting events are widely available to consumers by preventing subscription television licensees from acquiring exclusive rights to events which are on the antisiphoning list.
The policy rationale of the antisiphoning regime is to give free-to-air broadcasters an opportunity to acquire the broadcast rights to important sporting events without having to compete against pay-TV operators. It aims to maximise the amount of sport available on free-to-air television. The former minister for communications, the Hon. Daryl Williams, described the policy rationale for the regime thus:
To protect the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance by giving priority to free-to-air television broadcasters in acquiring the broadcast rights to those events.
When pay TV commenced in Australia there was concern that major television sports events would migrate or be siphoned from the free-to-air networks to pay TV. While the popularity of pay TV is growing, fewer than one in four households in Australia have access to subscription television. Thus the rationale for the antisiphoning regime remains valid—those who have only free-to-air television can watch the listed events, or have the opportunity to do so. Under section 115(1) of the Broadcast Services Act 1992, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts can gazette a list of events which the minister believes should be available to the public on free-to-air television. However, listing does not guarantee that these events will be screened on free-to-air television and such a decision is ultimately a commercial matter for the broadcaster concerned. That is a very relevant fact to bear in mind in the discussion on this issue.
Under the antisiphoning regime, subscription television licensees are prevented from acquiring a right to televise a listed event until such time as a right has been first acquired by the ABC, SBS or commercial free-to-air broadcasters reaching more than 50 per cent of the population. It is clear that the intention of the legislation was not to reserve specific events solely for free-to-air or to guarantee exclusive rights to free-to-air. The explanatory memorandum for the bill that introduced the provisions back in 1992 stated that the ‘process should ensure, on equity grounds, that Australians will continue to have free access to important events—it will, however, also allow subscription television broadcasters to negotiate rights to provide complementary, or more detailed, coverage of events’.
Some examples of events on the antisiphoning list at present include the Melbourne Cup, each match of the AFL premiership and finals, each match of the NRL premiership and finals, each rugby union match involving Australia and each match in the Rugby World Cup, each cricket test match involving Australia, and each match of the Australian tennis open and Wimbledon. Other sports included on the antisiphoning list are soccer, netball, golf and motor sports as well as the Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games. The inclusion or removal of an event on the list is a matter on which the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has complete discretion. On 7 April 2004 the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Hon. Daryl Williams, announced that the government ‘had updated the antisiphoning list to better reflect the attitudes of Australians and the commercial realities of the sporting and broadcasting sectors’. The new list will apply from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010.
As I said, the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games have been added to the new list but otherwise it has been streamlined through the removal of a number of events, including basketball, overseas Formula 1 grand prix and motorcycle grand prix events, Australian National Soccer League events, the US Open golf and the Hong Kong Sevens rugby. The minister noted that many of the events to be removed from the list have received little or no free-to-air coverage despite their listing.
The antisiphoning scheme is complemented by an antihoarding scheme which came into effect in 1999 and is aimed at preventing free-to-air broadcasters from hoarding rights to live coverage of events that they do not broadcast. The antihoarding provisions require commercial television licensees who acquire the right to televise a designated event but who do not propose to fully utilise the right to offer the unused portion to the ABC and SBS for a nominal charge.
An automatic delisting period of six weeks for those sporting events which free-to-air television licensees have not demonstrated any interest in acquiring broadcast rights to came into effect with the passage of the legislation in 2001. However, it is important to note that automatic delisting of an event will not occur if the minister has published a declaration under section 115(aa) of the Broadcasting Services Act and that the event continues to be specified in the notice. The minister may only publish such a declaration if the minister is satisfied:
That at least one commercial television broadcasting licensee or national broadcaster has not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the right to televise the event.
In April 2004 the minister for communications announced that the automatic delisting period would be doubled from six to 12 weeks. This bill gives effect to that announcement. According to the explanatory memorandum, this amendment is needed because:
Where no free-to-air broadcaster is interested in acquiring the rights to an event on the anti-siphoning list, the automatic delisting of the event six weeks before it occurs has proved ... insufficient time for pay television operators to acquire the rights, finalise program schedules, negotiate advertising contracts and promote the event. Extending this period to 12 weeks will provide additional certainty to industry.
The submissions from the subscription TV sector to the inquiry were supportive of the extension of the automatic delisting period. They noted that the extension of the automatic delisting period will give subscription TV operators a longer period in which to acquire events and make appropriate arrangements for their broadcasting. The Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, ASTRA, supported the extension of the automatic delisting period from six to 12 weeks describing it as ‘a reform that at least attempts to redress the anti-competitive nature of the scheme’. They added that ‘a period of 12 weeks is obviously timelier and more useful that the current automatic delisting period’.
ASTRA acknowledge that ‘the bill attempts to better balance the interests of subscription television and free-to-air television broadcasters and will improve the efficiency of operation of the delisting provision of the antisiphoning scheme to the benefit of sporting bodies and viewers’. They also noted that ‘a 12-week period provides a better opportunity for subscription television operators to acquire rights to events and market and promote those events to subscribers and potential subscribers’.
Premier Media Group endorsed ASTRA’s submission and observed that this administrative reform will have a positive efficiency effect because, once the twelve-week automatic window is in place, it is likely that there will be fewer requests made of government and far more use of the automatic delisting procedure. They concluded that this will reduce the resource strain and time spent by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in responding to formal requests to delist events. PMG described the current six-week delisting period as being too narrow and said that sufficient time is needed to make the necessary arrangements for coverage, stating that each of the subscription television distributors and PMG itself need sufficient time to ensure that appropriate coverage plans for the relevant events are in place.
The committee also received submissions from the AFL and the NRL which supported the extension of the automatic delisting period. In particular, the AFL noted:
All sporting organisations and their broadcasters seek to finalise broadcast plans well in advance in order to make appropriate logistical, operational and marketing plans. A 12-week period is much more appropriate than the current six-week period as it will enable sports bodies to better plan their works and allow broadcast partners greater certainty about broadcast arrangements.
While the extension of the automatic delisting period provided for in this bill has been welcomed by the subscription TV industry, representatives of the free-to-air TV broadcasters indicated that they are opposed to this extension. In particular, free TV justified its opposition on the basis that the extension would provide ‘greater opportunities for subscription broadcasters and rights holders to circumvent the antisiphoning rules by stringing out negotiations for rights until the event is automatically delisted’.
This argument is based on a view that sports bodies will be able to attract larger revenues from subscription TV licensees where they hold exclusive broadcast rights—something that is possible only once an event has been delisted. However, the minister does have the discretion to override automatic delisting. In a situation where a rights holder has strung out negotiations with free-to-air broadcasters with the deliberate intention of automatic delisting coming into play—that is, not bargaining in good faith—it could be plausibly argued that the free-to-air broadcasters had not been given a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to the event and it would therefore be open to the minister to exercise discretion to override automatic delisting. This tends to mitigate the concerns expressed by free TV.
Given that this is a simple bill that doubles the existing delisting period, to a large degree the attention of the committee was focused on matters which were, strictly speaking, tangential to the bill. In particular, the issues of the so-called loophole and the broadcast rights to the Ashes cricket series were consistently raised. The antisiphoning list does not prevent third parties, such as channel content providers, from acquiring broadcast rights to a listed event prior to either its delisting or acquisition by a free-to-air licensee. While these third parties cannot themselves broadcast the rights, they can trade them to a licensee. This is the so-called loophole which was referred to in the hearings and which has been the subject of debate for a number of years.
Free TV contends that the intent of the antisiphoning regime is being circumvented by the so-called loophole. Its major concern is that, once a channel provider has rights, it is no longer as commercially attractive for free-to-air operators to pick up those rights because they would not be available on an exclusive basis. However, it was never the intention of the antisiphoning rules to provide free-to-air broadcasters with exclusive access to the broadcasting rights to a listed event. The broadcast rights to the Ashes cricket series were submitted to the committee as an example of the apparent loophole at work. The committee received claim and counterclaim about the negotiations of the broadcast rights. However, I note that it is not the committee’s role to adjudicate on this matter, and the committee came to no conclusion about who had a better or more righteous case.
What was apparent to the committee was that, whilst Fox Sports, a channel content provider, had purchased the rights to the Ashes series, it had done so on a non-exclusive basis. Bearing in mind that it was never the intention of the antisiphoning rules to provide free-to-air broadcasters with exclusive access to the broadcasting rights to a listed event, it is important to note that the rights were still available to free-to-air broadcasters. The free-to-air broadcasters could have negotiated these rights with the England and Wales Cricket Board at any time. Ultimately, the decision as to whether to acquire these rights is, I repeat, a commercial one for the broadcasters concerned. In passing, I would note that last week SBS was successful in obtaining the free-to-air broadcast rights to the Ashes.
Nevertheless, to the extent that third parties, such as channel content providers, can acquire broadcast rights to a listed event prior to either its acquisition by a free-to-air broadcaster or its delisting, the question has arisen as to whether the intention of the antisiphoning scheme is being circumvented. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts should consider examining the issue of the so-called loophole and determine whether the intent of the antisiphoning scheme is in fact being circumvented. The committee has recommended that this bill be passed without amendment, and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-03-09,"—At the outset, let me say how pleased I was to see SBS win the right to broadcast the Ashes test cricket series from England later this year. As others have noted, this is something of a departure for SBS, which many people still think of, inaccurately, as fundamentally ‘the ethnic channel’. Many people had thought that the ABC would end up with the free-to-air broadcasts that are mandated under the rules of the legislation, as amended, that we are debating this afternoon. But perhaps they had taken their eye off the ball. Maybe they were all off at the World Conference of Semantic Prognosticators at the time. They might have been busy that day debating the finer points of an entirely different form of spin—for example, exactly how many ways it might be possible to describe the military as ‘lying bastards’ and get away with it. Anyway, the upshot is that SBS won the toss and gets to take its bat and ball to the wicket rather than home, like its big brother from Ultimo. Congratulations to them. Well played. As honourable senators know, I have had, and I am having, some difficulties with SBS in other areas. But credit should always be paid where it is due, and it is certainly due in this instance.
I am mindful that debate must be relevant to the matter before us. I am mindful too that in the debate in the other place on this bill last month, my new and enthusiastic, capable colleague the member for Bowman had a little go at the member for Lowe—who had spoken immediately beforehand—who was speaking about everything other than the bill. I certainly do not want to fall into that trap. While the substance of the bill is what is before us today, I do want to examine the additional comments of Labor senators which are recorded in the report of the legislation committee on the provisions of this bill. Senators Conroy and Lundy said that they had found a loophole in the bill, largely as a result of public concern that the 2005 Ashes test cricket series would not be shown on free-to-air television. To be precise, they said that free-to-air broadcasters contended that the commercial viability of broadcasting the series had been undermined by a loophole in the antisiphoning regime. To what extent this problem exists in any form other than as an impediment to monopoly rights to broadcast is unclear.
Pay TV is a fact of life. Regulating commercial broadcasting is certainly a more complex affair than it once was because of this factor. But public broadcasters have charters—and get very substantial public funding—to serve the public, not the private shareholders. The Australian Broadcasting Authority told the committee examining the legislation that it was taking an active interest in the question of whether there is a loophole in the antisiphoning regime. I would suggest to all honourable senators that that is good. That is the sort of work the ABA is paid to perform and which it will continue to perform in its new and expanded role after 1 July.
In terms of the general sweep of the antisiphoning provisions, this amending bill is minor. Its purpose is to extend the automatic delisting of an event from six weeks to 12 weeks before it occurs to ensure that pay television operators have sufficient time to acquire the rights—if they wish to do so—to finalise program schedules, negotiate advertising contracts and promote the event. In a strong pay TV environment, that is only fair. Antisiphoning rules were imposed because there was concern, when pay TV commenced in Australia, that major television sports events would migrate, or be siphoned, from the free-to-air networks. The scheme exists, as the former minister for communications, the Hon. Daryl Williams QC, stated last year, to protect the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance on free-to-air television by giving priority to free-to-air television broadcasters in acquiring the broadcast rights of those events.
That is very sensible public policy and it is a policy that no-one could legitimately complain about. It works by preventing pay TV operators from siphoning off television coverage of these events—the ‘listed’ events—before free-to-air broadcasters have had an opportunity to obtain the broadcasting rights. The six-week automatic delisting period, which is triggered by circumstances in which free-to-air broadcasters have not picked up broadcast rights, came into effect with the passage of legislation in 2001. In April last year, the then minister announced that the automatic delisting period would be extended to 12 weeks. This bill gives effect to that decision. The original legislation, which was introduced in 1992, never intended to reserve specific events exclusively for free-to‑air television or to guarantee exclusive rights to them. Thus the antisiphoning scheme does not give free-to-air broadcasters exclusive access to the broadcasting rights to a listed event—they are all sporting events, incidentally—but provides a priority to acquiring those rights if they choose. They are not obliged to acquire the rights. To that extent it is a free market, albeit one that is regulated to the extent that the rights of all Australians to access free-to-air broadcasts of important events are protected.
Under the existing legislation, and under the amended legislation as proposed, if a free-to-air broadcaster acquires the rights to broadcast an event, a pay TV operator may also acquire a right to broadcast the same event. It is interesting in the context of today’s debate that the government will add the 2010 FIFA World Cup—the world game that SBS has done so much to promote here in Australia—to the list of events protected under the antisiphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. As the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts said in her media statement on the matter issued this afternoon, the listing of this event ensures that Australia’s free-to-air broadcasters will have an opportunity to acquire broadcast rights. The 1992 legislation was designed to create a process that would ensure on equity grounds that Australians would continue to have free access to important events. That provision, under this bill, is still robustly in place.
This government stands for enterprise, entrepreneurship and competition, and it does so unashamedly. But it does so in the context of this legislation with a strong sense of the need to protect the rights of Australians who do not have access to pay TV—and only a quarter of Australians do. Free-to-air television in this country is, by a margin of three to two, predominantly a wholly commercial operation. The three commercial networks operate in a high-cost commercial environment. The ABC and SBS are our public broadcasters, funded by the taxpayer. As mentioned before, they have charter obligations to the people, and quite properly so. It is this environment in which we must operate as legislators, and it is in that context that we should assess commentary by pay TV operators about the antisiphoning rules. In that context, I note the comments made in April last year by the Hon. Nick Greiner, the Chairman of the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, the peak body representing subscription television. Mr Greiner was disappointed that the government had not adopted a ‘use it or lose it’ approach to antisiphoning. He said:
The government’s move to extend the automatic de-listing from six weeks to 12 weeks is a step forward, but the overall changes do not address fundamental problems with the scheme. The new list still includes a large range of events which are never covered by the free-to-air television networks. There is no logical reason why they should remain there.
I should say before I make the following statement that the Hon. Nick Greiner is one of the outstanding former legislators of this country and a very sensible person. It was a real pleasure to interact with him in the course of the inquiry, in which I participated, an inquiry so ably led by my senatorial colleague Senator Eggleston, who spoke before me. But I would say to the Hon. Nick Greiner that what he stated is not really the case. Circumstances change and, more importantly, audiences demand change. I see one of my honourable colleagues opposite smiling at me in a benign and agreeing way, obviously seeing how reasonable most of us, if not all of us, on this side of the house can be when considering and debating sensitive and important issues such as the one we are debating tonight.
It would not be good policy to strike from the antisiphoning list everything that, to this point, the free-to-air sector has not taken up. To do so, as I am sure the proponents of such action understand very well indeed, would be to effectively corral an ever-expanding compendium of events for the benefit of pay TV and its audiences. There is broad support for the existing arrangements, and, except for quibbling around the edges of the debate, that support extends across the broad spectrum of political views contained within our parliament, including in this chamber. I think that is a good thing.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-03-09,"—I thank all senators for their contributions and comments in relation to this important bill. It is now my pleasure to sum up the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004. In April 2004 the government announced changes to the antisiphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. In the government’s view the antisiphoning scheme, despite its complexities—and I think we all have to acknowledge those—is still needed. With fewer than one in four households having access to subscription television at this time, it remains important to ensure that as many viewers as possible are able to access events of national significance and cultural importance on free-to-air television.
In addition to extending the antisiphoning scheme and developing a revised list of events, the government committed to extending the automatic delisting period from six to 12 weeks, as has been noted by earlier speakers. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004, which gives effect to that commitment, is designed to improve the efficiency of the operation of the delisting provisions of the antisiphoning scheme to the benefit of sporting bodies and viewers. Extending the automatic delisting period to 12 weeks will allow pay TV operators a reasonable opportunity to acquire broadcasting rights, to arrange coverage and indeed to market the programs to viewers.
Of course, it remains possible for events to be delisted earlier than the automatic period by making an application to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In that instance, the minister may remove a particular event from the antisiphoning list—for example, if the minister is satisfied that the free-to-air broadcasters have had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights but have declined to do so. Critically, for current purposes, the existing protections for free-to-air viewers remain in place. The minister will retain the ability to keep an event on the antisiphoning list beyond the automatic delisting period if the free-to-air broadcasters have not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the free-to-air rights to that event.
I want to say a couple of words in respect of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. It is true that there have been a number of representations to the government in respect of this particular event. The government has always stated that it is continuing to monitor the operation of the antisiphoning scheme to ensure that it reflects the attitudes of Australians and of course the commercial realities of the sporting and broadcasting sectors. The antisiphoning list is designed to protect a limited range of events which are considered to be of national importance and cultural significance. This is a select list, and events should not be added to it unless they meet the criteria for protection. As I said, there have been a number of representations. There have been calls from soccer fans for the 2010 FIFA World Cup soccer to be included on the antisiphoning list. Those who follow these matters closely will of course recall that the 2002 event and the 2006 event had previously been listed.
The government has considered the issue again in the light of all these circumstances and according to the criteria and principles that I have just described. We have decided that it would be appropriate to include the 2010 World Cup soccer on the antisiphoning list. As I announced today, I will be taking the necessary steps to have the event included on the list as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that the inclusion of the event will have an impact on the pay television sector. I remind those people listening and those interested in these matters that the inclusion of an event on the list does not necessarily mean that the event will be shown free to air or that it will be broadcast live or in full. But it does preserve a right of first refusal for the free-to-airs to bid for. What it means is that free-to-air broadcasters have a real chance to acquire the rights to the event if they are interested in doing so. Whether or not they wish to do so is of course a commercial matter for them.
I am also aware that Senator Conroy proposes to move shortly an amendment in respect of what is referred to—incorrectly, I think, but it does have some currency—as a loophole. I have a number of comments in respect of that matter and signal that the government will not be supporting the amendment. Senator Conroy has indicated that he wishes to make some comments in relation to the rationale for the amendment, and the basis upon which Labor moves it, during the committee stage. I reserve my comments until the committee stage but otherwise thank all those who contributed to this debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The annual report from the Migration Agents Registration Authority is reasonably late in the piece, due, I understand, to issues within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I followed the development of the Migration Agents Registration Authority with some interest, in part because it was the first significant piece of legislation I had to deal with at relatively short notice when I first came into the Senate back in 1997. Therefore it has been of personal interest to me to see how things have panned out since then. It has been an area of continuing contention. Many members of parliament, both in the Senate and in the lower house, would have had experience with constituents with migration problems and issues. The Migration Act is an area of law that affects literally millions of Australians in all sorts of ways, mostly without too much of a problem. But, as within many areas of the law, when you run into difficulties it can be extremely difficult.
The migration agent profession is still developing and, in many ways, it is still in its infancy. But, because of the way the Migration Act can impact on people’s lives and futures, it is a very significant one. People need quality advice, many times, to get the best outcome and to get their rights enforced. They need to be confident that they will get good advice from people who hold themselves out to be migration agents. They need to be confident that there is some form of redress if they run into difficulties. It is worth noting a few things from the report. Firstly, over 3,250 agents were registered at the end of June last year. That figure is up on the previous year. The vast bulk of those are commercial or for-profit agents, but I would like to mention the 271 non-commercial and non-profit agents, most of whom work for community legal centres and provide pro bono advice, particularly for people who are without adequate means of support—refugees or others who have run into difficulties and need that sort of advice. They play a vital role.
The authority, the MARA, continues to provide investigations into areas of complaint and continues to provide a continually developing area of professional education and development for migration agents. Certainly all the evidence that I have seen is that it is continuing to do that in an ever-improving way. This whole area of professional development is continuing to evolve. The authority—and the Migration Institute, which is closely associated with it—continues to ensure that it evolves effectively. We have had significant changes to the law affecting migration agents in recent times and I expect we will have more significant changes over the coming months and years. It is very important that there is stability and coherent leadership in this profession, particularly given the unique and fairly unusual role that the MARA plays in relation to that.
I would like to also take the opportunity to note the contribution of the outgoing president of the MARA, Ms Laurette Chao, who stood down from that position at the last AGM, and to welcome on board Mr Len Holt, a Queenslander, who will go into that onerous and important role. Ms Chao will stay on the board as well. I know they will both continue to make an effective contribution to ensure this authority operates effectively and ensure that migration agents provide an ever-improving level of service to the many people who need it, particularly given the less than ideal way that the migration law is sometimes administered by this government and by the department. To have such a body of expertise is absolutely invaluable. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-03-09,"—I rise this evening to commemorate the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have made contributions to world peace by serving as both peacekeepers and observers in more recent years. In particular, I want to briefly pay tribute to those who served in Rwanda. On 6 April 1994, a plane was shot down as it landed in Kigali. It was carrying the Rwandan President and the President of Burundi. The downing of this aircraft seems to have been a signal to military and militia groups, who began rounding up and killing Tutsis and political moderates. Between 6 April and the beginning of July 1994, up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus—men, women and children—were killed at the hands of organised bands of militia. This was genocide of unprecedented swiftness. Even ordinary citizens were called on by local officials and government sponsored radio to attack and kill their neighbours. This massive genocide and war resulted in the destruction of much of the country’s economic infrastructure, including utilities, roads and hospitals.
It is important to know that Rwanda in 1994 and 1995 was a place of complete upheaval and unspeakable horror. It was into this upheaval and horror that, 10 years ago, the Australian Defence Force deployed the second contingent of around 300 service personnel. They were mainly medical personnel, who were sent to replace the first contingent that was sent some months earlier. The key role of both contingents, which came to be known as AUSMED, was to provide health support for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda. Any spare capacity available to AUSMED was to be used to assist the local people and NGOs. The provision of this spare capacity, though, was simply due to the selflessness, hard work and professionalism of the Australian men and women of both contingents.
Rwanda remains one of the most difficult peacekeeping deployments ever faced by individuals within the Australian Defence Force. This is due to the scale and seemingly indiscriminate nature of the genocide. At the Kibeho refugee camp alone, between 2,000 and 8,000 men, women and children were slaughtered and thousands more were wounded in April 1995. ADF personnel were witnesses to this slaughter. They were armed but unable and not permitted to intervene. They were under orders not to fire on those perpetrating the massacre.
The Rwandan Patriotic Army, the RPA, reportedly conducted executions under the noses of UN personnel in order to goad them into a fire fight. Had this happened, the vastly stronger RPA would have wiped out the UN and NGO presence. The RPA would then have been able to get on with its gruesome work unobserved and unrecorded. It would have also wiped out the source of medical treatment to those being set upon by the RPA.
It is a tribute to the professionalism of those United Nations troops, particularly the ADF participants, that they resisted the urge to open fire or to participate to prevent the massacre. The indiscriminate cruelty and horror made Rwanda a most difficult deployment. ADF personnel also had to match their limited medical resources with a seemingly limitless number of wounded. Many accounts speak of ADF personnel having to play God by deciding which patients’ lives to save. It is probably reasonable to say that the stress endured by our troops in Rwanda was comparable with that suffered in any other conflict that we have been involved in. Such stress takes its toll, despite the professionalism of the men and women of the ADF who were present and serving there.
Research conducted by Hodson, Ward and Rapee shows the toll of that stress on those men and women. It shows that Australian military peacekeepers deployed to Rwanda were exposed to multiple potentially traumatic events. This included witnessing human degradation and misery on a large scale, seeing dead bodies, and the obvious fear of injury or death. This was heightened by the very high proportion of Rwandans infected with HIV. The research also revealed that one in five were still experiencing significant levels of distress up to six years after the deployment. These ADF personnel are people who went and did their duty as required in the great tradition of the Australian Defence Force.
But, and this is the point of the discussion this evening, that peacekeeping in Rwanda is not treated as warlike service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. Instead it is regarded as the equivalent of operational service, not carrying any benefits above normal peacetime service. The real question is why peacekeeping service is treated so differently to other overseas service. The long-term effects on many of those who served in Rwanda demonstrate that the effects can be the same. It is understandable that those people compare their entitlements with those of others who have been deployed since, yet often in less dangerous circumstances.
Given this inconsistency, it is little wonder that so many of the peacekeeping veterans now feel so aggrieved. What is at stake for veterans is not just recognition but the entitlements and assistance often needed much later in life when the going gets really tough. The availability of the service pension and the gold card, for example, might provide the assurance they need. It is difficult to do justice to the case of Rwanda peacekeepers in the limited time available. But I do suggest that, when consideration is given to anomalies in entitlements in the future, Rwanda peacekeepers are fairly treated. There can be no doubt as to the horrors experienced and the effects of those experiences on so many individuals in those deployments.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Personnel</title>,ADJOURNMENT,30,1,speech

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-03-09,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
The evidence or other material on which my findings were based was provided by my department. 
The statement of reasons for my decision, which is publicly available on my department’s internet site, provides details of the information I used in making my decision.
See answer to question (2).
I can confirm that the report is due on 2 March 2005. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does contain provisions for me to extend the period within which the Australian Heritage Council can complete its assessment if more time is needed to ensure a thorough assessment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Environment: Recherche Bay</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,32,1,answer
