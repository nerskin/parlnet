1 DR FREELANDER: To move—That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) increased immunisation of children, which is essential for protecting them against diseases including pneumonia, polio, rotavirus diarrhoea, meningococcal and measles now saves the lives of 2 to 3 million children per year but, nevertheless, 1.5 million children still die each year from vaccine-preventable diseases;


(b) in 2017, 85 per cent of children globally received the full course of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine, a key measure of vaccine coverage, however, this left nearly 20 million children not covered by this vaccine;


(c) globally, 85 per cent of children receive the polio vaccine, however, gaps in polio vaccine coverage allow some children to contract the disease, with 13 cases in 2018 so far;


(d) Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to which Australia has been a consistent contributor, has supported the vaccination of more than 640 million children, and saved an estimated 9 million lives; and


(e) in December 2018, Gavi will hold a mid-term review to assess what changes to its strategy are needed to achieve increased and equitable access to vaccines;


(2) recognises that:


(a) Australia co-sponsored a resolution at the Seventieth World Health Assembly in 2017 to accelerate access to vaccines, calling for the extension of immunisation services beyond infancy, increasing domestic financing, and strengthening international cooperation to achieve global vaccination goals; and


(b) current funding by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), to which Australia contributes, is due to decline significantly as polio nears eradication—this funding covers one fifth of the World Health Organisation's costs, and accounts for a high proportion of the health and vaccination workforce in several countries; and


(3) calls on the Government to:


(a) participate in planning to accelerate progress in making vaccines available to all children, including through the Gavi mid-term review; and


(b) work with countries now receiving polio support and with multilateral agencies to ensure that transition from GPEI funding results in increased resources for other health and vaccinations programs.

3 MR HILL: To move—That this House:


(1) notes Australia's proud legacy of working for peace and democracy in Cambodia, led by the work of the former Labor Foreign Minister the Hon. Gareth Evans QC in fostering the Paris Peace Accords in 1991;


(2) reiterates that as a longstanding friend of Cambodia and the Cambodian people, Australia must continue to urge the Cambodian Government to take steps to allow free and open political debate without violence and intimidation;


(3) condemns the sham election in Cambodia last month and expresses grave concern that:


(a) the illegitimate election may sound the death knell of democracy, reversing more than 25 years of work to establish and strengthen democracy in Cambodia; and


(b) Prime Minister Hun Sen's 'victory' is a sham and cannot truly be said to represent the will of the Cambodian people because freedom of expression and association underpin democratic societies, yet in Cambodia the:


(i) main opposition party, the Cambodian National Rescue Party, has been banned;


(ii) opposition leader Kem Sokha remains in jail on politically motivated charges;


(iii) media and civil society have been silenced and harassed, with Hun Sen publicly threatening a civil war if he lost the election;


(iv) National Election Committee is not credible nor independent; and


(v) official 82 per cent turnout figures are not credible, noting the opposition boycotted the election and international media reported that election day was quiet in many places;


(4) calls on the Cambodian Government to immediately release Kem Sokha from jail and guarantee his safety;


(5) considers that Australia must now consider stronger measures and calls on the Australian Government to:


(a) review Australia's international development assistance to Cambodia to ensure the program is focused on humanitarian and civil society support rather than broader cooperation with Hun Sen's regime;


(b) examine the introduction of targeted sanctions such as visa restrictions and asset freezes for members of Hun Sen's regime and their families, given the reported strong links between the regime's key officials and Australia;


(c) lead and support multilateral efforts with other nations, starting with signatories of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, to develop coordinated measures to increase pressure on Hun Sen's regime to allow free and open political debate without violence and intimidation;


(d) fully investigate allegations of illicit activities, including money laundering, by members of the Cambodian People's Party in Australia; and


(e) guarantee the rights of Australians of Cambodian heritage to live safely and free from intimidation, and determine whether the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme may apply to expose community groups which may be operating covertly in Australia in support of Hun Sen's regime;


(6) calls on the Australian Government to:


(a) withdraw from the refugee resettlement deal; and


(b) promise not to enter into any further such deals with Cambodia; and


(7) acknowledge the tireless advocacy of the Australian Cambodian community in support of democracy and human rights in Cambodia.

(c) provides certainty for investors in new and existing power plants; and

3 MR HILL: To move—That this House:


(1) notes Australia's proud legacy of working for peace and democracy in Cambodia, led by the work of the former Labor Foreign Minister the Hon. Gareth Evans QC in fostering the Paris Peace Accords in 1991;


(2) reiterates that as a longstanding friend of Cambodia and the Cambodian people, Australia must continue to urge the Cambodian Government to take steps to allow free and open political debate without violence and intimidation;


(3) condemns the sham election in Cambodia last month and expresses grave concern that:


(a) the illegitimate election may sound the death knell of democracy, reversing more than 25 years of work to establish and strengthen democracy in Cambodia; and


(b) Prime Minister Hun Sen's 'victory' is a sham and cannot truly be said to represent the will of the Cambodian people because freedom of expression and association underpin democratic societies, yet in Cambodia the:


(i) main opposition party, the Cambodian National Rescue Party, has been banned;


(ii) opposition leader Kem Sokha remains in jail on politically motivated charges;


(iii) media and civil society have been silenced and harassed, with Hun Sen publicly threatening a civil war if he lost the election;


(iv) National Election Committee is not credible nor independent; and


(v) official 82 per cent turnout figures are not credible, noting the opposition boycotted the election and international media reported that election day was quiet in many places;


(4) calls on the Cambodian Government to immediately release Kem Sokha from jail and guarantee his safety;


(5) considers that Australia must now consider stronger measures and calls on the Australian Government to:


(a) review Australia's international development assistance to Cambodia to ensure the program is focused on humanitarian and civil society support rather than broader cooperation with Hun Sen's regime;


(b) examine the introduction of targeted sanctions such as visa restrictions and asset freezes for members of Hun Sen's regime and their families, given the reported strong links between the regime's key officials and Australia;


(c) lead and support multilateral efforts with other nations, starting with signatories of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, to develop coordinated measures to increase pressure on Hun Sen's regime to allow free and open political debate without violence and intimidation;


(d) fully investigate allegations of illicit activities, including money laundering, by members of the Cambodian People's Party in Australia; and


(e) guarantee the rights of Australians of Cambodian heritage to live safely and free from intimidation, and determine whether the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme may apply to expose community groups which may be operating covertly in Australia in support of Hun Sen's regime;


(6) calls on the Australian Government to:


(a) withdraw from the refugee resettlement deal; and


(b) promise not to enter into any further such deals with Cambodia; and


(7) acknowledge the tireless advocacy of the Australian Cambodian community in support of democracy and human rights in Cambodia.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,0,2,speech
"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (09:45):  I present the report of the Australian delegation to the 138th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly that was held in Geneva, Switzerland from 24 to 28 March 2018 and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr JOSH WILSON:
  I'm very pleased to make some remarks upon the tabling of the report in relation to the delegation from this parliament to the 138th Inter-Parliamentary Union, an assembly that took place earlier this year in March. The Australian delegation was ably led by Senator Ian Macdonald and also included my friend and colleague Senator Catryna Bilyk from the other place. Together we participated in and contributed to the IPU Assembly, whose general debate focus was on strengthening the global regime for migrants and refugees and the need for evidence based solutions. It was attended by 829 parliamentarians from 148 countries, which included 98 presiding or deputy-presiding members.


The Inter-Parliamentary Union is the international organisation constituted by the parliamentarians of sovereign states. Its focus is on promoting and supporting strong, effective and independent parliaments as a key feature of democratic governance. Of course, the IPU recognises that all parliaments and their members face challenges and so it works to build democratic capacity and the expertise of its members to encourage dialogue and to monitor and respond to circumstances that threaten the independence and good function of parliaments or that otherwise interfere with the ability of parliamentarians to undertake their work. The IPU is a healthy reminder of the significance of parliaments in their own right, separate from the executive within government. It's an opportunity at those assembly gatherings to hear firsthand from other parliamentarians whose circumstances and experience present both familiar and sometimes wildly different challenges to the ones we face here in Australia.


In addition to the work of the general assembly and the four standing committees, the IPU is an opportunity for Australian delegates to meet with delegations from other countries. The 138th assembly created the chance for us to meet on a bilateral basis with delegations from Ukraine, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Israel. It has become customary for the Australian and New Zealand delegations to host a gathering of parliamentarians from Pacific Island nations, which on this occasion allowed us to meet with delegates from the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu and the Federated States of Micronesia.


In the course of the assembly, there was also a session organised by the Mexico delegation through which delegates could consider the implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The session allowed a healthy canvassing of the merits and concerns related to the TPP, especially issues like investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms, the deregulation of temporary foreign labour arrangements and, if the US were ever to re-enter the TPP, the potential for costly extensions to the current length of monopoly rights on biological medicines.


I'd like to make particular mention of the work considered through the second committee, the standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade. Up to and including the most recent assembly, the member for Forrest, the Chief Government Whip, has been a much-respected member of that committee. It was a privilege to attend the meeting at this assembly in her stead. Through the process for determining a future resolution topic and with the support of my fellow delegates, I was successful in proposing that the standing committee consider in future the role of fair and free trade and investment in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially regarding economic equality, sustainable infrastructure, industrialisation and innovation.


Along with colleagues from Serbia and Ghana, I was appointed a co-rapporteur for the carriage of the resolution through the second committee in future. I'm looking forward to working with my fellow co-rapporteurs and parliamentary delegates in the standing committee at the next assembly to refine the details of the resolution. It's certainly a time when we need a sharpened focus on trade and infrastructure investment that can be the basis of shared inclusive wellbeing, rather than the means by which the imbalance of power between nations is translated into greater inequality, poorer health outcomes and environmental degradation. 


I was also glad to attend side meetings on the urgent challenge of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation and to contribute as a panel member on a workshop in relation to the nuclear weapon prohibition treaty. I support the purpose and objectives of that treaty. I was glad to see the work of ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, recognised in the course of that session, and it was recognised that their origins are here in Australia. The session focused on the important normative step that the NWPT represents towards peace and security. 


The IPU continues to be a forum in which parliamentarians discuss and debate issues that affect us all within our sovereign nations and, most importantly, the issues that affect us in the form of global challenges—like conflict, climate change, the global displacement of people and related migration and other humanitarian crises. I want to acknowledge the work and camaraderie of my fellow IPU delegates from the other place, Senators Macdonald and Bilyk, both of whom made substantial contributions in the general debate in addition to their other work. We were very well supported by officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I conclude by making special mention of Toni Matulick, the IPU delegation secretary, who kept us on schedule and ensured we were well briefed and well advised at all times.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:52):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee report incorporating a dissenting report entitled Report 181:Comprehensive and progressive agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ROBERT:
  by leave—I rise to make a statement concerning Report 181:Comprehensive and progressive agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP-11 for short. This is the revised Trans-Pacific Partnership and has been signed by all the original TPP parties except the United States. The active provisions of the TPP-11 are the same as those in the TPP, with the exception of a handful of provisions.


Even without the United States, this is one of the most significant international trade agreements since the completion of the World Trade Organization's Uruguay Round 20 years ago. It is quite an extraordinary agreement. In that light, Mr Speaker, it is wonderful to welcome to your gallery this morning His Excellency Mr Miguel Palomino de la Gala, the ambassador of Peru. Of course we had the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement tabled in this House to allow ratification last week. Sir, it is wonderful to see you. I welcome His Excellency Patricio Powell, the ambassador for Chile. Australia has a longstanding free trade agreement with Chile. It is wonderful to see that reaffirmed here in TPP-11. And I welcome His Excellency Eduardo Patricio Pena Haller, the ambassador for Mexico. It is superb to see Mexico, one of the world's great economies, the 10th largest country in the world, now involved in TPP-11.


So many of those countries are also involved in the Pacific Alliance Free Trade Agreement that we are currently working through. We're looking forward to bringing that completed trade agreement to the House. I think there will be a very strong association between Australia and Ibero-America going forward. I think there are great opportunities for us—for trade, commerce, education and cultural exchange in that part of the world. TPP-11 is a key plank in that area. 


There are considerable opportunities for Australian businesses as well as for businesses of the other signatories to TPP-11. The TPP-11 will provide considerable opportunities for Australian businesses, such as providing preferential access to the Canadian and Mexican markets for the first time and reducing or eliminating tariffs on beef, sugar, cheese, wheat and seafood exported to Japan. Mechanisms to minimise the impact of non-tariff barriers will be key across all TPP-11 countries. There will be a framework to standardise technical barriers to trade across all countries and, of course, improved access for Australian technical expertise to all countries in areas such as minerals exploration and technology services by ensuring an easy movement of professionals, reducing barriers to transfer of software and reducing barriers to businesses wishing to establish a presence in the TPP-11 countries.


While we considered and did an extensive inquiry into the original TPP—which was report 165, which I tabled in this House—a number of factors warranted an extensive inquiry into TPP-11. These included: the withdrawal of the United States, which is disappointing; the additional research that has been conducted into potential impacts of the TPP-11 since TPP was tabled a number of years ago; and, of course, the impact of the suspended provisions.


One of the most interesting insights of the inquiry is that the withdrawal of the United States is likely to benefit the Australian economy. Who would have thought! That is because the United States's exports to Japan will still be subject to tariffs higher than those applying to Australian exports. It just goes to show that international trade and a country's GDP rise when we move to freer trade.


The committee's inquiry benefited from extensive research conducted by inquiry participants. This was particularly the case in relation to some contentious issues like investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, and economic modelling. The committee was presented with evidence drawn from over 500 examples of ISDS cases. To date, Australia has only been subject to one or two such cases.


The improved ISDS provisions in TPP-11 should prevent foreign investors from bringing ISDS cases against Australia in relation to income, social security, welfare, public education, public training, health, child care, public utilities, public transport, housing and the environment—key areas of public policy debated often in this place.


The TPP-11 also signals future improvements in ISDS processes, such as appellate mechanisms, a code of ethics for arbitrators and the introduction of the construct of precedent within those cases. The improved ISDS provisions mean that the Australian public can and should have great confidence that ISDS will not prevent the Australian government from regulating in the public interest when necessary in this place.


Participants in the inquiry engaged in lengthy debate about the outcomes of the economic modelling performed on the TPP and TPP-11. In summary, the debate about economic modelling was at times heated but not particularly illuminating. Economic modelling takes a series of assumptions about an economy based on previous evidence and casts that forward to predict outcomes in a limited range of fields. To quote—heaven forbid!—the previous member for Groom, Mr Macfarlane, he says that economists are there to make astrologists look good. I'm not saying he's being unkind; I'm simply pointing out that there are limits to modelling that we should all understand.


A consequence of this is that the outcomes from different types of modelling at times cannot usefully be compared. In addition, modelling a complex agreement like TPP-11 in a real-world environment across 11 different countries imposes necessary limitations on the accuracy of what are, at times, predictions.


We as a committee believe that economic modelling is useful as a tool but amongst a range of tools and is only useful to inform decision-making. However, the committee believes that there are enough benefits to be had, especially in the public perception of trade agreements, if the Australian government commissioned modelling as part of the national interest analysis for future trade agreements. Because of this, the committee has recommended that the government, as part of preparation of an NIA—a national interest analysis—should commission economic modelling of future trade agreements.


In relation to the TPP provisions suspended in TPP-11, the committee found that the suspensions relating to intellectual and copyright were widely, though not universally, supported as beneficial to Australia. The committee also took evidence that reimposing the suspended provisions may have an impact on some sectors of the Australian economy. We therefore recommend that any proposal to reimpose any of the suspended provisions should be considered a treaty amendment resulting in an inquiry by the committee. Oversight is always a good thing.


The tendency towards protectionism that we have seen over the last 18 months or so in international trade has certainly grown since we first identified it. Trade protectionism will have a significant impact on Australia's exports and, consequently, employment if it continues to develop and will have an impact on the other 10 TPP-11 countries, as we all progressively move towards more open trade for the benefit of all involved.


Against this, TPP-11 provides an important positive example of international cooperation, promoting rules based trade and investment liberalisation. Ratification would be an important contribution towards stabilising the trade environment, reinjecting momentum into cooperative trade liberalisation and rules based approaches to global trade. Therefore, the committee recommends the ratification of TPP-11. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House. I thank the other TPP-11 countries for their cooperation, willingness and speed to which we can get this agreement done. To the ambassadors in the gallery: thank you, sirs, for all of your hard work ensuring this comes to fruition. It's with great pleasure that the committee tables its report.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:00):  by leave—I welcome the tabling of this report and I join the member for Cowan in welcoming the excellencies from the Ibero-American bloc, who are so much a part of this proposed treaty. Negotiations on the original Trans-Pacific Partnership, as we know, began under Labor in 2010. As we're all aware, the United States withdrew from the agreement, which was signed in March this year. This is a new agreement and against the tide of opposition to free trade around the world. That's why it's so important.


There are modest economic benefits for Australia in this agreement, and it will remove 98 per cent of tariffs in the region. According to independent economic modelling, of which the member for Cowan spoke so fondly and which was commissioned by the Victorian government, Australia gains market access and eliminates tariffs on Australian goods, including nickel, iron ore, copper, steel, auto parts and machinery. Open markets lift people out of poverty and create higher-paid, more secure jobs. There is also a strategic benefit to Australia in being involved in this regional agreement after the US withdrawal. It just shows that all of the countries who participate in this do understand that democratic cooperation, including in economic areas, is very important. Multilateral agreements like the CPTPP or, as it's better known, the TPP-11 establish the rules of the road for trade within our region. Deeper engagement in our region is key to securing Australia's economic future. Tying the economies of the region together also makes us more secure in this country.


The opposition has long recognised that it is in Australia's national interest to engage more and play a bigger role in our region. That is why Labor has announced a suite of policies under the Future Asia banner in recognition that it is in Australia's economic and strategic interests to deepen engagement in the region. There are issues with the agreement that Labor members raised in our additional comments presented with this report, a particular focus on the investor-state dispute settlement arrangements and the waiver of labour-market testing, which I will come to in a minute. I also want to draw attention to the prospective benefits of this agreement for Australia's universities. As Gabriele Suder, a professorial fellow at Melbourne Business School, argued recently:


Free-trade agreements linking Australia to south-east Asia, Latin America and the European Union will help break our reliance on international students from China—


and lead to prospective benefits of the treaty:


… greater access to overseas students and smoother facilitation of international research projects.


On their own, the agreements won't necessarily lead to a shift in the number of international students studying in Australia, but they could dramatically change where they come from – alleviating … over-representation of Chinese students in local classrooms.


Let me say something quickly about the investor-state dispute settlements. The opposition is reluctant, if it becomes government, to sign an agreement that includes ISDS provisions. We have already committed to negotiating to remove these clauses from existing agreements in government. This was a commitment made in the 2016 election and recommitted by the current shadow minister for trade in October 2017. If we look to New Zealand, we see that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was able to remove this clause by signing side letters with four countries with whom the previous conservative government had negotiated ISDS clauses.


On labour market testing, the opposition agrees that the waiver of labour market testing in trade agreements does not make sense. We agree that, before any employer brings in a worker from overseas, the employer should be required to first check and see if an Australian can do the job. As with ISDS, Labor in government also does not want an agreement that waives labour market testing for contractual service suppliers. In addition, a Shorten Labor government—which seems more likely by the day—will strengthen existing labour-market-testing provisions. We've already been successful in forcing the government to adopt several of these measures.


The opposition is also committed to improving the way that trade agreements are negotiated, by commissioning independent economic modelling for each new free trade agreement before it's signed and after an agreement has been in operation for 10 years. Labor supports quality trade agreements that benefit Australia.


Although we're a large economy, we are—many Australians are too modest and forget this—the 12th largest economy in the G20. With a population of only 25 million, we are an economy larger than Russia, with 140 million. It's very important that we be involved in free trade because we are relatively small, and trade with the rest of the world helps benefit the people of this country and raises their standard of living.


I commend Japanese Prime Minister Abe on his initiative in reviving this treaty after it seemed sunk by the current President of the United States and the current US administration. I commend this report to the House.

There are issues with the agreement that Labor members raised in our additional comments presented with this report, a particular focus on the investor-state dispute settlement arrangements and the waiver of labour-market testing, which I will come to in a minute. I also want to draw attention to the prospective benefits of this agreement for Australia's universities. As Gabriele Suder, a professorial fellow at Melbourne Business School, argued recently:


Free-trade agreements linking Australia to south-east Asia, Latin America and the European Union will help break our reliance on international students from China—


and lead to prospective benefits of the treaty:


… greater access to overseas students and smoother facilitation of international research projects.


On their own, the agreements won't necessarily lead to a shift in the number of international students studying in Australia, but they could dramatically change where they come from – alleviating … over-representation of Chinese students in local classrooms.


Let me say something quickly about the investor-state dispute settlements. The opposition is reluctant, if it becomes government, to sign an agreement that includes ISDS provisions. We have already committed to negotiating to remove these clauses from existing agreements in government. This was a commitment made in the 2016 election and recommitted by the current shadow minister for trade in October 2017. If we look to New Zealand, we see that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was able to remove this clause by signing side letters with four countries with whom the previous conservative government had negotiated ISDS clauses.


On labour market testing, the opposition agrees that the waiver of labour market testing in trade agreements does not make sense. We agree that, before any employer brings in a worker from overseas, the employer should be required to first check and see if an Australian can do the job. As with ISDS, Labor in government also does not want an agreement that waives labour market testing for contractual service suppliers. In addition, a Shorten Labor government—which seems more likely by the day—will strengthen existing labour-market-testing provisions. We've already been successful in forcing the government to adopt several of these measures.


The opposition is also committed to improving the way that trade agreements are negotiated, by commissioning independent economic modelling for each new free trade agreement before it's signed and after an agreement has been in operation for 10 years. Labor supports quality trade agreements that benefit Australia.


Although we're a large economy, we are—many Australians are too modest and forget this—the 12th largest economy in the G20. With a population of only 25 million, we are an economy larger than Russia, with 140 million. It's very important that we be involved in free trade because we are relatively small, and trade with the rest of the world helps benefit the people of this country and raises their standard of living.


I commend Japanese Prime Minister Abe on his initiative in reviving this treaty after it seemed sunk by the current President of the United States and the current US administration. I commend this report to the House.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-08-22,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (10:07):  First of all, the most important thing here is that our farmers be aware that they should be ringing the Rural Financial Counselling Service on 1800686175 or the family assistance hotline on 132316, and under no circumstances should they self-assess. There are many conditions that may allow them to get help when they absolutely need it, and they may not realise that the hand of the government is there for them. It's important that they don't rely on trying to assess their own assets and property. There's help available, and we have the resources to help them.


The Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 is a bill to help and to amend the Farm Household Support Act 2014. Under this bill, two temporary changes to the Farm Household Allowance program will happen. Firstly, it will increase the farm assets threshold to a net $5 million until 30 June 2019. Increasing the net farm asset threshold to this amount will give more farmers access to the allowance during times of hardship, which is what we're facing right now. It will help those farmers who have little or no cash flow to access assistance that provides them an allowance as well as breathing room to prepare for and adapt to change. It means these farmers won't have to sell their assets and risk taking away some or all of their future income-producing capacity from their farm. It also recognises that farm assets can be difficult to sell quickly and that during tough times these are often sold for less than they're worth.


Secondly, this bill proposes to pay a supplement to all eligible farm household recipients. That's in addition to their fortnightly income support payments. These temporary measures will help our farmers in need in the short term while we undertake an independent review of the program. The review, to be completed in the first half of 2019, will provide further guidance on the design elements of the farm household allowance well into the future. There will be some lump sum payments. This means that, if both members of a couple are receiving the allowance between September this year and June next year, they will receive 6,000 bucks each, or 12,000 per household. In all other circumstances, the maximum amount payable will be $7,200.


No farmer who lodges a claim for the farm household assistance on or before December will be disadvantaged. If they're eligible, they'll get back pay, right to the date of lodgement, and also receive the supplement. They will receive farm household assistance during the second payment, which is from December to June next year, and they will receive the maximum supplement.


The assistant supplement will give farming families much-needed cash to inject into their local economies. This will also help to put food on their tables and cover basic expenses such as their bills and school fees. As with the increases to the farm assets threshold, it will provide a safeguard for farm families who might be forced to liquidate farm assets to support themselves—and, heaven help us, that constricts their future. This assistance includes income support, independent financial assessment, individualised case management and an activity supplement that pays for advice and training. The safety net supports farmers in hardship while they take steps to improve their situation. And $5 million has been allocated to the Rural Financial Counselling Service so they can go out and talk to the farmers face-to-face and help them through these hard times.


We are working on ways to make the process simpler and quicker for farmers. I have already received email saying it is a little onerous, so we are working on that. We extended the Farm Household Allowance program from three years to four. All of these measures are immediate and on top of the $586 million in relief we have already announced, as well as concessional loans now available through the Regional Investment Corporation.


Many farmers find themselves in a difficult position. In my case, it is the dairy farmers. They don't want to put their hands out for a handout, so we are working to help raise awareness of the cost of milk. I recently wrote to the CEOs of Aldi, Coles, Woolworths and IGA and highlighted that just 20c a litre, 20c a dozen and 20c a kilogram from the profit margin would help our farmers. For the last eight years, the price of milk has been fixed at a dollar a litre. Nothing else on our shelves has remained constant during this time. In 2017 it was reported that the ACCC found the dairy pricing system to be outdated and skewed in favour of the large dominant supermarkets and processors, with farmers enjoying no real bargaining power and limited scope to rearrange their businesses and milk contracts to either accurately predict their current incomes or improve their selling options. The report made eight recommendations, including locking major processors into a mandatory code of conduct which would make milk pricing contracts more transparent, introducing more competition for farmers' milk and banning retrospective milk price cuts in mid-season, which has actually happened. Our local farmers in Gilmore want to have the ability to build their own resilience and futureproof themselves on their own merits as producers. This change in retail price specifically for milk will make a huge difference to them. I think the farm household assistance is just another part of the jigsaw puzzle and helping them get through these really tough times.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-08-22,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (10:12):  Before I came to this place—and I still have interest in it—I was a farmer in a district called Buckleboo. Buckleboo is 100 kilometres north of Goyder's line. That may not mean a lot to many Australians, but it means a lot in South Australia. Goyder's line is seen as the line north of which one should not engage in agriculture. But my family has been there for over 90 years and we have prospered, and so has the community. It is a successful farming community. This means I bring the personal experience of drought to this place. Probably the longest period of drought is around four years—the millennium drought, of course. I think we had six very substandard years over eight years. It was quite testing. Over the years, some things have been done better in helping farmers get through tough times—and I will come to that in a little while.


In 2009, the rains came back—they came back with a vengeance in parts of Australia. Up until the last little while, we have enjoyed reasonably good seasons, particularly where I come from. I understand that the drought in New South Wales and Queensland is very problematic at the moment. In some places, it is entering its sixth year. Where I come from, it is less pronounced. I have communities, though, in my electorate that are now looking at the third failure in four years. So things are toughening up. And we have some considerable soil erosion issues that we haven't seen for many, many years—in fact, since the advent of no-till farming. I'm very encouraged that the government is showing it's listening and it's making changes to drought assistance as the drought unfolds, as I think governments should. I commend the minister, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister on listening and making those adjustments.


This bill goes to some temporary measures that are attached to the farm household assistance. For those who don't know—I'm sure everyone in this place will—farm household assistance is the equivalent of Newstart, except there are two differences: one being that the person does not have to seek work, so they are able to receive Newstart assistance and continue to operate their farm. It's a very important tool for basically putting food on the table and keeping families in a good frame of mind. I mean that in the widest possible terms—looking after mental health.


The other difference, and it's a recent change to farm household assistance, is that the government has decided that people can continue on this assistance for up to four years. Newstart allowance is worth not quite $25,000 a couple. This bill, and the announcement by the Prime Minister a few weeks ago, now makes available two $3,000 payments per person. For a couple, it's $6,000 over the next 12 months. That another $12,000 on top of the $25,000, as long as they lodge up to 1 December. I think that is recognition that this is a drought that's having a lot of impact.


We're also increasing the net assets of a farming operation to be eligible for payments from $2½ million up to $5 million. This is a considerable change. A lot of farms are worth a lot of money, and we often say farmers can be asset-rich and income poor. This addresses that issue. Someone who still has assets of over $5 million should be able to make sure they can put food on the table, quite frankly. I think that's a good and powerful move.


But there are a whole lot of other things that swing within farm household assistance, and some other measures in other portfolios assist farmers to stay on the land and prosper. I thought—considering there had been considerable discourse around Australia when the Prime Minister made these most recent announcements, which came to a $190 million uplift at the time—that government gave only $190 million for farmers, but, in fact, since that time, in another announcement, the total assistance to farmers is up around $1.8 billion.


There are some important things available. I held a drought forum in Arno Bay, going back about 2½ weeks ago. There was about three days notice and about 75 farmers and families rolled up. I had a Centrelink officer there and also some rural financial counsellors. I was very grateful for their assistance. One of the things that became quite clear is that farmers do not necessarily have a full grasp of all the things that are available to them and sometimes underestimate the complexity of applying for that assistance. The golden rule here is: we are supplying rural financial counsellors; do not self-assess. Get some help. That is what the rural financial counsellors are for. They are built into the package.


Other things are available within that package; for instance, $1,500 for a farm enterprise evaluation. In layman's terms: this is some money for your accountant to put together the numbers that you can put on your form so you can apply for the farm household assistance. There's $4,000 for a farming operation to assist with skills training. It might be some business studies or it might be getting your computer operations up to speed. There are all kinds of things that can help farmers. It's very important because, at the end of the day, farmers are businesses and they need to operate in that world.


There's been a whole raft of other measures, including the $20,000 instant tax write-off for capital purchases that all businesses enjoy. The instant write-off now, after the recent upgrade, is for water, fodder and fencing, and that is a huge change. There are parts of my electorate where rainfall is preciously thin and where there are no underground water supplies, including on my own farm. In many places, there is not even a reticulated water supply. That means farmers are dependent on what they can capture on their properties. I've been espousing for a long time that they should investigate the possibility of plastic water runs and plastic-lined dams with plastic lids on them, which basically gives rainwater-quality water on farm that runs at one millimetre.


The figures are quite astonishing, and I've given them to the House before. Eyre Peninsula, which is where my farm is situated, uses about 11 gigalitres of water a year out of the reticulated system. If we were to situate a dam and run-off in a 400-millimetre rainfall area—and that's not that hard to find on Eyre Peninsula—just 7,000 acres would harvest all of that water. It would do it. No-one would ever suggest that we build this super dam in one place, but the ability is there for farmers to put aside maybe a hectare of land and put plastic on it—use an existing dam if they have one, line it with plastic and get rid of the evaporation by putting a lid on it—to virtually waterproof their farms. That indirectly takes all that pressure off, at least on the Eyre Peninsula and in some cases the Murray River system. This is an investment with great integrity. I encourage farmers to do that. With the changes to the instant tax write-off, when they get a good year they will have the ability to invest in something that's going to drought-proof their property for the coming years.


I was speaking recently to some quite large farmers who do a lot of fodder conservation. They have a number of sheds. One said, 'I've stopped selling, and I've got to tell you that, sadly, fodder is running out in South Australia.' The recent decision by the New South Wales government—I bear them no malice—to provide a freight subsidy for NSW farmers has actually shortened the food supply in South Australia and lifted its price. This farmer produces a lot of hay and he said, 'We've stopped selling, though, because we've decided that what we've got left we need to have for ourselves. We've made very good money through this period by selling this hay, so what we will do when the drought breaks and when we grow a good hay crop again is build yet another shed, which will be fully tax-deductible in the year in which we build it, and we'll fill that up with hay so we've got more hay for the next drought.' That is more reserves, more fat on their farming system, and an ability to supply a very important commodity to other farmers who haven't got to that point. That's what those incentives do.


On top of that, we have the concessional loans—the drought assistance and business improvement loans. The government announced only last week, I think, that they made available a swag of extra money for those loans. To give people some idea, there is no requirement to repay the principal within five years, and they operate at a 3½ per cent interest rate. Interest rates are fairly low in the market, but that is still below what anyone could expect to get from their bank. Up to 50 per cent of their debt can be financed in that way.


We also have 2½ thousand dollars for benchmarking properties for access to multi-peril crop insurance. It was interesting that, at the drought forum I held in Arno Bay, a number of farmers said that they'd taken out multi-peril crop insurance this year. They were dealing with the sellers of that insurance about how those payouts might work. I'll put one note of caution in: there seems to be quite a variance between those particular policies. One particular farmer had sown his crop and said, 'Because it has been so dry and it never came up, we actually reached the default date, so it's not considered to be a crop,' even though he had expended all his money on seed, fertiliser and the chemicals that went with the sowing. That's a little note of caution. The point is the government is assisting farmers to get into this area to try and manage these income shortfalls for themselves.


The most important federal government policy equipping farmers to deal with drought is the farm management deposits scheme, which was brought in by the Howard government. In the 2016 budget, we doubled the amount which farmers can put into these farm household deposits. For the uninitiated, this means that, in a high-income year, farmers can put money in a bank account with any of the major banks, and that money will get the normal interest from the bank—which I have to say at the moment is not very much—and it will get treated in the same way as any other account. There is a full tax deduction for the year in which they lodge it, and when they bring it back onto their income books—it can earn that interest while it's parked to one side—it will be assessed at the top marginal rate at the time. Of course, if you've got a drought and you're not paying tax because you have zero income or less, that is the time to bring your FMDs back into action. Those limits now are $800,000 for an individual and $1.6 million for a farming couple. The reason it's had to go up is that farms have gotten bigger and bigger, and many of them will spend anything up to half a million or a million dollars getting a crop in the ground. So it's no good equipping farmers for half a season of input; we need to be able to make them resistant to multiseasonal droughts. That's why those limits have been lifted. I do think, as I said, it's the best policy that a government has ever given Australian farmers to equip themselves for drought.


I might say there is a knock-on effect here too for local businesses because it actually keeps cash flow more constant in our local towns, because farmers have actually got money to spend in the season when they didn't get an income. I recount a story of one of my suppliers some years ago, when I was still farming. I was talking about FMDs and he said: 'Why can't I get that as a supplier? Why can't I get an FMD?' I said: 'It's difficult because we come down to this definition of what is a rural business and what is not a rural business. Have you noticed any difference since the FMDs have come in?' He said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Well, for instance, when it got to about 20 June in the previous years, and I'd had a reasonable season, I used to come in and buy all my fertiliser for next year and most of my chemical.' He looked at me and he said, 'Yes, you used to offload your tax problems on to me.' I said, 'I know!' It was in good humour, of course, but he's right. Farmers used to come in and unload in June to buy up big for the coming months. I said, 'What happens now?' He said, 'It's not happening anymore.' I said, 'I'm not doing it anymore; I'm using my FMDs.' He said, 'Yes, actually, you're right; we are getting a steadier income.' That FMD actually has a knock-on benefit for the farm merchandising and the farm-dependent rural businesses. As I say, it's the best thing available.


That's a big round off on drought policy generally and where the government is. I think it's a very comprehensive package. I do applaud these most recent changes, which are the temporary measures to get people through the current tight spot.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:27):  This bill, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018, demonstrates this government's responsiveness to the needs of farming communities and our commitment to rural and regional Australia. The Farm Household Allowance program provides support for all farmers and their partners facing hardship, including drought. It's a time limited program, and from 1 August 2018 the government increased the time on payment from three to four years accumulative.


This bill proposes two temporary changes to the Farm Household Allowance program. The first change is to increase the net farm assets threshold to $5 million to begin on a date to be prescribed by a minister's rule and ending on 30 June 2019. The second change provides a supplement to all eligible farm household allowance recipients in addition to their fortnightly payments. These temporary measures are designed to help our farmers in the short term while we undertake an independent review of the FHA which will provide further guidance on the design elements of the farm household allowance into the future.


The increase to the farm assets threshold was specifically raised by farmers on the listening tour this government undertook in June 2018, with harsh drought conditions impacting their ability to provide the basics for their families. In fact, many of these farmers have not yet been able or were unable to access the farm household allowance. I will be introducing a minister's rule that will allow farmers with net farm assets up to $5 million to lodge a claim for FHA from 1 September 2018. Implementation arrangements to allow the processing of these applications will be in place from 1 October. People who are granted FHA under the temporary farm asset increase can continue to receive their payment after 30 June 2019 as long as they continue to meet all other eligibility requirements.


The bill also pays a supplement, called the FHA supplement, of up to $12,000 to a couple where both are recipients of the farm household allowance and up to $7,200 for single recipients. This additional support will benefit not only our farmers but the regional communities they live in. The allowance is not about paying for feed and fodder. It's about putting food on the table, paying household bills or putting diesel in the ute. But the farm household allowance is more than a social security payment. Recipients are supported to undertake a farm financial assessment and a financial improvement agreement, which is a plan to work towards improving their self-reliance. Recipients identify goals and undertake activities designed to move them towards a more sustainable future. These features of the program continue unchanged.


FHA also provides access to activity supplements of up to $4,000. This money can be used for eligible professional support, advice or training. This support affords farmers and their partners an opportunity to earn an off-farm income. Recipients will also continue to receive support through dedicated farm household case officers who work with recipients to assess their individual situation and to identify activities to improve their long-term situation. While on payments, farmers and their partners also have access to a healthcare card, pharmaceutical allowance, rent assistance, telephone allowance, energy supplement and remote area allowance. If it is not possible for recipients to achieve financial sustainability, notwithstanding the support offered through the farm household program, the program also supports recipients to consider alternative employment or transitioning away from farming with dignity.


This bill demonstrates the government's continued responsiveness to the needs of our farming communities. By amending the legislation, more farmers and their partners will be able to access the farm household allowance program, and eligible recipients will be paid a supplement in addition to their fortnightly income support payments. The bill increases the net farm assets test to $5 million until 30 June 2019, with the start date to be determined by ministerial rule. It pays a supplement of up to $12,000 for a couple where both are recipients of farm household allowance and up to $7,200 for single recipients. It helps farmers and their partners recover from the hardship. This bill benefits current and future farm household allowance recipients and the communities they live in. I thank the members for their contributions and commend the bill to the House.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:43):  I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. I move the government amendment as circulated:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 13), omit ""1 November 2018"", substitute ""the day prescribed by the Minister’s rules"".


The Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 amends the Farm Household Support Act 2014 to provide up to two lump sum payments and gives a temporary increase to the farm assets threshold to $5 million. This increase was originally planned to take effect from 1 November 2018. However, the government will bring the implementation forward to 1 September 2018.


I'll be introducing a minister's rule to allow people with net farm assets of up to $5 million to lodge an application with the Department of Human Services on or after 1 September 2018. This is a substantial increase from the current limit of $2.6 million. By 1 October the changes to support the implementation will be finalised. As long as all eligibility is met, payments will be backdated to the date of lodgement.


Increasing the net farm assets limit to $5 million enables more farmers to access farm household allowance, remembering that this isn't just income support; it's a complete package of assistance. Bringing the changes forward means that people in need can access the assistance at the time when they need it most and provides benefits not only to our farmers but also to the communities in which they live. I commend the amendment to the House.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (10:44):  The opposition has supported every proposition the government has put forward in this place in order to assist our drought affected farmers in this most difficult time. I refer members to my second reading contribution where I outlined what I believe are the deficiencies in the government's approach and what Labor's alternative approaches would be. Suffice to say that I believe that the government has been a little late to the party on drought assistance and has been somewhat less strategic in its response.


In the second reading amendment just defeated by the government members, including members of the National Party, I did two things. The second proposition was just a general criticism of the government's approach to drought assistance, but the first was an invitation to the government to allow eligible farmers to secure the up-to-$12,000 payment in the first tranche. That is, rather than having the payment happen in two tranches, over the last quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year, we don't see any reason why drought affected farmers facing dramatic cash flow problems and growing debt shouldn't be able to access the full payment up front.


A number of things have made me somewhat curious about these changes to the farm household allowance. They remain a little bit of a mystery to members of the opposition. The first is the very amount. How were the $12,000, $6,000 and $3,000 amounts arrived at? What assessments did the government undertake to determine they are the most appropriate amounts to go to farmers? More important is the logic behind the split. Why is it $6,000 over two tranches rather than $12,000 up front? Then there is the timing of the applications. I would ask the minister, if he can, to provide responses to those questions. I would also ask him how many farmers are currently the recipients of farm household allowance. I understand it's in order of 1,700 or so farmers. More particularly, what is the fiscal impact of the amendment that he's moved this morning? We have another example now of the government moving amendments to its own legislation, five minutes after that legislation was introduced. I further ask him: what is the actual impact of the amendment that has been put forward today in terms of the recipients securing the payment?


There are those who will be now able to apply because of the increase in assets test. The original application date—the date the application opened—was 1 November. The first question to the minister is: why was it 1 November in the first place? Why will it now be 1 September? The opposition has no difficulty in allowing farmers easier access to the payments. In fact, that has been our criticism for four years: the difficulties farmers face in securing income support. But why is it now 1 September when it was originally 1 December? Why was it 1 December? Are there any impediments, notwithstanding the new application date, in delivering those payments to farmers? In other words, will the move from 1 December to 1 September ensure farmers get the payment any earlier?

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:49):  Bringing the date forward was on the advice of the Department of Human Services. In essence, we now believe we can get these payments sorted. There are two elements to it. The increase in the threshold is from $2.6 million to $5 million, and we believe now, after advice from the Department of Human Services, that we can get this done sooner. We feel it's important that we're able to get this money into farmers' pockets as quickly as we possibly can and get the money flowing through to take the pressure off the wholesale expenses for them so they're able to have a dignified approach to the way they deal with this drought. Couple that with those rural financial counsellors that we've invested an extra $8.4 million in to be able to put more people, more rural financial counsellors, around farmers' kitchen tables. They will help them make strategic decisions about their businesses: how they get out of this drought and where they go after this drought.


This is really about the here and now, and we're doing it in a responsible way and bringing it forward. We're doing it because we believe that we won't cause any impediment to the flow of this money. We're doing it in a responsible way to ensure that farmers can get through this drought with dignity and respect.

 (Hunter) (10:50):  I can assure the minister that I'm not trying to be cute or political about the question, but the opposition is being asked to support an amendment put forward by the government to the government's own bill. If we're being asked to do so, I believe it's appropriate to ask if the minister might be able to enlighten us on any fiscal impact that this change might have.


The minister was indicating, possibly, that this means people are only getting money earlier; that may be the case. Given that it appears to be happening in the same fiscal year, that doesn't raise any real concern for us in terms of impact on the forward estimates. But surely the government hasn't put forward the changes without considering the fiscal impact?


And I should correct myself, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell: in my opening remarks I was talking about 1 December as the original application date for those who will possibly now become eligible under the assets change. That date is actually 1 November, which will now be 1 September. But my understanding is that the DHS system will not be capable of processing applications for those who, potentially, are now securing eligibility because of the change in the assets test. The process won't allow DHS to process them until 1 October. The question then becomes: why 1 September? And is the ongoing delay, which is system based, posing any threat to the capacity of those who are coming in as a result of the assets test change to secure the first $6,000 payment or $3,000 payment, whatever it might be, depending on their circumstances?

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:52):  The payment will accumulate from 1 September. The department has advised us that the October date is allowing for that threshold increase to be achieved and delivered with the assessment process that's in place.


In terms of any fiscal constraints, there are none. The government has, prudently, undertaken these measures, along with the other suite of measures that we are putting in place, because there is not just one fix of support in helping drought affected farmers. It's about farmer welfare and it's about preparedness, so the measures that we're putting in place are ones that this government has thought through with a prudent fiscal aspect in mind, and to ensure that they're sustainable and achievable.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (10:53):  The big missing answer, of course, is the logic and rationale behind the split in the payment. Again, we did afford the government the opportunity to change that, or invited them to do so, by way of my second reading amendment, which the government members voted down. So they must feel quite strongly that the payment should be phased in over two periods. That still remains a mystery to me.


If the government believes that farmers aren't sufficiently fiscally responsible to be trusted with the $6,000 to $12,000 payment up-front, well, that's a reasonable argument to put; I invite them to do so. If they have an alternative rationale behind splitting the payment, then I also invite the minister to put that forward. Labor is of the view that farmers need cash and they need it now. The government has acknowledged that, both by changing the assets test and by putting in place this supplementary payment. Many of those farm households have large credit card debts accruing relatively large amounts of interest, and that is happening right now. And so the opposition is still struggling to understand, given that there seems to be minimal fiscal impact and given that it's all happening in one fiscal year, why the government wouldn't give the worst-affected farmers, the farmers who are struggling now, the opportunity to secure that $12,000 payment up-front.


I remind the House that it was the Prime Minister who responded to this question on national radio, saying that March is not too far away. Well, March is a long, long way away if you've been subject to one of the most severe droughts in our history and if you are struggling to put food on your table. The minister has acknowledged that this payment is not for feed, fodder and like farming needs; it is about putting food on the table and about paying the bills. I trust farmers to spend that money responsibly. They hardly have an option if they are unable at the moment to meet their basic cost-of-living needs. So it remains a mystery to us still why the government hasn't accepted our invitation to make that change. It's not too late. The minister could do that today. We'd be happy to adjourn the debate so the paperwork could be done. If he's not prepared to do so, he might at least share with the Australian farming community why he's not prepared to do so.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:56):  Thank you, the member for Hunter. This payment is to go towards household expenses. As you would know and all Australians would know, household expenses are constant, and splitting this into two payments in essence six months apart means that we're able to give that extra payment at two different times of the year. But it also needs to be acknowledged that the fortnightly payment will continue in between so there is continuity of payment as we continue to move through this. This is about making sure that we are able to address the household expenses. The government's responsibility through the intergovernmental agreement on drought with the states is around human welfare. It's not around animal welfare. It's not about fodder and freight. This is about the daily expenses of our farmers, and they are spread out across the year. So in that essence, the government made the decision that there should be two lump sums paid over a different period, that will complement the up to $538.80 a fortnight a family could receive in one payment. So this is about making sure that we understand that these are constant expenses, not one single expense.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (10:57):  I apologise to Channel Seven's David Koch because the Prime Minister's remarks about March not being too far away were in an interview with him, not on national radio as I suggested. I'm bringing this to a close now. I assume that part of the changes in timing are about the capacity of those who are coming into farm household allowance for the first time because of the change to the asset test threshold enabling them to secure the first $6,000 payment. I ask the minister what risks still remain other than their capacity to get their own paperwork in order. What risks remain to them being denied the first $6,000 payment? In other words, we have people coming in, possibly for the first time, because of a more generous assets test, and their application is now allowed to be lodged on 1 September. I still understand there are some processing difficulties, which will delay the processing of those applications. The opposition remains concerned that those people might still be denied the $6,000 payment—that is, the first tranche of the supplementary payment—through no fault of their own.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:58):  The reality is that we understand that there has been an uplift in applications, and that's a good thing. I would say to every Australian farmer not to self-assess. The fact that we are putting more rural financial counsellors on the ground to assist you in terms of undertaking the application is an important step. We're also reviewing the application itself to try to streamline it. The reality is that that does take time. We're working through that as quickly as we can and we're working as practically as we can with the Department of Human Services to make sure that we can expedite as many applications, and resources within the Department of Human Services, as I understand, have been deployed to ensure that this increase in demand of application is able to be assessed in the appropriate time. It is also worth remembering that any person that falls outside the criteria for the farm household allowance can still apply under hardship provisions, and it's important that farmers understand that as well. That is why engaging a rural financial counsellor is so important in this process. They can guide and assist you through the whole application. If for some reason you fall outside one of the guidelines, there are still hardship provisions within the FHA to enable you to apply. This is about making sure the accessibility is there. We are doing it in a responsible way. This amendment is about providing an opportunity, where we have seen that we can deploy extra resources in the application process, to get that money out quicker and in a responsible and methodical way.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-08-22,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (10:07):  First of all, the most important thing here is that our farmers be aware that they should be ringing the Rural Financial Counselling Service on 1800686175 or the family assistance hotline on 132316, and under no circumstances should they self-assess. There are many conditions that may allow them to get help when they absolutely need it, and they may not realise that the hand of the government is there for them. It's important that they don't rely on trying to assess their own assets and property. There's help available, and we have the resources to help them.


The Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 is a bill to help and to amend the Farm Household Support Act 2014. Under this bill, two temporary changes to the Farm Household Allowance program will happen. Firstly, it will increase the farm assets threshold to a net $5 million until 30 June 2019. Increasing the net farm asset threshold to this amount will give more farmers access to the allowance during times of hardship, which is what we're facing right now. It will help those farmers who have little or no cash flow to access assistance that provides them an allowance as well as breathing room to prepare for and adapt to change. It means these farmers won't have to sell their assets and risk taking away some or all of their future income-producing capacity from their farm. It also recognises that farm assets can be difficult to sell quickly and that during tough times these are often sold for less than they're worth.


Secondly, this bill proposes to pay a supplement to all eligible farm household recipients. That's in addition to their fortnightly income support payments. These temporary measures will help our farmers in need in the short term while we undertake an independent review of the program. The review, to be completed in the first half of 2019, will provide further guidance on the design elements of the farm household allowance well into the future. There will be some lump sum payments. This means that, if both members of a couple are receiving the allowance between September this year and June next year, they will receive 6,000 bucks each, or 12,000 per household. In all other circumstances, the maximum amount payable will be $7,200.


No farmer who lodges a claim for the farm household assistance on or before December will be disadvantaged. If they're eligible, they'll get back pay, right to the date of lodgement, and also receive the supplement. They will receive farm household assistance during the second payment, which is from December to June next year, and they will receive the maximum supplement.


The assistant supplement will give farming families much-needed cash to inject into their local economies. This will also help to put food on their tables and cover basic expenses such as their bills and school fees. As with the increases to the farm assets threshold, it will provide a safeguard for farm families who might be forced to liquidate farm assets to support themselves—and, heaven help us, that constricts their future. This assistance includes income support, independent financial assessment, individualised case management and an activity supplement that pays for advice and training. The safety net supports farmers in hardship while they take steps to improve their situation. And $5 million has been allocated to the Rural Financial Counselling Service so they can go out and talk to the farmers face-to-face and help them through these hard times.


We are working on ways to make the process simpler and quicker for farmers. I have already received email saying it is a little onerous, so we are working on that. We extended the Farm Household Allowance program from three years to four. All of these measures are immediate and on top of the $586 million in relief we have already announced, as well as concessional loans now available through the Regional Investment Corporation.


Many farmers find themselves in a difficult position. In my case, it is the dairy farmers. They don't want to put their hands out for a handout, so we are working to help raise awareness of the cost of milk. I recently wrote to the CEOs of Aldi, Coles, Woolworths and IGA and highlighted that just 20c a litre, 20c a dozen and 20c a kilogram from the profit margin would help our farmers. For the last eight years, the price of milk has been fixed at a dollar a litre. Nothing else on our shelves has remained constant during this time. In 2017 it was reported that the ACCC found the dairy pricing system to be outdated and skewed in favour of the large dominant supermarkets and processors, with farmers enjoying no real bargaining power and limited scope to rearrange their businesses and milk contracts to either accurately predict their current incomes or improve their selling options. The report made eight recommendations, including locking major processors into a mandatory code of conduct which would make milk pricing contracts more transparent, introducing more competition for farmers' milk and banning retrospective milk price cuts in mid-season, which has actually happened. Our local farmers in Gilmore want to have the ability to build their own resilience and futureproof themselves on their own merits as producers. This change in retail price specifically for milk will make a huge difference to them. I think the farm household assistance is just another part of the jigsaw puzzle and helping them get through these really tough times.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-08-22,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (10:12):  Before I came to this place—and I still have interest in it—I was a farmer in a district called Buckleboo. Buckleboo is 100 kilometres north of Goyder's line. That may not mean a lot to many Australians, but it means a lot in South Australia. Goyder's line is seen as the line north of which one should not engage in agriculture. But my family has been there for over 90 years and we have prospered, and so has the community. It is a successful farming community. This means I bring the personal experience of drought to this place. Probably the longest period of drought is around four years—the millennium drought, of course. I think we had six very substandard years over eight years. It was quite testing. Over the years, some things have been done better in helping farmers get through tough times—and I will come to that in a little while.


In 2009, the rains came back—they came back with a vengeance in parts of Australia. Up until the last little while, we have enjoyed reasonably good seasons, particularly where I come from. I understand that the drought in New South Wales and Queensland is very problematic at the moment. In some places, it is entering its sixth year. Where I come from, it is less pronounced. I have communities, though, in my electorate that are now looking at the third failure in four years. So things are toughening up. And we have some considerable soil erosion issues that we haven't seen for many, many years—in fact, since the advent of no-till farming. I'm very encouraged that the government is showing it's listening and it's making changes to drought assistance as the drought unfolds, as I think governments should. I commend the minister, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister on listening and making those adjustments.


This bill goes to some temporary measures that are attached to the farm household assistance. For those who don't know—I'm sure everyone in this place will—farm household assistance is the equivalent of Newstart, except there are two differences: one being that the person does not have to seek work, so they are able to receive Newstart assistance and continue to operate their farm. It's a very important tool for basically putting food on the table and keeping families in a good frame of mind. I mean that in the widest possible terms—looking after mental health.


The other difference, and it's a recent change to farm household assistance, is that the government has decided that people can continue on this assistance for up to four years. Newstart allowance is worth not quite $25,000 a couple. This bill, and the announcement by the Prime Minister a few weeks ago, now makes available two $3,000 payments per person. For a couple, it's $6,000 over the next 12 months. That another $12,000 on top of the $25,000, as long as they lodge up to 1 December. I think that is recognition that this is a drought that's having a lot of impact.


We're also increasing the net assets of a farming operation to be eligible for payments from $2½ million up to $5 million. This is a considerable change. A lot of farms are worth a lot of money, and we often say farmers can be asset-rich and income poor. This addresses that issue. Someone who still has assets of over $5 million should be able to make sure they can put food on the table, quite frankly. I think that's a good and powerful move.


But there are a whole lot of other things that swing within farm household assistance, and some other measures in other portfolios assist farmers to stay on the land and prosper. I thought—considering there had been considerable discourse around Australia when the Prime Minister made these most recent announcements, which came to a $190 million uplift at the time—that government gave only $190 million for farmers, but, in fact, since that time, in another announcement, the total assistance to farmers is up around $1.8 billion.


There are some important things available. I held a drought forum in Arno Bay, going back about 2½ weeks ago. There was about three days notice and about 75 farmers and families rolled up. I had a Centrelink officer there and also some rural financial counsellors. I was very grateful for their assistance. One of the things that became quite clear is that farmers do not necessarily have a full grasp of all the things that are available to them and sometimes underestimate the complexity of applying for that assistance. The golden rule here is: we are supplying rural financial counsellors; do not self-assess. Get some help. That is what the rural financial counsellors are for. They are built into the package.


Other things are available within that package; for instance, $1,500 for a farm enterprise evaluation. In layman's terms: this is some money for your accountant to put together the numbers that you can put on your form so you can apply for the farm household assistance. There's $4,000 for a farming operation to assist with skills training. It might be some business studies or it might be getting your computer operations up to speed. There are all kinds of things that can help farmers. It's very important because, at the end of the day, farmers are businesses and they need to operate in that world.


There's been a whole raft of other measures, including the $20,000 instant tax write-off for capital purchases that all businesses enjoy. The instant write-off now, after the recent upgrade, is for water, fodder and fencing, and that is a huge change. There are parts of my electorate where rainfall is preciously thin and where there are no underground water supplies, including on my own farm. In many places, there is not even a reticulated water supply. That means farmers are dependent on what they can capture on their properties. I've been espousing for a long time that they should investigate the possibility of plastic water runs and plastic-lined dams with plastic lids on them, which basically gives rainwater-quality water on farm that runs at one millimetre.


The figures are quite astonishing, and I've given them to the House before. Eyre Peninsula, which is where my farm is situated, uses about 11 gigalitres of water a year out of the reticulated system. If we were to situate a dam and run-off in a 400-millimetre rainfall area—and that's not that hard to find on Eyre Peninsula—just 7,000 acres would harvest all of that water. It would do it. No-one would ever suggest that we build this super dam in one place, but the ability is there for farmers to put aside maybe a hectare of land and put plastic on it—use an existing dam if they have one, line it with plastic and get rid of the evaporation by putting a lid on it—to virtually waterproof their farms. That indirectly takes all that pressure off, at least on the Eyre Peninsula and in some cases the Murray River system. This is an investment with great integrity. I encourage farmers to do that. With the changes to the instant tax write-off, when they get a good year they will have the ability to invest in something that's going to drought-proof their property for the coming years.


I was speaking recently to some quite large farmers who do a lot of fodder conservation. They have a number of sheds. One said, 'I've stopped selling, and I've got to tell you that, sadly, fodder is running out in South Australia.' The recent decision by the New South Wales government—I bear them no malice—to provide a freight subsidy for NSW farmers has actually shortened the food supply in South Australia and lifted its price. This farmer produces a lot of hay and he said, 'We've stopped selling, though, because we've decided that what we've got left we need to have for ourselves. We've made very good money through this period by selling this hay, so what we will do when the drought breaks and when we grow a good hay crop again is build yet another shed, which will be fully tax-deductible in the year in which we build it, and we'll fill that up with hay so we've got more hay for the next drought.' That is more reserves, more fat on their farming system, and an ability to supply a very important commodity to other farmers who haven't got to that point. That's what those incentives do.


On top of that, we have the concessional loans—the drought assistance and business improvement loans. The government announced only last week, I think, that they made available a swag of extra money for those loans. To give people some idea, there is no requirement to repay the principal within five years, and they operate at a 3½ per cent interest rate. Interest rates are fairly low in the market, but that is still below what anyone could expect to get from their bank. Up to 50 per cent of their debt can be financed in that way.


We also have 2½ thousand dollars for benchmarking properties for access to multi-peril crop insurance. It was interesting that, at the drought forum I held in Arno Bay, a number of farmers said that they'd taken out multi-peril crop insurance this year. They were dealing with the sellers of that insurance about how those payouts might work. I'll put one note of caution in: there seems to be quite a variance between those particular policies. One particular farmer had sown his crop and said, 'Because it has been so dry and it never came up, we actually reached the default date, so it's not considered to be a crop,' even though he had expended all his money on seed, fertiliser and the chemicals that went with the sowing. That's a little note of caution. The point is the government is assisting farmers to get into this area to try and manage these income shortfalls for themselves.


The most important federal government policy equipping farmers to deal with drought is the farm management deposits scheme, which was brought in by the Howard government. In the 2016 budget, we doubled the amount which farmers can put into these farm household deposits. For the uninitiated, this means that, in a high-income year, farmers can put money in a bank account with any of the major banks, and that money will get the normal interest from the bank—which I have to say at the moment is not very much—and it will get treated in the same way as any other account. There is a full tax deduction for the year in which they lodge it, and when they bring it back onto their income books—it can earn that interest while it's parked to one side—it will be assessed at the top marginal rate at the time. Of course, if you've got a drought and you're not paying tax because you have zero income or less, that is the time to bring your FMDs back into action. Those limits now are $800,000 for an individual and $1.6 million for a farming couple. The reason it's had to go up is that farms have gotten bigger and bigger, and many of them will spend anything up to half a million or a million dollars getting a crop in the ground. So it's no good equipping farmers for half a season of input; we need to be able to make them resistant to multiseasonal droughts. That's why those limits have been lifted. I do think, as I said, it's the best policy that a government has ever given Australian farmers to equip themselves for drought.


I might say there is a knock-on effect here too for local businesses because it actually keeps cash flow more constant in our local towns, because farmers have actually got money to spend in the season when they didn't get an income. I recount a story of one of my suppliers some years ago, when I was still farming. I was talking about FMDs and he said: 'Why can't I get that as a supplier? Why can't I get an FMD?' I said: 'It's difficult because we come down to this definition of what is a rural business and what is not a rural business. Have you noticed any difference since the FMDs have come in?' He said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Well, for instance, when it got to about 20 June in the previous years, and I'd had a reasonable season, I used to come in and buy all my fertiliser for next year and most of my chemical.' He looked at me and he said, 'Yes, you used to offload your tax problems on to me.' I said, 'I know!' It was in good humour, of course, but he's right. Farmers used to come in and unload in June to buy up big for the coming months. I said, 'What happens now?' He said, 'It's not happening anymore.' I said, 'I'm not doing it anymore; I'm using my FMDs.' He said, 'Yes, actually, you're right; we are getting a steadier income.' That FMD actually has a knock-on benefit for the farm merchandising and the farm-dependent rural businesses. As I say, it's the best thing available.


That's a big round off on drought policy generally and where the government is. I think it's a very comprehensive package. I do applaud these most recent changes, which are the temporary measures to get people through the current tight spot.

"Littleproud, David, MP",Nats,2018-08-22,"



Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:27):  This bill, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018, demonstrates this government's responsiveness to the needs of farming communities and our commitment to rural and regional Australia. The Farm Household Allowance program provides support for all farmers and their partners facing hardship, including drought. It's a time limited program, and from 1 August 2018 the government increased the time on payment from three to four years accumulative.


This bill proposes two temporary changes to the Farm Household Allowance program. The first change is to increase the net farm assets threshold to $5 million to begin on a date to be prescribed by a minister's rule and ending on 30 June 2019. The second change provides a supplement to all eligible farm household allowance recipients in addition to their fortnightly payments. These temporary measures are designed to help our farmers in the short term while we undertake an independent review of the FHA which will provide further guidance on the design elements of the farm household allowance into the future.


The increase to the farm assets threshold was specifically raised by farmers on the listening tour this government undertook in June 2018, with harsh drought conditions impacting their ability to provide the basics for their families. In fact, many of these farmers have not yet been able or were unable to access the farm household allowance. I will be introducing a minister's rule that will allow farmers with net farm assets up to $5 million to lodge a claim for FHA from 1 September 2018. Implementation arrangements to allow the processing of these applications will be in place from 1 October. People who are granted FHA under the temporary farm asset increase can continue to receive their payment after 30 June 2019 as long as they continue to meet all other eligibility requirements.


The bill also pays a supplement, called the FHA supplement, of up to $12,000 to a couple where both are recipients of the farm household allowance and up to $7,200 for single recipients. This additional support will benefit not only our farmers but the regional communities they live in. The allowance is not about paying for feed and fodder. It's about putting food on the table, paying household bills or putting diesel in the ute. But the farm household allowance is more than a social security payment. Recipients are supported to undertake a farm financial assessment and a financial improvement agreement, which is a plan to work towards improving their self-reliance. Recipients identify goals and undertake activities designed to move them towards a more sustainable future. These features of the program continue unchanged.


FHA also provides access to activity supplements of up to $4,000. This money can be used for eligible professional support, advice or training. This support affords farmers and their partners an opportunity to earn an off-farm income. Recipients will also continue to receive support through dedicated farm household case officers who work with recipients to assess their individual situation and to identify activities to improve their long-term situation. While on payments, farmers and their partners also have access to a healthcare card, pharmaceutical allowance, rent assistance, telephone allowance, energy supplement and remote area allowance. If it is not possible for recipients to achieve financial sustainability, notwithstanding the support offered through the farm household program, the program also supports recipients to consider alternative employment or transitioning away from farming with dignity.


This bill demonstrates the government's continued responsiveness to the needs of our farming communities. By amending the legislation, more farmers and their partners will be able to access the farm household allowance program, and eligible recipients will be paid a supplement in addition to their fortnightly income support payments. The bill increases the net farm assets test to $5 million until 30 June 2019, with the start date to be determined by ministerial rule. It pays a supplement of up to $12,000 for a couple where both are recipients of farm household allowance and up to $7,200 for single recipients. It helps farmers and their partners recover from the hardship. This bill benefits current and future farm household allowance recipients and the communities they live in. I thank the members for their contributions and commend the bill to the House.




The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Hunter be agreed to.

Mr ROB MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (13:30):  Over the last few weeks we have seen devastating images coming out of Kerala, India, with millions of locals being affected by torrential flooding in the south. August rainfall in the state so far has been 2½ times the normal rainfall for the period. The Peermade weather station, in Idukki, broke over 100 years of records for 24-hour rainfall. The floods have taken the lives of over 350 people and a further 33,000 people have been rescued from the hundreds of affected communities. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed as a result of these monsoonal rains. Indian emergency services and international organisations have opened around 4,000 relief camps, which are currently sheltering over one million people who have been displaced in this tragic event.


In McEwen, we have a much-cherished Indian community. On behalf of all McEwen residents, I send to the Indian people our sincerest thoughts, condolences and support in this difficult time. Our thoughts are with the millions of people who have been displaced and those whose families and friends have been affected by these devastating floods. We hope India can rebuild quickly, and we would like to see them recover with the support of all Australian aid programs and our partners around the world. We ourselves know the devastation that natural disasters can have on our communities, and that is why we are always behind those in need when they need our help. To all our Indian friends, we wish you all the very best. We hope and pray that everything works out quickly and well for you.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I thank the honourable member for his question about DNA. Clearly, he must share some of that DNA as well, because only a few years ago he said that cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital, he said, means higher productivity and economic growth, and leads to more jobs and higher wages. Well, despite our political differences, it may be that there's a little bit of DNA shared between us.


The reality is that we took our Enterprise Tax Plan to the election. We won the election. We were able, despite many naysayers, to legislate that part of it that delivers lower taxes for small and medium companies—overwhelmingly. Australian owned family companies. That is already driving record jobs growth in our country. It's driving strong economic growth, stronger than any of the biggest economies, with 3.1 per cent GDP growth. And last year we saw over 400,000 jobs created.


Now, that is delivering. But the reality is that the iron laws of arithmetic, which everyone pays attention to here, they are—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  I'm glad you woke up! You were half asleep! The iron laws of arithmetic dictate that we have not been able to get the rest of the tax plan through the Senate. We do not foresee any change in public sentiment on this matter and, accordingly, we will not be taking the larger company tax cuts policy to the next election.


Australia needs to have competitive taxes. There is no question about that, and the time will come, no doubt, when people on the other side of the House will go back to reading the member for McMahon's book on that very subject. But the reality is that in this place we have to live with what we can work through the Senate and this is something we have not been able to achieve.


In terms of tax, it's very clear where the line is between us and Labor. Labor wants higher taxes; we're for lower taxes and we're delivering lower taxes. Labor wants to go after the savings of retirees; we are defending them. Labor wants higher energy prices; we're delivering lower energy prices. Labor wants to have less investment; we want to have more investment. What that means is that Labor's economic policies mean less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages. That is why Labor is such a threat to the Australian economy and why thousands of Australian businesses and millions of Australian families are threatened by Labor's absolute, reckless disregard for looking after the workers it claims to represent.

  Thank you. My question is to the health minister. In a welcome move, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended that cystic fibrosis medication Orkambi be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Minister, as you know, cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting condition. For eight-year-old Will Grue, in my electorate, it means different medications every day and several weeks each year in hospital. Orkambi increases the life expectancy of children and young people, but currently the medication is prohibitively expensive. Minister, would you please provide an update on when Orkambi will likely be listed on the PBS and therefore become available to children like Will?

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (14:16):  I want to thank the member for Mayo for this question. She's been very sincere and longstanding in her advocacy for patients with cystic fibrosis, in particular for the listing of Orkambi. This is something which has been done across this chamber. I know that, amongst many others, the members for Moreton and Lilley have also made representations, but it's not confined to them. On this side of the chamber, I've had representations from the member for Boothby, the member for Higgins and the member for Forrest in particular, who has been a very strong advocate for young Connor in her electorate. What you say in terms of Will and what she says in terms of Connor and many others is sincerely held.


I'm really delighted that last Friday the PBAC announced that, after three previous assessments, on this occasion they had recommended the listing of Orkambi for cystic fibrosis patients. This is a medicine which will be listed for all patients aged six and above. There had been some speculation that, if it were to be successful, it would only be for those aged 12 and above. It is in fact for six and above.


We will move now as quickly as possible. I have already asked the department to begin discussions and to work on the listing process with the company, and indeed I have spoken with the company myself. We did that within the first day of the announcement of the PBAC. As a guide, I would indicate that last year we listed the drug Kalydeco. Kalydeco is another cystic fibrosis drug by the same company which involves treating beautiful young children. That was recommended, I believe, in January, it was announced in February and it was delivered in May. I think that provides a good guide, although we will try to do it at a faster pace, and we've already had a very strong and positive response from the company.


Cystic fibrosis is a horrific condition. It can shorten the lives of so many patients. It's a nightmare diagnosis for any parent and any young child. And so, to all of those parents who have advocated: I thank them for that. To all of the members in this House who have advocated: I thank them for that. Along with other medicines such as Kisqali, for breast cancer, and Spinraza, for SMA, and what we've done with Kalydeco, we will move heaven and earth to do this as quickly as possible, because I want this medicine to be in the hands of patients at the earliest possible time.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation) (14:27):  I welcome the new shadow minister to the portfolio. And the answer, of course, is yes. It gives me an opportunity to go through the achievements that we're actually doing within my portfolio of human services.


Because we're managing the budget well, because we're managing the economy well and because we've created one million jobs, that means there are fewer people in the welfare system. That saves billions of dollars over the budgetary cycle. That's allowed us to employ an extra 2,750 people within my department so that when you call Centrelink you can actually get someone answering the phone within a reasonable time, who can answer your question—a knowledgeable person who knows what they're doing, who can deal with your query in the way that the Australian people want and with the service that they expect.


I will continue to make sure that we're delivering for the Australian people within this portfolio. The Department of Human Services runs the largest call centre in the Southern Hemisphere. We take one million calls a week. When the Howard government left office, the average call waiting time when somebody called in was 90 seconds—a minute and half. When these guys left office in 2013, it was 12½ minutes! And that happened because they ripped 4,800 people out of the Department of Human Services. Those 5,000 people meant that when people called Centrelink they couldn't get the service they needed.


These guys like to pretend that they care about the welfare system. They like to pretend they care about Australians who are on the welfare system. But we're the ones who are making sure they can get a job, and we're the ones who are making sure that they can get the support they need when they need it.

The SPEAKER
 (15:16):  Before members leave, I've got a very short statement. I want to say a few words about one of the staff of the Department of the House of Representatives, Peter Fowler, who is having his last sitting week in the House. Peter's there in the front row of the gallery this afternoon.


In December 1982, Peter was seconded from the Parliamentary Library, where he had worked, to the House of Representatives Procedure Office, where he established the procedural records system. Peter's been involved heavily in the preparation of all of the editions of House of Representatives Practice since the second edition, back in 1989. This has included extensive research, drafting of text and coordinating of all aspects of publishing. Of course, Peter has been very heavily involved in the most recent 7th edition that members have. There can be no doubt that such a dedicated focus on the main procedural reference volume of the House has been of considerable value in the continuity of the development of the text and a benefit to all of us.


Peter's also made a valuable contribution to the work of the Procedure Committee. Of particular significance was his work for that committee's 1993 report About time: bills, questions and working hours. That report led to many important reforms, including the establishment of the Federation Chamber, initially called the Main Committee, and which Peter has served as a deputy clerk. Peter also served as a deputy clerk in this chamber.


In 1988 he was awarded an Australia Day medallion to acknowledge his significant contribution to parliament and the department. His sustained focus and interest in House procedure has made him an expert, and he has offered guidance and assistance to many new staff over the years. We wish Peter and his wife, An, all the best in retirement and, of course, he leaves on a high after the publication of the 7th edition of the House of Representatives Practice. Congratulations, Peter.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (15:21):  Yesterday 35 members of this government decided that they would rather have the member for Dickson than the member for Wentworth as their Prime Minister. Thirty-five members of the government, including the current Minister for Health, said that they would rather have the person who presided over some of the worst health policy in the nation as Prime Minister than the member for Wentworth. It says a lot about the mob opposite that they would rather have the worst health minister on record as the Prime Minister than the current Prime Minister. So I think it is well worth this House, as a matter of public importance, looking back at the government's greatest hits when it comes to health.


The member for Dickson was the worst federal health minister in Australia in a generation. That's not just me saying that, although I do have to say I wholeheartedly agree; that was the judgement of the nation's doctors. There has been some pretty stiff competition for the crown from those opposite. There was the member for Warringah, who, when he wasn't obsessing about how to stop women accessing medical terminations, was giving rolled-gold commitments on Medicare and then promptly abandoning them. There was the scandal-plagued member for Farrer who somehow managed to start damaging fights with doctors, pharmacists, pathologists and pretty much everyone else in the health sector. Years later, the government is still trying to clean up some of those messes that she made in the portfolio, but at least she actually wanted the portfolio and cared about it. And now we've got the member for Flinders, the man who's continued the government's freeze on the Medicare rebate. He's presided over billions of dollars of cuts to hospitals and has spent the last 18 months kowtowing to the big private health insurers, putting their profits before patients, and now he's reportedly desperate to get out of the health portfolio so that he can become deputy Liberal leader. Just 18 months in the health job, and he can't wait to get out of it. He doesn't care about the health of the nation. He is just using it as a stepping stone for his political ambitions.


On the other side of the chamber, it's a rogues' gallery of incompetence and attacks on Medicare and our hospital system. And yet none of these hopeless ministers can challenge the member for Dickson for his sheer bloody-mindedness and his assault on the Australian universal healthcare system, a system that is the envy of the world. When doctors were polled a few years ago now, 47 per cent of them named and shamed the member for Dickson as the worst health minister in 35 years. We've had about 15 health ministers in that time, but half of the doctors of the nation agreed that the member for Dickson was the worst. He was only in the job for 15 months, but the damage he did in that short time as health minister was extraordinary. Let's consider his appalling record. Bear with me, as it is going to actually take a while.


The member for Dickson was one of the chief architects of the horror 2014 budget—the cruellest, nastiest budget in living memory. It was a budget so infamously unpopular it ultimately destroyed the Prime Minister and the Treasurer who delivered it. What was the member for Dickson's contribution to that budget? It was $57 billion worth of cuts to public hospitals, for starters. That's not a Labor number; that was the number offered up by the government's own Treasury at the time. The 2014 budget tore up Labor's national partnership agreement on public hospitals, a massive broken promise and a disaster for health care in this nation. A cut like that meant fewer hospital beds and longer waiting times for emergency care and for elective surgery. It meant doctors, nurses and other hospital staff simply did not have the resources they needed to deliver top-quality care. That was his vision for the nation's public hospitals—cutting them to the bone and letting patients suffer.


The Liberals, under the current Prime Minister, eventually restored some of this money because they knew their cuts were electoral poison. But even now they are persisting with the funding formula that the AMA says will doom our hospitals to failure, a deal that is billions of dollars below what was promised and billions of dollars below what a Labor Shorten government would deliver. Of course, we also saw the $7 co-payment to see the doctor. Remember that one? This was another of the member for Dickson's bright ideas, a policy that effectively undermined the universality of Medicare that somehow he thought doctors and patients would welcome. It was a policy that would have forced up the cost of seeing a GP and the costs of out-of-hospital care. He also wanted the states—remember this one?—to charge a co-payment on emergency departments as well. These co-payments weren't just targeted at the wealthy or well-off; they were for everyone, including children, pensioners and the chronically ill—the poorest, most disadvantaged people in this nation.


It was one of the most regressive policies ever proposed. It was only because Labor and the crossbench opposed it that it was killed off eventually. As usual, we ended up saving the government from their appalling instincts to slash and burn health funding. But the member for Dickson thought it was a great idea and spent months advocating for it and then, if that was even possible, made it worse by proposing an even higher co-payment. He liked it in large part because it would deter people from going to the doctor. Deterring people from going to the doctor was what the policy was designed to do. We know that people who don't go to the doctor typically get sicker and sicker and end up costing the health system more.


But, of course, the member for Dickson's health policies didn't stop there. He wanted to also force up the cost of prescription medicines. He wanted people to pay an extra $5 every time they filled a script, and that included extra charges for pensioners and other concession cardholders. He also wanted cuts to the PBS safety net and the Medicare safety net. He wanted to ensure that people with chronic and complex health problems got less support.


But, wait, there is, in fact, actually more! The member for Dickson also began the Medicare rebate freeze. He made it more expensive to visit a specialist, allied health professional, nurse, midwife or dental surgeon. Stared down by the Senate on his genius GP tax, he decided later to extend that Medicare freeze to GP visits—a GP co-payment by stealth. That Medicare freeze still exists in form today and will endure for another two years. It has robbed more than $3 billion out of Medicare. That means it has ripped more than $3 billion out of the pockets of patients. And, as a result, out-of-pocket costs are still getting worse to this day.


Earlier this month, the Australian Institute For Health and Welfare finally laid bare the full extent of the health affordability crisis in this nation. Despite the Prime Minister's promise that no-one would pay more to see a doctor under this government, the report shows Australians are now spending nearly $30 billion a year on out-of-pocket expenses and that includes $3 billion in non-hospital Medicare subsidised services. Half of all patients have incurred out-of-pocket costs to see a GP or specialist or to have blood tests, X-rays or other scans. Seventy per cent of patients seeing specialists made some out-of-pocket payments, and more than a million people spent $600 or more on medical gap fees. As a result of these soaring costs, 1.3 million Australians are either delaying or skipping seeing a doctor or getting a test when they need it, putting their wellbeing and, possibly, even their lives at risk.


Despite all of this, the government has done absolutely nothing when it comes to out-of-pocket costs. The member for Dickson also abolished Health Workforce Australia, which was tasked with ensuring that the health workforce had appropriate skills and training. He abolished the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. He took the axe to, generally, every prevention program that there was federally, cutting millions of dollars from measures put in place to prevent cancer and to tackle obesity, problem drinking and smoking. There were massive cuts to dental funding, diagnostic imaging and ophthalmology and the destruction of Labor's Medicare Locals system. There was no corner of the health system that the member for Dickson did not take an axe to. Not including the cuts to hospitals, he cut $10.4 billion from our health system in a single budget.


Let's not forget this chestnut in the 2014 budget: the market testing of the payment system for health services by commercial payment service providers. That's a fancy way of saying that, in fact, the member for Dickson wanted to sell off the Medicare payment system. It was his idea. He wanted to start the process of privatising Medicare. It's there in black and white in the budget papers. He was an absolute disaster when it came to being a health minister of this nation, yet 35 members on the government side of the House decided that he would make a better Prime Minister. It tells you everything about the Liberal Party and what they think of health and what they think of the Prime Minister that they think he would do a better job. (Time expired)

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (15:32):  If you can't manage the economy, you can't manage health. The member opposite talked about what was black and white in the budget papers. Well, it is all there in black and white in the budget papers for 2011-12—the link between the economy and health and the ability to manage it. Again, in the 2011-12 portfolio budget statement, under the previous Labor government, it says:


… given the current fiscal environment, the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit.


They couldn't manage the economy and they couldn't manage health. Those medicines were for asthma, COPD, deep vein thrombosis, endometriosis, IVF and schizophrenia, amongst others. 


I've been doing a little bit more research about the response at that time and what is interesting is that the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee held an inquiry into this decision of the last Labor government. What they found, at page 90, was that it:


… represents unacceptable cost-shifting to patients who can least afford to bear an increased financial burden.


They also said, at page 87:


This profound and ill-considered change in policy puts at risk affordable access to medicines for Australians, and will have significant consequences for the pharmaceutical sector, including research and development.


But it's more than just that. Submissions came from some of the most reputable organisations in the country, including SANE Australia. Their submission said:


The decision to defer the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council (PBAC) to list medications jeopardises the integrity of the PBS process. 


Diabetes Australia said:


… we see the decision to delay listing of drugs which have been through the PBAC process as poor policy …


The Consumers Health Forum of Australia said:


Consumer concerns about the changes to the PBS listing process can be broadly summarised as follows:


1. Delays in access to essential medicines


2. Lack of transparency in the new process


3. Politicisation of PBS listing process


4. Lack of consideration of other healthcare costs likely to arise as a result of consumers not having access to essential medicines.


And then the AMA said, which perhaps sums it up perfectly:


Denying access to medicines that are proven to be both clinically useful and cost-effective is a crude and blunt instrument to attempt to control PBS outlays.


That is what the experts said, that is what the medical groups said, that is what the community groups said and that is what the mental health groups said in response to the inability of the previous government—a Labor government—when they were in power, to manage the economy, which, in turn, meant they could not manage health. That is fundamental. It is the exemplar of everything that is wrong with Labor when they seek to govern.


More than that, let's look at the record of what we've achieved compared with the previous government: record hospital funding, record bulk-billing levels, record Medicare funding and record mental health funding. Let us go through each of those. Hospital funding is up over 50 per cent from when Labor was last in power. I just want to repeat that—up over 50 per cent, from $13.3 billion in their last full year to $21 billion this year, to $22 billion next year, to $23 billion and to $24 billion in the third and fourth years of the budgets. And that means more services, more access to doctors and more access to nurses—so an over-50 per cent increase. So, when they make their claims, just check the budget papers because, when we check their budget papers, we see them denying essential medicines. But when we check our budget papers, we see an over-50 per cent increase in actual hospital funding. That's the reality. That's the truth. That is the undeniable fact, and that is what is actually occurring as a result of good economic management.


In addition to that, though, Medicare funding is increasing to record levels each year, every year, under this government. What we see is that we have gone from $19.5 billion under Labor to $25 billion this year, to $26 billion next year, to $27 billion in the third year and to $29 billion in the final year of the budget papers. So there's a massive increase of approximately $10 billion from Labor's last year to the end of the forward estimates within the budget period.


We've also seen, again, new listings on the MBS. There are new items for 3D mammography for breast cancer, new items for men's prostate cancer and new items for remote and Indigenous renal treatment—important steps forward, delivering real benefits to patients that actually make a difference to their lives. That's what's occurring when you've got a strong economy based on real jobs growth; you can actually lead and see the benefits in health.


More than that, though, we see bulk-billing, and what we've just seen are the highest bulk-billing figures on record—86.1 per cent, up from 82.2 per cent under Labor. So that's nearly a four per cent increase from when Labor was last in power to what bulk-billing is now. It's 3.9 per cent up, nearly four per cent, at 86.1 per cent. It's the first time in Australian history that bulk-billing has reached an 86 per cent level. That means that 86 out of every 100 times that people go to the GP, they go for free—they don't pay a cent to attend that service—and that's an important outcome for Australians. It's important in terms of access and it's important in terms of the ability to seek treatment. What we have also seen since 2011 is a 39 per cent decrease in terms of the rate of people delaying access to GPs. We want to drive that down further. But what we have seen is a 39 per cent decrease from 2011, based on ABS figures, compared with what it was under Labor.


There is a very important additional element here—that is, what we also see is that Labor has a proposal to rip the rebate away from all of the low-cost policies under private health insurance. They're not proposing a cap for private health insurance costs. They're proposing a 16 per cent increase because, if you take the rebate away, what you see is a massive impact on pensioners and low-income earners. And they talk about out-of-pocket costs. What will occur then is a major hit on out-of-pocket costs—not just according to us, but according to Members Health, according to Private Healthcare Australia and, in particular, according to the Queensland Teachers' Union's health fund. So these are not our views, although we agree with them. These are the views of the experts in the space, including some groups that are deeply aligned with the Labor Party.


You would see two things occur. The cost of private health insurance would soar under Labor, because Labor hate private health insurance, as we see from their record—they slashed the rebate last time. But also out-of-pockets would go up because, when you are driving up the cost of private health insurance, the insurers will seek to make savings elsewhere, and that means that there would have to be a reduction in the services that they offer, and that means an increase in out-of-pocket costs. So it's the patient who suffers. It's the patient who would be worse off under Labor. And it was the patient who suffered and was worse off under them last time, when they had private health insurance increases which hovered around the six per cent mark every year. By contrast, through reform that has changed the cost base for private health insurance, we have just delivered the lowest private health insurance change in 17 years. But we are working to drive that down further.


These are real reforms which have made a difference, in terms of record funding for hospitals, record funding for Medicare, new services from Medicare and new drug listings. On the latest figures, over 1,800 new or amended drug listings have been made since we came to government. That compares with what Labor did when they couldn't manage the economy, when they couldn't manage the budget, when they made the country suffer the consequences of their fiscal incompetence: they withheld new medicines for DVT, endometriosis, IVF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma and schizophrenia. When you do that, that shows you can't manage health, you can't manage the economy and you don't ever deserve to be back in government.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:42):  It's a bit rich for the Minister for Health and Aged Care to give Labor a lecture on management when he can't even manage the My Health Record rollout. It has turned into an absolute debacle.


Whichever way one turns under this government, currently led by the member for Wentworth, Australians are paying more and waiting longer for essential health services. Billions of dollars have been cut in funding to our hospitals. Three billion dollars have been cut in the last six years because of the Medicare freeze. There has been a 27 per cent increase in private health insurance costs. It's an atrocious record on health, led by the current Prime Minister; a former Prime Minister; a would-be Prime Minister, the member for Dickson; and a would-be Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Flinders.


With to respect hospitals, $57 billion was cut when this government first came to office. Seven hundred and fifteen million dollars will be cut between 2017 and 2020, and that means a cut of $31 million for the state I represent, South Australia. Between 2019 and 2025 the cut will be $2.8 billion. What does that mean? It means longer waiting times for emergency treatment, longer waiting times for elective surgery and shorter recovery times in hospital for patients. Only on Monday of this week the front page of the Adelaide Advertiser said: 'Frustrated paramedics' stress soars over ramping bottlenecks'. The article refers to three stress related incidents a week across Adelaide's major hospitals because of ramping, where ambos and patients wait for hours in hospital corridors, all because of the cuts to our hospital system.


With respect to private health insurance, there has been a 27 per cent increase under this government. Some 40 per cent of all policies now have exclusions, so people are not only paying nearly $1,000 a year more for their private health insurance but they're actually getting less, and, not surprisingly, more and more people are dropping out of private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it. Then what happens? More and more people end up in our public hospitals because they go there for treatment, or they simply don't take up treatment at all. That in turn means that their health deteriorates and, ultimately, the costs of caring for them escalate.


With respect to the Medicare freeze, GP visits are now up to about $38 on average. For specialists it's $88. In 2016, 1.7 million Australians skipped a specialist visit, another 1.7 million Australians did not fill their pharmaceutical script, one million skipped or avoided a GP visit and 1,830 personal bankruptcies in Australia were attributed to health costs because of this government's cuts. More recently, we saw the AMA put out a survey that showed one in three doctors will cut back or cut out their visits to aged-care centres. Aged-care centres look after some 235,000 Australians every year. If the doctors don't go there, they ultimately end up in the hospital ED departments where it costs even more. That happens at a time when we know more and more people are ending up in aged-care facilities because of our ageing population.


When health costs increase across the country it's the most vulnerable who are hit the hardest, particularly country folk. Country folk are already faced with higher levels of chronic ill-health, a shortage of health professionals and higher costs in accessing the health care they need. These are communities that are already seriously disadvantaged when it comes to healthcare services. This government's tenure has made their access to health care more costly and more difficult, and these are communities that are primarily represented by members of the government.


This is a time when Australia's health needs are greater than ever before. We know dementia rates in this country are rising and it won't be long before about a million people in this country have a dementia related illness. We know mental health issues affect so many people across the country and, again, it's an increasing problem. We know Australians are ageing. We know obesity rates are increasing, with about one in four Australians already obese and nearly two-thirds of Australians overweight.


Our health system needs more support not less. Yet what we're seeing from this government, from one minister after another, is cuts to the health system, passing the buck onto the patient or the states, leading, ultimately, to a deteriorating health service. It is time this government understood that, when it comes to the priorities of the Australian people, health and education are first and foremost. They should respond by supporting the health system of Australia.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-08-22,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Children and Families) (15:47):  Here we go again. The usual lies. Everyone's used to seeing mist cleared from the eyes of confused people, from the 'Mediscare' campaign of the last election. But the propaganda that keeps coming out of the other side about cuts to health is starting to be just repeated lies. Like those masters of propaganda, if you keep saying a lie often enough people start believing it—even the people who are telling the lie. And that's where they're going with this argument.


You've just got to look at the budget papers. There was $13.3 billion spent by the federal government in 2013-14. Now it will be $22.7 billion in 2021, as of the last budget papers. At the moment, we're over a 50 per cent increase by the end of the forward estimates. In these budget papers the increase will be 70 per cent. In the latest hospital agreement the increase goes up to $30.2 billion. I will reiterate that: $13.3 billion in 2013; $22.7 billion in 2021. That is a 70 per cent increase. That is not a cut.


Look at the PBS. One of the best initiatives is from the Minister for Health who has organised savings on the old drugs to guarantee extra funds to get the new drugs onto the PBS. Since the coalition government has been responsible for the health portfolio, since 2013, we have had 1,870 new medicines listed on the PBS. That's about 31 a month: one a day.


We have from a Senate inquiry in 2011 all the things the Minister for Health mentioned. Former Minister Roxon admitted that they took drugs off recommendations from the PBAC and didn't list them. They were drugs for schizophrenia, IVF, deep vein thrombosis, asthma and COPD. All the records were delayed. They did it because they couldn't manage the economy. They didn't have the funds to pay for it. Past behaviour reflects future behaviour. They froze the rebate for health insurance. Back in March, the member for McMahon, the opposition Treasury spokesman, was meeting with health funds, saying they're going to freeze it again—at least $2 billion extra in costs for people holding health insurance. There are 13½ million people in this country holding health insurance, and 6½ million of them, many of them pensioners, only earn $40,000. Health insurance is such an important arm of our health system, and they want to increase the cost to make it unaffordable.


We've made it much more affordable for young people to hold health insurance, because we've given the 18- to 29-year-olds a 10 per cent discount. We've changed the regulations to allow people, if they haven't got mental health cover, to upgrade to mental health cover without a waiting period. We've increased a whole lot of initiatives in mental health—extra funds for mental health, for regional people to get mental health by telemedicine and for psychological counselling by telemedicine.


We've had so many great initiatives. You've just got to look at the record funding for medical research, the Medical Research Future Fund and the National Medical Industry Growth Plan—that's another $1½ billion on top of the Medical Research Future Fund. There is $2½ billion at least that's going into direct medical research through the NHMRC funding, on top of the Medical Research Future Fund, and then on top of that the Medical Industry Growth Plan. We have got extra funds for vaccinations for children and mothers for whooping cough and meningococcal disease, and that is why it is so important.


Everywhere you turn there are funding increases. We have made health insurance simpler and more understandable. There were so many complex offers there in the market that we simplified it. In mental health, as I mentioned, former minister Fiona Nash, the former Minister for Rural Health, initiated extra funding for mental health in remote Australia. We have got extra funds for immunisation and for drug treatment and prevention. (Time expired)

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (15:52):  It has been really difficult sitting here in the chamber listening to the doublespeak on the other side. I'm here as a hospital pharmacist and a mental health worker, and I just want to call out this claim about patients not being able to get medication over this delay in listing. I worked in mental health units in our public hospital at the time. No patient missed out on medication. Those medications were available under the patient familiarisation scheme because the medications were TGA listed. Not a single patient in our mental health service missed out on medications during that period, and I think that needs to be put on the record. This doublespeak is misleading the community and the public about access to medications.


If those opposite want to talk about access to medications, what about the problems we have in continuity of access to medications because of the delays in access because of manufacturing problems? That's a real access problem that we have in Australia at the moment.


The health of Australians should be the No. 1 priority of this government, and yet what has it done? It has just cut. Five years of cuts are what has happened to health in our hospitals. The cost of health care is growing, and the system is under strain. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report has finally revealed the full extent of the crisis. Despite this government's promise that no-one would pay more to see a doctor, the report shows that Australians are spending nearly $30 billion on out-of-pocket health expenses every year. In communities like mine, that's not affordable. As a community pharmacist, I've had people come to me and say: 'Which script should I not fill? Which one can I go without? Can I go without my cholesterol medication, or can I go without my hypertension medication? Which one?' That's not a choice that anybody should have to make in Australia today.


These cuts include $3 billion a year in non-hospital Medicare-subsidised services. Half of all patients have incurred out-of-pocket costs to see a GP or a specialist or to have a blood test, an X-ray or other scans. Seventy per cent of patients seeing specialists made some out-of-pocket payment, and more than a million people spent $600 or more on medical gap fees. That is not affordable. That's putting the health of everyday Australians at risk, particularly those in regional and rural communities. And 1.3 million people are delaying or skipping seeing a doctor or getting a test when they need it, putting their health at risk.


The report exposed the bulk-billing doublespeak of the health minister. The data reveals that only 66 per cent of patients are bulk-billed by their GP, not the 86 per cent the minister has claimed over and over again. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association now confirms the figures cited by the minister are misleading. Despite this, the government have said 'Medicare has never been stronger' and their commitment to it is 'rock solid'. Perhaps it's like the 'rock-solid commitment' they have to the current Prime Minister. Yet they will not fully lift the Medicare freeze, with some elements staying in place for another two years. Two years is too long for people who are already out of pocket and whose health is at risk because of the costs of care. 


Labor created Medicare, Labor created the PBS and only Labor will make sure that all Australians can access the health care that they need when they need it. In my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, health care really matters. One in five of us is under 15, and one in five of us is aged over 65. The young and the old in our communities have the biggest health needs. What is our government's answer? This government has walked away from its commitment to the states to fifty-fifty fund public hospitals. In real terms that is a cut of $2.8 billion.


I'll give you a real-life example of what these cuts mean. How did the New South Wales government respond? It was by putting five public hospitals on the market and by threatening to sell public hospitals, to privatise them. But what did our community do? Our community stood up. We stood up for our community hospital and we stopped it being privatised. And my community will stand up again. They'll stand up against these cuts. 


It is absolutely outrageous what this government has done to public hospitals and health care. I challenge anybody to walk into a public hospital, particularly into a mental healthcare unit, and tell me in good conscience—genuinely—they are properly funded. Tell me that. 




Mr Pasin:
  Come to the Sunshine Coast.




Ms McBRIDE:
  Pork-barrelling, is it? Anyone who is waiting for elective surgery or who is waiting to be assessed by a mental health team, anyone who has been to a doctor or specialist and has been hit with a big bill, anyone who has skipped filling a prescription, anybody who has missed an appointment because they can't afford it—do you know where they end up? They end up in the emergency departments of our public hospitals at the end of a queue. That's where this ends up, with people sicker and in emergency departments. This government's record on health is absolutely appalling. It's time for a change in attitude to health. It's time for a change of government now.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:57):  I was going to give a speech simply dismissing the absurdity of this policy motion, but the interjections by the previous speaker cannot go ignored. She went out and promoted a series of untruths about hospital funding in this country, and when a member on this side of the chamber stood up and said, 'Actually, we do have well-funded hospitals in the area and the community that I represent,' the response was, 'Pork-barrelling, is it?' This is the fundamental flaw of everything that sits at the heart of what this opposition stand for. When they disagree, they dismiss or ignore, but the facts and the evidence show them up for the political frauds that they are. It needs to be called out by people on this side of the chamber, because if this motion were put to the parliament as simply a form of wording members would be accused of misleading the parliament. It doesn't make it more true by putting it in a motion and putting it to the parliament. 


As the Minister for Health outlined in his remarks in addressing and responding to this ridiculous motion, if you do not—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member will be seated for a second. The member for Bass on a point of order.




Mr Hart:
  I just wanted to be sure that the member's microphone was working because he was certainly yelling—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member will be seated.




Mr TIM WILSON:
  I welcome the interjection, Deputy Speaker, because I can assure you I need the microphone. As the Minister for Health said previously in the opening of his remarks, 'Without a strong economy you cannot have a strong health system.' This is nakedly obvious to the people on this side of the chamber. But the point isn't that it's supposed to just be a health system. We don't have a strong economy simply to deliver a health system. We have a health system because it is designed to deliver for Australians, to improve the standard of their care, to improve the standard of their welfare and to make sure that, through people's lived experience, when they need assistance and when they need support, particularly in times of vulnerability, the system is there to provide for them. Because that's whom we, the coalition, are for. We're here for people.



Mr Hill interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Bruce is in his wrong place and will be removed if he interjects again.




Mr TIM WILSON:
  The foundations of this motion are based on a falsehood. We know that, under this government, funding has gone up considerably, from $13.3 billion in 2013-14 to a record $22.7 billion in 2020-21. It's an increase. It's kind of more than a little bit of an increase in nominal terms. In fact, it's about a 70 per cent increase in funding. So the very basis of this motion is a falsehood.


We know that, yes, we are moving and adjusting our spending in line with the lived experience of Australians. We have an ageing population. People consume more of their healthcare expenses in the latter stages of their life, and we need to make sure that we care for people in that moment of vulnerability. That's what's been shown up in bulk-billing rates. We have had an increase from 82.2 per cent, the last time the opposition was in government, to 86.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2018. That's quite a significant increase as well. So there has been an increase in bulk-billing rates, we are matching the funding and we are putting the best interests of Australians first. These are all foreign concepts to the opposition.


What we're doing also is backing Australians to take care of themselves. Imagine that! The very foundation of Liberal policy should always be that people who can stand on their own two feet should do so, not just so they can take care of themselves and not be a burden on others but, more critically, so they're in the best situation to help others. What do we have as part of our policy? We have an active encouragement and incentivisation for young Australians to take up private health insurance so they can take care of themselves.


That's the sort of thing that most governments would be fundamentally proud of. In fact, even if oppositions had introduced such policies and wanted to defend them, they would traditionally be proud of them—but not those opposite. Instead, they simply confect outrage because their interest is the politics of health rather than the human outcomes of health. You can say that, in every minute of every hour of every day of this Turnbull Liberal government, we will stand for Australians and by Australians and their health care.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (16:02):  I've worked at the coalface of health care for many, many years, and one thing I know is that the Liberal Party just does not understand public health policy. I rise today to speak on this matter of public importance to highlight the coalition government's track record of cutting health over the past five years. It doesn't matter whether the Prime Minister, at the end of the day, is the member for Wentworth, the member for Warringah, the member for Dickson or even the member for Curtin; the track record of this Liberal-National party government speaks for itself. Every member opposite has been content with the slashing and burning of health over the past half-decade. Sadly, I do not see that a change of leadership is going to change the outcome. Health, education, the environment and the cost of living—these are the issues that we should be speaking about in this incredibly beautiful building. We should not be bickering, talking about ourselves and engaging in egocentric political games—that is not for the betterment of the Australian people.


I'm happy to speak on today's matter of public importance because it is so important to me and it is so important to the Australian people. We are rapidly developing a two-tier health system where the quality of your health care depends on the size of your wallet, and some of the poorest people are having enormous difficulty accessing health care. I've just received a letter from an eminent colleague of mine, Professor John Corbett, who is a very well regarded neurologist from Brisbane. I'll read out the beginning of his letter to me: 'After providing bulk-billed specialist EEG services for over 20 years, I've recently been forced to cease providing these services due to the freeze of Medicare rebates which has been in place since 2012 and will remain in place until July 2020, a total of eight years. It's now impossible to provide EEG services to my patients on a bulk-billing basis any longer. I'll have to cease bulk-billing. This will lead to increased patient costs. It will also lead to increased public hospital waiting lists.'


Just for the information of members opposite, an EEG is a very important neurological investigation done mainly for conditions like epilepsy. It's very important. Often people who suffer from epilepsy have other neurological disorders. They often have difficulty with employment et cetera. They are now going to face huge public hospital waiting lists or increased patient costs. This is just not acceptable to me.


This is the real coalface of health care. This is something that the Liberal-National Party just does not understand. I understand why: many of them have high incomes and good health and don't have to access health care. For many people in my electorate of Macarthur these increased gap costs are prohibitive and they just cannot get care. Those opposite, who have been intent on talking about themselves and dragging the national agenda and public debate down with them, do not really understand health care and do not understand what the Australian people want. We all need a strong Medicare, properly funded hospitals and fewer out-of-pocket expenses for the average Australian.


The average Macarthur resident couldn't care less who is the Leader of the Liberal Party. They just want this incompetent and out-of-touch government kicked out of office. The government are most incompetent in their attitudes to health care. In government, the coalition have slashed health funding. Tony Abbott did it when he was at the helm and Malcolm Turnbull has continued on this legacy. God forbid the member for Dickson becomes the Prime Minister. We know what he did to the healthcare system. He was instrumental in providing the health cuts in the 2014 budget. It was a disaster and absolutely shocking.


My particular interest at the moment is the electronic health records. I see this as a very important way of reducing health costs and providing better health care for all Australians, from children through to those in aged care. This government's rollout of electronic health records has been a total disaster, a total debacle and a complete shambles. It is just a disaster. This government's record on health care speaks for itself. Let me be clear: each member opposite wants to lock in the health cuts and wants to continue with this American-style, two-tier health system and make the poorest of our community struggle with health care. It's a shame. (Time expired)

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:07):  I am pleased to speak in this matter of public importance debate today because I am proud of our government's record on health. I congratulate the Minister for Health and the Minister for Aged Care on their incredible work in this portfolio. They are doing an excellent job of listening to what the Australian people need. Like the ministers, I'm also listening to my community and my local residents as to what they need on health. Because we are listening I worked very closely with the Minister for Health to see the delivery of a national action plan and, so far, more than $4.7 million of federal funding towards endometriosis. Minister Wyatt joined me in my electorate to listen to senior members of my community talk about the issues that are most important to them, and we are working with them as well to deliver in the aged-care space.


It is unsurprising that those opposite want to talk down our contribution to health, but our record speaks for itself. We are achieving record funding for our healthcare system in Australia. In the 2018-19 budget we announced a $2.4 billion investment for new medicines to be listed on the PBS, including $1 billion set aside for the provision of future medicines. In fact, since coming to government we have listed, on average, one new medicine per day. These are often lifesaving medications. So far we've had an overall investment of $9 billion, which is a very significant investment.


Federal funding for public hospitals under the coalition has increased from $13.3 billion in 2013-14 to a record $22.7 billion in 2020-21. This is a 70 per cent increase. Under a new national hospitals agreement, the government has committed an additional $30.2 billion in public hospital funding from 2020-21 to 2024-25, taking overall funding during this period to $130 billion. This means more hospital services, more doctors, more nurses and increased funding every year for every state and territory. This is what responsible governments do.


In stark comparison, those opposite have a terrible track record on health both at the state and federal levels. Nobody knows this better than I do, because I come from the state of South Australia where we saw the state Labor government make one of the most disgraceful decisions of their 16 years in government when they decided to shut down the iconic Repat Hospital. This was devastating to veterans not just in my community but across South Australia.




Ms Burney:
  Take your hand off your heart!




Ms FLINT:
  If the member opposite actually cared to do a quick google on this issue, she would realise how devastating it was to these veterans, particularly our Vietnam veterans, to have this hospital shut down. It was also devastating to the senior members of my community, who regularly used this hospital, and to so many people whose loved ones had passed away in the hospice over decades. It's a much-loved hospital, which is why I worked so hard with the now member for Elder, the member for Waite, the minister for health and the now premier, Steven Marshall, to see the state Liberal government commit to reactivate and reopen the Repat.


I'm so proud that the now South Australian Liberal government committed to reopening operating theatres to reduce elective surgery waiting times, and to reopening the hydrotherapy pool, which has already happened, for veterans in my community to be able to use. They committed to using Ward 18 as an older persons' mental health facility to care for those people who suffered so badly at Oakden, under the disgraceful treatment by the previous state Labor government, and they also committed to building a new older persons' mental health facility.


The Marshall Liberal government have consulted with health professionals as to what else they can do with this wonderful, iconic community hospital site. Last week they commenced community consultation to find out what other services my local residents would like to see reopened on the site. I would encourage all of the members of my local community to have their say as to what they would like to see returned to the Repat site. They have until 16 September to provide submissions on the future of the site. Following this consultation, the state Liberal government will collate all of the feedback and release a final master plan by the end of the year. This is what Liberal governments do. We govern responsibly, we keep community health services where they need to be and we listen to our community. (Time expired)

 (Batman) (16:12):  I rise to speak on this very important matter of public importance. Do you know, I was a nurse for 20 years. I worked in both the public and the private sectors, and I have a very good understanding of what it is to work in a well-funded public health system and in one that has been devastated by funding cuts. I worked in Victoria during the Kennett years. The Jeff Kennett cuts were devastating. They slashed, burned and cut the public health system to critical, low levels. Thousands of nurses left through forced redundancies. Many left through overwork—they simply could not cope with the cuts in that system.


I know what it's like to have to scrounge for pillows. I know what it's like to hide surgical tape in your pockets for fear of there not being any stock when you go to the cupboard. I know what it's like when waiting lists are so long that ambulances line up outside the hospital. I know what it's like to have to see patients frustrated by sitting for hours in waiting rooms at outpatient clinics.


I was at the ACTU when Campbell Newman, the then Premier of Queensland, nearly destroyed the public health sector in Queensland. I was there with nurses and saw the looks on their faces when those white slips appeared in their pigeonholes telling them that they had been earmarked for a redundancy. I know what it was like in Far North Queensland when regional hospitals had to tell their patients that they could no longer afford to fund a cardiac rehabilitation unit and that patients, post-surgery, had to travel 50 kilometres for their check-ups. Do you know what happens when people are told that they have to travel as far as 50 kilometres for appointments? They don't go, they don't do it, and their conditions exacerbate. They rebound back into hospital or worse.


Let's face it: the Liberal Party hates the concept of public health. It goes against its free market, trickle-down economic philosophy. 'If you are sick, bad luck. If you can't pay for health care, you miss out. If health care isn't creating a profit for some multinational enterprise then we don't want it'—and so it goes with this government and, I'm afraid, with its potential new leader, Peter Dutton. He hates public health care as much as Newman and Kennett did. We've heard already how he's been deemed the worst health minister in 35 years—worse than Tony Abbott—cutting billions from hospitals; wanting to dismantle our universal health care system, our beloved Medicare; increasing the burden of prescription costs for all Australians by attacking our PBS safety net; Medicare freezes; introducing co-payments for GPs; and tearing up the National Health Reform Agreement. Undermining our public healthcare system is in the Liberals' DNA. Add to this litany the fact that with the current health minister, Greg Hunt, his only focus is on supporting his mates in the private health insurance industry and plotting with Peter Dutton to run a ticket against our Prime Minister. 


Do Greg Hunt and Peter Dutton have any idea of the impact of funding cuts? They are forcing services to choose which services they will cut—will it be the Indigenous community health service, diabetic nurses or geriatric psychiatric services?—and forcing nurses to make impossible decisions because of funding cuts and not enough staff. Do they understand what it's like to have to decide between walking an elderly patient for their much-needed physio and starting a complex dressing that takes a long time so they can finish it before their shift ends? They might do both, in which case they will work unpaid overtime. We already have a health system that relies on nurses working for free. They have to make decisions like: 'Do I let a sick child sit for two more hours in the emergency department or do I leave a worker with a burn injury or in pain in the waiting room? Do I sit and feed a patient who has had a stroke or do I leave an incontinent patient in a wet bed?' I know what it's like to have to make these decisions, but Peter Dutton and Greg Hunt don't know because they won't try to find out. They don't care. Cutting $57 billion from public hospitals means that our health professionals have to make these hard decisions and more. They want to cut another $2.8 billion from our health system. 


I am proud to say that Labor know what it's like. We have health professionals who know what it's like to work in our public health system. We know what it means to have to make these decisions. We know the difference between working in a well-funded health sector and a sector that has had savage cuts from health ministers who simply don't care. Labor will invest in our health system, we will invest in our healthcare professionals and we will keep our communities healthy.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (16:17):  I would genuinely like to thank the members opposite for raising this matter of public importance. Of course health is one of the most important matters for the public, which is why I'm so proud to speak to our record today. I'm sure you've heard of my boast that I represent Australia's capital of innovation. A huge portion of this innovation comes from the pharmaceutical industry, much of which is based in Macquarie Park, or Pill Hill, as it's known. These include, but are not limited to, companies like Novartis, with Kisquali, their treatment which will help thousands of people with breast cancer; Jansen with Imbruvica, which will benefit hundreds of people with a subtype of lymphoma; Amgen's drug Neulasta, which helps the body cope with the debilitating effects of chemotherapy; Biogen with Spinraza, a life-changing medicine for those with spinal muscular atrophy; and MSD's treatment Keytruda, which is a game-changer in the way it uses the body's own immune system to fight cancers. 


It is all well and good to have companies designing, creating and providing these drugs, but they don't cure one condition or help one person if they can't be accessed by patients who depend on them. That, I am pleased to say, is where this government comes in. Since coming into government the coalition has listed over 1,870 medicines, which equates to an average of one new medicine a day, on the PBS, worth approximately $9.3 billion. In this budget, $2.4 billion has been invested in new medicines, including $1 billion set aside for the provision of future medicines. These medicines will assist people suffering from conditions such as breast cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, heart disease, epilepsy and severe asthma. Some of these cost many thousands of dollars but are now available for $6.40 concessional or $39.50 for general patients per script. 


Just this month the government announced it will invest $250 million to make life-changing medicines available to thousands of Australian patients. These include: 1,000 patients with a type of head and neck cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, who would otherwise pay almost $50,000 a year for Opdivo, will now have affordable access; 1,125 patients with rare types of leukaemia cancer, myeloproliferative neoplasms, who would otherwise pay more than $18,000 a year, will now benefit from the listing of Pegasys. The listing of Kisquali will save over 3,000 patients with breast cancer from having to pay $71,000 per year; 220 patients with subtype lymphoma cancer, relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, will benefit from the listing of Imbruvica as patients would otherwise pay $134,000 a year for this treatment; 1,500 patients who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer will benefit from Neulasta, which will help the body to make neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, saving patients over $4,500 per course of treatment; and there is $241.3 million for Spinraza, a life-changing medicine which treats the devastating illness spinal muscular atrophy, and, without the subsidy, patients would pay more than $367,850 per year.


This record investment in drugs and medicines is only possible because of the arrangements made by this minister with Medicines Australia. These agreements brought certainty to the market, which has brought the industry and government together to help all Australians access more medicines. The PBS needs a responsible government that can afford to pay for these medicines. The Turnbull government will continue to deliver on our promise to list medicines recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee without fear or favour.


In contrast, the last Labor government reversed the policy of the coalition to list all medicines approved by the independent PBAC. On 25 January 2011, the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Nicola Roxon, announced the unprecedented deferral of the listing of seven medicines under the PBS. If it weren't for this government, millions of Australians would be without the medicines that are improving their quality of life and sometimes keeping them alive. Our record on medical listings is a source of great pride to us all. I congratulate the minister. (Time expired)

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (16:23):  As I was saying earlier, it's important to see these bills in the context of the trade agreement that they enable, the PACER Plus agreement. As we do that, it's worth asking, particularly when you consider the relationship between Australia and New Zealand, and the Pacific Island nations that form this agreement with us, exactly what the benefit to the Pacific Island nations will be. And I would begin on that point by noting that Papua New Guinea and Fiji chose to stay out of PACER Plus. Together, those countries represent 80 per cent of the combined GDP of Pacific Island nations. To give you a sense of that disparity or the proportion of trade that PNG and Fiji represent, Australian exports to Papua New Guinea and Fiji are $2.8 billion. Our exports to other Pacific nations, as I understand it, are only $84 million. There was evidence before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties when it looked at the PACER agreement, which is the foundation of the bills we are discussing here, that Papua New Guinea and Fiji chose not to be part of PACER Plus because, in their analysis and from their judgement, it was heavily skewed towards Australia and New Zealand. So as we discuss these bills it's important that we consider some of those related issues.


As I've already said, there is a fundamental imbalance between Australia and New Zealand and the Pacific island nations, and it appears that that imbalance did shape this agreement. I think that is a matter of some concern. I want to look at some particular aspects of PACER Plus that I think are concerning and where those concerns haven't really been resolved by the material that's been available, either in relation to these bills or in relation to the agreement as a whole. Concerns were raised in a number of areas through the JSCOT process that I referred to, and I'll mention three of them. Firstly, there was the reduction in tariff revenue for Pacific island nations; secondly, there were the health impacts of the agreement; and, finally, there was the particular impact on women.


As I said when I began my contribution to this debate, this doesn't remove tariffs that affect goods coming into Australia, it affects exports from Australia. Effectively, it removes tariffs that exist in Pacific island nations on goods that we export. So it costs them tariff revenue, effectively. The analysis that was provided in the consideration of PACER Plus showed that it would cost the larger nations in the Pacific at least $10 million annually, and in relation to the smaller nations it would cost as much as 10 per cent of their government revenue as a whole, which is really quite considerable.


Understandably, if you want to talk about health impacts, when you see that kind of reduction in revenue and that kind of reduction in government capacity you'll see a corresponding reduction in the ability to invest in health services and health infrastructure. The second health impact, which the Public Health Association of Australia highlighted, was in relation to the kinds of products that are likely to flow into the Pacific as a result of tariff reductions. The PHAA was particularly concerned about the increased availability of and lower prices for unhealthy products such as ultraprocessed food, alcohol and tobacco. I will just quote from the material that they provided as part of their submission to the JSCOT:


There is a substantial body of evidence indicating that reduction of tariffs and other 'barriers to trade' in food products can lead to increased availability and lower prices of unhealthy foods, and can affect household food security … The PACER Plus tariff schedules indicate that some Pacific island countries have made commitments to reduce or eliminate tariffs on tobacco products, alcoholic beverages and a variety of processed foods.


So that is one of the possible deleterious impacts of the PACER Plus agreement.


Finally, there was evidence that pointed to the impact of these agreements on women in the Pacific. Again, if you reduce government revenue and the capacity to deliver social services, that does tend to affect women and children disproportionately. And if you have the health impacts that I've just mentioned, they also affect women and children disproportionately. But there are some specific impacts on women that have been identified, particularly by ActionAid Australia, who make the point that women who do paid work in the Pacific islands are concentrated in industries that are likely to be impacted by PACER Plus. Those include agricultural production, clothing, manufacturing and retail. In their submission, they made the following point:


ActionAid is concerned that in its current form, the PACER plus agreement poses a significant risk to women's rights and economic empowerment in the Pacific, and as such is inconsistent with the Australian Government's commitment to gender equality. In particular, PACER plus is anticipated to lead to an erosion of public services, loss of sustainable livelihoods, and adverse health impacts in Pacific Island countries, all of which will disproportionately affect women, and their social and economic empowerment.


What the Pacific islands were particularly interested in when PACER was being considered were the provisions that went to the question of labour mobility. Pacific island nations would obviously like to have the opportunity for their citizens to find work in the region, including in Australia. Remittances from that work is an important source of revenue for Pacific island nations. Unfortunately, the labour mobility piece, if you like, is not included in PACER Plus as a whole but is consigned to a less-than-treaty-status agreement. There were concerns expressed that those kinds of provisions and commitments were far less certain and far less valuable than the tariff reductions and other things that were made plain in PACER Plus.


There's no doubt that, while we make the changes that these two bills, the customs amendment bills, put in place, they are relatively minor in their impact. They really just take care of some sort of technical customs niceties from our side of the arrangement. The PACER Plus agreement as a whole is a relatively significant agreement. The tariffs phase in over a relatively long time. That's probably something to be grateful for. It does leave open, though, the question of just how genuinely beneficial PACER will be to our Pacific islands brothers and sisters. I note that we have allocated official development assistance funds, foreign aid effectively, to help Pacific island nations implement PACER Plus. That puts this agreement squarely in the aid-for-trade—or vice versa—frame, if you like, and I think there are question marks over that approach. There is some irony in providing aid funding to countries to implement trade agreements where the vast proportion of the benefits of those agreements come to the donor country.


The reason it's hard to be sure about PACER Plus is that Australia didn't commission a thorough and independent economic impact analysis. The shadow minister spoke earlier about that failing and our current approach to trade agreements generally. There have been numerous committee reports over the last five years—more than the last five years, actually—during the course of this government and the previous government that have recommended that all trade agreements be accompanied by an independent economic analysis. That has been recommended twice in the course of this parliament in the majority reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties; yet we go without the benefit of that kind of analysis.


It was interesting to hear in the JSCOT hearings on the PACER Plus agreement that departmental staff advised that funding had been provided to Pacific island nations for the purpose of undertaking their own economic analysis but that the results of that analysis were not required to be provided to Australia. So one can only assume that the analysis that Fiji and Papua New Guinea undertook showed them that there wasn't any great benefit in PACER Plus and that that informed their decision to not be part of it.


As I said earlier, the interest the Pacific island nations had was overwhelmingly in relation to labour mobility. On that point I will just point out that Matthew Dornan, the deputy director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University noted that the Pacific island countries were unhappy with the outcome in PACER Plus because the agreement didn't include a binding commitment in relation to labour mobility.


I'll finish by saying, in general terms, that these kinds of agreements do need to be looked at carefully. They need to be looked at through the lens of our broad responsibility to our Pacific island neighbours. We don't stand on an equal footing when we negotiate these kinds of agreements. There is a vast disparity in economic power and capacity between Australia and New Zealand on the one hand and Pacific island nations on the other. I think there are elements of PACER Plus that give great cause for concern because of the fact that they essentially bring tariff benefits to Australian companies but there are no corresponding benefits for Pacific island nations. It's clear that they will receive less tariff revenue as a result and it's also likely that they will see impacts in terms of health and on women and children.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (16:35):  I rise to speak in favour of the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. In speaking on both bills, I do so as they are a step—it is probably fair enough to say a relatively small step but a step nevertheless—in a process of putting in place in this country and within the region the PACER Plus agreements, which have traversed the efforts of a number of governments in this country. We already have a largely open economy, but this is an important step forward.


The PACER Plus agreement is a trade agreement. It is therefore reciprocal in nature. It's a multilateral agreement which seeks to create a free trading zone within the Pacific. In that sense, what is happening now is not complete, because, as the member for Fremantle noted, it is not an agreement which covers, at this stage, Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which would be the two largest economies within the Pacific other than, of course, New Zealand and Australia. It is not principally an agreement which is about the Australian economy. No government has engaged in the PACER Plus negotiations as an exercise in trying to fundamentally expand Australian markets.


To put that into context, what free trade agreements we seek to negotiate as a country occur within a context of priorities around our own economic development, which is why you see trade agreements done with either large countries, large economies or countries where there is the opportunity for significant trade growth in respect of Australian exports. You would never say that in respect of the Pacific, because that's not really been the motivation for governments of either persuasion to pursue PACER Plus. Indeed, if this were only seen through the light of what it could do for the Australian economy, it would never meet the priorities test in the list of countries or regions that we would seek to do a free trade agreement with.


PACER Plus is an exercise of regional leadership in respect of regional development. Ultimately, PACER Plus is about playing a part in the development of the Pacific, and that is evidenced by the 'plus' component of PACER Plus, which is a reference to significant development assistance funds which go hand in hand with the trade agreement and which allow Pacific island countries to engage not only in the PACER Plus agreement itself but also in the regional and, ultimately, the global economy. And that is an important form of assistance for Pacific island countries.


This particular bill provides for the tariff reduction components of the PACER Plus agreement. It's in that context that I would argue that these are significant bills to pass this parliament. There is a lot of work still to be done. The member for Fremantle is absolutely right that this doesn't deal with greater access to the Australian labour market, and there is no doubt that that is a key desire of the countries of the Pacific. There is a sense of it being incomplete so long as Papua New Guinea and Fiji are not part of the PACER Plus arrangements. But it is a step in the right direction in a context where any step in the right direction in terms of the development of the Pacific needs to be celebrated.


The fundamental challenge of a small island state is how to bring to bear a viable economy when ultimately you're talking about small populations in very geographically remote parts of the world. That is the challenge of small island states in the Pacific—it is, in fact, the challenge of small island states globally. How to solve the problem of creating a viable economy in that context is actually far from obvious. In many respects it's a much harder problem to solve than having a viable economy in a country of 25 million people like ourselves, being on a continent. If you are a population of 100,000 people on an island in the middle of the Pacific, how you come up with a solution as to what represents a viable economy is a much harder nut to crack. In that context, Australia's place within the Pacific, by contrast, is as a country having a very large economy and, indeed, a very large labour market in comparison to the countries of the Pacific. We are relatively proximate, obviously, to the countries of the Pacific.


Development assistance aid is fundamentally important in the work that we as a nation do in helping the development of the countries of the Pacific. There is no question about that. We have voiced our concern about the cuts to aid that we've seen from the coalition government. A future Labor government would seek to increase the way in which we provide aid in the Pacific. It is profoundly important. But, in the same breath, I also make the point that, given the particular difficulty of trying to establish viable economies for small island states in the Pacific, and given our relatively large economy, being geographically proximate to the Pacific, access to the Australian economy and to the Australian labour market is profoundly important and actually in a different order of magnitude to development assistance in terms of what it can do for the development of the countries of the Pacific. If we as a nation are serious about the exercise of leadership within the Pacific and seeing the development of the roughly 10 million people who live in the Pacific then we have to be about trying to open up the Australian economy and the Australian labour market more to the benefit of the peoples and the economies of the Pacific. That is the single most significant thing we can do, in an economic sense, in driving economic development within the Pacific. It really deeply matters.


I think the labour market component of that, which the member for Fremantle referred to, is probably the most important side of that equation, particularly now. The Seasonal Worker Program is a really successful example of how providing access to a relatively small number of people from the Pacific to our economy is making such a dramatic economic difference to the countries of the Pacific. We have the privilege of seeing that in operation here in terms of companies in Australia which employ people through the seasonal worker scheme. I note the member for Kingsford Smith is here, and he has seen this as well. Also, going to the Pacific, by seeing how the money earnt in Australia is put to beneficial use in villages throughout the Pacific, you realise the economic power and the developmental power that comes from that.


Opening up the Australian economy to be able to freely trade with it is also important. These bills and the PACER Plus are about that. That's principally what they're about. It is not really about trying to create and open up new markets for Australia, albeit that that occurs. The principal function, as I said at the outset, of the PACER Plus and why it has been pursued by governments of both persuasions is an attempt to provide a building block in that architecture that I've described of opening up the Australian economy and the Australian labour market to the countries of the Pacific, which is so deeply important for them. To do that in a meaningful way does require providing development assistance so that companies in the Pacific may be able to export into Australia—and, again, the member for Kingsford Smith and I have both seen firsthand many companies in the Pacific which have an ability to sell into Australia and indeed New Zealand. This makes a difference for them. It's actually them that ultimately this agreement is about and these bills are about.


We would all want bigger steps in this direction, but it is a nevertheless significant small step in this direction. I have done some work in the Pacific, as the member or Kingsford Smith has done as well. Any step in the right direction in respect of the development of the Pacific needs to be celebrated.


I have on many occasions been generally critical, I guess, about our nation's focus and intent—and perhaps our lack of intent—in terms of the way in which we engage with the Pacific. We're a country which has significant presence in the Pacific, to be sure—our diplomatic presence, our defence cooperation programs with the nations of the Pacific and our patrol boat program, and you could name a whole lot of other efforts that have been quite significant in terms of their presence within the Pacific—but our intent in terms of demonstrating an Australian leadership within the Pacific needs to be much greater than it is. It needs to be transformationally greater than it is.


To this point: it is the case that, when we speak about foreign policy and strategic policy, far too often we talk about countries other than those countries within the region where we have the greatest impact. There are 10 countries in the world which would see their primary partner on the planet as not America and not China but Australia, and yet we could walk around this building and challenge members of this House to name who those 10 countries are. That says something about the fact that we do not pay enough attention to the Pacific.


If you look at the most important bilateral relationship that we have in the world today, our alliance relationship with the United States—which obviously is largely characterised by the United States leading, given their size and their being a superpower—there is one area across a very broad relationship with the United States where the United States actually come to Australia and say: 'We'll do what you say. We'll follow you. We want to understand what Australian leadership is.' That space is in respect of the Pacific. In relation to our most important bilateral relationship, the Pacific is the place where we demonstrate to the United States what Australia looks like as a leader. And you can run that analysis in respect of Europe and in a different context in respect of China and indeed the world.


The way in which we behave in the Pacific is the single most important demonstration of Australian leadership in the world today. That's why we need to take this really seriously. The basis on which we need to take this is not seeking to have an influence over that part of the world because we can or seeking the strategic denial of others. Actually, the focus of why we need to engage in the Pacific is the 10 million inhabitants of the Pacific themselves. We need to be focused on their development, and there is significant development to be done.


The Pacific is that part of the world which performed the worst in respect of the Millennium Development Goals. It's a relative measure, but it means that development in the Pacific is going at a slower rate than in almost any other part of the world. On that measure, by a point in the 2020s, probably the late 2020s, the Pacific may become the least developed part of the world. That is relevant to Australia. That has something to do with us and who we are.


We need to change our focus so that we are absolutely focused on the development, the welfare and the prosperity of those 10 million people, because that is about how Australia looks as a leader in the world. What we have today is a small step but a step nevertheless in the right direction in respect of demonstrating that leadership, and it's because of that that I support these bills today.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:50):  It's a pleasure to follow my friend the member for Corio, who, I think, is widely respected as one of the best parliamentary secretaries and ministers for the Pacific and who really did a lot for development and aid within the Pacific. I'm reminded of programs such as Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development, the climate change adaptation program and all of the health, education, infrastructure and welfare programs that were put in place under the stewardship of the member for Corio when he held this ministry. He's very well respected within the Pacific and someone who I see as an expert on these matters. All of the points that he raised in his speech were spot on.


The Pacific is our neighbourhood. They are our greatest friends and, in many respects, we can be doing more to assist this region within our neighbourhood to ensure that we lift development and that we lift living standards. Given the wealth that Australia has, the relatively high living standards that we have and the absolute poverty and low living standards that most people in the Pacific enjoy, we do have an obligation to do our best to ensure that we're working with the nations of the Pacific to boost their development.


That's why Labor does support these bills that establish, finally, the PACER Plus trade agreement. In this respect, these bills give life to the changes to tariffs and to excise duties that provide that favourable nation status to those Pacific nations that are signed up to this agreement. PACER, of course, means the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations. It's been in negotiation for many years. When I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, this agreement was being negotiated back in 2012. It's an agreement that is good for our region and will support our neighbours. It helps the Pacific island countries become more active partners in, and benefit from, the regional and global trading system.


PACER Plus also includes an aid component to help with the development of the region. Australia's Pacific aid for trade supports helping to increase economic growth, generate jobs and boost living standards. But it was Labor that really committed to establishing this as a foundation for our relationship with the Pacific, and it's Labor that's truly committed to rebuilding Australia's international development assistance levels to beyond what they are at the moment, particularly within our neighbourhood in the Asia-Pacific. A Shorten Labor government will commit to redeveloping Australia's international development assistance program, including in our neighbouring region in the Pacific, and increasing our aid investment to that area.


As our friends in the region know all too well, the Abbott and Turnbull government have slashed aid. That's resulted in approximately $12 billion being slashed from the international aid assistance budget over the course of this government. These cuts are a source of some international embarrassment for Australia, particularly within our region, given the relatively high living standards that we have compared to our Pacific neighbours. There's a clear expectation of many of those in the Pacific that Australia will take a lead in this region on supporting our neighbour's development, and our behaviour and our relationship with our Pacific neighbours is quite important to Australia's international reputation. As the member for Corio mentioned, when it comes to the Pacific, the United States, our very important defence ally, will often come to Australia and ask us our views on particular issues because they see us as the experts. It's within our region. We have traditionally played a very important partnership role with Pacific nations. In some respects, we have assisted with their defence. The pacific patrol boat scheme comes to mind. And many in the region face a range of development challenges, including small domestic markets, narrow production bases, a weak regulatory and private sector capacity, low savings and investment rates as well as high trade and business costs. They also have young fast-growing populations that need growth and jobs. 


The Pacific, unfortunately, has performed the worst of any region when it comes to global development goals. Many of the nations in our backyard don't meet the individual goals within the global development goals, related to things like child mortality rates, levels of primary education and preventable diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the diseases that, unfortunately, is rampant throughout the Pacific. Many people die needlessly each year from a disease that should be preventable within our region. On current measures of relative development, it's possible it won't be too long before Africa overtakes the Pacific on progress towards achieving those development goals. That would mean the Pacific would be the least developed region in the world. That is why Australia has an obligation to do more to support its neighbours within the region.


When Labor were in government we introduced a number of programs aimed specifically at doing just that. One of the big problems within the Pacific is the shockingly high rate of domestic violence and lack of opportunities for participation of women within the economy, within society and within government. That is why Labor instituted the Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development partnership program. It aimed at ensuring we worked with those nations to reduce levels of domestic violence but also to encourage women's participation in society.


I can recall visiting a domestic violence centre in the Solomon Islands. We saw it first hand and spoke to victims of domestic violence about the assistance they were getting from a community centre specifically established to help people deal with domestic violence and to take them and their children out of abusive relationships. It was Australian aid at work, making a difference to the lives of people within our region.


We all know that climate change is a huge problem for nations within the Pacific. Whenever I would meet with Pacific leaders I would ask them what their challenges and issues were. Climate change would always be the No. 1 issue, particularly for nations like Kiribati and Tuvalu where climate change is threatening their very existence, on islands they've inhabited for thousands of years. Wells are becoming salinised. Crops can no longer be grown in traditional areas. Sea levels are rising out of control and extreme weather events, such as cyclones, are becoming all the more frequent. Access to fresh water is becoming an issue for these nations because of climate change.


In Australia when we speak of climate change we see it as something that will affect us in a generation's time—something we don't have to worry about for years to come. But, if you talk to someone in the Pacific, it is affecting them now. It is an immediate threat. Unfortunately, Australia hasn't been doing enough on climate change adaptation. We certainly haven't been doing our fair share when it comes to reducing emissions within our economy and transitioning to cleaner renewable energy, to try and do our bit to reduce the impact of warming and climate change.


Australia should be a natural partner of choice in assisting its close neighbours in their development needs. But, unfortunately, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments—and, let's face it, whoever else is Prime Minister at the end of this week—our leadership role has been eroded in the Pacific. Labor's been warning for some time now that, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Australia has dropped the ball and damaged its reputation within the Pacific. Those $12 billion of cuts to the international aid budget that I mentioned earlier are part of the reason for that.


Earlier this year we saw New Zealand commit to a 30 per cent increase in foreign aid over four years, with the money earmarked primarily for the Pacific region. Their foreign affairs minister, Winston Peters, who is visiting Australia today and did a joint media conference with our Foreign Minister, said that the new commitment reflected New Zealand's identity as being anchored in the Pacific. He said: 'What is good for them is good for us. We all know that, if we look after each other, we're all better off, more prosperous and, therefore, more secure.' He went on to say: 'Prevention saves money. Prevention health strategies save far more taxpayer dollars downstream by tackling health problems early.'


Likewise, Australia has a deep interest in contributing to global poverty alleviation, and our international development program supports security and stability in our region. One obvious need in the region is greater infrastructure investment. Labor has repeatedly stated that infrastructure projects should be transparent, conform to environmental and social safeguards and not place unsustainable debt burdens on regional countries. Australia has an interest and responsibility to assist our smaller regional neighbours with projects that best meet their development needs and provide them with the maximum benefit. This is not about any other country; it is about the role Australia wants to have in our region.


That is why we welcome last month's announcement by Australia, the United States and Japan of a trilateral partnership to invest in infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region. We do need to be much more active when it comes to infrastructure and development within our region. This economic agreement has been years in the making and is signed by most of the nations of the Pacific. It is a shame that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, two of the biggest nations of the Pacific, aren't partners to this agreement. But there is always the opportunity for them to join at a later stage. The focus of Australia, through this agreement, is on building the economic and social capacity of our dear friends in the Pacific to grow their economies, to provide great opportunities for investment in business and greater economic mobility, and ensure that we ultimately improve and boost the living standards of our nearest and dearest neighbours, our friends in the Pacific.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:02):  The Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 implement Australia's obligations under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus, otherwise known as PACER Plus. I note that the minister in the chair was responsible for signing the agreement. It is good to have him here as part of this debate. Australia's relationship with the Pacific island nations is a very important one. The nations of the Pacific are our neighbours and also our friends. This agreement helps to build on this, helping to tie our economies closer together. There are currently 11 signatories to this agreement: Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. As the member for Kingsford Smith just said, hopefully more countries will join this agreement in years ahead—in particular, Papua New Guinea and Fiji.


This agreement will mean tariffs will be cut on 88.5 per cent of Australian exports to signatory countries, apart from New Zealand, and it will also mean that there will be no tariffs on goods imported to Australia from countries that have signed this agreement, apart from New Zealand. These bills implement that commitment. Under the agreement, we will also provide $4 million to assist Pacific island countries to prepare to ratify this agreement and $19 million to update their customs processes. I should note, though, that this doesn't make up for the more than $11 billion that this government has cut from the aid budget. As the Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map that was released earlier this month shows, aid to Pacific island nations has been cut by a number of countries over the last four years, and other countries and organisations like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are moving to fill that gap.


It's also worthy of note that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties gave a report to the House on this agreement. In recommending support for it, they also recommended that this agreement include—or that future trade agreements include—independent economic analysis of the merits of these agreements. This is the third time that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties have recommended that the government conduct independent economic modelling for trade agreements. I note they did that again for a fourth time today. The committee reported today on the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and recommendation 3 of their report is identical to the recommendation they gave in relevance to PACER Plus. I can read that for the House:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider implementing a process through which independent modelling and analysis of a proposed trade agreement is undertaken by the Productivity Commission, or equivalent organisation, and provided to the Committee alongside the National Interest Assessment (NIA) to improve assessment of the agreement.


That was a unanimous recommendation of the committee, led by the Hon. Stuart Robert, who I know the minister holds in high regard. His recommendation, and the recommendation of all of the members of that committee, is worthy of serious consideration by this parliament and by this government. 


It has also been recommended by other parliamentary committees. It has been recommended by the Harper review, by the Productivity Commission and by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, unfortunately, so far it has fallen on deaf ears. I think that is a mistake, because this sort of independent analysis helps to respond to community concerns about agreements like this and whether they are in the national interest. At the moment, what the parliament relies upon and what the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties relies upon is that national interest analysis, a report done by DFAT, a report done by serious and capable professionals, but by individuals who are responsible for negotiating the deal, saying that it's a good deal. I think it would be a worthy addition to public debate and consideration of these agreements for the parliament to have available to it an independent economic analysis of that agreement struck by the government. That's why, if we win the next election, I and other members of the Labor Party team have said we'll fix that and ensure that all future trade agreements are subject to independent economic analysis. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (17:08):  I thank the speakers for their contribution to the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. I note the comments that have been made by a number of people who have participated in this discussion, including the member for Blair, the member for Fremantle, the member for Corio and the member for Kingsford Smith, as well as the shadow minister. At the outset let me say that I find it interesting when I hear the Labor Party talk about reductions in Australia's foreign aid budget. I find it interesting for two reasons. The first is that one of the key initiatives of the Turnbull coalition government has been to refocus our aid assistance—or what we call ODA—towards the Pacific. So we took what was effectively a shotgun approach that previously existed in the sector and targeted it and directed it specifically to—although not exclusively to—Pacific island countries in our region. It's our neighbour and this government feels we should be doing the heaviest lifting. That's precisely what we're doing.


I also find it interesting because, of course, the Labor Party stand up and wring their hands about how there should be more foreign aid money, but they do two things. The first thing they do is never acknowledge they are not committing to replace that money. They just complain about it and make absolutely no commitment whatsoever, which makes, of course, their words exceptionally hollow. The second observation is that the very reason we've had to reduce Australia's foreign aid budget by such a significant amount is the massive structural deficit that the Australian Labor Party put in place. There's a reason why as a country now we are over half a trillion dollars in debt, and that is called the Australian Labor Party. 


The structural deficit that the Australian Labor Party left includes, for example, the fact that Labor put in place an unfunded NDIS and committed to a range of spending that they did not have funding for. That is precisely the reason why this country is faced now with these very difficult challenges. But we've been making slow and steady progress. We're exceptionally close now to going back into surplus, and that's been through prudent economic management. I note, as I said, the complete hollowness of the Australian Labor Party's position when they whinge and complain about the reductions in foreign aid, even though (1) they're responsible for it, and (2) they make zero commitments about actually putting in a single extra dollar.


With respect to broader comments about the contributions that members have made in this debate, including, for example, concerns I heard that were put forward by both the member for Blair and also the shadow minister about how they would like to see, and that there should be, economic modelling on trade agreements: for starters, when Labor were in power they didn't start and conclude a single free trade agreement. But they were able to conclude a couple, and guess what—there was no economic modelling from the Australian Labor Party when they were in government. It's just another example of the Australian Labor Party coming in here and bleating on about how they want the government to act in one way when they themselves didn't do it. It just reinforces, once again, the sheer hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party.


But let's talk specifically about this actual agreement, PACER Plus. As the person who has engaged continuously with the economies across the Pacific, both in my previous role as Minister for International Development in the Pacific and also now as Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, what I am most excited about is the numerous conversations that I've had with key government figures, the private sector and others in the Pacific who are energised and excited about the opportunities that this PACER Plus agreement will provide. It is, in many respects, in equal parts both a trade agreement and a development agreement.


This will be a game changer when it comes into force, not only for Australia's relationship with the Pacific but also in terms of the way in which we will, in a sustainable way, help to build economic resilience and long-term sustainability of Pacific island country economies. Ultimately, it is always going to be far more profitable, in a social sense, for Pacific island countries to build long-term sustainable industries across the Pacific, and we should help provide integration with the Australian economy and the New Zealand economy for those countries.


I note some comments that have come from the Labor Party as well about wanting PNG and Fiji to be part of this agreement. Well, of course we do—of course we do. We have engaged in a very constructive way with both Papua New Guinea and Fiji to try to secure that outcome. We remain very open and willing to engage in very constructive discussions with both of those countries, and we will work to deliver a whole-of-region PACER Plus that includes those two major economies as well.


As I've said on numerous occasions, this coalition government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. PACER Plus will create closer economic integration of Australia and the Pacific island countries. It will drive economic prosperity, raise living standards in the region and complement our trade agreements that are already in force, which are delivering record growth in exports and creating more jobs here in Australia.


PACER Plus is a regional-development-centred trade agreement. To date, PACER Plus has been signed by 11 members of the Pacific Islands Forum, namely, Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. PACER Plus will provide commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and investors in a range of sectors. These opportunities will increase over time as the provisions of the agreement lead to more open and transparent policies, and as wider relationships are built regionally and beyond.


The agreement reflects Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific island countries' commitment to the principles of free and open trade, and the underlying impetus for negotiating PACER Plus and its goal of regional economic integration is the formation of an interconnected Pacific market, including Australia and New Zealand, enabling the Pacific islands to access a larger market for their consumers and producers. While PACER Plus provides the framework for this integration, dedicated assistance is critical to addressing barriers in Pacific island signatories and to unlocking the benefits. PACER Plus provides this assistance.


The PACER Plus bills represent the key legislative changes required to give effect to the new rules of origin required to implement PACER Plus. The Customs Act 1901 is being amended to include new rules-of-origin requirements and, also, to enable a full set of related product-specific rules that remain in keeping with modern FTAs. The amendments contained in this bill will enable eligible goods that satisfy the PACER Plus rules of origin to be entered into Australia at preferential rates of customs duty. The Customs Tariff Act 1995 is being amended to set out the preferential rate of customs duty for goods that satisfy the new rules-of-origin requirements. These new rules are consistent with existing arrangements for duties imposed on excise-equivalent goods. Without these amendments, Australia would not be able to complete its domestic arrangements and the agreement would not be able to enter into force. This would prevent Australian businesses from receiving the various benefits that will flow from the agreement.


It's important that Australia be among the first eight countries to ratify, as early ratification would signal Australia's commitment to both PACER Plus and the rules based trade in the Indo-Pacific. PACER Plus will enter into force 60 days after the eighth signatory notifies, and I note that Tonga, as the depository, has ratified the agreement. Closer economic integration with the Pacific region and with larger economies such as Australia and New Zealand is essential for sustainable economic growth in the Pacific. In addition to implementing PACER Plus, Australia will continue to work to increase Pacific-wide trade, tourism and investment.

Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (16:23):  As I was saying earlier, it's important to see these bills in the context of the trade agreement that they enable, the PACER Plus agreement. As we do that, it's worth asking, particularly when you consider the relationship between Australia and New Zealand, and the Pacific Island nations that form this agreement with us, exactly what the benefit to the Pacific Island nations will be. And I would begin on that point by noting that Papua New Guinea and Fiji chose to stay out of PACER Plus. Together, those countries represent 80 per cent of the combined GDP of Pacific Island nations. To give you a sense of that disparity or the proportion of trade that PNG and Fiji represent, Australian exports to Papua New Guinea and Fiji are $2.8 billion. Our exports to other Pacific nations, as I understand it, are only $84 million. There was evidence before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties when it looked at the PACER agreement, which is the foundation of the bills we are discussing here, that Papua New Guinea and Fiji chose not to be part of PACER Plus because, in their analysis and from their judgement, it was heavily skewed towards Australia and New Zealand. So as we discuss these bills it's important that we consider some of those related issues.


As I've already said, there is a fundamental imbalance between Australia and New Zealand and the Pacific island nations, and it appears that that imbalance did shape this agreement. I think that is a matter of some concern. I want to look at some particular aspects of PACER Plus that I think are concerning and where those concerns haven't really been resolved by the material that's been available, either in relation to these bills or in relation to the agreement as a whole. Concerns were raised in a number of areas through the JSCOT process that I referred to, and I'll mention three of them. Firstly, there was the reduction in tariff revenue for Pacific island nations; secondly, there were the health impacts of the agreement; and, finally, there was the particular impact on women.


As I said when I began my contribution to this debate, this doesn't remove tariffs that affect goods coming into Australia, it affects exports from Australia. Effectively, it removes tariffs that exist in Pacific island nations on goods that we export. So it costs them tariff revenue, effectively. The analysis that was provided in the consideration of PACER Plus showed that it would cost the larger nations in the Pacific at least $10 million annually, and in relation to the smaller nations it would cost as much as 10 per cent of their government revenue as a whole, which is really quite considerable.


Understandably, if you want to talk about health impacts, when you see that kind of reduction in revenue and that kind of reduction in government capacity you'll see a corresponding reduction in the ability to invest in health services and health infrastructure. The second health impact, which the Public Health Association of Australia highlighted, was in relation to the kinds of products that are likely to flow into the Pacific as a result of tariff reductions. The PHAA was particularly concerned about the increased availability of and lower prices for unhealthy products such as ultraprocessed food, alcohol and tobacco. I will just quote from the material that they provided as part of their submission to the JSCOT:


There is a substantial body of evidence indicating that reduction of tariffs and other 'barriers to trade' in food products can lead to increased availability and lower prices of unhealthy foods, and can affect household food security … The PACER Plus tariff schedules indicate that some Pacific island countries have made commitments to reduce or eliminate tariffs on tobacco products, alcoholic beverages and a variety of processed foods.


So that is one of the possible deleterious impacts of the PACER Plus agreement.


Finally, there was evidence that pointed to the impact of these agreements on women in the Pacific. Again, if you reduce government revenue and the capacity to deliver social services, that does tend to affect women and children disproportionately. And if you have the health impacts that I've just mentioned, they also affect women and children disproportionately. But there are some specific impacts on women that have been identified, particularly by ActionAid Australia, who make the point that women who do paid work in the Pacific islands are concentrated in industries that are likely to be impacted by PACER Plus. Those include agricultural production, clothing, manufacturing and retail. In their submission, they made the following point:


ActionAid is concerned that in its current form, the PACER plus agreement poses a significant risk to women's rights and economic empowerment in the Pacific, and as such is inconsistent with the Australian Government's commitment to gender equality. In particular, PACER plus is anticipated to lead to an erosion of public services, loss of sustainable livelihoods, and adverse health impacts in Pacific Island countries, all of which will disproportionately affect women, and their social and economic empowerment.


What the Pacific islands were particularly interested in when PACER was being considered were the provisions that went to the question of labour mobility. Pacific island nations would obviously like to have the opportunity for their citizens to find work in the region, including in Australia. Remittances from that work is an important source of revenue for Pacific island nations. Unfortunately, the labour mobility piece, if you like, is not included in PACER Plus as a whole but is consigned to a less-than-treaty-status agreement. There were concerns expressed that those kinds of provisions and commitments were far less certain and far less valuable than the tariff reductions and other things that were made plain in PACER Plus.


There's no doubt that, while we make the changes that these two bills, the customs amendment bills, put in place, they are relatively minor in their impact. They really just take care of some sort of technical customs niceties from our side of the arrangement. The PACER Plus agreement as a whole is a relatively significant agreement. The tariffs phase in over a relatively long time. That's probably something to be grateful for. It does leave open, though, the question of just how genuinely beneficial PACER will be to our Pacific islands brothers and sisters. I note that we have allocated official development assistance funds, foreign aid effectively, to help Pacific island nations implement PACER Plus. That puts this agreement squarely in the aid-for-trade—or vice versa—frame, if you like, and I think there are question marks over that approach. There is some irony in providing aid funding to countries to implement trade agreements where the vast proportion of the benefits of those agreements come to the donor country.


The reason it's hard to be sure about PACER Plus is that Australia didn't commission a thorough and independent economic impact analysis. The shadow minister spoke earlier about that failing and our current approach to trade agreements generally. There have been numerous committee reports over the last five years—more than the last five years, actually—during the course of this government and the previous government that have recommended that all trade agreements be accompanied by an independent economic analysis. That has been recommended twice in the course of this parliament in the majority reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties; yet we go without the benefit of that kind of analysis.


It was interesting to hear in the JSCOT hearings on the PACER Plus agreement that departmental staff advised that funding had been provided to Pacific island nations for the purpose of undertaking their own economic analysis but that the results of that analysis were not required to be provided to Australia. So one can only assume that the analysis that Fiji and Papua New Guinea undertook showed them that there wasn't any great benefit in PACER Plus and that that informed their decision to not be part of it.


As I said earlier, the interest the Pacific island nations had was overwhelmingly in relation to labour mobility. On that point I will just point out that Matthew Dornan, the deputy director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University noted that the Pacific island countries were unhappy with the outcome in PACER Plus because the agreement didn't include a binding commitment in relation to labour mobility.


I'll finish by saying, in general terms, that these kinds of agreements do need to be looked at carefully. They need to be looked at through the lens of our broad responsibility to our Pacific island neighbours. We don't stand on an equal footing when we negotiate these kinds of agreements. There is a vast disparity in economic power and capacity between Australia and New Zealand on the one hand and Pacific island nations on the other. I think there are elements of PACER Plus that give great cause for concern because of the fact that they essentially bring tariff benefits to Australian companies but there are no corresponding benefits for Pacific island nations. It's clear that they will receive less tariff revenue as a result and it's also likely that they will see impacts in terms of health and on women and children.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2018-08-22,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (16:35):  I rise to speak in favour of the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. In speaking on both bills, I do so as they are a step—it is probably fair enough to say a relatively small step but a step nevertheless—in a process of putting in place in this country and within the region the PACER Plus agreements, which have traversed the efforts of a number of governments in this country. We already have a largely open economy, but this is an important step forward.


The PACER Plus agreement is a trade agreement. It is therefore reciprocal in nature. It's a multilateral agreement which seeks to create a free trading zone within the Pacific. In that sense, what is happening now is not complete, because, as the member for Fremantle noted, it is not an agreement which covers, at this stage, Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which would be the two largest economies within the Pacific other than, of course, New Zealand and Australia. It is not principally an agreement which is about the Australian economy. No government has engaged in the PACER Plus negotiations as an exercise in trying to fundamentally expand Australian markets.


To put that into context, what free trade agreements we seek to negotiate as a country occur within a context of priorities around our own economic development, which is why you see trade agreements done with either large countries, large economies or countries where there is the opportunity for significant trade growth in respect of Australian exports. You would never say that in respect of the Pacific, because that's not really been the motivation for governments of either persuasion to pursue PACER Plus. Indeed, if this were only seen through the light of what it could do for the Australian economy, it would never meet the priorities test in the list of countries or regions that we would seek to do a free trade agreement with.


PACER Plus is an exercise of regional leadership in respect of regional development. Ultimately, PACER Plus is about playing a part in the development of the Pacific, and that is evidenced by the 'plus' component of PACER Plus, which is a reference to significant development assistance funds which go hand in hand with the trade agreement and which allow Pacific island countries to engage not only in the PACER Plus agreement itself but also in the regional and, ultimately, the global economy. And that is an important form of assistance for Pacific island countries.


This particular bill provides for the tariff reduction components of the PACER Plus agreement. It's in that context that I would argue that these are significant bills to pass this parliament. There is a lot of work still to be done. The member for Fremantle is absolutely right that this doesn't deal with greater access to the Australian labour market, and there is no doubt that that is a key desire of the countries of the Pacific. There is a sense of it being incomplete so long as Papua New Guinea and Fiji are not part of the PACER Plus arrangements. But it is a step in the right direction in a context where any step in the right direction in terms of the development of the Pacific needs to be celebrated.


The fundamental challenge of a small island state is how to bring to bear a viable economy when ultimately you're talking about small populations in very geographically remote parts of the world. That is the challenge of small island states in the Pacific—it is, in fact, the challenge of small island states globally. How to solve the problem of creating a viable economy in that context is actually far from obvious. In many respects it's a much harder problem to solve than having a viable economy in a country of 25 million people like ourselves, being on a continent. If you are a population of 100,000 people on an island in the middle of the Pacific, how you come up with a solution as to what represents a viable economy is a much harder nut to crack. In that context, Australia's place within the Pacific, by contrast, is as a country having a very large economy and, indeed, a very large labour market in comparison to the countries of the Pacific. We are relatively proximate, obviously, to the countries of the Pacific.


Development assistance aid is fundamentally important in the work that we as a nation do in helping the development of the countries of the Pacific. There is no question about that. We have voiced our concern about the cuts to aid that we've seen from the coalition government. A future Labor government would seek to increase the way in which we provide aid in the Pacific. It is profoundly important. But, in the same breath, I also make the point that, given the particular difficulty of trying to establish viable economies for small island states in the Pacific, and given our relatively large economy, being geographically proximate to the Pacific, access to the Australian economy and to the Australian labour market is profoundly important and actually in a different order of magnitude to development assistance in terms of what it can do for the development of the countries of the Pacific. If we as a nation are serious about the exercise of leadership within the Pacific and seeing the development of the roughly 10 million people who live in the Pacific then we have to be about trying to open up the Australian economy and the Australian labour market more to the benefit of the peoples and the economies of the Pacific. That is the single most significant thing we can do, in an economic sense, in driving economic development within the Pacific. It really deeply matters.


I think the labour market component of that, which the member for Fremantle referred to, is probably the most important side of that equation, particularly now. The Seasonal Worker Program is a really successful example of how providing access to a relatively small number of people from the Pacific to our economy is making such a dramatic economic difference to the countries of the Pacific. We have the privilege of seeing that in operation here in terms of companies in Australia which employ people through the seasonal worker scheme. I note the member for Kingsford Smith is here, and he has seen this as well. Also, going to the Pacific, by seeing how the money earnt in Australia is put to beneficial use in villages throughout the Pacific, you realise the economic power and the developmental power that comes from that.


Opening up the Australian economy to be able to freely trade with it is also important. These bills and the PACER Plus are about that. That's principally what they're about. It is not really about trying to create and open up new markets for Australia, albeit that that occurs. The principal function, as I said at the outset, of the PACER Plus and why it has been pursued by governments of both persuasions is an attempt to provide a building block in that architecture that I've described of opening up the Australian economy and the Australian labour market to the countries of the Pacific, which is so deeply important for them. To do that in a meaningful way does require providing development assistance so that companies in the Pacific may be able to export into Australia—and, again, the member for Kingsford Smith and I have both seen firsthand many companies in the Pacific which have an ability to sell into Australia and indeed New Zealand. This makes a difference for them. It's actually them that ultimately this agreement is about and these bills are about.


We would all want bigger steps in this direction, but it is a nevertheless significant small step in this direction. I have done some work in the Pacific, as the member or Kingsford Smith has done as well. Any step in the right direction in respect of the development of the Pacific needs to be celebrated.


I have on many occasions been generally critical, I guess, about our nation's focus and intent—and perhaps our lack of intent—in terms of the way in which we engage with the Pacific. We're a country which has significant presence in the Pacific, to be sure—our diplomatic presence, our defence cooperation programs with the nations of the Pacific and our patrol boat program, and you could name a whole lot of other efforts that have been quite significant in terms of their presence within the Pacific—but our intent in terms of demonstrating an Australian leadership within the Pacific needs to be much greater than it is. It needs to be transformationally greater than it is.


To this point: it is the case that, when we speak about foreign policy and strategic policy, far too often we talk about countries other than those countries within the region where we have the greatest impact. There are 10 countries in the world which would see their primary partner on the planet as not America and not China but Australia, and yet we could walk around this building and challenge members of this House to name who those 10 countries are. That says something about the fact that we do not pay enough attention to the Pacific.


If you look at the most important bilateral relationship that we have in the world today, our alliance relationship with the United States—which obviously is largely characterised by the United States leading, given their size and their being a superpower—there is one area across a very broad relationship with the United States where the United States actually come to Australia and say: 'We'll do what you say. We'll follow you. We want to understand what Australian leadership is.' That space is in respect of the Pacific. In relation to our most important bilateral relationship, the Pacific is the place where we demonstrate to the United States what Australia looks like as a leader. And you can run that analysis in respect of Europe and in a different context in respect of China and indeed the world.


The way in which we behave in the Pacific is the single most important demonstration of Australian leadership in the world today. That's why we need to take this really seriously. The basis on which we need to take this is not seeking to have an influence over that part of the world because we can or seeking the strategic denial of others. Actually, the focus of why we need to engage in the Pacific is the 10 million inhabitants of the Pacific themselves. We need to be focused on their development, and there is significant development to be done.


The Pacific is that part of the world which performed the worst in respect of the Millennium Development Goals. It's a relative measure, but it means that development in the Pacific is going at a slower rate than in almost any other part of the world. On that measure, by a point in the 2020s, probably the late 2020s, the Pacific may become the least developed part of the world. That is relevant to Australia. That has something to do with us and who we are.


We need to change our focus so that we are absolutely focused on the development, the welfare and the prosperity of those 10 million people, because that is about how Australia looks as a leader in the world. What we have today is a small step but a step nevertheless in the right direction in respect of demonstrating that leadership, and it's because of that that I support these bills today.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:50):  It's a pleasure to follow my friend the member for Corio, who, I think, is widely respected as one of the best parliamentary secretaries and ministers for the Pacific and who really did a lot for development and aid within the Pacific. I'm reminded of programs such as Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development, the climate change adaptation program and all of the health, education, infrastructure and welfare programs that were put in place under the stewardship of the member for Corio when he held this ministry. He's very well respected within the Pacific and someone who I see as an expert on these matters. All of the points that he raised in his speech were spot on.


The Pacific is our neighbourhood. They are our greatest friends and, in many respects, we can be doing more to assist this region within our neighbourhood to ensure that we lift development and that we lift living standards. Given the wealth that Australia has, the relatively high living standards that we have and the absolute poverty and low living standards that most people in the Pacific enjoy, we do have an obligation to do our best to ensure that we're working with the nations of the Pacific to boost their development.


That's why Labor does support these bills that establish, finally, the PACER Plus trade agreement. In this respect, these bills give life to the changes to tariffs and to excise duties that provide that favourable nation status to those Pacific nations that are signed up to this agreement. PACER, of course, means the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations. It's been in negotiation for many years. When I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, this agreement was being negotiated back in 2012. It's an agreement that is good for our region and will support our neighbours. It helps the Pacific island countries become more active partners in, and benefit from, the regional and global trading system.


PACER Plus also includes an aid component to help with the development of the region. Australia's Pacific aid for trade supports helping to increase economic growth, generate jobs and boost living standards. But it was Labor that really committed to establishing this as a foundation for our relationship with the Pacific, and it's Labor that's truly committed to rebuilding Australia's international development assistance levels to beyond what they are at the moment, particularly within our neighbourhood in the Asia-Pacific. A Shorten Labor government will commit to redeveloping Australia's international development assistance program, including in our neighbouring region in the Pacific, and increasing our aid investment to that area.


As our friends in the region know all too well, the Abbott and Turnbull government have slashed aid. That's resulted in approximately $12 billion being slashed from the international aid assistance budget over the course of this government. These cuts are a source of some international embarrassment for Australia, particularly within our region, given the relatively high living standards that we have compared to our Pacific neighbours. There's a clear expectation of many of those in the Pacific that Australia will take a lead in this region on supporting our neighbour's development, and our behaviour and our relationship with our Pacific neighbours is quite important to Australia's international reputation. As the member for Corio mentioned, when it comes to the Pacific, the United States, our very important defence ally, will often come to Australia and ask us our views on particular issues because they see us as the experts. It's within our region. We have traditionally played a very important partnership role with Pacific nations. In some respects, we have assisted with their defence. The pacific patrol boat scheme comes to mind. And many in the region face a range of development challenges, including small domestic markets, narrow production bases, a weak regulatory and private sector capacity, low savings and investment rates as well as high trade and business costs. They also have young fast-growing populations that need growth and jobs. 


The Pacific, unfortunately, has performed the worst of any region when it comes to global development goals. Many of the nations in our backyard don't meet the individual goals within the global development goals, related to things like child mortality rates, levels of primary education and preventable diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the diseases that, unfortunately, is rampant throughout the Pacific. Many people die needlessly each year from a disease that should be preventable within our region. On current measures of relative development, it's possible it won't be too long before Africa overtakes the Pacific on progress towards achieving those development goals. That would mean the Pacific would be the least developed region in the world. That is why Australia has an obligation to do more to support its neighbours within the region.


When Labor were in government we introduced a number of programs aimed specifically at doing just that. One of the big problems within the Pacific is the shockingly high rate of domestic violence and lack of opportunities for participation of women within the economy, within society and within government. That is why Labor instituted the Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development partnership program. It aimed at ensuring we worked with those nations to reduce levels of domestic violence but also to encourage women's participation in society.


I can recall visiting a domestic violence centre in the Solomon Islands. We saw it first hand and spoke to victims of domestic violence about the assistance they were getting from a community centre specifically established to help people deal with domestic violence and to take them and their children out of abusive relationships. It was Australian aid at work, making a difference to the lives of people within our region.


We all know that climate change is a huge problem for nations within the Pacific. Whenever I would meet with Pacific leaders I would ask them what their challenges and issues were. Climate change would always be the No. 1 issue, particularly for nations like Kiribati and Tuvalu where climate change is threatening their very existence, on islands they've inhabited for thousands of years. Wells are becoming salinised. Crops can no longer be grown in traditional areas. Sea levels are rising out of control and extreme weather events, such as cyclones, are becoming all the more frequent. Access to fresh water is becoming an issue for these nations because of climate change.


In Australia when we speak of climate change we see it as something that will affect us in a generation's time—something we don't have to worry about for years to come. But, if you talk to someone in the Pacific, it is affecting them now. It is an immediate threat. Unfortunately, Australia hasn't been doing enough on climate change adaptation. We certainly haven't been doing our fair share when it comes to reducing emissions within our economy and transitioning to cleaner renewable energy, to try and do our bit to reduce the impact of warming and climate change.


Australia should be a natural partner of choice in assisting its close neighbours in their development needs. But, unfortunately, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments—and, let's face it, whoever else is Prime Minister at the end of this week—our leadership role has been eroded in the Pacific. Labor's been warning for some time now that, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Australia has dropped the ball and damaged its reputation within the Pacific. Those $12 billion of cuts to the international aid budget that I mentioned earlier are part of the reason for that.


Earlier this year we saw New Zealand commit to a 30 per cent increase in foreign aid over four years, with the money earmarked primarily for the Pacific region. Their foreign affairs minister, Winston Peters, who is visiting Australia today and did a joint media conference with our Foreign Minister, said that the new commitment reflected New Zealand's identity as being anchored in the Pacific. He said: 'What is good for them is good for us. We all know that, if we look after each other, we're all better off, more prosperous and, therefore, more secure.' He went on to say: 'Prevention saves money. Prevention health strategies save far more taxpayer dollars downstream by tackling health problems early.'


Likewise, Australia has a deep interest in contributing to global poverty alleviation, and our international development program supports security and stability in our region. One obvious need in the region is greater infrastructure investment. Labor has repeatedly stated that infrastructure projects should be transparent, conform to environmental and social safeguards and not place unsustainable debt burdens on regional countries. Australia has an interest and responsibility to assist our smaller regional neighbours with projects that best meet their development needs and provide them with the maximum benefit. This is not about any other country; it is about the role Australia wants to have in our region.


That is why we welcome last month's announcement by Australia, the United States and Japan of a trilateral partnership to invest in infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region. We do need to be much more active when it comes to infrastructure and development within our region. This economic agreement has been years in the making and is signed by most of the nations of the Pacific. It is a shame that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, two of the biggest nations of the Pacific, aren't partners to this agreement. But there is always the opportunity for them to join at a later stage. The focus of Australia, through this agreement, is on building the economic and social capacity of our dear friends in the Pacific to grow their economies, to provide great opportunities for investment in business and greater economic mobility, and ensure that we ultimately improve and boost the living standards of our nearest and dearest neighbours, our friends in the Pacific.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:02):  The Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 implement Australia's obligations under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus, otherwise known as PACER Plus. I note that the minister in the chair was responsible for signing the agreement. It is good to have him here as part of this debate. Australia's relationship with the Pacific island nations is a very important one. The nations of the Pacific are our neighbours and also our friends. This agreement helps to build on this, helping to tie our economies closer together. There are currently 11 signatories to this agreement: Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. As the member for Kingsford Smith just said, hopefully more countries will join this agreement in years ahead—in particular, Papua New Guinea and Fiji.


This agreement will mean tariffs will be cut on 88.5 per cent of Australian exports to signatory countries, apart from New Zealand, and it will also mean that there will be no tariffs on goods imported to Australia from countries that have signed this agreement, apart from New Zealand. These bills implement that commitment. Under the agreement, we will also provide $4 million to assist Pacific island countries to prepare to ratify this agreement and $19 million to update their customs processes. I should note, though, that this doesn't make up for the more than $11 billion that this government has cut from the aid budget. As the Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map that was released earlier this month shows, aid to Pacific island nations has been cut by a number of countries over the last four years, and other countries and organisations like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are moving to fill that gap.


It's also worthy of note that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties gave a report to the House on this agreement. In recommending support for it, they also recommended that this agreement include—or that future trade agreements include—independent economic analysis of the merits of these agreements. This is the third time that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties have recommended that the government conduct independent economic modelling for trade agreements. I note they did that again for a fourth time today. The committee reported today on the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and recommendation 3 of their report is identical to the recommendation they gave in relevance to PACER Plus. I can read that for the House:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider implementing a process through which independent modelling and analysis of a proposed trade agreement is undertaken by the Productivity Commission, or equivalent organisation, and provided to the Committee alongside the National Interest Assessment (NIA) to improve assessment of the agreement.


That was a unanimous recommendation of the committee, led by the Hon. Stuart Robert, who I know the minister holds in high regard. His recommendation, and the recommendation of all of the members of that committee, is worthy of serious consideration by this parliament and by this government. 


It has also been recommended by other parliamentary committees. It has been recommended by the Harper review, by the Productivity Commission and by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, unfortunately, so far it has fallen on deaf ears. I think that is a mistake, because this sort of independent analysis helps to respond to community concerns about agreements like this and whether they are in the national interest. At the moment, what the parliament relies upon and what the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties relies upon is that national interest analysis, a report done by DFAT, a report done by serious and capable professionals, but by individuals who are responsible for negotiating the deal, saying that it's a good deal. I think it would be a worthy addition to public debate and consideration of these agreements for the parliament to have available to it an independent economic analysis of that agreement struck by the government. That's why, if we win the next election, I and other members of the Labor Party team have said we'll fix that and ensure that all future trade agreements are subject to independent economic analysis. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (17:08):  I thank the speakers for their contribution to the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. I note the comments that have been made by a number of people who have participated in this discussion, including the member for Blair, the member for Fremantle, the member for Corio and the member for Kingsford Smith, as well as the shadow minister. At the outset let me say that I find it interesting when I hear the Labor Party talk about reductions in Australia's foreign aid budget. I find it interesting for two reasons. The first is that one of the key initiatives of the Turnbull coalition government has been to refocus our aid assistance—or what we call ODA—towards the Pacific. So we took what was effectively a shotgun approach that previously existed in the sector and targeted it and directed it specifically to—although not exclusively to—Pacific island countries in our region. It's our neighbour and this government feels we should be doing the heaviest lifting. That's precisely what we're doing.


I also find it interesting because, of course, the Labor Party stand up and wring their hands about how there should be more foreign aid money, but they do two things. The first thing they do is never acknowledge they are not committing to replace that money. They just complain about it and make absolutely no commitment whatsoever, which makes, of course, their words exceptionally hollow. The second observation is that the very reason we've had to reduce Australia's foreign aid budget by such a significant amount is the massive structural deficit that the Australian Labor Party put in place. There's a reason why as a country now we are over half a trillion dollars in debt, and that is called the Australian Labor Party. 


The structural deficit that the Australian Labor Party left includes, for example, the fact that Labor put in place an unfunded NDIS and committed to a range of spending that they did not have funding for. That is precisely the reason why this country is faced now with these very difficult challenges. But we've been making slow and steady progress. We're exceptionally close now to going back into surplus, and that's been through prudent economic management. I note, as I said, the complete hollowness of the Australian Labor Party's position when they whinge and complain about the reductions in foreign aid, even though (1) they're responsible for it, and (2) they make zero commitments about actually putting in a single extra dollar.


With respect to broader comments about the contributions that members have made in this debate, including, for example, concerns I heard that were put forward by both the member for Blair and also the shadow minister about how they would like to see, and that there should be, economic modelling on trade agreements: for starters, when Labor were in power they didn't start and conclude a single free trade agreement. But they were able to conclude a couple, and guess what—there was no economic modelling from the Australian Labor Party when they were in government. It's just another example of the Australian Labor Party coming in here and bleating on about how they want the government to act in one way when they themselves didn't do it. It just reinforces, once again, the sheer hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party.


But let's talk specifically about this actual agreement, PACER Plus. As the person who has engaged continuously with the economies across the Pacific, both in my previous role as Minister for International Development in the Pacific and also now as Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, what I am most excited about is the numerous conversations that I've had with key government figures, the private sector and others in the Pacific who are energised and excited about the opportunities that this PACER Plus agreement will provide. It is, in many respects, in equal parts both a trade agreement and a development agreement.


This will be a game changer when it comes into force, not only for Australia's relationship with the Pacific but also in terms of the way in which we will, in a sustainable way, help to build economic resilience and long-term sustainability of Pacific island country economies. Ultimately, it is always going to be far more profitable, in a social sense, for Pacific island countries to build long-term sustainable industries across the Pacific, and we should help provide integration with the Australian economy and the New Zealand economy for those countries.


I note some comments that have come from the Labor Party as well about wanting PNG and Fiji to be part of this agreement. Well, of course we do—of course we do. We have engaged in a very constructive way with both Papua New Guinea and Fiji to try to secure that outcome. We remain very open and willing to engage in very constructive discussions with both of those countries, and we will work to deliver a whole-of-region PACER Plus that includes those two major economies as well.


As I've said on numerous occasions, this coalition government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. PACER Plus will create closer economic integration of Australia and the Pacific island countries. It will drive economic prosperity, raise living standards in the region and complement our trade agreements that are already in force, which are delivering record growth in exports and creating more jobs here in Australia.


PACER Plus is a regional-development-centred trade agreement. To date, PACER Plus has been signed by 11 members of the Pacific Islands Forum, namely, Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. PACER Plus will provide commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and investors in a range of sectors. These opportunities will increase over time as the provisions of the agreement lead to more open and transparent policies, and as wider relationships are built regionally and beyond.


The agreement reflects Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific island countries' commitment to the principles of free and open trade, and the underlying impetus for negotiating PACER Plus and its goal of regional economic integration is the formation of an interconnected Pacific market, including Australia and New Zealand, enabling the Pacific islands to access a larger market for their consumers and producers. While PACER Plus provides the framework for this integration, dedicated assistance is critical to addressing barriers in Pacific island signatories and to unlocking the benefits. PACER Plus provides this assistance.


The PACER Plus bills represent the key legislative changes required to give effect to the new rules of origin required to implement PACER Plus. The Customs Act 1901 is being amended to include new rules-of-origin requirements and, also, to enable a full set of related product-specific rules that remain in keeping with modern FTAs. The amendments contained in this bill will enable eligible goods that satisfy the PACER Plus rules of origin to be entered into Australia at preferential rates of customs duty. The Customs Tariff Act 1995 is being amended to set out the preferential rate of customs duty for goods that satisfy the new rules-of-origin requirements. These new rules are consistent with existing arrangements for duties imposed on excise-equivalent goods. Without these amendments, Australia would not be able to complete its domestic arrangements and the agreement would not be able to enter into force. This would prevent Australian businesses from receiving the various benefits that will flow from the agreement.


It's important that Australia be among the first eight countries to ratify, as early ratification would signal Australia's commitment to both PACER Plus and the rules based trade in the Indo-Pacific. PACER Plus will enter into force 60 days after the eighth signatory notifies, and I note that Tonga, as the depository, has ratified the agreement. Closer economic integration with the Pacific region and with larger economies such as Australia and New Zealand is essential for sustainable economic growth in the Pacific. In addition to implementing PACER Plus, Australia will continue to work to increase Pacific-wide trade, tourism and investment.


Question agreed to.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (19:30):  One of the great privileges of being the member for Sydney is representing the wonderful community of Redfern. Redfern is a suburb that's changed a lot over the years, but it is and has been for a long time the home of a thriving First Nations community. There's not just one mob in Redfern but representatives of many nations from around New South Wales and around Australia. The suburb first attracted Indigenous people from all over New South Wales to work in the factories and the railway workshops that were there in the 19th century. The connections that were formed across First Nations peoples—across tribes, across language groups—became the basis for a strong political movement.


Redfern locals attended a day of mourning and protest in 1938 to mark the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet. In 1944, the Redfern All Blacks were formed by Aboriginal players who could not get a run with the other clubs in the local south Sydney district junior competition. It was in Redfern that the first Aboriginal-controlled community organisations were established—the first medical service, the first legal service and the first housing company. In 1972, four young men left Redfern for Canberra to set up a beach umbrella on the lawns opposite what is now Old Parliament House, founding the Tent Embassy. The Coloured Diggers march that started in Redfern saw, in 2017, First Nations service personnel and veterans leading the Anzac Day march here in Canberra—again, a movement that was started in my suburb of Redfern. The Babana Aboriginal Men's Group uses positive values of traditional Aboriginal culture to help men address a range of issues like men's health, family relationships, antiviolence, anti-drug and alcohol campaigns and post-release programs. The Tribal Warrior Aboriginal Corporation uses Aboriginal culture to provide employment skills and promote economic and social stability within the Redfern community. The relationship between these organisations and the local police area command has been fantastic and incredibly successful under the previous commander, Luke Freudenstein, and no doubt will be under his successor as well.


I'm so very proud to represent this community that has produced generations of activists who have changed the course of this country, and that's why I think it's a very good time to start to have a conversation not just in Redfern but around Australia about whether we should have a cultural centre, a museum, celebrating the contribution of First Nations people—the history, the culture, the art. Of course, this has to be led by local people in the Redfern community, including the traditional custodians of the land, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. But of course it must include a much broader collection of people too.


Washington DC has the National Museum of the American Indian and Canada has its First Peoples Hall. In my view, we should have something similar in this country to tell the story of more than 60,000 years of continuous history and culture: the stories of the Dreaming; a place that would preserve and teach hundreds of First Nations languages; to tell the recent stories of the frontier wars and the massacres, the long and continuing struggle for land rights, the Wave Hill walk off, Mabo and Wik; to tell the story of the world's oldest continuing culture—its art, language, dancing, music and spirituality; to celebrate First Nations leaders across our country in their communities, in politics, in arts, in business and in sport; to celebrate their successes. It could be a place of pilgrimage for all of those who count First Nations people among their ancestors. It'd be a terrific educational resource for schoolchildren and students of any age, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, from all around our country. Such a centre would ensure that the real history of this country is taught—not a black-armband version of history but not a whitewash either; a truthful acknowledgement of the role that those of us with non-Indigenous heritage played in the position of continuing disadvantage that so many First Nations people still suffer now. It'd be an international tourist destination that could provide employment for the local community. Of course the planning and campaign has to be led by the local community, but I'd love to work with them on that.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (10:00):  I'd like to inform the chamber of an issue with the physical condition of many of the public schools in my electorate of Macarthur. Many of the schools in Macarthur were built in the sixties and seventies and have only had infrequent and superficial maintenance since then. Conditions that would be unacceptable in other areas are considered okay for the people of Macarthur. 


The particular issue I wish to raise is the present condition of Passfield Park School, a special school located in Minto, within my electorate of Macarthur. I've had a longstanding relationship with the school over my many years as a paediatrician and now as the federal member. Indeed, many of my patients have attended the school over the years, and I wish to state on the record that the staff and the teachers at the school are some of the most incredible people I've ever had the privilege of working with. They do a very hard job very well and very compassionately. However, over the years I've noticed the truly disturbing condition of the school's buildings, which the staff and students are made to deal with. The school's buildings are in such a poor state that I have in fact been contacted by members of the community, completely external to the school, who have noticed the conditions deteriorate even further over the last few years. 


This is perhaps one of the worst-kept secrets in Macarthur, but I've had enough. The New South Wales Liberal government has failed to address the community's concerns in fixing the school, which is no surprise when one considers the backlog of school maintenance in the area. Instead of receiving the work it requires, the school over the years has merely received touch-up jobs. Some visible mould has been removed from time to time, and minor paint jobs have been undertaken. But, from firsthand experience and exposure to the school, I can tell you that the school needs much more than that to bring it up to an appropriate standard. It needs to be knocked down and rebuilt. It's no longer fit for purpose. Some classrooms are inaccessible to those in wheelchairs—and many of the kids at the school are in wheelchairs—and the mould problem is unrelenting. It is a truly sad state of affairs, and I must confess that I get quite upset when I see and hear of the conditions that these beautiful children and their loving teachers and carers are made to endure.


I've tried to undertake the appropriate action, lobbying the New South Wales government to take care of the situation, but its lack of compassion and empathy has left me with no choice but to call this out in the parliament of Australia. I wish to take this opportunity to formally invite the New South Wales Premier, the New South Wales Minister for Education and the federal minister for education to see firsthand the conditions of the school and see if they can justify the government's continued ignorance and lack of action. Premier, we can even meet there on a weekend. Trust me: I know my way around the school. There will be no PR, no cameras, no spin. Just bring yourself and some builders, please.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:15):  I stand to pay tribute to Tasmania's Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman to serve in a federal Australian cabinet—75 years ago this week. It is worth noting that, at the same election, Western Australia's Dorothy Tangney became the first woman elected to the Senate. My electorate is named jointly after Dame Enid and her husband, Joe Lyons, who to date—and I stress 'to date'—remains the only Tasmanian to hold the office of Prime Minister. 


Dame Enid was, however, a formidable politician long before she was elected in 1943 to the federal seat of Darwin, which is now known as Braddon. That seat is held by my colleague Ms Keay, who will speak after me. For many years Dame Enid accompanied her career politician husband on the campaign trail, not just as a devoted wife but as a key confidant. In the days before politicians were gifted with paid staff and advisers, Enid played the role perfectly.


Dame Enid was born Enid Burnell in 1897 in a remote north-west Tasmanian timber camp. She grew up in Smithton, a nearby town. In her mid-teens she became a trained teacher. In 1912, while visiting the state parliament in Hobart, which back then was some distance away by train, Enid was introduced by her mother to Joseph Aloysius Lyons, who at the time was a state Labor MP for the seat of Wilmot. In 1915, following what has been described as 'decorous correspondence' between Enid and Joe, who was now state Labor Treasurer and education minister, the pair wed. Joe was 35 and Enid 17.


By 1922 Enid was mother to six children, but she took a leading part in election campaigning by talking to women about pots and pans, and children's shoes—what we call these days grassroots politics. While I hesitate these days to mention a working woman's family life, it's important to reference it in this context because the times were so different. There would have been an expectation and understanding in 1920s Australia that a woman's place was in the home and that her primary role was as a caregiver. Still in her mid-20s Enid was mother to six children and yet was also a significant party campaigner and key adviser to her husband. This was trailblazing stuff. Enid would go on to have 12 children by 1933.


In 1923 Joe became the Labor Premier and in 1925 Enid stood as a Labor candidate for the state seat of Denison, a Hobart based seat. She lost by just 60 votes. A whooping cough epidemic during the campaign attacked five of the Lyons' children and their 10-month-old baby died of pneumonia. In 1929 Joe Lyons was elected as the federal Labor MP for Wilmot, now Lyons, and Enid's political focus shifted to the national stage. She is reported to have played a critical role in Joe's decision to break with the Labor Party. We've got a term for that in the Labor Party, but, given the valedictory nature of this speech, I won't reference it. Enid had never been a true believer in Labor but she did retain a lifelong commitment to equality, security and social justice. These are traits we all share.


Ambitious for her husband, she was a political pragmatist by nature and she had been concerned by Labor's response to the financial crisis caused by the Great Depression. She had no problem urging Joe to jump ship. In 1931 Joe left Labor and he helped form a new party—the United Australia Party—which included in its number former Labor and Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who was even then as old as Methuselah, and future Prime Minister Bob Menzies. Joe was the party's first leader. Of course, as we all know, the UAP later rebadged itself as the Liberal Party. I think after its formation it went on to win two or three elections, so it was very successful in its formative years. If Enid hadn't whispered to her husband, the first leader of that party, who knows where Australian politics would be today? She was a very significant figure.


Enid was an enthusiastic campaigner for the UAP, so much so that Menzies is said to have complained that she was stealing the men's limelight. She's reported to have later said, 'Together on a platform, Joe and I worked like partners in a game of bridge.' Everything that Joe and Enid did was done together. Upon winning the December 1931 federal election in a landslide, defeating the Scullin Labor government after just one term, Joe's first act was to write to Enid, 'Whatever honours or distinctions come are ours, not mine.'


I could go on about her life before her parliamentary career and talk about some of the issues that she cared about, but I want to say this. In 1938, and with the drums of war beating in Europe, Enid gave speech after speech on the subject of peace and disarmament. She was a staunch defender of Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Europe's fascists, and she was not alone in that. At the time a lot of people thought the best way to avoid war was to appease the fascists. But after Hitler's treachery with Poland, she said, in her first speech, that she could 'never again advocate such a policy'. She became very much an ardent supporter of Australia being able to support itself militarily.


She suffered deep depression following her beloved husband's death in office. He remains, to date, the only Prime Minister to have died in office. For 24 years they'd been virtually inseparable. But she continued to be politically active. Enid stood for election for the federal seat of Darwin, which covered the Lyons's home in and around Devonport, and was elected in August 1943—the same year she was made a Dame by the King. In her first speech she spoke about the issues she'd always sought to advance: the need for a robust social security system, Australia's declining birth rate, housing, family, the need to extend child endowment and the importance of planning for a postwar future where hundreds of thousands of men would be returning from the front.


In the matter of social security, one thing stands out clearly in my mind:


Such things are necessary in order that the weak shall not go to the wall, that the strong may be supported, that all may have justice.


These were the words of Dame Enid Lyons in her first speech. She also said:


We go along, thinking always that we progress, but sometimes we have to pause and take stock. I think that every Australian should pause now and again and say to himself, ""Only 150 years ago this land was wilderness. Now we have great cities, wonderful feats of engineering and beautiful buildings everywhere. And this is still a land of promise"".


In 1949, Dame Enid was elevated to sit in Bob Menzies's cabinet, though without portfolio, which she was very unhappy about. She retired from parliament in 1951, but certainly not from public life. She was an active newspaper columnist. She chaired the Jubilee Women's Convention in 1951 and was a member of the ABC from 1951 to 1962. She was a longstanding member of the Victoria League, the Housewives Association and the CWA. And it must be said: she was a beloved lifelong member of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, where she continues to be revered.


She also wrote articles and autobiographical volumes, and I think one title referenced Billy Hughes once saying of her that she was like a 'nightingale amongst the carrion crows'.



Honourable members interjecting—  




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  I'm the biggest crow they've ever seen! I think one of her volumes referenced that quote.


So while Dame Enid did leave the Labor Party, many of her principles and ideals continue to hold true to Labor ideals. And irrespective of her politics, she is a highly significant figure not just in politics in general but also for the advancement of women in politics. I think it's wonderful that, no matter which side of the aisle we're on, we stand here, we stake stock and we honour those women who did blaze a trail, whether it was Enid Lyons or Dorothy Tangney in the Senate. They all deserve recognition. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for them just putting up with the nonsense that men must have given them, and to get through it all. So, my hat goes off to Dame Enid Lyons; she has my great respect. Vale Enid Lyons.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (11:25):  I, again, share your congratulations and acknowledgement of the member for Lyons's contribution. That was a lovely reflection on Dame Enid Lyons and her husband, Joseph Lyons, who were fine Tasmanians.


As we know, we're here to commemorate Enid Lyons's election to the House of Representatives. Yesterday, 21 August, marked the 75th anniversary of her election to the House of Representatives in 1943. She was the first woman elected to the federal parliament in the House of Representatives, and she went on to become Australia's first female cabinet minister.


Enid Lyons was a remarkable woman, and her career, her family life and her relationship with her husband, Joe Lyons, really reminds me of another remarkable woman, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I think there are a lot of commonalities between them, with their strong family life and their dedication to serving the public throughout their lives.


As has been noted, Dame Enid was born in 1897. Remarkably, she first stood for the Tasmanian parliament in 1925 when she had six children, and she only lost the seat by six votes. She was married to Joseph Lyons, who became the Tasmanian Premier and, of course, became the Prime Minister of Australia between the years of 1932 and 1939. Between them, they had 12 children, one of whom tragically died at the age of 10 months from pneumonia. By all accounts, Enid Lyons and Joseph Lyons were a very close couple. They had a loving relationship, and they supported one another in their public lives and public roles.


I do want to quickly read from the Australian Dictionary of Biography, which notes, amongst other things, what was happening at the end of Joseph Lyons's life. He died at the age of 59 years, so he died at a very young age. Things had been very stressful for them around politics and his prime ministership. As the Australian Dictionary of Biography records:


His final months were miserable as his government became increasingly unstable. Apart from Menzies, there were other threats, particularly from Charles Hawker. According to Enid Lyons, Hawker was on his way to Canberra to challenge Lyons when he was killed in a plane crash in October 1938. … Although Menzies never issued a direct challenge, he made pointed public comments about lack of national leadership; through 1938-39 his claims were advanced in the newspapers of Sir Keith Murdoch, previously an enthusiastic supporter of Lyons. …


The dictionary goes on to say that Sir Joseph Lyons:


… was able to thwart the implicit Menzies challenge in the final months of 1938. On 14 March 1939 Menzies resigned from cabinet because of the deferment of the national insurance scheme.


Not long after, Sir Joseph Lyons died in Sydney in hospital on 7 April 1939.


This was an incredibly, understandably, stressful time for Dame Enid. She was 41 years old, she had 11 children, and her husband had just died at a very young age. As the Australian Dictionary of Biography also records:


When Joe Lyons died on 7 April 1939, Enid, exhausted and grief-stricken, plunged into a depression that only fully lifted when a daughter, noting that their Federal local member was retiring, persuaded her to stand for the House of Representatives.


As we know, as I remarked, yesterday, 21 August, was the 75th anniversary of her election.


I have read Dame Enid Lyons's speech a number of times since I became a candidate, in my previous life doing research and, certainly, since I've been elected. Her speech is really remarkable and I want to reflect on that today. I think, for all of us who get elected to this place, your maiden speech is one of the most stressful. It's a stressful moment, but it's also very emotional and very personal. I had the great honour of doing the very first maiden speech for this parliament, the address-in-reply speech. There have been nine women in this place who have given the very first speech to new parliaments—I think five Labor and four Liberal women. I want to thank the Parliamentary Library for gathering those statistics. 


You certainly do feel the pressure when not only is it your maiden speech but you are the very first speech of all of the maiden speeches, so I can only imagine how Enid Lyons felt giving her first speech to the parliament. It really was a remarkable speech not just because she was the first woman—and, as I'll read in a moment, she took that responsibility very seriously—but given the political circumstances and the fact that Robert Menzies was still in the parliament and that her husband had recently passed away. So there she was amongst her husband's colleagues and with people who had caused him great stress at the end of his life, and caused her, of course, great stress as well. She delivered the speech with wonderful humour and made a very serious policy contribution, but she really held her emotions in check, which I think is just a remarkable testament to the sort of woman that she was. It's a remarkable achievement and also a testament to the woman that she was.


 As Dame Enid Lyons said in her first speech:


It would be strange indeed were I not tonight deeply conscious of the fact, if not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility; because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed this house. For that reason it is an occasion which, for every woman in the Commonwealth, marks in some degree a turning point in history. I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.


As we know, not that many women have followed Dame Enid—not as many as we would like—into public service in the House of Representatives. I believe it's something like 115 women who have been elected since Federation, and certainly since 1943 when Dame Enid was elected. I want to recognise her today for the fact that she was an absolute trailblazer. She is one of my heroes and one of the reasons why I've worked very hard as a female member of the Liberal Party to do my bit to encourage other women to consider putting their hand up to become candidates for the party. 


I'm grateful to my good friend and colleague Nick Cater for working with me and engaging me through the Menzies Research Centre on a 2015 report Gender and politics, which examines women in the Liberal Party and what we can do to encourage more women to get involved. Nick is a true champion of women in the Liberal Party. We revised the report in 2017, and I commend it to everyone, particularly people in the Liberal Party. Have a look at the suggestions we have as to how we can encourage more women to put their hand up for preselection and then support them to become elected, whether it is for the state or federal parliament. The most crucial message, though, I think, from the report is that the Liberal Party must always remain true to its principles when addressing the issue of female representation in the party. Robert Menzies really did put this very well back in 1943 and I want to read this quote because it's really important and it explains why the Liberal Party, certainly on my watch, will do everything to prevent quotas being introduced, because quotas are absolutely inconsistent with our principles. We need to find the best people for the job, which means that we can never support quotas. As Menzies said: 


Of course women are at least the equals of men. Of course there is no reason why a qualified woman should not sit in parliament or on the bench or in a professorial chair or preach from the pulpit or, if you like, command an army in the field. No educated man today denies a place or career to a woman just because she is a woman.


But there is a converse position which I state with all respect but with proper firmness. No woman can demand a place or a career just because she is a woman. It is outmoded and absurd to treat a woman's sex as a disqualification; it seems to me equally absurd to claim it as a qualification in itself.


This is the beauty of the Liberal Party. This is why I am a Liberal: it is about giving people equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.

Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (11:35):  'The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people.' That was something that Dame Enid Lyons said. I think that's very apt, a great way to sum up her life and her view not only of her as a female politician but as a participant in Australian society. In my first speech I actually quoted Dame Enid Lyons's first speech. I was proudly the first woman elected to the division of Braddon. It took 61 years for that to occur. The division of Braddon was formerly the division of Darwin. But I'm not the first female to represent the people of the North West coast of Tasmania. Sixty-five years on, I proudly follow in the footsteps of one other women, a member for the former division of Darwin, the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman in federal cabinet, Dame Enid Lyons.


In her first speech, Enid said:


I hope that I shall never forget that everything that takes place in this chamber goes out somewhere to strike a human heart, to influence the life of some fellow being …


It was very, very powerful. Indeed, as the member for Boothby said, our first speeches are not only a very important part of our career in politics and the way we communicate with people in our electorate; they have a long history as well, and Enid's first speech was absolutely remarkable. Dame Enid has left a rich legacy in my electorate and in my home town of Devonport.


As wife of Tasmania's only Prime Minister, Joe Lyons, Devonport is very privileged to have a Prime Minister's residence, Home Hill, just up the road from where I grew up, with Dame Enid's personal touches gracing every inch of this wonderful home. It was built for the family in 1916 in Middle Road, Devonport for a cost of £390 by Wilson Brothers. It is a very elegant homestead and remains largely as it was when Dame Enid last lived there in 1981. It is absolutely complete with original furnishings and memorabilia. You just have to walk through Home Hill to get a fantastic, wonderful sense of who Dame Enid actually was. She painted the walls. It was quite remarkable. She was a woman who did everything and anything. I don't think she ever sat down for a quiet moment. As you walk through, you can see wonderful drawings on the walls as they were in their original state. She made all the furnishings, all the upholstery and the curtains herself. Think about how busy her life was going around campaigning with Sir Joe, raising 11 children—one sadly dying in infancy—and her own political career yet she put her heart and soul in it to have such a homely house to raise her family in not only inside the property but the outside as well, which has the most remarkable garden that is still pretty much the way she left it. It's truly an amazing place.


I was very privileged to go on a tour with the National Trust, which has looked after the building very well in the time that it's been in their possession. I really hope that people when they do visit Tasmania go to my home town of Devonport, which is the sea gateway of the state, and visit Home Hill. It's a fantastic piece of not only Tasmanian history but Australian history as well. She has some fantastic mementos in that home. 


A lot of volunteers volunteer at Home Hill. I commend their work and their passion for the Lyons family and for Tasmanian history. Enid had some little boxes of mementos that were very close to her heart—handkerchiefs of Sir Joe, some baby clothes of the infant that she lost—just truly touching bits of memorabilia from a remarkable woman. In a poignant letter penned in early 1939, Joseph noted that he was:


… always longing for the time when, if God spares us, we can be together in our beautiful home, forgetting all the problems of politics. 


I think we can all relate to that a little bit but, sadly, Sir Joe died not long after penning that letter. 


From her election in 1943, Dame Enid, at that stage a widowed mother of 12 children—one of whom had died in infancy—successfully led the way for women in federal politics. As she said in her first speech:


I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.


As a politician, Enid Lyons made a modest contribution to politics, with a particular emphasis on the role of women and progressive measures that paved the way toward gender equality, despite her very conservative moral views on issues such as abortion and homosexuality and her disapproval of early sex education. She led the way to increased welfare payments to women and children, such as the extension of child endowment. She also campaigned for an end to discrimination against women in the workforce and increases to the allowances paid to returned servicewomen and pensions for widows. Tasmanian Liberal politician Michael Hodgman—who we Tasmanians knew really well—knew Enid Lyons well and recalled:


She wasn't a stuffy person. She had strong ideas on social justice. And she wasn't your conservative at all. She was a reforming Liberal from good solid Labor stock.


A good combination, actually! That's fabulous, coming from Michael Hodgman, whose son is now the Liberal Premier of Tasmania.


We have come a long way since Dame Enid in terms of gender equality, but I have to recall a photo in Home Hill, on one of the walls there, of the 1949 cabinet. It's a very stark reminder of how far we have come. It's an amazing photo, obviously in black and white. It's a sea of suits. The cabinet is standing outside Parliament House, but there's Dame Enid in her light-coloured dress and very wide-brim hat, standing out like a sore thumb. It's absolutely remarkable. What I encountered when I first came to this place was sitting on the opposition benches, surrounded by many fantastic Labor women, but, sadly, looking at the government benches and not seeing much of a difference since 1949. I'm pleased to hear the member for Boothby saying that they're looking at addressing—in a different way to ours—women's representation in parliament. But that photo reminded me that one side of politics has probably progressed a little bit more than others in terms of female representation.


I will finish off on this note. Television reporter George Negus signed off a 2003 documentary piece on Enid with:


It's fair to say they just don't make them like that any more. Dame Enid Lyons—despite poor health, the first Australian woman to burst through the political glass ceiling into the boys' club.

Mrs MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (11:43):  On 21 August 1943, Dame Enid Lyons was elected to the House of Representatives. While in this day and age having women in parliament is nothing unusual, when she and Dorothy Tangney entered the white building down the hill, it caused quite a stir. Female toilets had to be designated. The procedure of the opening of the parliament had to be slightly amended—no more 'gentlemen members and gentlemen senators' in the Governor-General's opening.


Dame Enid first came to the public's attention as the wife of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, and everyone knew that they were a true team. She took to the role of prime ministerial spouse at the time with great enthusiasm, using it as a platform to give speeches, write newspaper articles and generally promote traditional values. When her husband died in 1939, she withdrew from public life for a time. By the time of the 1943 election, she was convinced to run for the UAP for the Tasmanian seat of Darwin. She won and entered the House of Representatives, changing the House forever.


Dame Enid was the first woman to serve in the House and, subsequently, the first woman to serve in cabinet. She was an absolute trailblazer for all of the women who have followed her, including me. Her maiden speech to the House covered many topics, from the political situation in Europe to the employment situation here in Australia. But a common theme running through the entire speech was the central position of the family as the foundation stone of society. That is something that permeates in our party to this day. She quoted the late King George in her speech saying, 'The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people.' For her, family was everything and provided much stability in her life. She and Joseph had 12 children. They were a great comfort throughout their lives. 


She believed in hard work and the rewards that came from that. She believed that women should earn equal pay with men if they went out and worked. That was quite a radical idea at the time, considering that hers was an era and a time when women stayed at home. Dame Enid was instrumental in bringing in welfare payments for mothers as well as equal training for both men and women. She was a visionary. Dame Enid Lyons was one of the most highly decorated women of her generation. She was awarded the Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. 


She was a household name across the country. She even wrote a column in The Women's Weekly and remained a commissioner of the ABC until 1962. As the first female chief whip of the Liberal Party in a sitting government, I'm one of those women who is very proud to follow in her trailblazing footsteps. We do need to keep celebrating the firsts in our party and in this parliament. Certainly Dame Enid has been honoured in many ways, from the naming of Dame Enid Lyons Place here in Canberra, to her being made a Dame of the Order of Australia in 1980. In the event that was held last night to recognise Dame Enid Lyons we saw so many of her family present. There was a re-enactment of her first speech, which was delivered so well and gave us a great sense not only of how Dame Enid would have spoken but of her feelings at the time. 


I feel a great sense of pride in being in the same party as Dame Enid. Hers is a legacy that blazed a trail for women across all political persuasions, but I'm very proud that the first woman in the House of Representatives was Dame Enid Lyons. It is an absolute legacy that the women in the Liberal Party are proud to look up to and that we should never forget or stop celebrating. She placed her family and her country at the centre of her life, and that shone through in her contributions not only in the parliament but in the community during her three terms in this House. Three terms is a fantastic achievement. 


It's absolutely a privilege to rise and speak on the legacy of this great Liberal woman. She paved the way for all women, including the women sitting in this chamber right now, who have followed her into this House. Her legacy is just as relevant today as it was in 1943.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",CA,2018-08-22,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (11:48):  I echo many of the comments of the member for Forrest. Dame Enid Lyons was the first. I cannot imagine how challenging it must have been for Dame Enid. Let's think about that time. Australia was at war. Darwin had been bombed. Our troops were fighting with the Allied forces on many, many fronts. On the home front, women were dealing with the consequences of war. They were managing children and family responsibilities alone. There were shortages of resources as well as fears for the future and the grief and trauma of losing young ones. Many women were also actively involved as nurses and many other active duties and contributed more actively to the war efforts through military service. At this time, quite extraordinarily, we had a woman in parliament—a widow, a mother of 12, a wife to a former member of parliament. I believe Dame Enid Lyons illuminated the way for all of the women who have followed her into the federal parliament, and now there is a long line of distinguished female parliamentarians. I'm so humbled and thankful to be a woman in this parliament and the first woman from my part of South Australia.


I will speak only briefly on this motion, but I would like to enter into my speech a small excerpt from Dame Enid Lyons's first speech, which was delivered on 29 September 1943. She commenced her speech:


It would be strange indeed were I not to-night deeply conscious of the fact, if not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility; because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed this House. For that reason, it is an occasion which, for every woman in the Commonwealth, marks in some degree a turning point in history. I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.


I believe that Dame Enid Lyons did a great service to women in this parliament and to our great nation, so I think it timely that we remember her speech from September 1943, and I thank her for her contributions to this great place.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-08-22,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (11:51):  Can I first reflect positively upon the contributions of the members for Mayo, Lyons, Braddon, Boothby and Forrest, who all spoke of the significance of Dame Enid Lyons. The member for Boothby told me that she hadn't really had a chance to properly consider her speech, but it was probably one of the best researched speeches that I have heard given on a motion of this nature, in particular her reflection upon the emotional context in which Dame Enid Lyons would have given her first speech, which Dame Enid did in the chamber after her husband had recently passed away and in front of so many of those who, she probably felt, had caused his early death through the stress that they had caused him.


Dame Enid Lyons was a pioneer for women in politics in Australia. It is 75 years since Dame Enid was elected the first woman in parliament. She paved the way for so many women to follow her journey to public life. In today's parliament there are 76 women. Enid narrowly won the seat of Darwin in Tasmania for the United Australia Party at the 1943 election. At the same election, Dorothy Tangney was elected as a Labor Party senator representing Western Australia. She was the first female senator to be elected.


Dame Enid's election in 1943 was not her first stint at politics. She narrowly lost the 1925 election for the seat of Denison by only 60 votes. Enid also supported her husband, former Prime Minister Joe Lyons. Enid and Joe were Australia's first political couple, and their children were the first children to live in the Lodge. In fact, the Lyons children were famous across the nation, with Joe and Enid inviting the press into the privacy of their home to take pictures of what was then a very new thing in newspapers. Of course, we need to also consider that travel in Australia in the 1920s was not as easy as it is today. So for Joe and Enid there was only one practical solution, and that was to move their family to Canberra.


Enid and Joe campaigned together. Enid made speeches and radio broadcasts for her husband and also alongside her husband. They thought of themselves as a team, and a true team they were, sharing and advancing so many of the political ideals and ideas that formed much of early Australia. But when Joe Lyons died in office in April 1939, Enid's greatest contribution to public life was still to come. Enid was left a widow, a widow with 11 children. Her husband's death was tragic and a tremendous loss not only for her but for this nation, whose democracy, at that point, was less than three decades old. She made the decision to enter parliament in her own right. It was a decision that, at the time, could not have been taken lightly. Her maiden speech, which many of the speakers today have referenced, was one that, no doubt, would have had more poignancy than most other maiden speeches, given the circumstances in which it occurred.


The anniversary of her first speech occurs next month. She must have thought very long and hard about what she would say in the chamber, given the death of her husband, and given that many of the people who had known him so well and caused him so much angst would be listening. She was re-elected twice, and after those elections Enid became the first woman to be in cabinet when she became the Vice-President of the Executive Council in 1949. She was widely credited with the Menzies government's decision to extend child endowment beyond the first-born child. This was a significant advancement for Australian families. It was a significant advancement for the federal government at a time when most people looked to their state governments, not to the Commonwealth, for such measures. To take this measure, as the Menzies government did—at a time when many people presumed the role of the Commonwealth government was a very limited one—was significant, but it was also a reflection of Enid and her husband's view that the family was the core of our society and anything the government could do to help advance that institution it should do. She advocated fervently, sensibly and, most importantly, persuasively for the raising of allowances paid to returned service women.


She was outspoken against the debarring of married women from employment in the Public Service. I was amazed to read only the other day that it was the Fraser government that actually got rid of the provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act that said that when a woman became pregnant she had six months before she had to resign her position in the Commonwealth Public Service. Such provisions, it is amazing to think, Deputy Speaker Gee, were still in force in our lifetime. When you think about those things it is important to remember the massive advancements that we have made in the provision of equality of rights for all people in Australia, including, in this instance, pregnant women who are employed by the Commonwealth Public Service. Dame Enid Lyons was talking about this in the 1920s and 1930s, and the fact that it was not acted upon for 40 years is, I think, a testament against apathy and inaction—things are not inevitable. There is a current generation of people who believe quite fervently that things just get better. But this particular instance shows that it took nearly 40 years for something that was one of the core issues of one of the most important parliamentarians in the history of our nation to actually get advanced and to take effect.


In this very emotional speech, Enid's first speech, she canvassed policy ideas on an absolute multitude of issues. These issues were very relevant at the day but, when we go back and look, there was extraordinary foresight in those speeches as well. It is incredible that, even back in the 1930s, Dame Enid was talking about decentralisation. That's something that, frankly speaking, we have continued to try, but it has not successfully happened. I had someone the other day talking to me about traffic congestion on the northern beaches in my electorate of Mackellar. They said: 'Didn't the Fraser government try decentralisation? Whatever happened to that?' In actual fact, I was amazed to find in Dame Enid Lyon's first speech that she'd been talking about it in the 1930s. She also said—talking about her political philosophy:


… the problems of government were not problems of … statistics, but problems of human values and human hearts and human feelings …


She also said:


I hope that I shall never forget that everything that takes place in this chamber goes out somewhere to strike a human heart, to influence the life of some fellow being.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister's time has expired. No other minister having risen, the minister may continue.




Mr FALINSKI:
  Dame Enid put it so beautifully—so beautifully, I felt. She went on:


… and I believe this, too, with all my heart: that the duty of every government, whether in this country or any other, is to see that no man—


by which I presume she meant 'no person'—


because of the condition of his—


or her—


life, shall ever need lose his vision of the city of God.


Earle Page, the great National Party leader, nicknamed Enid 'the woman who wouldn't be sat down'. I think that that goes to the proud idea that she stood up for what she believed, and she stood up for what she believed at a time and at a place when often groupthink is too easy to accept, to know. Others referred to her as the 'lady member'. She was both literally and figuratively a lady, and the sole female member of the House of Representatives.


Dame Enid suffered from various illnesses and ailments during her life and, ultimately, it was her ill health that forced her early retirement at just 53. Of course in the 1920s and 1930s life expectancy was much lower and 53 was considered to be quite a senior age. Now I hear that 70 is the new 50—as I approach my 50th birthday, I hope that's true. We owe her and Dorothy Tangney, through their election to the parliament, a very significant debt. It was a very significant moment in our history. We honour their memory. I would like to thank all the members who felt it proper to give speeches on Dame Enid today, especially the members for Lyons and Braddon, and in particular the member for Boothby, who gave an incredibly eloquent and well-researched speech.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:05):  Seventy-five years have passed since Dame Enid Lyons gave her maiden speech in the federal parliament in 1943. She was the first woman ever to be elected to the Australian House of Representatives, and also the first woman to serve in federal cabinet. But these historical snapshots are among many of her achievements. Enid Muriel Lyons was the mother of 12 children, which even today might make thoughts of an additional occupation well-nigh impossible. She has been described as living life at a killing pace. Not only managing all of her family responsibilities, she was also actively involved in her husband's political career. 


Long before Enid's election to the House of Representatives she was an articulate and persuasive speaker. Her mother ensured that she took elocution lessons and encouraged her to speak or perform whenever she had an audience. She also took her to the Tasmanian state parliament, where the fresh-faced 15-year-old first met Joseph Aloysius Lyons, Labor member for the state seat of Wilmot. They would eventually marry on 28 April 1915 at Wynyard. Joe was 35 and Enid just 17. After Lyons moved to the federal House of Representatives in 1929 Enid remained closely involved in his career. In 1932 several nationalists revolted and brought down the government. With Enid's encouragement Joseph Lyons was elected leader of a minority Labor government, before the United Australia Party split, becoming Prime Minister until his passing in 1939. His first act as PM was to write to Enid, noting, 'whatever honours or distinctions come are ours, not mine.' 


After Joseph passed away, Enid fell into a deep depression, which, by her own admission, was likely caused by inactivity. She then decided to pursue her own political career. In her maiden speech she spoke on social security, a declining birth rate, the need for an extension of child endowment, housing, the family and the importance of looking ahead to postwar policies. She really did have a strong belief in the right of women to take their place in government. I quote from her maiden speech to federal parliament in 1943: 


I believe, very sincerely, that any woman entering the public arena must be prepared to work as men work; she must justify herself not as a woman, but as a citizen; she must attack the same problems, and be prepared to shoulder the same burdens. But because I am a woman, and cannot divest myself of those qualities that are inherent in my sex, and because every one of us speaks broadly in the terms of one's own experience, honorable members will have to become accustomed to the application of the homely metaphors of the kitchen rather than those of the operating theatre, the workshop, or the farm. They must also become accustomed to the application to all kinds of measures of the touchstone of their effect upon the home and the family life …


I am delighted that the honorable member for Denison Dr. Gaha should have secured the honour of having introduced to this chamber, in this debate, the subject of population … I, like him, have pondered on this subject—not with my feet upon the mantle-piece, but knee-deep in shawls and feeding bottles … I consider that something more than decentralization is necessary if the population of Australia is to be increased.


The response from politicians, the press and the public was overwhelming. She would note afterwards: 'In that place of endless speaking, no-one had ever made men weep, and I wasn't even trying to do so.' As a politician, Enid was a strong advocate for women, yet not necessarily a feminist, debating robustly on issues including population, immigration, international affairs, agricultural development, finance and energy.


Enid Lyons did not lead an easy life, suffering a host of medical conditions and recurring ill health. Her health was much improved after she retired from politics in 1951 to become a newspaper columnist and to serve as a commissioner of the ABC from 1951 to 1962. Remaining active, Enid published three sets of memoirs and was vocal always in family's and women's issues. She was made a Dame of the Order of Australia on Australia Day in 1980. She passed away the following year, late in 1981.


I encourage the women in our federal and state parliaments, who come to these places with a path much easier than Dame Enid had, to consider the example of Dame Enid and reflect on all the things she achieved. She's known today, but not well known, and I think she should be a lot better known. I really thank my colleague, the Minister for Revenue, Kelly O'Dwyer, for moving this motion and for highlighting the extraordinary life of Dame Enid. I will just quote from the Minister for Revenue's final remarks about Dame Enid:


Tonight we celebrate Enid's achievements and forge our future. Like Enid, we have a duty to our country to carry the lamp that she lit on that spring evening in 1943 and to ensure that many more women will follow in our footsteps to serve and contribute to our nation. Although she was famously described as a 'bird of paradise among carrion crows', I prefer to think of Dame Enid in far more sturdy terms as someone who was smart, energetic and determined, as someone passionate about politics, her husband, about her 12 children, and about our nation. She was seen and heard and she was magnificent.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack—Assistant Minister for the Environment) (12:11):  I'm very proud to add my name to the list of speakers on this motion commemorating Enid Lyons's election to parliament, one of the pivotal figures in Australian history. I would also like to acknowledge my female parliamentary colleagues on all sides of politics. They truly do a wonderful job not only of representing their constituents but also exemplifying the opportunities that exist for women right around Australia. As we say, you can't be what you can't see.


I had the honour of attending an re-enactment of Dame Enid Lyons's maiden speech in Old Parliament House last night. It truly was a wonderful event. It was impossible not to be moved by the poignancy of the moment. The first woman to be elected to parliament and also the first woman to be elected to cabinet delivering a speech that would be etched into Australian history. And, of course, the words reflected a different era. Much has changed over the last 75 years but also a lot has not changed. In her introduction, Dame Enid captured the feeling of trepidation that accompanied a turning point in history, as she said:


I know that many honourable members have viewed the advent of women to the legislative halls with something approaching alarm; they have feared, I have no doubt, the somewhat too vigorous use of a new broom.


I can't recall her exact words but she did go on to talk about that she did know a bit about brooms given she had had 12 children and had to do her fair share of cleaning up. But she was a new broom in terms of the way that business was done 75 years ago in federal parliament.


In present day Australia, women in the parliament have become more commonplace. I and millions of other people believe Australia is a better country for that. The parliament and indeed the country is a much more inclusive environment in the modern world. Yet the work is far from over. Seventy-five years after Dame Enid entered parliament, women still make up less than half of this parliament. Women are still less likely to be promoted and are underrepresented in senior positions. And there is a persistent view that, when women do make it to senior positions in any workplace, not just federal parliament, there are finite positions available. There is also a view, and my own experience has borne this out, that a woman needs to be better than her male counterparts to get ahead. The idea that only a certain number of women can fit into the structure of a management or executive team or a board remains one of our greatest challenges, and it holds the nation back. 


I personally don't support quotas, preferring that people are selected on merit, but that has its challenges. I do support targets, but they need to be taken seriously by the party, and we're not there yet—we are far from it. The Liberal Party has a target of preselecting women to 50 per cent of winnable seats by 2025. I think there are a few practical things that the party ought to do to be able to achieve that target. Firstly—and I think this is key—we need to work a lot harder to support the female members of parliament that we have and then to encourage aspiring MPs. We do need a formal sponsorship program that gets more women into the pipeline and exposed to preselectors, which is the key. The WA Liberal Party I believe are starting to take action on this front. I congratulate them for that. I'm doing my bit to support them.


We know that diversity is an asset. An equal, balanced workplace leads to better outcomes, higher productivity and greater efficiency. A McKinsey Global Institute report in June 2017, which investigated advancing women's equality in Canada, found that increasing diversity correlated with better business practice. That report suggested a more diverse workforce had the potential to add $150 billion to the country's incremental GDP by 2026. Similar studies have suggested that, globally, GDP could increase by $12 trillion by advancing gender equality. 


We've some way to go, I'm sure you would agree. The reasons for pursuing such a goal are valid on a number of fronts. The economic arguments alone are worth pursuing. Why shouldn't we create a culture that encourages a diverse workforce and signals to young women all around the world that they can aspire to the highest level of their profession? This is a universal issue that requires a united approach from both men and women. It's not just a women's issue; it is a men's issue as well. Women of this parliament and female leaders across the nation share this responsibility. Dame Enid recognised it from the moment she made history with her inaugural speech, when she said:


I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.


It's a potent message that still resonates today. Strong female leaders are role models for their younger peers in this nation, and we must never lose sight of this. It is a huge responsibility for female politicians.


We've come a long way since Dame Enid gave her inaugural speech to the Australian parliament on 29 September 1943. Much of the progress we've made can be attributed to the foundations laid by Dame Enid and the Australian women who dismantled the stigma that women are unfit to be leaders of our great country. Our duty now is to continue this work so that future generations may reap the benefits that a diverse and accepting nation has to offer. Once again I would like to pay my respects to Dame Enid Lyons, a champion of women and a champion of Australia.


Debate adjourned.

Mrs Elliot
  asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 18 June 2018:


(1) What educational qualification or prior service experience in working with people with disabilities is required of NDIS planners and approvers.(2) Who (a) provides governance, oversight and accountability of NDIS providers, (b) determines the effectiveness of NDIS providers in delivering what they have been contracted for, and (c) can NDIS clients and their families discuss any concerns with about their providers.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2018-08-22,"




Mr Tehan:

The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


1) Position descriptions contain a generic skillset the NDIA seeks when recruiting, and it is expected that successful applicants meet the required skillset. Most of the planners have worked in the disability sector in jurisdictions.




2)



   a) During the transition to full Scheme, providers are required to meet state and territory quality and safeguarding legislative requirements to become registered providers of NDIS supports. This includes meeting specific jurisdictional quality and safeguard, professional and expertise requirements.


From 1 July 2018, responsibility for registration of providers in New South Wales and South Australia will transition to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.


   b) Service agreements between providers and participants outline the expected outcomes, and the nature, quality and price of supports to be provided. Participants, and their nominees and family, can provide feedback to providers, and exercise their choice and control where services do not meet their expectations. 


NDIS-registered providers are required to act in the best interests of participants, abide by the NDIS Terms of Business and NDIS Price Guide and may have their payment requests tested as part of the NDIA's Provider Payment Assurance Program. 


   c) From 1 July 2018, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission began operating in New South Wales and South Australia. NDIS participants and their families in New South Wales or South Australia, can discuss any concerns regarding NDIS services with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission by:


Phoning: 1800 035 544 (free call from landlines) or TTY 133 677. Interpreters can be arranged.


BULLET National Relay Service and ask for 1800 035 544.


Completing a complaint contact form, available at: www.ndiscommission.gov.au 


For NDIS participants and their families not in New South Wales and South Australia, state or territory requirements for quality and safeguards continue to be in place. Concerns regarding providers can be raised with the relevant State or Territory body and may also be referred to the appropriate complaints body for investigation, including the relevant Ombudsman. The existing arrangements for making complaints remain in place, until the NDIS Commission begins operating from:


1 July 2019 for the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria


1 July 2020 for Western Australia.


Registered providers must notify the NDIA if they are in breach of any Commonwealth, State or Territory law, including any Commonwealth, State or Territory disability service standards. Registered providers must also notify the NDIA if they become subject to any investigation for breach of a Commonwealth, State or Territory law and/or quality and safeguard arrangements.
