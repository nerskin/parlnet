"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-04-28,"—Madam President, at the request of Senator Ellison, I withdraw government business notice of motion No. 1.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,0,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Minister, are you aware whether the Treasury used the HES data for any other applications?
—Any other applications to what?
—Macro-economic modelling, micro-economic modelling—any sort of modelling whatsoever. Does Treasury use the HES data to produce anything?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, I don't want to canvass what was extensively covered, I believe, by the select committee. I understand that question was asked in the select committee and I understand Treasury gave a full answer to it. If you like, I will get a copy of what the Treasury said.
—I've got the Hansard  here.
—Okay. Apparently the answer was given then.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Perhaps to assist you, Minister: Treasury accepted that they use the HES data for 
 retirement income modelling, or RIM as it is colloquially known.
—Why did you ask me the question, then?
—Perhaps to see if you had any idea about what you had been talking about for the last four hours, but obviously not.
—Maybe this could be formalised in some way.
—The reason I asked this question, Senator Kemp, was to ascertain whether you were aware of the discussion and disagreement within Treasury about the position adopted by it. I take you to page 383 of the Senate Hansard  for the select committee on Thursday the 28th and a Mr Gallagher, who is in charge of the retirement income modelling section of Treasury. He refers to the now infamous Dr Carnahan's paper. This is Mr Gallagher's comment on Dr Carnahan's paper:
The main problem with this paper is that Dr Carnahan wants to throw the baby out with the bathwater . . . The HES expenditure data does allow us to estimate price effects which are statistically reliable and which show clearly that the retired and pensioners have compensation needs beyond the average of all households.
This, as I was saying and as we were discussing yesterday, is the nub of the argument inside Treasury—whether it is justified to just toss out traditional uses for HES because it is inconvenient to the government. Are you aware of this debate inside Treasury? You are the Assistant Treasurer, so I am hoping that you are familiar with this debate and that you have a contribution to make. In particular, is Treasury's decision to throw out the use of HES for calculating the compensation package, and just using an average, appropriate? Do you consider, given the comments of Mr Gallagher about the HES data and about Dr Carnahan's paper, that it is appropriate to make that decision?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—(9.36 a.m.)—Senator, as with all vibrant bodies like the Treasury, there will be some debate on issues, as we would expect. There is nothing surprising about that. You 
 are obviously well aware of the debate. Part of the problem is that we have already had this debate before a Senate committee. The select committee was established to look at this issue. We have now had this debate before a Senate select committee. Senator Conroy is asking me to go back over the debate that we have already had. I think that is a pity. It is another example of time being consumed when the Senate is probably ready to move on to debate the substance of the bills.
—This is the substance of the bill. This is the core of your bill.
—That is why we have committees—so that we can look closely. A select committee has examined this. I understand that there was an extensive debate by the select committee. After this debate the Treasury came to the view that the HES data is not reliable for this purpose. Dr Carnahan, who I think is a good friend of yours and someone whose views you admire, also came to that view. So, Senator, yes, there was a debate. That debate was extensively covered before the select committee, of which you were a part. Treasury came to a view, and that view was put to the Senate select committee.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Thank you for that, Minister. I accept that there was a debate inside Treasury, as you now acknowledge, about the appropriateness of this assumption, because this is the key assumption, Minister. There is no clause in the bills about this, so this is the appropriate place to debate, discuss and seek information from you about the government's thinking. What I have drawn to your attention is the debate inside Treasury, because yesterday, in one of your responses to some of my questions, you pointed out that Treasury—
—Senator Conroy, could I ask you to address your comments through the chair. This is not a conversation across the chamber.
—Certainly. Thank you for drawing my attention to that, Madam Temporary Chairman. The minister, in his comments yesterday about the Treasury 
 position, stated that Treasury had, in the past, gone down the path of amending and using the HES data. The minister said that Treasury seem to have always objected; that they have always had a longstanding objection to this, which they raised. But Senator Kemp went on to say that Treasury were directed to do that modelling. And yes, that is correct.
So the question that I want Senator Kemp to answer is: why did the government not direct Treasury to do it again? This is the key to the compensation argument. Why did the government not direct Treasury to do what they had done previously? Why did the government just accept the position put by Treasury that an average is okay when you are doing the compensation package? That is the question that I direct to Senator Kemp: why did the government accept Treasury's argument this time? What was different this time that was not known in 1985, 1991 and 1993, so that the government did not say to Treasury, `Go and do this; the government does not accept this average CPI figure'? That is the issue that I would like Senator Kemp to address.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—I will put a couple of facts on the table. Treasury, I am advised, was directed to prepare HES based estimates. Treasury, as has been well known, does not support this approach. However, the results were released, of which you are probably aware, and the analysis indicated that the range of price effects was very small—perhaps half a per cent higher for pensioners. The government has provided a 1½ per cent buffer, which ensures that no-one will be worse off. However, I restate that Treasury and the government do not endorse the use of HES data. This is not only the position of government and Treasury, but also of people like Professor Warren and Dr Carnahan. We have had this debate before the Senate select committee. Apparently, we are about to revisit the debate now.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—The facts are on the table—thank you, Minister. What you possibly are unaware of is that, yes, Treasury did a calculation of the second year effect using HES data. But they 
 have never produced what the first year effect of the HES data was. They admitted that. I asked them whether they could produce the first year effect using the HES data. We were told that it would not be useful for the debate. That is what the committee was told. We asked: could you table the first year HES data effects?
We have three figures, but the fourth is missing. We have the first year effect using the Treasury model; we have the second year effect using the Treasury model; we have the second year effect using the HES data; we have the first year effect, finally coughed up through the Senate processes—3.1. But when we asked what was the first year effect using the HES data, we were told that it would not be useful for the debate; that we should ask the minister whether that could be produced and tabled. And we are still waiting. So I am asking the minister today: is the government willing to put on the table what the HES data showed in the first year?
Before you start quoting Professor Warren about Dr Carnahan, you should look at the Hansard, because I asked Professor Warren the following question:
While criticising HES—as the Treasury document I am criticising has—it is not exactly a huge rap for where they went. It argues—
this is Dr Carnahan's paper—
that more study was needed . . . 
I repeat: more study was needed. This was in Dr Carnahan's paper. My question continued:
and that more information was needed before you had a reliable figure; it did not say the CPI is the absolute rolled gold way to do this. Is that a fair statement?
I asked him whether that was a fair summary of Dr Carnahan's paper. At page 88 of the Hansard  transcript, Professor Warren replied:
Yes. Like others, I was looking for the supporting literature, and why there was a significant change in position from 1992 and 1985. It was not forthcoming from that, other than inferred by the title. I did not feel convinced at the end of it. I read the literature—
this is Professor Warren on Dr Carnahan—
and it seemed to me that the precedent was not in the direction where it was leading . . .  

So he said he agreed with Dr Carnahan's paper about the limitations of HES. There is no argument about Dr Carnahan's dissection of the problem with HES. Where every eminent economist in this country and Treasury and Dr Carnahan part company is on the decision as to what they did next. He said:
I read the literature and it seemed to me that the precedent was not in the direction where it was leading—so I had some difficulty with that document.
We have missing figures, which hopefully the government will table for us today in order to further inform the debate. We have every eminent economist saying that Treasury got it wrong.
The question to Senator Kemp and the government is: does the government believe that every individual in this community and every individual in the gallery today has the same expenditure pattern? It is the question I asked yesterday. Do you really believe that James Packer has the same expenditure pattern as somebody in that gallery? That is the question, because that is the assumption that the government has made. They have said that Jamie Packer has the same expenditure pattern as a member in the public gallery today.
—He doesn't eat in the restaurants I eat in.
—He does not eat in any restaurants I eat in either, Senator Campbell. That is the question that I am asking Senator Kemp to justify. I am asking him to justify the government's position on that issue. Does the government believe that everybody has the same expenditure pattern in this country?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—I have to point out that this debate was very extensively canvassed before the Senate select committee. I am advised by the Treasury that the first year has not been done, but I would expect that the dispersion would not be dissimilar to the second-year effect. Of course, we have an up-front payment of four per cent which has been widely welcomed. Dr Henry provided extensive evidence to the committee and I would 
 urge the good senator to read carefully the evidence that Dr Henry gave.
As I pointed out to you, these matters were very extensively canvassed before the Senate select committee. This debate has been run. People have come to a view on it. I have stated the government's position. There will be people of goodwill who will differ. I do not doubt that people will differ, but in the end governments have to make decisions. Governments make decisions based on advice that they receive from a variety of sources and the decision has been made.
We had a debate yesterday about the HES data. You may not accept that position and it is a pity if you do not. But, nonetheless, the government's view is quite clear on this. I am not sure why we are constantly revisiting this particular issue.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-28,"—The minister may have unwittingly misled the Senate or perhaps the way in which he expressed himself did not cover the full gamut. As I understood it, you said that the government did not endorse HES. That is so for this package; it is not so generally. As you know, it is the HES with fairly rigorous adjustments which forms the basis of the CPI. Secondly, HES is used in the social security arena for the establishment and understanding of government policy and particular benefits that are paid out. It is not true as a general rule that either the Treasury or the government reject HES.
I should take you back to the central position put by Senator Conroy, and that is that the Treasury has changed its approach under different governments. In 1985 for the draft white paper and in 1993 for the analysis of Fightback, price effects based on differing expenditure patterns for households were based on HES. In ANTS the Treasury rejected this approach, arguing that HES contains known bias in reporting of tobacco, alcohol and gambling; is affected by lumpy, large household expenditures; and there were problems with HES savings data and, finally, disaggregated data.
Those arguments were expanded in detail in the paper by Carnahan, which was tabled by the Treasury and Treasury officers in the 
 committee. But the important point that should be made to you is that Treasury's approach was not only rejected by six university professors who are experts in this area in evidence to the committee, but it was also rejected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Those professors included Professor Ann Harding, Professor John Quiggin, Associate Professor Neil Warren, Professor Peter Saunders, Professor Peter McDonald and Associate Professor David Johnson.
It is important to recognise for the purpose of this debate that this is a critical issue and deserves to be fleshed out, because it has not really been debated in the committees. What happens in the committee, as you know, is a question and answer session and then senators arrive at their conclusions and write their reports appropriately.
The problem is that the government's view and the Treasury's view is opposed by considered academic and professional opinion and is opposed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I will quote the Government Statistician, Mr McLennan. He said:
The ABS consider statistical data from the households expenditure survey can be used at a suitably disaggregated level after appropriate adjustments are made to reported expenditure information to describe the expenditure patterns of population subgroups. The ABS itself uses the information this way in its own fiscal incidence studies, in the calculation of the weights in the CPI and in the compilation of the national accounts. Also, HES data has been used over the years by many analysts for distribution analysis by population subgroups.
So the government does heavily use HES and has heavily used HES. This is picked upon because the government's whole case for the imposition of a GST rests on its claim that it is able to compensate and appropriately compensate significant population subgroups, such that the Prime Minister claimed that no person would be worse off. That has now moved to no group would be worse off.
—No average in a group.
—No average in a group, yes. That assumption is now being severely tested because the evidence that was developed through the Senate committee process is that significant numbers of Australians, running into the millions, are losers or 
 are potential losers in this package. It therefore will require the government, if it is to hold to its belief that it will compensate for the imposition of a GST, to significantly raise that compensation. This is important because the government has made a commitment to compensate for the GST based on erroneous assumptions and erroneous data. This is right at the core of the examination of this package, but if it was fair you would not have to compensate. Senator Conroy is pursuing this issue because it is very much at the heart and at the core of the debate.
In summary, Minister—and I think it was unintentional because you would know that HES is used for CPI, you would know that HES is used in the compilation of national accounts which the government relies on, you would know that it is used in social security—I do not think you should propagate the view that HES is a discredited statistical tool. We all know its inadequacies when it is very finely disaggregated—of course we do—but suitably qualified and suitably modified by the appropriate professional people it is an exceptionally useful means of evaluating the majority of Australians. I think therefore you should take note of what is being driven at in this debate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I was hoping that the minister may have responded to Senator Murray or to my earlier views because this is, as Senator Murray has said, the absolute core. As has been said many times in this chamber, there is no debate that the GST is regressive. It is not possible to debate it. The very notion of a compensation package absolutely gives the lie to the suggestion that the GST is not regressive. The GST is regressive. You need a compensation package to try and bring people back to the point where they are no worse off. That is the whole thrust of the compensation package. So it is an absolutely legitimate debate here today for you to have to argue out your case. It is not possible just to say, `Treasury have said that this is okay.' Treasury have been challenged absolutely legitimately not only by reputable economists like Dr Johnson, Professor Warren and Professor Harding but by St Vincent de Paul and by 
 pensioner groups. They have all come and said, `The government cannot be serious that this is the approach they intend to take. They cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.'
 So you are now challenged to debate the position here, Minister. The government has to state its case, and saying, `Treasury have decided to do this,' is not stating its case. This is the government of which the Treasurer said, `We make the decisions, not Treasury. Treasury's advice is irrelevant.' A letter was sent by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, to the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System—and I am sure Senator Murray would remember it, and possibly Senator Harradine—in which he said: `Treasury's views are not relevant.' The Treasurer sent a letter to the select committee saying: `Treasury's views are irrelevant. It is the government's views that matter.' It may surprise you, Madam Temporary Chairman Knowles, that the Treasurer would be so strong in dismissing Treasury's views. It certainly surprised many of us on the committee.
We want to hear from the Assistant Treasurer why the government believes that every Australian has the same expenditure pattern. St Vincent de Paul proved in their submission, and I will go through it again for you, Minister, that people with a weekly income of between zero and $324—that is, the people in the bottom income group—spend 30 per cent of their income on food. The question is: does Jamie Packer spend 30 per cent of his income on food? Not a chance. They spend three per cent of their income on clothing. Does Jamie Packer spend three per cent of his income on clothing? Not a chance. Utilities: does Jamie Packer spend nine per cent of his income on utilities? Transport, nine per cent. Housing, 28 per cent. This is the key question. The government have said that the people St Vincent de Paul deal with every day, the people they went to to do this survey in the limited time available, have the same expenditure pattern for the purposes of this tax and compensation package as Jamie Packer.
That is what is at stake, Minister. That is why we want the government to give us a response. The government told us not to take 
 any notice of what Treasury had to say. That is the government's view. The Treasurer's letter is on record, Minister. You may smile, but that is what we were told. When another organisation started a similar survey, they got the same sorts of figures: 30 per of those people's expenditure is on food, 16 per cent on utilities and 25 per cent on miscellaneous services. Those are real Australians, with real expenditure patterns, that you dismiss. Dr Johnson made it quite clear about Dr Carnahan's paper. He said, `No, I think he ducks the issue. He states the problems very cogently and very well, but they are problems that we all knew about.' Then he said, `We cannot use this because of these problems. We will use some of that much stronger assumption, namely, that everybody has the same expenditure pattern.' This is a farce. The government's compensation package is based on a farce. As Dr Johnson said, `That seems crazy to me.' Earlier, he stressed the CPI figure:
The first is that we think that the estimate of the CPI itself is wrong. Two things in particular which are stated quite blandly in the tax package documentation itself are that tobacco—and they take a moral view—should not be compensated for. I have no argument with the moral view, but I do not think that should be confused with calculating the price effect.
That is absolutely right. You can have the moral view. You can take the Pigouvian tax approach. But, if you are going to do that, you have to come into the chamber and say, `We commissioned some studies which found, coincidentally with the tax package, that the Pigouvian optimal level of taxation for tobacco is too low at the moment. Therefore, we believe we are moving to the new optimal position.'
What we are asking you, Minister, is where is that information? Where is the intellectual defence that Jamie Packer has the same expenditure pattern as the people interviewed by the ARPA's over-50s, the combined pensioners of St Vincent de Paul? Where is your intellectual defence that Jamie Packer has the same expenditure pattern?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—If I quoted former Treasurer Mr John Dawkins, would that be an 
 intellectual defence? There was a debate on this whole issue; it was an extensive debate. Let me refer to the Hansard . In the other place in relation to the modelling done under the household expenditure survey, this is what the Treasurer said.
—What date, Minister?
—This is 11 November 1998. This is what the Treasurer said in relation to a question from Mr Crean:
This treatment of the household expenditure survey data is wrong. It is nothing more than a statistical nonsense. The HES is based on a sample survey. As the data are divided into smaller and smaller subsets, the accuracy of any derived estimates declines rapidly. Some cells used in the opposition analysis contain as few as seven households and are clearly useless as a guide to the impact of the package. Word for word, that was a statement by Mr John Dawkins, Labor Treasurer . . . 
In response to a freedom of information request from the member for Flinders, John Dawkins, Labor Treasurer, released in the House on 3 March 1992 Treasury modelling of a household expenditure survey. The Treasury advised the Labor Party that the household expenditure survey was not reliable. In fact, this was the document that the Labor Treasurer tabled in the parliament on March 1992 which included a Treasury minute, and the Treasury advice has not changed from 1992 to 1998 that the HES sample did not accurately reflect the Australian population in respect of the household characteristics. This was the argument that the Labor Party used when they were in government. This government has not announced some brand new view of it. As I have said, this was the position, as I understand it, and correct me if I am wrong, that Mr Dawkins put to the parliament on 3 March 1992.
—Do you actually understand what you are debating?
—I wonder whether you understand what you are debating. You have asked me about the use of the household expenditure survey. You have asked me why the government has adopted this new position. I have referred to a position that former Labor Treasurer Mr Dawkins took. I think this goes 
 to the very nub of what you were saying, Senator.
Before I continue, I have been reminded by the Clerk that I need to table the supplementary explanatory memorandum. I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998, the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Bill 1998 and the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Administration) Bill 1998. Apparently that has not been tabled.
Let me return to what I said in light of the comments by Senator Conroy. Treasury was directed to prepare HES based estimates. As I have indicated, the Treasury does not support this position. However, the results were released. I do not think you seem to have recorded that comment in your own remarks. The results were released, and the analysis indicated that the range of price effects was very small, perhaps half a per cent higher for pensioners. That is what I said: `The government has provided a 1½ per cent buffer which ensures that no-one is worse off.' Then I restated the position.
The Treasury has not changed its position. I quoted a 1992 example which I understand was tabled by Mr Dawkins. The Treasury has not changed its position. It has always objected to its use. However, HES based estimates have been provided. When they have been provided, they are typically heavily qualified by caveats. Sometimes these caveats are ignored in the discussion and the subsequent debate. The government has accepted the Treasury's position on this. My understanding was, in quoting comments made by Mr John Dawkins, that was a similar position adopted by the former government.
Senator Murray raised an issue about the ABS. My advice is that the ABS does not trust the HES data. That is why they massaged the data—I am using the words from my adviser—for a range of uses. A professional judgment needs to be made as to when the level of massaging that is necessary becomes too large. The Treasury believe that the level of massaging required to do highly 
 disaggregated analysis is too high, and the government has accepted that advice.
The Jamie Packer issue was raised by Senator Conroy. The Treasury does not assume that everyone has the same expenditure pattern. The Treasury believes that the CPI is the best measure of changes in the cost of living. The CPI estimate will be a reasonable measure unless there is a statistical bias in the distribution of goods and services and the CPI and the tax treatment of those goods and services. 	Senator, this a longstanding debate. It is a debate in which we have tabled some information. The information showed that the differences were simply not large.
The argument then extended into the compensation area. This was a major focal point of the Senate select committee—to look at whether some groups were worse off than other groups. Let me just quote what the Treasurer recently wrote in an article in the Financial Review:
Recently Professor Neil Warren, while supporting GST including the GST on food, criticised some elements of the compensation provided by the ANTS tax reform package. But his research did not identify any groups worse off. Professor Warren notes that his study for the Senate committee ""found that on average there appeared to be no groups who were losers from ANTS"".
That is the evidence that, as I understand it, was given to the Senate committee. The CPI, Senator, is an average measure. It is the best available measure of changes in the cost of living. Governments of both persuasions have accepted this for a whole range of government benefits. The former government accepted the use of the CPI for a range of government benefits and this government does. Unless Senator Conroy is arguing we should change our whole position in relation to the indexation of benefits—that the CPI is not an appropriate measure—I wonder whether, when put to the test, he would be prepared to sustain that position.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Minister, you have agreed that no first year HES calculations have been done. The Treasury chose not to produce them. That is the HES data in the first year. Okay? What the Treasury officials were forced to admit, after some dragging kicking and screaming, 
 is that the actual real world first year effect is 3.1 per cent. That is when you put back in the housing question and the tobacco question. Let us make the brave assumption that the disbursion, as you called it, in the first year is roughly the same as the second year so there is an extra half a per cent to be added on when you use the HES data, so what you are really looking at is a real world first year effect of close to four per cent. Then you say, `Oh well, it is okay because the four per cent will cover that.' But that is only based on the same assumptions that the government has made.
Surprise, surprise: Professors Warren and Harding did their study and their option which you and the Treasurer have continued to refer to. What you have said is that if you model the government's package using the same assumptions—guess what?—you get the same statistical results as the government. That is not a great shock because the models are very similar. But for the Treasurer to continue to try and run the line that Professors Warren and Harding did not find losers is doing the parliament a disservice. It is doing the Senate committee a disservice. Senator Harradine and Senator Murray were there with me and I think possibly Senator Campbell.
What their studies showed was that, depending on the assumptions and options that you chose, it was possible to find losers. But even for what the government is touting as the `no losers' option, Professor Harding was quite explicit in rebutting the Treasurer's claim of no losers. She made quite clear the consequences of averaging—that it was an average pensioner who was going to be 37c better off, and that that 37c average figure would be surrounded by some people who benefited from this whole package by more than 37c but that there would be some pensioners who were below the 37c figure. In other words, under all of the government's favourable assumptions under the modelling that they were using, real people, not an average, would be worse off. She even coined a phrase for it, Minister. She coined the phrase `disguised losers' because an average disguises those below the average.
When, on all the government's most favourable assumptions, the best off you are going to be is 37c, then it is perfectly obvious to Warren and Harding—and they said this in the committee and they have said it afterwards—that 37c is an average figure and it is possible that in that particular grouping more than half of the pensioners could be worse off than the 37c. That is the way an average works. It is spread like this. I apologise to Hansard: it is hard to incorporate hand gestures.
That is the key. Minister, you are playing with figures if you are trying to say, `We did not really just make the assumption about expenditure patterns.' It is true that you did produce some HES data that showed people do have different expenditure patterns, but you then said, `We are going to compensate them on an average.' So you are just playing with words when you try and pretend you have not just assumed that assumption away. It is embarrassing for you to have to stand there, on a parliamentary broadcast day, and say that when you compensated people you treated Jamie Packer the same as a pensioner.
—Senator Conroy, could I ask you to address your comments through the chair and not across the chamber.
—Thank you for drawing that to my attention, Madam Temporary Chairman. That is what the minister has to do today. He has to stand up here and say that Jamie Packer gets the same compensation as the average pensioner.
—He gets more.
—He gets more, because he gets all the tax cuts as well. But if Jamie Packer were in that situation, with all his assets, he would be lumped into this pensioner category, and that is why the government don't want to admit that the whole nub of their argument is flawed from the beginning. There is no clause that can be debated through the Senate. This has to be debated now.
I would like to move on to the Fightback package, which the minister—and probably even you, Madam Temporary Chairman— 
voted for. Even John Hewson has gone public and said, `Stop with the Goebbels chant about there being no losers.' Nobody believes that there will be no losers. Senator Harradine does not believe it, Senator Murray does not believe it, the Greens do not believe it, and we certainly don't believe it. Stop with the Goebbels chant; John Hewson has blown the whistle.
—Neither does Senator Tierney.
—Even Senator Tierney.
—Even the pixies don't believe it.
—No, I won't go that far. But John Hewson said that one of the things he was proud of in the Fightback package was on this question of compensation: `We did not pick an average. We calculated what the bands were, where the average was in the middle of, but what we actually did was compensate for the worst of the potential outcomes, not for the average.' So if the government wants to come in here today and be hairy chested and talk about John Dawkins, I say to you that the tax package of your former leader, which you supported, was very different in structure from that which you are putting to this parliament and the Australian people today. He compensated for the worst of the potential impacts. That is what you voted for last time in 1993. Madam Temporary Chairman, you voted for that strategy last time. You thought that that was the way to go. You don't calculate for an average and compensate for an average; you compensate for the worst of the outcomes. This approach is using all the government's favourable assumptions.
When you start looking at some of the other assumptions that are possible, you see that Warren and Harding find millions of potential losers. That is what Senator Murray and his party have looked at. That is possibly what Senator Harradine is referring to when he talks about the compensation not being enough. So, Minister, you have to justify—through you, Madam Temporary Chairman—
—Senator Conroy, could you  please address 
 your comments through the chair and not across the chamber.
—Thank you for drawing that to my attention. I will endeavour to comply as best I can. But I am sure you will draw it to my attention again if I stray. So it is the expenditure pattern question and the compensation mechanism that the government fought for and supported previously in Fightback that is where you are falling down. That is why you don't want to talk about it today. That is why you want to complain that the debate is blowing out. Why don't you quote the Fightback package when you stand up, Minister?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—The Fightback package was an entirely different package. For a start, it had a 15 per cent GST. It was a different package and there were different issues. I understand that in 1992 the then Treasurer asked Treasury to cost Fightback on the same assumptions used by the then Liberal opposition so that no questions could be raised about the different methodologies. Treasury advised at that time that the HES based distribution was not valid in 1992, and it has that view today. Senator, I think you are missing the point of the debate.
—Minister, I ask you to address your comments through the chair.
—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman, for drawing my attention to that. To constantly asserting something does not prove it. The honourable senator constantly asserts that the Jamie Packer issue somehow has not been responded to. The Treasury does not assume—I have answered this question—that everyone has the same expenditure pattern. That is the point you were making as your big point.
The Treasury believes that the CPI is the best measure of the changes in the cost of living. That is the issue that we are looking at. The former Labor government also believed that the CPI is the best measure of changes in the cost of living. The CPI estimate will be a reasonable measure unless, as I said, there is a statistical bias in the distribution of the goods and services in the CPI. The 
 issue that has been raised by Senator Conroy is an attempt to bring in a total furphy. I do not know what Jamie Packer would think of that or of Senator Conroy's contribution, but it is a furphy.
The next point I want to come to is the use of the HES data. Senator Conroy seems to have come to the conclusion that the government position is essentially a new position that this government has developed. As I understand it, certainly as this quotation in the Hansard of 11 November 1998 shows, it was also the position of the former Labor government. Mr Costello said:
As I said, Mr Speaker, what I propose to release is the Treasury advice to the government and the modelling in relation to the effect of the government's tax package done under costing of the household expenditure survey.
Then there was the quotation which I read out earlier. My understanding is that the former government, in response to a question from the member for Flinders, pointed out all the problems in the HES data which this government has pointed out. So any idea that somehow this government has developed a new position does not appear to be correct, as it was a position which, I understand, the former government was happy to table in the parliament.
Senator Conroy went on to talk about what the HES data showed. As I quoted to him, Treasury was in fact directed to provide HES based estimates. What did the HES based estimates show? The results were released—nothing was hidden—and the analysis indicated that the range of price effects were very small. Senator Conroy has attempted to construct this argument which I do not believe is sustainable. Senator Conroy fails to acknowledge—and I quoted the Treasurer—that in the modelling that was done for the Senate select committee, under any reasonable assumptions, Professor Warren found that on average there appeared to be no groups who were losers from the ANTS package. You might feel upset about that result because it does not fit the preconceptions that you have.
—John Hewson does not believe you.
—Senator, we can quote a whole range of people. Let me quote the modelling that the Senate select committee established. They modelled over 500 households. I can provide that data to you. That was the evidence that was given to the Senate select committee. So your construct on the use of the HES data—
—It is not mine; it is Dr Johnson, Warren and Harding—everyone but you.
—Senator, we have quoted Dr Warren on the HES data. We have quoted Treasury on the HES data. I have quoted a statement that apparently was tabled by Mr John Dawkins on the use of the HES data. I have quoted what the HES data showed when it was used. Senator, it does not sustain the case that you have put.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-28,"—I want to take issue with a number of remarks that the minister has made. Minister, I think your advisers need to be a little judicious in the language they put on the notes to you to read from because earlier you said that the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not trust the HES data. I listened very carefully throughout that hearing, and there is the Hansard  record of that hearing, and in no sense ever did they say that they did not `trust' the HES data. I quoted to you from the ABS submission No. 731, page 1, what Mr W. McLellan, the Government Statistician, said. I will quote him again. He said:
The ABS consider statistical data from the households expenditure survey can be used at a suitably disaggregated level after appropriate adjustments are made to reported expenditure information to describe the expenditure patterns of population subgroups.
That means that they use the information carefully and adjust it appropriately on good statistical and professional grounds. That does not mean they do not trust it. If they did not trust it, they would not use it. We then move on to a number of things you have been saying about what the views of Professors Harding and Warren were. I will quote Professor Warren's words to the committee in the evidence on 8 April at page 2405. He said:
. . . an average goes both ways. There are people above it and people below it. In a sense, what you are looking for is how important is that variation within those groups for those people, where that group on average is sailing close to the wind, and that type of issue. If they are quite close to the 3.4, even though we indicate on an average basis that they are still the beneficiary, on average there could be some groups within that who are the losers.
That is a very clear statement about losers. You must then go on to the nub of the Warren and Harding argument—that is, that the compensation is not adequate. That is the point that Dr Hewson is making. He is not quarrelling with you that you should not give compensation; he is quarrelling with you that it is not adequate. Senator Conroy has been quoting the figure of 37c as some of the compensation available to a particular population subgroup. I remind the Senate that 37c works out to about $20 a year as compensation for the imposition of a GST. By any measure, $20 a year is miserable and mean. If that is the best you can do for the average, imagine what it is like for people below the average who Professor Warren says will be losers.
The firm consensus of Warren and Harding in the NATSEM report and by other commentators who addressed the committee, including Geoff Carmody from Access Economics, is that the compensation clearly is not adequate. If it were adequate, why would Warren and Harding have put up option 7, as they did, where they argued for an increase in pensions from 3.4 per cent to six per cent in 2001-02? Why have they argued, and other people consistently argue, that the male ordinary time earnings benchmark—an area first highlighted by Geoff Carmody of Access Economics—required there to be a different form of compensation certainty introduced? Why have Warren and Harding also proposed that the age pension savings rebate needs to be doubled?
Minister, you are going to be put in a position of trying to defend the indefensible. Throughout the Senate select committee process what has been established is that the ANTS package of compensation is irredeemably flawed and requires it to be significantly boosted if the government is to meet its claim 
 that it will make individuals and groups properly compensated in this matter.
You can argue endlessly about who said what as we went through the process. The conclusion that all the professionals, all the academics and leading supporters of the Liberal Party of Australia have come to is that the compensation is inadequate. So all that your government has to come to terms with is how much you are going to up the ante by. That is your problem. We are told you have $2 billion to $3 billion that you are looking at, but the first step is for you to admit that it needs to be increased.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Minister, are you saying that there will be no change in compensation?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, we have stated our position very clearly in relation to compensation. We think it is a fair package. We have stated that position. The Prime Minister has stated that position. I have stated that position. It is the government's position that the compensation package is a fair package. We draw contrast to the changes that we have made in providing compensation to the changes you made as part of your government in 1993 when no compensation was offered.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Again, I ask the minister, and would he try to address the question: are you saying, Minister, there will be no change in the compensation?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, I am stating that it is the government's position—let me make this very clear—that the compensation which is offered in the package is a fair package. It is fair compensation.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I want to come back to the question of compensation, but I want to make a few comments leading into it. I want to start by making the point that this government has consistently said that this package will be good for the economy. Yet you have to ask against what objective criteria it makes that statement. The modelling done 
 by the government's preferred modeller, Chris Murphy, found that the economic benefit or economic welfare to the community of this package was 0.2 per cent or $607 million, which is relatively negligible. In terms of the indirect tax base, Professor Dixon in his modelling found that the wholesale sales tax was growing at the same rate of GDP, if not slightly better. So the argument about the current tax system being broken is a nonsense. It is true that there has been a decline in the indirect tax base, but that has been because of specific decisions of governments, particularly in reference to tariffs, which could have been, I believe, reasonably easily fixed in terms of our current tax system.
Perhaps the most critical measurement that could have been used to determine whether or not this tax package would have been good for the economy would have been the impact upon employment. If this government had been able to demonstrate that there would be significant employment growth as a result of the introduction of this package, then it certainly would have merited considerable attention. But it has not been able to do that. In fact, it was only through the process of the Senate inquiry that we were finally able to extract the fact that Treasury had not even done any substantial modelling on the jobs impact of the package. They had not even attempted to assess in real terms whether there would be a significant benefit to employment in this economy as a result of the introduction of this tax package—nothing at all.
What came out of the modelling done by the government's preferred modeller, Mr Murphy, was that, if anything, the impact on jobs would be neutral. There would be no net benefit or no net loss. He did demonstrate however that there would be a significant loss to some sections of the community such as Queensland and Tasmania, particularly Tasmania where the effects will probably hit home the hardest in terms of employment in that state. What was also demonstrated by the Murphy modelling, looking at the breakdown across industries, was that the negative impact on jobs was going to be greatest felt in regional and rural Australia. If you look at the 
 industries in which the job losses will be, you will see that they are in those industries that tend to employ in the regional and rural parts of the country. That is borne out if you look at the survey of where jobs growth is taking place which appears in the Financial Review this morning. There has been 25 per cent growth in the CBD or inner area of Sydney over recent years with a loss of population in regional and rural Australia. This package will do nothing to redress that issue.
I want to deal with the analysis done by Professor Dixon in relation to the impact on jobs and to bring that back to the issue of compensation. Professor Dixon in his analysis did a number of sensitivity analyses. He said in part in evidence given in Melbourne at the beginning of February:
Remembering that in the central simulation there is an increase in employment in the short run . . .
That increase in employment is 30,000 jobs—not related to the introduction of the GST but specifically generated out of the tax cuts. His analysis was that the tax cuts would generate some 30,000 jobs. He goes on:
. . . the key assumption is that wages are bargained in after-tax terms. That means that workers are very concerned with how much their wages will buy after they have paid their income tax. In the package, wages—wage demands—are dampened by the cuts in income tax being offered by the government. On the other hand, they are stimulated by the increases in indirect taxes.
He goes on to say:
For the contract that we did at the Centre of Policy Studies, we were asked to look at six types of sensitivity to our central simulation. In sensitivity 1, something goes wrong with the wage process. What goes wrong is that people do not recognise the role of income taxes—the cut in income taxes—so they continue to look at wages as being geared to the CPI, so the cuts in income taxes no longer have a dampening effect on wage demands. Wage earners are not prepared to allow wages to fall relative to the CPI.
Under that analysis, his assessment is that there will be 100,000 jobs lost in the short term, in the short run. He did a number of other sensitivity analyses relating to tourism, education and so forth, but this was a specific analysis on jobs.
 You have to take that in the context of the submission made by the ACTU to the com 
 mittee hearing in Sydney which raised the issue of bracket creep—I think the first and only time it has been raised—and the impact that bracket creep has had on wages and the purchasing power of their members. I will mention a number of the main points that were made in the ACTU's submission. First, workers on $30,000 per annum will be worse off even if you take an inflation impact of three per cent. However, they believe that the inflationary impact of the package has been understated and that it is more likely to be about five per cent. But certainly an increase in inflation greater than three per cent is almost certain.
They also said that no allowance has been made for the disparity in spending patterns between low and high income earning households and that, in that context, the compensation is inadequate. I do not want to go over the detail of that, because it has been raised by both Senator Conroy and Senator Murray this morning in terms of the HES data and so forth.
The ACTU also said that, in their view, the compensation package must be assessed after allowing for bracket creep and taking into consideration what had happened when the last tax schedules were adjusted back in 1993. In that context, they said that full-time workers earning more than $55,000 per annum are more than compensated for protection against bracket creep and GST price effects. Under their assessment, the biggest winners are families with single incomes of $75,000 plus, while full-time workers earning less than $28,000 per annum are insufficiently compensated for GST price increases and those earning between $30,000 and $50,000 fall into a grey zone. The submission went on to state:
. . . real tax on workers earning less than $45,000 rises under the package, but falls for workers earning more than this.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Full-time workers earning between $20,000 and $30,000 per year receive the smallest tax cuts.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The methodology used to calculate changes in the cost of living from the GST package, understates the price increase for low income families 
 and exaggerates it for high income families. This is because it ignores:
.	 savings behaviour differences, and
.	 consumption pattern differences
across family income levels.
They then went on to say, and I think this was probably the most telling point in their submission:
Once adjustment is made for bracket creep, single income earners without dependants and earning less than $40,000 per year are worse off under the GST package . . . The greatest losses occur in the $20,000-$30,000 income bracket.
Given that that is the assessment of the ACTU on how this package will impact on workers, particularly low income workers, given the sensitivity analysis that has been done by Professor Dixon in particular on what the likely outcome on jobs would be if workers seek to maintain their wage levels relative to movements in the CPI and they do not take into account any compensation that might be provided through the tax cuts, and, more importantly, given that under the ACTU's analysis the workers most affected will be those in the $40,000 a year and under bracket creep—and that range of workers covers metal workers, transport workers, storemen and packers, and building and construction workers who are amongst the most militant groups of workers in the economy—one would have to draw—
—But you have left them; you are here. They are no longer as militant.
—I said `metal workers'. I do not put myself down as one these days.
—Could you get a job for Senator O'Chee?
—It is also true that you will not be a senator come 1 July. You will be unemployed and you will have to work for the dole the same as everyone else, I hope.
—I doubt it.
—I look forward to seeing whether the social security minister, Senator Newman, actually insists on you working for the dole on 1 July in the same way the government have insisted on 
 some other workers in this country having to work for the dole.
—There must be some shop you can put him in.
—I am sure there are a few metal shops that would love to take him. Whether he would last very long is another matter.
—You have never worked for a wage.
—Order! Senator Campbell, will you address your remarks to the chair, please.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman, for drawing my attention to that. I come back to the point I was making. Given that that range of income covers the most militant groups of workers in our community, one would have to assume that at least a percentage of those workers will seek compensation directly from their employers for the impact of this package. Given that that is the case, one would also have to assume that the impact on jobs in the short term is going to be a negative one. I think it would be unrealistic to assess it as having a total across-the-board impact, but it certainly will be substantially greater than this government has taken into account.
There are some questions that arise in relation to that issue that I would like to put to the Assistant Treasurer. The first question is: why did the government not insist, with Treasury, when the ANTS package was being put together that extensive modelling be done in relation to the impact it would have on employment in our economy? The second question I would like to put to the Assistant Treasurer is: did the tax committee or did the government at any time ask Treasury to look at the issue of bracket creep, either (a) in respect of the initial putting together of the ANTS package or (b) in response to the detailed submissions that were made by the ACTU? Has the government had the Treasury examine the ACTU submission in terms of their claims as to what the impact will be on low income earners? And surely the question that is posed by the ACTU submission is not 
 who is not worse off under this package, but who is substantially better off?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I would like to ask the minister: why didn't Treasury use a wider modelling base to arrive at the compensation level of four per cent; and how and why did they actually arrive at four per cent, bearing in mind that a range of academics and a range of social security and church groups have all said that the use of the CPI is not a good modelling system and totally inadequate? Surely Treasury could have used not only the CPI but also the household expenditure survey. Maybe Treasury could have spoken to people, because so many people have said that this compensation is not adequate.
I want to point out the burden this will place on country people who are, on average, less well off than their metropolitan counterparts. Australians in regional and remote areas are already using a larger proportion of their incomes to buy food than people in the city. In North Queensland, a basket of healthy foods has been found to cost 175 per cent more than Brisbane prices. So why, in your view, is the four per cent adequate for people in these areas, as opposed to the four per cent being adequate in metropolitan areas, when these people are already paying more for their food and everything else? With the impact of the GST, they are going to be paying even more—so how can you say that this is adequate?
In remote Aboriginal communities, families spend an even larger proportion of their income purchasing essentials. An ATSIC survey of expenditure patterns for indigenous households in rural and remote communities in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory was considered by the Senate community affairs committee. The survey revealed that these households spend on average 39.3 per cent of their income on food. That is an extraordinarily large percentage of your total income to spend on food. Larger sized households were spending up to 54 per cent of their income on food.
I know that the minister will say, `In Aboriginal communities and remote areas the diesel fuel rebate is going to compensate for 
 this.' I would like to know exactly how much lower the cost of items will be because of this diesel fuel rebate. Can you actually give me a percentage or a figure of how much less people in these areas are going to pay for this? You need to bear in mind that aircraft are the only means by which food can be transported to a lot of these remote Aboriginal communities, so the diesel fuel rebate is really not going to make any difference to them. In many parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland the only reasonable way of transporting food is to fly it in—unless you want to take a picnic basket and a three-day car trek. So I would really like to know how this is going to affect these people.
A number of church and social security groups have pointed out to us time and again that the four per cent is not enough compensation. This is because Treasury has lumped everybody into one mass of an average. People are not average. Nobody is average. You, Minister, might spend more on food than I do, or maybe vice versa—I might like my food more than you do. We are of opposite gender, and I would imagine that I would have a lot more expenditure than you do. After all, you do not have to buy make-up, you do not have to buy stockings—
—I don't know about that.
—Alexander does.
—Exactly, the fish-nets. I am trying to say, Minister, that people are not average, and people—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Did I miss something here?
—It is all right, Brian. It is not that other committee.
—It is all right, Senator Harradine, I will be very well behaved. People are not average, Minister, and people on lower incomes are not average. They have certain expenditures. Most of these people barely have enough to live on now. I would really like people in the Treasury to actually try to live on an old age pension and to see how far they get. Living on an old age pension is very hard. People barely have enough to live on.
My parents are pensioners and they say, `We can live, and we can live adequately, but we cannot buy the big things in life.' If the television breaks down, if they need a new refrigerator or if they need a new washing machine, it is a struggle because the pension simply covers the other things that they need in life. A four per cent increase for them is not going to be much at all. I know the government will say that we are getting the tax rebates, but people like my parents do not pay tax. They do not pay tax at all. They are simply going to have to pay more and more for what they are getting.
I would like to know, also, whether the government realises that down the track the four per cent compensation is not going to be adequate for people on lower incomes—people on pensions, people living in Aboriginal communities, people living in rural and remote areas where products and goods cost a lot more than they do in the metropolitan areas. Is there going to be a mechanism here for this compensation to be increased? Has the government thought that out, or is the compensation simply going to stay and people will struggle? We have also heard from other countries where the compensation fizzled out because the GST went higher and that compensation was never advanced at all in any way.
—Or removed.
—Exactly. So is there going to be a mechanism for these people? Is there going to be a mechanism for people living in the remoter areas where their expenses are far higher? Are they going to be compensated in any other way?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—A number of questions have been put. Perhaps I can deal with a few of those quickly now before the debate moves on. I think Senator Murray raised in his comments the issue of trust and disputed my use of the word `trust' in relation to some comments I made on the ABS. I think that the ABS feels that the use of the HES data does have limitations and that it cannot be used without adjustment. We can argue what it all means. My understanding is and my advice is that they never use the raw data.
—Never say never. You know that.
—You will notice that I said `my advice is'. My advice is that they never use the raw data. I think that puts that comment into perspective. I do not think there is much difference between what we are really arguing there. Of course, they use their professional judgment as to just how much adjustment has to be made and how much is reasonable.
Senator George Campbell made a contribution, and I think he, in fact, made some remarks in his comments that were very similar to a question, if I remember rightly, he asked me in the Senate some time ago about the use of modelling and what modelling showed in relation to the growth in employment. I thought I gave a pretty good answer at that time. I think it was to you, Senator George Campbell. I know I received widespread praise from people who were listening to the Senate at that time.
But, Senator, there is a range of models that have been prepared, which show, in fact, that tax reform of the type that we are bringing in is good for the economy. Salomon Smith Barne predicted that tax reform would lift GDP by 2.3 per cent, which I thought was not too bad. Econtech, using the MM330, indicated a long run GDP gain, with the replacement of the WST with a VAT, of around two per cent. The Melbourne Institute, using the ORANI model, indicated that indirect tax reform could lift GDP by 3.8 per cent.
—Two per cent over 10 years.
—Access said that the tax package would lift—
—You are quoting 10-year figures.
—Senator, you have been out for a long time, and the debate was actually proceeding quite nicely without you in here, so could you keep quiet while I try to respond to Senator Campbell's question? Mr Temporary Chairman, you might like to take some strong action on this front, particularly in the light of the comment that Senator 
 Conroy made about you and the superannuation surcharge.
—I request that you address the chair and the issues, Senator Kemp.
—An exceedingly impartial ruling, I might say. The Melbourne Institute, using the ORANI model, indicated that indirect tax reform could lift GDP by 3.8 per cent. Access said that the tax package would lift GDP by 2.5 per cent and create some 190,000 jobs. So there is quite a range of models that have been produced which show GDP growth which either imply or indicate growth in employment. So I think that should deal with the matter you raised.
I was intrigued, given your former occupation, that you felt that wage rises would cost jobs. I took that to be one of the comments that you made. Senator, you said that in relation to the Dixon model. Wage earners are more than fully compensated, and I think actually a reading of your remarks would show that you believe that wage earners are compensated. You wish to increase compensation, I understand, but wage earners are more than fully compensated for consumption price increases by the income tax cuts and by increases in government benefits. So the real take-home pay will actually rise.
Your argument was that there would be unintended wage rises because some people would not accept that their take-home pay had increased as a result of the package. I think you were very careful to say that it was unreasonable to assume that across the whole range people would seek wage rises to compensate, but you felt there may be particular groups in more militant sections of industry who would ignore the compensation package and seek wage rises. I think the implication was that you felt this may cost jobs. In the compensation package we more than fully compensate people for the taxation changes. We think it is unreasonable to argue that there will be wage rises.
I was interested in your comments on the ACTU. Although the ACTU have made some threatening noises about a wages blow-out under the tax reform, I think Jennie George was quoted in the Age of 5 February as 
 saying that they would not make claims that economists say would cost jobs. Jennie George said: `We will keep in mind the employment effect.' That puts a slightly different perspective on the comments you made about the attitude of the ACTU. I hope that the ACTU will act in a responsible fashion. There is no reason for wages to blow out. Even your remarks indicated that a wages blow-out would cost jobs. Coming from Senator George Campbell, I think that is a big statement and I am happy to have that recorded in the Hansard. It is all very well to hypothesise a whole range of adverse effects but a reasonable person would ask why people would seek wage rises to obtain further gains when the compensation, through the tax cuts and other increases in pensions and benefits, is there and is on the table.
Senator Campbell raised the fiscal drag issue. The personal income tax cuts of over $13 billion each year more than offset the fiscal drag that has occurred recently. The government is providing a low inflation environment. I note that the CPI comes out at 11.30 a.m. We will be interested to see what that figure is. But it cannot be argued that the government has not provided a low inflation environment and that the impact of fiscal drag has not been subdued in recent times.
Let me put the fiscal drag issue into perspective, because your remarks gave some emphasis to it. The personal income tax cuts in 2001 are almost five times as large as the cuts required to compensate taxpayers for the fiscal drag that has occurred since the government came to office. In fact, the personal income tax cuts will compensate taxpayers for more than twice the value of fiscal drag since the last round of personal income tax cuts in 1993.
Senator Gibbs raised a number of issues. Senator Gibbs decided that she would also get back into the HES debate. We have had a pretty extensive debate on that issue this morning. I am not sure that I can add anything further to the debate which occurred probably over an hour and a half ago between Senator Conroy and me on that. Senator Gibbs, not unnaturally, was concerned about the impact that tax reform may have on rural 
 areas. Senator Gibbs drew our attention to the fact that some prices are higher in rural areas. One of the reasons they are higher is the substantial cost of transport. The compensation is for the change in prices which is likely to occur as a result of the tax reform package. There is no particular reason to believe that the change in prices would be higher in rural areas.
I was trying to get a bit of a feeling yesterday as to whether rural senators in the Labor Party supported cuts in diesel fuel prices. I had a debate last evening on that issue. I was unclear from Senator Crossin's response as to whether she supported a cut in diesel fuel prices. I assume I am correct in assuming that you support a cut in diesel fuel prices, Senator Conroy.
—Stop verballing my questions.
—He always says that. When an interesting topic comes up, you can always tell when Senator Conroy has made a useful point—Senator Conroy has to butt in. It is a useful point. I think your constituents would be interested to know whether you support a cut in diesel fuel prices. A measure in this package which will have very significant and important effects in rural and regional Australia is the cut in diesel fuel prices. Senator, knowing your interest in looking after rural Australia, we will look forward to your support for that measure. There were a number of issues in relation to Aboriginal communities. There is a useful brief that I am getting on that, and I may respond after some other comments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-04-28,"—It is always dangerous posing any questions to Senator Kemp because the answers never have any relationship to the questions asked. I did not ask him about the issue of whether I supported the view that one man's wage increase was another man's job, but I will come back to that in a minute.
I asked Senator Kemp what objective criteria were used to measure whether or not this package was good for the economy. He trotted out some growth rates by various groups in terms of what they say GDP growth 
 will be under this tax package. I ask the minister: are those annual growth rates or are they projected rates of growth over a period of time? I also asked Senator Kemp a question in relation to why the government had not insisted on Treasury doing more extensive modelling on the impact of this package on jobs, given that unemployment is one of the critical issues we are facing every day in this community and which has so many spin-offs in terms of our economy, most of which are negative when we have substantial rates of unemployment. He totally ignored the question; he did not even attempt to answer it.
The third question I raised was in respect of the submission made by the ACTU. I related that to the modelling carried out by Professor Dixon, who said that if compensation were sought for the impacts of the package outside the tax cuts, that would have a jobs impact. I am not debating whether that is right or wrong; that was his assumption from the modelling. The ACTU made a submission which stated that the compensation for ordinary wage and salary earners would be totally inadequate. In that context, I said that if that were the case, you had to draw the conclusion that those groups would seek compensation outside of just the tax cuts, and that could have an impact on jobs. I asked whether Treasury had been asked to look at the submission made by the ACTU in terms of that argument about bracket creep.
I agree that in certain circumstances one man's wage increase is another man's job. You have only to look at what has happened to major corporations in this country and in the United States when they have put in top executives and given them a big salary increase and a huge swag of shares in the company. What have they done? They have wielded the axe and ordinary workers have hit the deck all over the place. Look at job shedding across all the major companies in this country, the United States and elsewhere—all built upon huge salary packages for executives. That is certainly a clear example of one man's wage increase being another person's job. We do not deny that that happens, and that it has happened consistently. I ask the minister to try to answer the specific 
 questions that I have asked him and not ramble on with some waffle about a topic that he might be interested in but which the rest of us regard as an irrelevancy.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Minister, thank you for your answers, but you did not answer my question. Does the government have mechanisms in place to redress the hardship which people will suffer if the four per cent compensation is not enough? I am talking about people on pensions, people on very low incomes, and particularly people in remote and regional Australia. If the compensation is not enough, and the government realises it is not enough, are there mechanisms in place which will address the situation?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—We have the 1.5 per cent guaranteed real rise in pensions. So whatever the price rise is, there will be a guaranteed 1.5 per cent real increase.
—What if it isn't enough?
—The 1.5 per cent is above the price rise, so if you tell me that the price rise is not 1.9 per cent, that you think it is 4.5 per cent—even though we would not accept that—the 1.5 per cent guarantee represents a real rise above the prices. That is the mechanism; that is the guarantee.
—Can you guarantee that in rural and remote areas of Australia?
—This applies to all Australians. This is the guarantee. I am surprised, because of your interest in this package, that you do not seem to be aware of that guarantee. I say to Senator Campbell that I regret that my remarks must have stung. He went off on his usual frolic. The growth rates in GDP which I quoted are over time.
—Over what time?
—I can give you a breakdown of each model over the period of time, if that is required. My advisers will take that on notice and it will be provided to you. Senator, you and I will have to differ. Essentially, I have indicated—
—That is not unusual.
—No, it is not unusual and it is probably a healthy thing that we differ. It is a good thing that there is a vigorous debate. Senator, you and I will just have to differ. I noted your efforts to get out of the comments about one man's wage rise being another man's job. I noted that you attempted to correct the record there. I am pleased to record that.
—Why didn't you push Treasury to do modelling on the jobs impact?
—The government is entirely comfortable with the fact that a range of models show that tax reform is very good for the economy. I promised Senator Gibbs that I would return to another matter that she raised with me. Senator, one of your issues concerned—and I think I answered it—claims that consumer prices would rise by more in rural and remote communities than in the cities. As I pointed out, that failed to take into account the benefit which remote areas will receive from the new fuel excise arrangements to be introduced in conjunction with a GST. As a rural senator, we hope that because of your concern for rural issues you will be supporting that move.
Together with other measures in the package, they will reduce road transport industry costs by an estimated 6.7 per cent and rail transport costs by nearly four per cent. Clearly, these cost reductions translate into lower costs of providing goods and services. Commonwealth income support payments such as the newstart allowance, remote area allowance, assistance for isolated children and the Community Development Employment Program—all programs in which you have taken a particular interest—will receive an up-front four per cent increase, and you noted that, and will remain 1.5 per cent above the increase in the cost of living as measured by the CPI.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-28,"—On the issue of compensation, I want to take the minister to something I said in my second reading debate speech about the accommodation provided by supported ac 
 commodation providers and also people in the boarding house industry. I am aware that there is an amendment, but I do not think that the amendment the government is proposing fully addresses the issue.
There are a couple of questions which the minister may well need to take on notice, and I am quite prepared to get the answers later on. We are looking at a very special sector of accommodation in our community, because invariably that sector—whilst they are for-profit providers—deals with a significant number of people who are disadvantaged and on low incomes, many of whom were residents in previously state run institutions.
As I said in my second reading debate speech, most of the people in these facilities are on government benefits or pensions of some sort, and there are some who do have access to low paid casual and part-time positions. But invariably these are people who are at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. These are people who are severely disadvantaged; people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities or alcohol and drug dependencies, the long-term unemployed and so on. We are not dealing with the people at the top end of town who can comfortably deal with the effects and impacts that the GST may have. In my second reading debate speech I referred to a 1990 survey in Queensland which showed that 1,000 facilities catered for 23,000 clients. That is not a small market at all; that is reasonably substantial. I am told that there are no reliable statistics for the rest of Australia, and one of the reasons for this is that this part of the market is very much unregulated. If the GST has the impacts that we say it will have, then these are the people who will be the most disadvantaged as a result.
I have received a submission from a group looking into the impact of the GST on this sector. They say that the supported accommodation industry has estimated that, for a resident in supported accommodation, the GST could be as much as $10 per week higher than the four per cent compensation proposed in the GST. That is the impact. There have been models which have looked at the averages, but has any modelling been 
 done in this particular area, the area of most disadvantage? In other words, whilst I understand where your compensation package is aimed, have you looked specifically at the needs of these people who are in supported accommodation premises and boarding houses throughout Australia?
I am led to believe by the people who have approached me that this is a growth area because of the economic and social problems faced by people in our society today. We are dealing with the people who are almost the most severely disadvantaged in our community. I have a grave concern that these people, who have no discretionary spending at all, will suffer the most from the impact of the GST. It seems to me that, whilst the models looked at the average, we need to compensate for the worst of the outcomes.
The question Senator Gibbs asked was very relevant indeed: what happens if compensation is not enough? In an area such as this which is unregulated, how does the government intend to address that in particular? If there are 23,000 people in this situation in the state of Queensland, based on a 1990 survey, can you give me the Australia-wide statistics? Was any modelling done based on the impact on these people, and what happens to these people if the compensation offered in the government package is insufficient?
As has also been pointed out to me, whilst the government is seeking to make some changes in division 87, those changes will not eliminate the cost impact of at least a minimum of three per cent on the supported accommodation providers and the boarding houses. There will be an impact from the GST, and every indication I have is that the other things that are currently GST free in these establishments—because there is no GST and they have no wholesale sales tax applied to them—will now attract a GST. If this is the case, we will have a substantial pool of people in the Australian community who will be very much worse off as a result of the GST.
It also happens to be, I am told, an industry which, whilst unregulated, is very price sensitive, so I am looking for some clear answers. I can only refer back to my very first 
 speech in this place, in which I said we should look after the dignity of those people who are least able to defend themselves and that we should have a preferential option for the poor rather than just treating them in an offhand manner, as this compensation package seems to be doing. I look forward to your response.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Although Senator Hogg has suggested that we are treating this group of people in an offhand fashion, the government is particularly conscious of the needs of disabled people and people with other special needs who need support. There is a vast range of programs which the government supports to assist these people, so let me get the political rhetoric out of the way. Nonetheless, I think Senator Hogg raised some issues, so let me deal with them. Senator Hogg, I think you put some questions on notice, and I will see whether we can provide some of those statistics which you were seeking. I will go through the issues you raised.
If the accommodation is provided by the charity and the supply is non-commercial, then it is GST free. But of course people in those cases will benefit from the four per cent up-front rise and the 1.5 per cent real guarantee. As far as long-term accommodation price rises are concerned, the estimates that I have been given by my advisers indicate that they will rise by approximately two per cent. Senator, you also looked at the treatment of people who may well be in boarding house type accommodation. It has never been the government's intention that residents of boarding houses and hostels should suffer any disadvantage. The government is providing concessionary treatment of long-term commercial accommodation—I think you referred to that in your remarks—and some optional ways are provided in relation to the way the GST will be applied. The operators of commercial residential premises will have the option of choosing the tax treatment that serves them and their residents best. To reiterate: by increasing pensions, benefits and allowances by four per cent, the government will be more than compensating low income 
 people for any price increases, including of course movements in rent.
  Another area is when disabled residents of boarding houses or hotels require nursing or daily living assistance care of the type covered by schedule 1 in relation to the quality of care principles under section 96-1 of the Aged Care Act 1997. The legislation provides for these services, as well as the accommodation, to be GST free. I think you were seeking a response on how they would be treated, and I think the statement I made should provide a high degree of comfort in regard to what you were concerned about. GST-free treatment will apply if the Minister for Aged Care has determined the services are of a type covered by schedule 1 of the quality of care principles and these services include daily living assistance or nursing care. Thus, people with disabilities requiring this level of care can have access to the same services GST free whether they are living in boarding houses or other accommodation. I think that should give a high degree of comfort in these areas about which you have expressed some special concern. I recall some reference to this, now you have reminded me of your remarks, in your first speech in this parliament.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Minister, I do not think you have addressed a couple of issues, and I do not necessarily accept your last remark. Was there any modelling done—I am not asking for the specific detail now—in this particular area to show the impact? We are not dealing with charitable organisations; we are dealing quite specifically with places which provide accommodation on a full profit basis.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, my advisers will take that on notice and I will provide you with the information. The general accommodation sector was, I think, modelled. But in terms of the specifics about which you have asked, I will check with my advisers.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Thank you, Minister. These are people with specific needs. As I said, they are people who are invariably in a severely disadvantaged area. They are not in charitable accom 
 modation; they are in for-profit accommodation and, therefore, the impact will be different in that area. Whilst you mentioned the option of the provider to choose how they charge, nonetheless the GST still will have an impact on accommodation in general which will, I am reliably told, be of the order of three per cent. So there will be an impact in this area. Has that been taken into account in looking at the problems that are faced in general by the people in this type of accommodation?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, I think you may not have heard the comment I made about the issue of disabled people who live in a boarding house or hostel and who require nursing or daily living assistance. You are speaking of the kind of care that is delivered under schedule 1 of the quality of care principles, I assume. The legislation provides for these services, as well as the accommodation, to be GST free. The GST-free treatment will apply if, as I said, the Minister for Aged Care has determined the services are of a kind covered by schedule 1 of the quality of care principles. Thus, people with disabilities who require a level of care can have access to the same services GST free whether they are living in boarding houses or whether they are living in other accommodation.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Minister, as I said in my preamble, this is an unregulated area. There are a lot of backyard operators out there.

 more detailed questions on some of the modelling and some questions in relation to the numbers. I will seek to provide that information to you.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-28,"—At this point in the debate, I want to raise some issues which are the subject of questions on notice about the impact of the GST on the racing industry. My office has been in contact with the minister's office today. The questions were lodged 57 days ago and, therefore, they are outside the 30-day response limit. My office faxed the minister's office on 12 April to remind the minister of the questions and seek answers, and it followed up on 20 April seeking further advice. Because apparently that fax was lost, we faxed through another copy of the request on that day. The minister's office called at the end of last week seeking more information, and we provided that information. As I said, my office has contacted the minister's office again this morning, trying to find out what was happening. We were advised that the answers are now in the Treasurer's office.
—Which minister are you talking about?
—You, Minister.
—You contacted my office?
—Yes. The information contained in those answers is directly relevant to this debate. I asked the questions when I did to ensure that I had the answers prior to the commencement of the debate. That may have somewhat foreshortened my presence in the chamber in relation to the eliciting of that information. I take it that the minister has been acquainted with those matters. One would have assumed his staff would have acquainted him with those formal requests.
I want to go back to the debate of this issue during the election campaign, because it appears not to have received any attention in the committee stage of this bill. I have had a look at the relevant reports of both the select committee and the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, and it is not in there. There was a degree of debate. We had the curious situation during the election campaign 
 where the proponent of the government's view in the community was Mr Wilson Tuckey, the member for O'Connor. He was representing the government's view to the industry participants.
I attended a public meeting in Victoria attended by Mr Tuckey where there was a debate about the issue. One of the matters which concerned me during that debate was that there were assurances given to the industry by the then relevant minister, Mr Andrew Thomson, or by his staff. There was a letter circulated to the industry which was not signed by Mr Thomson but by his chief of staff which said that Treasury gave certain assurances in relation to the effect of the GST on the industry, particularly on the owners of animals racing for prize money and the issue of input costs in that industry. I noted that Carruzzo Consulting Certified Practising Accountants circulated a document during the campaign to industry participants talking about the issue of prize money. The publication reads:
Unfortunately, there has been little direction from the Tax Office in this area, other than what was quoted in their official publications, where they stated:
""Prize money is a payment to an owner for providing a horse to race. Prize money will be subject to GST. However, racing clubs will claim an input tax credit for the GST paid on prize money to a registered owner. This means that prize money is effectively GST-free.""
At the time of writing, I am aware of various submissions, from breeding and racehorse owners associations, trying to clarify this issue. The initial indication is that hobby owners will receive the same amount of prize money, however registered business owners will have a GST component in their winnings. It follows that any GST component in their prize money will have to be ""netted off"" against input credits to determine if they remit or claim back GST from the Tax Office.
This is undoubtedly a complex area and, if the Coalition retains office, I will update you as to what the final Tax Office treatment is in this area.
Given that the statement which Mr Thomson's office was making and which Mr Tuckey was repeating was that any owner of a racing animal, if they had a reasonable expectation of earning prize money, would be able to be registered under the GST to claim back their 
 input costs, and given the way that that information was conveyed—that is, not by the Treasurer or his office but by the chief of staff, and not by the minister or the minister for sport's office but by Mr Wilson Tuckey, the member for O'Connor and a backbencher at the time, who was representing the government—I think it is time that we had absolute clarity on this issue.
I say that because, looking at the legislation, it seems to me that these individual operations or what might generally be described as racing partnerships would have to fall within the definition of an enterprise or perhaps even the definition of a business under the legislation. It seems to me that in terms of registering there is a discretion by the Commissioner of Taxation as to whether those individual ownership or collective arrangements—syndicates, for example—are going to be dealt with in some more specific way than is set out in the legislation.
The issue—as was the experience in New Zealand—is that, if the cost of participation in this area rises, then the likelihood is that there will be a reduction in the number of participants and that will have an impact on employment. One of the reasons I have a significant interest—and only one of them, I might say—is that in my state the industry is undergoing some significant difficulty at the moment and, were additional costs to be imposed in the way of input costs that could not be recovered, that would in many respects have a disastrous effect on the industry.
I suspect I would be talking not just about the state of Tasmania, but also regions of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia where there are significant businesses operating which generate employment in those regions—employment being a scarce commodity in those regions. This is an industry which tends to employ a lot of people who are not academically qualified and who have skills which are applicable possibly to this and a few other rural industries but would have difficulty finding alternative employment were this industry to fall over.
It is important that there be clarity on this issue because the legislation does not specifi 
 cally deal with it—and possibly that is as it should be. But given that, the nature of the assurances given are somewhat vague and the official publication of the government which was issued during the election is, at least in the words of the certified practising accountants that I quoted, such that it provides little direction in this area. There are other implications which arise if the status of a business is attributed to these operations or racing partnerships.
The other area of concern which intermingles with this issue is the treatment of what Carruzzo Consulting described as hobby owners, saying that they could not register for the GST and that they would wear the full cost of the GST levied on their racing costs—and they have nominated some of those. That is in contradiction in some respects to the statements by Minister Thomson's office and Mr Tuckey's statement during the campaign.
I raise this now because I suspect it is not the subject of specific amendments during the debate, so far as I am aware. I have not seen them. Perhaps the government has some amendments that it is entertaining in this regard. It seems to me that if it is not raised here there may be a difficulty later in the debate in dealing with the matter. So, Minister, perhaps you could assist me in relation to this matter now.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, I do not know if you refer to the difficulty down the track. My understanding is that the Labor Party will not be moving any amendments. I am not quite sure what you had in mind there. But that is the position that the Labor Party has adopted, as I understand, in relation to this bill. Senator, if the racehorse owners pass the enterprise test then they can register.
—That is in the legislation?
—That is right. That is in the legislation. If they register then, as is well known, they remit one-eleventh of prize money. But the racing club will be able to gross up the prize money so that the net prize money does not fall. The advice I have received is that unregistered owners will 
 receive the same net prizes. I hope that gives you some comfort.
—It does not.
—I think it should.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-28,"—It does not, because, as I said, there are assurances given that any owner who races an animal with a reasonable expectation of obtaining prize money would be able to register. That is not clear from the legislation and my reading of the definitions of either `business' or `enterprise' in the legislation. To say that it is clear from the legislation is to beg the question. The question is: to the extent that they are not clear from the legislation, are you able to assure the industry that the assurances give by Mr Tuckey and by Mr Thomson's office during the campaign will be fully met by this legislation? The last thing that the industry wants is find that they have been dudded—that they have been told something in relation to how this tax system will apply to their industry only to find that when it is implemented by the parliament it applies in a different way. What I tried to impress upon you is that there are significant consequences of the application of the GST to input costs for the industry where there is not the ability to get those costs back either as a registered enterprise or in some other way.
I am not sure whether you appreciate the point that I am making, as you are in animated conversation with your adviser. It seems to me that, if there is an intention to keep those assurances, you should be able to simply say to the Senate that the assurances given by Mr Tuckey and Mr Thomson's office in the campaign will be honoured in full; that is, an owner who races an animal with a reasonable expectation of earning prize money will be able to register, whether or not they reach the $50,000 threshold.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—This is the first time you have made those comments to me, but my understanding is that what I have said is quite consistent with those comments. The bill has been drafted: what we say is that if the racing owner passes the enterprise test, they can register. It seems to me that that is con 
 sistent with what you have said. The bill has now been out for four months.
—I have had questions on notice for 57 days; you have not answered them.
—I am glad that you have drawn that again to my attention. Quite obviously, if you put questions on notice you are entitled to an answer. I will find out what has happened. I hear what you say.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I appreciate that assurance and I look forward to the answers to those questions. I use the words carefully because they were the words which were being used during the campaign and they are important words in the view of the industry, I am sure. The other issue that was raised verbally by Mr Tuckey was that, if a racehorse owner or partnership were registered as an enterprise, it would become a business for the purpose of general taxation law.

—If we can come back at some point in the debate, if need be, without it being taken as formally out of place, I am happy with that.
—Just so there is no misunderstanding, can you repeat your question? We have got the substance of it; I want to make sure that we deal with the issue you have raised.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Where, for example, an individual or a syndicate registers as an enterprise and they are racing for the purpose of racing a thoroughbred, a pacer or a greyhound, will that registration indicate that they are a business for the purposes of general taxation law?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-04-28,"—When I made my speech in the debate on the second reading on 
 behalf of the Labor opposition in this chamber, one of the commitments I gave in terms of the Labor Party's approach to this legislation was that we would want to complete the consideration of this legislation by 30 June. A number of backbenchers have pursued—exhaustively, I think—a lot of questions up to this point in the committee stage which are very important issues. One does not in any sense undercut the importance of them.
The government has billed this legislation as the biggest tax change in Australian history. It therefore cannot expect that it would go through unquestioned or without the type of scrutiny and review that the Senate is appointed to undertake.
I wonder whether it might be appropriate at this juncture to invite Senator Murray to move the first amendment on our list. Then we will start to debate some of the amendments to the legislation. I think there are 128 government amendments. We have put to you, Minister, direct questions as to whether there are to be any further government amendments. Without trying to misrepresent your view, my understanding of what you have said is that you are in a position of neither confirming nor denying that there would be, or—to use another phrase that you have often expressed—you do not know whether there will be further amendments.
We have sought to ask you: is the government considering other changes? That is a reasonable question in view of the clear fact that the government at this point would appear not to have, on the views expressed in the speeches at the second reading stage, a majority in this chamber to carry its legislation in the form in which it is presenting it with its own amendments. The question as to whether the government therefore contemplates softening some of its harsh provisions in this legislation to meet the needs of this chamber or whether it intends to try to crash through or crash is a reasonable question.
For the record, again I note that you have not been lured into providing any sort of indication as to what is in the government's mind. I would maintain that it is reasonable that you should, but it is a fact that you have not. Perhaps you might want to express a few 
 more words on that subject so that we can be given some guidance. If we now move into considering the amendments and the government, because of negotiations that may occur offstage with senators or with other parties other than the Australian Labor Party, changes its position and brings forward new amendments, we may have to backtrack and go over ground we have already covered and extend, as a consequence, the period of this debate beyond the time which at least we in the Labor Party want to bring it to a conclusion—that is, 30 June.
I think it is reasonable for us to say that, since this is a house of review and since the GST legislation is a moveable feast, the bills that the House of Representatives voted on are not the bills you want us to vote on. You want to change those in 128 different places. Therefore, the complexion of the legislation alters when it is before us. It is reasonable in those circumstances to say: why don't you trot out all of the changes you want to make so that this chamber of review can see the full enchilada? Let us have a look at the lot. Let us see what your true position really is and then we can engage in constructive debate.
Having said that, it appears that it is not the government's wish to do that. At some point we have to acknowledge that the government is militant in its determination not to do that. So, in a practical sense, let us move to some of the amendments and risk having to come back and cook our cabbages twice, having to come back and go over ground we have already gone over at the risk of perhaps extending the sitting unduly. With those remarks, it seems to me that it might be appropriate, subject to the views of the chamber of course, that Senator Murray, who is the author of the first amendment, be invited—
—A famous phrase.
—This is not the American Constitution; this is the dreaded GST legislation. Of course any softening of that would be welcome, but the only way to deal with this legislation is to throw the lot out. Let us tend to the practical concerns of meeting our deadline. Subject to the view of the chamber, it might be an appropriate juncture at which to hear from Senator Murray, who is now, I 
 notice, ducking under his desk and now returning to his place. If he is in a position to move his amendment, perhaps we should move on to that.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator Cook has made some observations and has summarised some of the remarks I made earlier.
—I hope accurately.
—I am a bit loath to give a big tick, Senator Cook. I will look closely at what you said, but the general thrust is broadly in line with what I have stated before. These are the amendments of which I am aware. We think the package is a fair package. We hope we can convince the chamber of that particular issue. The government is ready to move its amendments. I understand, as you said, that the first amendment falls to Senator Murray. If he is ready to move his amendment, the government is very happy for him to take that step.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-28,"—It is seldom I have had such fanfare before commencing a debate on the detailed amendments before us. But we should be aware as we now enter debate on the actual amendments that there are nearly 300 amendments to `Peter's perfect package', of which the government have the most; and that will take some lengthy and passionate debate. But the purpose of amendments is always to improve bills. That I think is the prime role of the Senate after review—to improve legislation. The amendment I will move is on sheet 1369. On page 2 of the first bill, which is entitled A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998 —I say the first bill because, as you know, there are around 30 of them—I will move that the following be added:
It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act and associated laws for A New Tax System:
	 (a)	 be fairer than the Wholesales Sales Tax system they replace; and
	 (b)	 promote redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich.
You will note that this is the first of nearly 300 amendments because it appears on what is just about the first page. The government have entitled their bill `A bill for an act about 
 a goods and services tax to implement a new tax system and for related purposes'. There is absolutely no preamble and there is no object. I think the chamber should begin the detailed amendment stage of this committee stage of the bill by asking ourselves what on earth are we here for? What is this all about?
It is said that at least one-third of all the bills dealt with in the parliament are taxation bills. Taxation bills are designed to provide the revenues to provide the services that Australians legitimately require. But they are designed for much more than that. Taxation laws play a vital role in social, community and environmental equity goals. The absence of a preamble or a prologue or an object is notable because we should be addressing these bills with an eye to achieving a better outcome for the people of Australia.
I deliberately focused on two areas. The first area was that of wholesale sales tax and the second one concerned redistributional equity. The reason I started by focusing on wholesale sales tax was because it is the fundamental argument of the Labor Party, the official opposition, that we do not need to reform the indirect taxes of this country in this way because the wholesale sales tax system is adequate for its task. It is the fundamental argument of those who say that you need to replace the wholesale sales tax system that it is either in decline or it is broken, depending on the speaker, and that you need to quite radically change the indirect tax system to achieve much better economic outcomes.
Essentially, the wholesale sales tax is a narrowly based, regressive, indirect multiple rate tax which falls at a single level in the production and consumption process. The GST is a broadly based, regressive, indirect tax which falls at multiple levels but, because of the input credit system, ultimately has only one outcome at the consumption level. Those who argue against the tax on grounds of its regressivity have good arguments against indirect taxes per se. But we should always be reminded that the wholesale sales tax is in itself a regressive tax. The Australian Democrats for one have never understood why it is 
 appropriate to apply indirect taxes to goods but not to services.
 On the indirect tax side of things, the indirect revenue base, according to our analysis of the budget papers, is in decline. Indirect tax will have declined from 7.15 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 to 5.5 per cent. Sales tax has actually increased in that same period from 2.56 per cent to 2.59 per cent of GDP. Excise has fallen, principally because of the various changes made by governments to that, from 3.42 per cent to 2.50 per cent. In 1997-98 customs indirect taxes have fallen from 1.21 per cent to 0.67 per cent. Overall, the Australian Democrats have accepted that the wholesale sales tax base and indirect tax generally are in decline. The Labor Party have argued, `Well, that can be fixed quite easily by an adjustment in rates.'
We have argued that overall the government is right in its approach. We do not accept that the indirect tax system is broken, but it is certainly in decline. When you add the other economic benefits of a GST with regard to exports and greater economic efficiencies, it seems to us that it is, on balance, a more efficient tax for Australia. But the fact remains that it is a regressive tax. The definition of `regression' means that it falls hardest upon those least able to pay. It falls hardest on the poor and disadvantaged.
Whilst the wholesale sales tax is in itself regressive, so is the goods and services tax. It is because of that that the government feels obliged to provide income tax cuts and compensation to adjust for the impact of that regressivity on the poor and the disadvantaged and those groups who are potentially at risk because of the GST. We therefore need to look at what the bill is trying to achieve in terms of dealing with those at the lower end of our society, and here I move on to item (b) of my amendment.
From the 1950s to about 1973 the middle classes of Australia were built up. Their standard of living improved. With the advent of economic rationalism, a massive redistribution of wealth and of family income occurred in this society, and it has been to the detriment of the poorer in our society. The shift to the rich 10 per cent, to the elite in our soci 
 ety, has been very significant over the last 20 to 25 years under both governments. Economic rationalism is currently under assault, but in this package it is alive and well. The compensation for poor and disadvantaged people is mean, inadequate and will not last. The income tax cuts benefit the rich. The adjustments to tax scales merely claw back some of the losses that have occurred in this country as a result of bracket creep.
The Australia Institute has developed a measure called the genuine progress indicator, which mirrors work done internationally to measure the total sustainability and the total quality of life of nations, and the Australia Institute's measure of course is of Australians. It shows that since the advent of the economic rationalist movement in the early 1970s the quality of life and the actual wealth and the actual advancement of the poor and disadvantaged and lower middle classes in this society have deteriorated.
So you have your economic measures showing Australia growing and advancing economically and you have your social and wealth measures showing that there is a decline. Other writers such as John Ralston Saul have picked up this particular theme. In fact, I think he was brought here by the Evatt Foundation and, hopefully, as a result he will have some influence on that large body of economic rationalists that still live in the Labor Party.
The Australian Democrats believe that this package of bills has to be savagely amended to readjust the system back to a redistributional approach. In other words, that the load of the tax system, the load of the PAYE system, the load of bracket creep, the load of the tax cuts and advantages, and the load of the tax avoidance mechanisms should shift off the backs of the poor, off the backs of the disadvantaged, onto the rich. That is what a progressive tax system will deliver.
When you look at the combination of all these bills and the package they represent, the income tax cuts, in our view, are regressive because they reinforce the advantages which accrue to the wealthy in our society—the top 10 per cent. Incidentally, it is that top 10 per cent who dominate the boards of the com 
 panies that make all the political donations and who influence so much the political life of this country.
 The Australian Democrats believe that we need to enshrine in our tax system a redistributional ethos and that we need to restore ourselves to some of the equity which prevailed in Australia in the early 1970s. Unless we significantly alter this package on the income tax side, on the compensation side, on the GST side and on the Commonwealth-state relations side, then this package will remain fundamentally unfair and fundamentally disadvantageous to the poor, to the disadvantaged and to those who fall between the cracks of the income tax system and the social security system. And it will also damage the middle class which is so vital to the health and future of this nation. That is why I am putting this amendment on sheet 1369 before you. I move:

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-28,"—I move:
At the end of clause 1-4, add:
; and (c) promote ecologically sustainable development.
This freshly circulated amendment on sheet 1385 in my name is an amendment to Senator Murray's amendment in relation to what this tax package ought to be aiming for. It is a simple amendment. It simply adds an item (c) to clause 1-4 to `promote ecologically sustainable development'. I will quickly explain why I am doing this.
I will first of all take a selection of quotes from the Greens (WA) additional statement to the First report of the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System. In that statement I talked about the modelling that was not done in relation to environmental impacts. We have 
 not yet heard any response from Senator Kemp today as to whether or not we have any response at all from Senator Hill on whether or not this package has been considered for environmental assessment. The additional statement reads:
When questioned as to whether any kind of environmental impact analysis has been undertaken by Treasury—
So we are not even talking about getting to the environment minister; we are talking in this case about whether action ministers even looked at it as to whether it should be referred—
Mr Greg Smith, Executive Director of the Budget Group, claimed that it was up to another Department to do that kind of analysis.
It is interesting because, as I said, the action minister is the Treasury in this particular case and not the environment minister. So he said another department should do it. Mr Smith said in evidence:
I think essentially those are matters that are the portfolio responsibility of others. I think I have heard Senator Hill give answers along those lines, where he says that he and his portfolio are responsible for that type of work. Certainly, the Treasury cannot do all of those things.
Also contained in this additional statement is a quote from a statement that Senator Hill made on 30 September 1996:
. . . it is four years since the ""World Scientists Warning to Humanity"" was released. You will recall that this warning was signed by 1700 of the worlds leading scientists, including the majority of Nobel laureates in the sciences. The warning stated that:
	 "". . . many of our current practices put at serious risk the future that we wish for human society, . . . and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know"".
The message that I would leave with you today, is that we are well past the warnings, and we are well past the theoretical arguments. We are now into the most critical phase of all—action and implementation.
Well said, Senator Hill, I would have to say. But the point is that when push comes to shove and we are dealing with an issue that we cannot separate from its environmental impacts—that is, the way the tax system operates, the types of activities that are 
 rewarded, encouraged or discouraged—this government is failing in a major way with this particular package.
 I would also like to refer the committee to the statement made by my colleague from the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, and I to the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee inquiry into the GST and A New Tax System. In that conclusion we said:
Taxation can help move Australia's economy from old dirty and wasteful industries, which employ relatively few people, to new clean green job-rich industries. Instead of relying on coal, especially brown coal for electricity generation, we can invest in energy efficiency, wind and solar energy. Instead of woodchipping native forests, we can invest in processing existing plantations to meet our needs for building materials and wood fibre.
The Greens (WA) and the Australian Greens believe the Australian Government is missing a rare window of opportunity during this tax reform process. The Australian Government should follow the example provided by Britain and other European countries as illustrated by the following quote:
We said in our manifesto that what governments choose to tax sends clear signals about the economic activities they believe should be encouraged and those that should be discouraged. Just as work should be encouraged through the tax system, environmental pollution should be discouraged.
To that end, the Government will reform the tax system, so that we encourage growth that is environmentally sustainable. It will encourage the delivery of a more dynamic economy and cleaner environment, to the benefit of all.
The statement of intent establishes our position on the use of environmental taxes. It is backed, today, by a range of other announcements. Taken together, these measures demonstrate the Government's determination to place the environment at the centre of policy making.
This was not made by a radical speaker. It was made by the British Financial Secretary in July 1997.
Mature governments in the 1990s—at the end of this century—are saying that the signals to producers must reflect some of the costs to the community that result from the production of goods and services. For those people who believe that the market is all that matters, this means that the consumer has the opportunity of making wise choices with 
 some of those costs built in, so that we are not operating in a flawed market. But that is what this government seems to be saying is suitable—a flawed market which is giving the wrong signals. In fact, this package very much illustrates that point by making diesel cheaper and sending bankrupt the people who are producing refined oil from waste oil, who are actually cleaning up on our behalf. What a great message this is sending!
I urge honourable senators not simply to regard ecological sustainability as a side issue but to put it up front and realise that, unless we do so, we are going to be in deep trouble now and in the years ahead. I know that in his time as minister for the environment, Senator Faulkner suggested that in his opinion economic instruments had to be built into the way we dealt with the environment. Of course, from the point of view of the Greens (WA), it is a totally natural thing to keep those issues connected. If you separate justice, equity and environment issues from the economy, you will be left with a meaningless process where somehow the environment is seen to be something different and is ruled at all times by the economy. We will have no economy if we destroy our environment. We will have no quality of life. But what is more, we will not have jobs or an economy if we destroy our water and air systems. We must realise that everyone on earth has a responsibility to move towards repairing the damage that is impacting on our climate and our atmosphere.
I would like to think the amendment I have moved is self-explanatory. It is simply putting up a little message which says, `and sustainable development should be included in the way we produce, design and operate our tax system.' I would urge support for it from all senators in this place.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-04-28,"—The Australian Labor Party—the opposition here—will not support the amendment and we will not support the amendment to the amendment. We will not 
 support it for two basic and quite fundamental reasons. None of those reasons goes to the good intent of the movers, but they go to the nature of what they are trying to do. The good intentions of the movers are beyond question, in my view. But the nature of what they are trying to do is to amend a goods and services tax in the belief that you can make a GST fair.
We do not believe you can make a GST fair. A GST is a regressive tax. A GST taxes all Australians at the same rate irrespective of income, which means to say that poor Australians, proportionately, pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than do wealthy Australians. We do not think that is fair. That is a fundamental proposition for us. It is a proposition that the government recognises. The government has recognised that this is an unfair tax by introducing a package for compensation—a compensation package of tax cuts and compensation to people on welfare and pensions; by changes to offset the unfair nature of this tax.
Here lies the basic crux of the problem. The government says it will lock in a GST at 10 per cent. It has got a fancy mechanism for doing so with the states. Everyone in Australia knows that mechanism does not work because, while it looks good, when you examine it, all it will take is an act of this parliament to change it. Therefore, since it is not embedded in the Constitution, it can be changed by the will of parliament. It only lasts as a lock-in mechanism as long as a parliament allows it to. If a government gets a majority in the House of Representatives and in this chamber, it can change it. It is not locked in or safeguarded by any state legislation.
But let us leave that whole argument aside for the moment and say that the government recognises the unfairness of this package by saying that the 10 per cent GST will not increase and that they have locked it in—forget for the moment that is not true that it is locked in. But how do you lock in the compensation? You can lock in the tax, according to the government argument, but how do you lock in the compensation? How do you make the compensation last forever? 
 You cannot. Governments that come and go in this place will change the amount of tax cuts. They always do. Governments that come and go in this place will change the amount of pension entitlement and of benefit to welfare recipients. They always do.
So if you buy a GST and you even accept and believe the argument that the government has locked it in and it will never rise, that it will always just be 10 per cent into the next century and the century beyond, then you also have to have a gigantic leap of faith that the compensation to offset the regressive nature of this GST will equally go the distance. It will not. And, because it will not, I do not believe we would be doing this parliament a justice or doing the community of Australia a service by saying that this bill is meant to be fair. The intention of this amendment—and I do not question, as I have said, the honesty of the movers or the supporters of it in the Democrats and the Greens—is to insert in the introductory chapter of the GST legislation a provision which says:
It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act and associated laws for A New Tax System:
	 (a)	 be fairer than the Wholesales Sales Tax system they replace; and
	 (b)	 promote redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich.
In logic, one could argue that if you believed when we have completed the debate on the whole bill that the package as amended at the end of the process reflects these sentiments and, therefore, these sentiments stand as true sentiments, perhaps you then should insert this provision. We do not believe you can arrive at that position, but if you believe that, that would be the time to move this amendment. I do not think it is right to say that the GST is fairer than the current wholesale sales tax system—albeit that we in the Labor Party want to amend that as well. But I do not think that you can say, either, as an intention of this parliament that the content of these bills, if carried—and we will oppose their carriage—shifts the load of the taxation burden from the poor to the rich, because I do not think that is true.
—Not unless it is amended, it doesn't.
—I accept your interjection, Senator Murray. `Not if it is amended, it isn't,' I think is your interjection. I accept that is your view, but I began my remarks by saying that we in the Labor Party do not believe you can make this fair. Because, even if it were true—an illusory fact—that you could lock in the rate, you cannot guarantee that the compensation to offset the regressive nature of this package will last indefinitely. And, as a consequence, I do not think you can say in the bill that the intention of this parliament is to shift the burden of taxation to the rich away from the poor—which is an intention we would subscribe to as a principle, an ideal—when the act, as it is finally carried, if it is, does not in practical terms reflect that ideal. If the practical application does not deliver the ideal, then the view taken of this legislation will be that we got it wrong, and badly. I will be in that camp of argument, but if you are advocating this, I would be mindful of that view.
I come back to the fundamental point on which this debate turns, as far as the Labor Party is concerned. This is a GST. You have to believe you can make a GST fair to support this amendment. We do not believe you can. We have form on this. We looked at the GST in 1985. We looked at the whole tax system in 1985. Unlike this government, we brought down a report for public debate which canvassed a range of tax options and we came to the conclusion at the end of that public debate, culminating in a tax summit, that you could not make the GST fair, and we dropped the option. We have thoroughly examined this proposition. We did not—and I contrast this with what the government has done—ambush the electorate before the election with tax cuts and a goods and services tax. We did not distract attention from the devil in the detail that was not revealed until the Senate inquiry got stuck into examining exactly what the package contained. We did not rush this through and claim a mandate to legislate. We did not do that. We gave time for proper public debate.
Let me say a couple of other words as to why this package, in our view, is not fair. It arises from what we now know as a conse 
 quence of being able to examine this—within a relatively short space of time, but in considerable detail, nonetheless—by the Senate committee process. I remind the chamber that in that process we commissioned independent modellers. One would have thought—and it has been said many times here, but it is probably not widely understood in the broader community—that in bringing this tax package to the parliament the government would have done some modelling of its own. On the substantive question of what is the macro-economic effect of this tax package, the government did not do any modelling of its own. The modelling that was done was the modelling commissioned by the Senate through its Senate select committee. While the government might want to borrow selectively from modelling done by private sector modellers to justify its case, the only modelling that has been comprehensively done is by the Senate select committee.
What do we know from that modelling? Take one macro-economic indicator which the community of Australia is concerned about; take the indicator of employment. We are all worried about where our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, will get jobs in the future in this country. What does the modelling show on that subject? It shows that up to 120,000 jobs will be lost because of this package. It shows that a GST favours capital intensive, low employment industries over labour intensive industries. It shows that to those industry sectors in the mining area with very few people employed, with high-tech knowledge involved and with exports there may be some favouritism in terms of employment.
But it shows that jobs will be lost in those industry sectors that employ Australians, such as the tourism sector and the education export sector. Where have the jobs in the past come from and where do we expect them to come from in the future? We expect them to come from those sectors. The services sector will be hit to leg, to use a cricketing term, by the GST, and that is where the jobs growth is. About 81 per cent of Australians work in that sector. This bill, if it were law, would on that 
 macro-economic indicator militate against jobs growth there.
There is another element to the government's claim. It is important to expose this furphy because they only tell half the truth on this subject. They say, `At the end of the day you've got to believe it's in the national interest. It may mean pain for you and you may have to suffer a bit, but overall the country will be better off.' That is the story they run. In the Senate inquiry we went around sector by sector. If you add up all the pain, there is no national interest in this package. The government nonetheless has the view that it is in the national interest, that you have to make a sacrifice for Australia, and that that is what you are doing if you allow the wealthy to be taxed, on a percentage basis, less than the poor. The poor will be taxed more than the wealthy on a percentage basis. According to the government, that is the sacrifice we have to make for Australia. Most Australians don't agree with that.
The government's winning argument, so they think, is on export. They say that the GST will reduce input costs to exporters, and therefore the cost of Australian goods in foreign markets will be cheaper. If that was as far as the story went, they would have a case. The trouble with economics is that you can't look at it in such a compartmentalised and neat paradigm because economics has effect, counter-effect and implications beyond the wider view. The impact of what the government is saying—which they never say in public but which the Department of Treasury gave evidence to our inquiry about—is that, if that happens, the exchange rate will increase and Australian goods will be as expensive as they now are in foreign markets. Therefore, the so-called `pain' that the rest of us have to suffer in the national interest will be countermanded by the change in the exchange rate as the market does its work.
Do we hear that from the government? No, we don't. Why don't they tell us that? It is not convenient and it doesn't suit their case. But my point is that if you are claiming positive employment advantages out of this package, which would be one of the reasons why it would be useful, you have to answer 
 that question. The government has not. What we know from our investigations is the negative impact the package will have on employment.
What about growth in the economy? You can have growth in the economy, but jobless growth hardly serves the needs of the community. But is there to be jobless growth in the economy? The economists who did our modelling—one is the Prime Minister's preferred modeller—both concluded similarly, and that is that there is negligible economic impact in terms of economic growth.
I am almost out of time, so let me just summarise my position. If there is an opportunity, I will complete my remarks at a later stage. If you believe that you can make the GST fair, then you will vote for this amendment. If you believe, as we do, that you can't because you can't guarantee the compensation but you can guarantee the tax, then you will not vote for this amendment. That is fundamentally the reason why we will not proceed to vote for it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-04-28,"—Let me return the compliment to Senator Cook. I think he has made out a very eloquent case for the Labor Party. By and large we would agree with all of the things he said. However, we disagree with the fundamental point he is making. I made this point yesterday: you can disagree with the package because it is unfair, but you can still seek along the way to amend it. That is the point where we have a disagreement with the Labor Party about this tax package. In seeking to amend it, we are not talking only about a GST; we have a whole package with many elements in it and we want to get at each of those elements in turn and  move amendments to them.
We are doing this at the very beginning—trying to fix some objectives for any tax reform. I know that in a lineal sense it would be better to do this at the end if we achieve what we set out to do and what we set out to proclaim in those objectives. However, we are putting down at the very beginning a basis, a foundation, for what we want to achieve in the other amendments we are moving. That is where we have a fundamental disagreement 
 with you, Senator Cook, although certainly all of the content of your speech I would loudly proclaim as right. 	At the end of the day, as with the Labor Party and, I presume, the Greens, if we do not achieve that fairness, if the objective is not achieved through our other amendments, which is fundamental as far as the Democrats are concerned, then obviously whatever the title or the objectives might say, we too will be voting against the total package. I just wanted to give those indications at the very beginning.        
However, I want to point out a couple of things before I get to the substance of what I want to say. It is important to note where we are trying to place this amendment—right at the very beginning. It would be inserted after clause 1-3. You will note that clause 1-1 simply relates to the short title, clause 1-2 relates to the commencement date and 1-3 talks about Commonwealth-state financial relations.
One of the things which has plagued this country since Federation and still remains in this tax package is the problem that we only ever think about the division of power and resources between the states and the Commonwealth. This package says nothing about the citizens of Australia. It says nothing about fairness in terms of our obligation to those at the bottom of the heap in this country, just as the Constitution also says nothing very much about the rights and duties of citizens but talks about the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states.
Another problem with the whole tax package—and with legislation and the Constitution of this country—is that it only ever talks about the split-up of resources and power between two levels of government: the Commonwealth and the states. There is nothing in the title or in the preliminary introduction about local government. That is a problem. That is something else which the Democrats want to address in our amendment. So you can see that we have deliberately placed this amendment at the very beginning to try to lay a foundation for all the amendments that we want to move, but realising that, if we do not achieve those, we would certainly have to agree with Senator Cook 
 that an unfair package would certainly not be one which the Democrats would vote for.
I notice that my time is slipping away. I believe that I will make further comments in this debate, because we are dealing with a very critical issue. Let me pick up a couple of other points which illustrate what I am trying to say here. Senator Cook is right: as it stands, this package is not only unfair but also unjust. One of the issues which is very close to my heart is the effect of the package as it presently stands on rural and remote indigenous communities.
I will return to this matter, but I want to lay this further foundation. I believe that many of the changes to the tax system which are currently before the Senate will impact on Australia's indigenous people, many of whom already suffer significant disadvantage. This government likes to talk about `mutual obligation', but what it means by `mutual obligation' is that it will put further hurdles in the way of the poor and those who are the recipients of government pensions, et cetera. This government will make them jump over more hurdles to obtain the grudging charity that it is prepared to allow to trickle down to those at the bottom of the heap. That is what the government means by `mutual obligation'. Mutuality, to me, is always a two-way thing. But in the mind of this government, it is never two-way. It simply means more hurdles that will be placed in the way of those at the bottom of the heap which they will have to jump in order to access that grudging charity which this government will trickle down to them.
I want to illustrate this point not only from the tax package but also from other actions of this government. Let me talk for a moment about the loss of the egalitarian ideal which, in the last three years, has been a very significant loss indeed. Recently, Curtin University in Western Australia did research on notions of fairness and equality in Australian society. In its report on the research, the university claimed that the egalitarian Australian ideal of a fair go for all was being undermined by a belief that Aborigines and Asian migrants were getting special benefits and treatment. The main conclusion of the research was that 
 Australians no longer believed in the idea of a fair go.
That is a tragedy. That loss of belief in the Australian community is reinforced daily by the actions and rhetoric of this government. This research reinforces my belief that many Australians no longer see themselves as part of a community where all belong but as being in competition with others to determine who belongs and who does not. The loss of this egalitarian ideal has been reinforced not only by the current government but also by the prevailing ideology of market economics. In social, political and economic terms, the market defines society as a collection of competing individuals held together by self-interest. I believe this market definition of society is not merely inadequate; it is destructive of the meaning and essence of community.
By definition, a collection of competing individuals is made up of winners and losers. The winners are the true members of the community. Their very success determines their membership as a right. The losers exist at the edges of this kind of community. They have no rights. They belong to the community only in a secondary and inferior sense. They are permitted to exist by the good grace of the winners, who may offer them charity as long as they fulfil certain mutual obligations. They are to blame for the fact that they are losers. 
In the global market, the largest group of losers is the unemployed. Their plight is made worse by the attitude of the market, which declares them not only to be losers but to be worthless as well. In Australia, the current federal government's attitude to the unemployed reflects this attitude to an appalling degree. When we come back to this debate—because my time is about to expire—I will give you some very significant illustrations of that fact.
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-04-28,"—My colleagues in the Senate have in recent days raised enormously important questions in the public interest: questions of major tax fraud by Paul Keating, and questions of gifts to his piggery worth millions from the Commonwealth Bank.
Today I argue the case for an inquiry into the business dealings of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. In particular, I argue for the terms of reference of such an inquiry to be broad enough to encompass other dubious dealings involving Paul Keating and Warren Anderson, as well as the former Prime Minister's alleged use of fronts and options in other business transactions.
The 60 Minutes program, `The Keating millions', revealed how two Keating associates, property developer Warren Anderson and `Mr Fixit business broker', John Benson, were instrumental in putting together the deal to sell Keating's share of the piggery to the Indonesians. 60 Minutes disclosed that Anderson and Benson were both in Indonesia in October 1993 at the same time as Mr Keating, and that their target was William Soeryadjaya.
A book released last week raises extraordinarily important questions about the national interest. In Asian Eclipse—Exposing the Dark Side of Business in Asia, author Michael Backman traces how the Soeryadjaya family business fortunes improved markedly following their purchase of Keating's piggery. Backman claims:
The Soeryadjayas possibly hoped that their taking Keating's troublesome piggery investment off his hands would help to improve their standing with Soeharto in the wake of the Astra-Summa debacle. There was no doubt that a link with the Australian Prime Minister wouldn't do the family any harm.
Last year the Sydney Morning Herald  first told the story of how an Indonesian businessman, William Soeryadjaya, agreed to pay Mr Keating $US6 million for his share of the piggery. In an extraordinary attack on Senator Robert Hill, Keating denied a charge which had never been made and denied any involvement by President Suharto in the piggery deal.
The new facts raise the brutally simple proposition that the deal which was put to the 
 Indonesian businessman was, `If you buy Keating, he can sell Suharto on you.' Keating's relationship with Suharto was so close, he had taken to calling him `bapak' or father. Even if Keating never fixed anything with Suharto, under such a deal he would have become appallingly compromised—no longer his own man; no longer Australia's man—and beholden to curry favour with a foreign head of state for $10 million. And not just any head of state: one where crucial issues of Australia's future were involved.
Backman tells how a consortium headed by a Soeryadjaya company was subsequently awarded a fixed telephone line concession on part of Java, noting:
. . . for the Soeryadjayas, it marked a return to big business.
The unmistakable implication is that the Soeryadjayas bought out Keating's piggery share in return for influence peddling by the former Prime Minister with President Suharto on their behalf. On the 7.30 Report  in July 1998, Keating himself said:
. . . Mr Soeryadjaya, was definitely not part of any crony structure with President Suharto. He'd been on the outer, as anyone who knows about Indonesia knows.
But he was not on the outer after he bought Keating's piggery interests. It was Benson and Anderson who set up the deal with the Soeryadjayas on Keating's behalf, while Keating lied to parliament by saying that he had disposed of his piggery interests to his partner, Al Constantinidis. This was not the first time that Warren Anderson and John Benson had been involved in business moves involving Keating and Indonesian interests.
In 1992 Anderson and Benson hatched a scheme to get Australian foreign aid for a group of retired Indonesian generals to buy cattle from Anderson's cattle stations in northern Australia. Anderson and his partners, the Bakrie brothers, planned to build small feedlots for the resultant steers, while the small farmers would retain heifers for breeding. Anderson's property, Tipperary, was to provide Australian breeding cattle and farming expertise. The scheme needed about $130 million in funding to provide 30,000 Brahmans a year for five years. But the request for 
 Australian foreign aid came not from Anderson or Benson but from an Indonesian charitable foundation, the Yayasan Serangan Umum 1 Maret 1949.
On 22 August 1992 the foundation's chairman wrote a letter titled `Aid to Indonesia' to the Hon. Laurie Brereton, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. The letter introduced the foundation, saying it aimed to:
. . . contribute to the living standard of the Indonesian people, especially the rural population.
It said that the foundation wished to fulfil President Suharto's recent diktat to `try various ways to improve the welfare of our farmers' by increasing `the quality and quantity of breeding cattle in Indonesia'. A copy of this letter clearly shows two fax markings: one is of John Benson and is dated 25 August 1992, three days after the date of the actual letter; the other is Warren Anderson's Tipperary station. I seek leave to table this document.
Leave not granted.
—Not surprisingly, leave is not granted—shock, horror! Brereton replied to the Yayasan in October 1992, saying the cattle breeding plan was `of merit' and suggesting that it would get `greater impetus' if raised at the inaugural Indonesia-Australia ministerial forum being held in Jakarta in November 1992. But how could Mr Brereton know the proposal was of merit? Indeed, the Yayasan Serangan Umum 1 Maret 1949 is far from being a benevolent foundation. In fact, it was recently exposed as one of those tax exempt foundations with hidden wealth, run by Suharto's military cronies, with Suharto himself as a patron.
Most significantly, a copy of Brereton's reply to this foundation shows at least two fax markings. One is from Brereton's electorate office on 30 October 1992 and the other shows that, after Benson received the letter from Brereton, he on-faxed it the same day. Is this what one would expect? Would it be normal for such a reply—to applicants for Australian foreign aid funding—to be faxed the same day to an Anderson associate? Quite frankly, it smacks of a conspiracy and, once 
 again, the intended beneficiary was Warren Anderson. I seek leave to table this document.
Leave not granted.
—So leave has been denied yet again because of the sensitivity.
Then there was Keating's involvement. The proposal was raised at a meeting between Keating and Suharto in Jakarta in 1992. According to the Indonesian Department of Agriculture, Keating and the head of the Bakrie Group also discussed it in Canberra in August 1992. It was raised again at a meeting between Suharto and Keating in 1994. The energy which was put into pushing this cattle breeding proposal was quite extraordinary. But in all that has emerged about the `cattle-aid' deal, there is no record that Keating or, for that matter, Brereton, ever disclosed that Warren Anderson would be the beneficiary. Once again, the taxpayer, who was expected to foot the bill for this $130-million project, was treated with contempt.
After three discussions involving Keating's office, the cattle-aid proposal was rejected by AusAID, but by this stage Anderson had sold his interest in the cattle stations and feedlots associated with them. AusAID concluded that the project would not make money, would not survive and would not lead to other sustainable development. `The proposal and any variant of it should be rejected,' AusAID recommended. The documentary evidence shows that for three years Keating and Brereton tried to secure Australian aid funding for an uneconomic project which would have benefited Anderson. In an AusAID study, Benson is identified as a consultant to Yayasan. He has now resurfaced as an associate of Paul Keating. In my view, the terms of reference of any inquiry into Paul Keating's business dealings should be broad enough to include `cattle-aid'. That the project never finally got off the ground is totally and utterly immaterial; there was corrupt intent and corrupt manipulation of the bureaucratic and ministerial processes.
Of course, this was not Keating's first dealing with Anderson. Consider the Northern Territory Parliament House and the State Square precinct. In 1988, when then Treasurer Keating was telling the states and territories 
 to slash borrowings, the Northern Territory was given a 26 per cent boost to its global borrowing limit so that State Square could go ahead. What is scandalous about this affair is that Keating pushed the proposal through cabinet and the Loan Council, Anderson benefited to the tune of $8 million in project management fees and Keating concealed the benefit to Anderson and publicly lied about the Loan Council decision. The decision to raise the Northern Territory's borrowing limit to allow for construction of State Square was agreed first by cabinet, on Mr Keating's submission, and then by the Loan Council, chaired by Mr Keating. In other words, Keating shepherded the proposal through all the official forums. He was pivotal to its success.
Anderson received $8 million in project management fees, but Keating failed to disclose that Anderson would benefit, either at cabinet or at the Loan Council—or, for that matter, at the meeting of the Expenditure Review Committee which also considered the issue. This was despite the fact that his friendship with Warren Anderson had been a matter of public notoriety for years and despite the fact that he had often been a recipient of Anderson's hospitality. Anderson gave Keating two free trips to the Northern Territory in corporate jets, which Keating did not declare, in contravention of the Hawke government guidelines.
But not only did Keating conceal the benefit to Anderson, he lied publicly about the Loan Council decision. Keating's press release announcing the Loan Council outcome categorically stated that five states and the Northern Territory had agreed to `significant reductions' in their authorities' global borrowing limits. However, appended to the statement were figures which, if one read the fine print, showed that the Northern Territory got a 26 per cent increase. This was utterly misleading. In October 1995, the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, called for an inquiry into this affair. He said Mr Keating should explain why he failed to disclose that Warren Anderson brought the possibility of developments in the Northern Territory to Keating's attention, conceived the State 
 Square project, advocated that development and stood to benefit from the project. The fact is that Anderson had most to gain from Keating's intervention and could not have built this project without this intervention. Not only did Keating secure this benefit for his mate but also he once again treated both the parliament's and ministerial disclosure requirements—not to mention the public—with contempt.
I believe that the terms of reference of any inquiry into former Prime Minister Keating's business dealings should also be wide enough to include this sordid episode. Both `cattle-aid' and State Square involved attempts by Mr Keating and his government to enrich Warren Anderson who, by 1991, had fallen on hard times. Their association goes back a long way. Their relationship, their shared interest in antiques, particularly clocks, goes back at least 15 years. In the landmark article `The Keating-Anderson Connection', in 1986, the National Times reported how Keating and Anderson traded antiques with one another, particularly antique clocks. The article contrasted statements by Mr Keating that the sorts of clocks he owned could be worth up to $200,000 with estimates by independent dealers suggesting values ranging from $1,650 to $50,000. The short take-out was that Keating was selling antiques to Anderson at inflated prices to launder money from Anderson. Significantly, Keating neither denied nor sued over this story.
Another aspect of Paul Keating's financial affairs which should be examined is his use of front companies and other devices to conceal assets. The second 60 Minutes program on `The Keating Millions' detailed how Keating had Maria Constantinidis front for him in a property purchase on the Hawkesbury in 1990. That, according to Maria Constantinidis, was because he did not want the public to be aware that he was a half-owner. Maria Constantinidis said that Keating initially put in $175,000 of his share of the deposit, stamp duty and legal fees, but soon welshed on the deal. Now Mr Keating says the money was a loan, but this beggars belief. Needless to say, he did not disclose this on the pecuniary interest register at the time 
 either. Keating also used an option agreement to hide his continuing interest in the piggery affair after he disposed of his half share to his partner Al Constantinidis.
In the time that I have left, I think it is important that I go through some of the things that I suggest should be included in the terms of reference. I believe a judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission should inquire into whether there was any impropriety or illegality involved in the purchase, conduct, sale and taxation arrangements of companies in which the former Prime Minister was a shareholder or in which he was involved; whether Paul Keating, either as Prime Minister, Treasurer or backbencher, improperly used either his position or government resources for personal benefit for the improper use of other companies or individuals; and whether the Commonwealth Bank acted improperly in relation to its dealings with Mr Keating and companies or individuals with which he was involved.

QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE
SENATOR STOTT DESPOJA- 27 APRIL 1999
GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS
SENATOR STOTT DESPOJA—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. I am glad to hear that he is concerned that unsafe genetically modified products would not be available for sale in Australia. But I reiterate my question in relation to international standards. I would like the minister to confirm for us whether or not acceptance or approval of a genetically modified food overseas will be accepted as the sole basis for approval for sale of that product in Australia. Could you clarify if that will be specifically one of the criteria that will be allowed under the A18 standards that will be put forward by ANZFA?
SENATOR HERRON—I can confirm that all foods produced using gene technology must undergo ANZFA's own safety assessment before they can be approved for sale in Australia. This will be required by the new standard for genetically modified foods (Standard A18).
ANZFA's own safety assessment is rigorous and takes into account not only the dietary intake, the nutritional composition, and the potential toxicity and allergenicity of the food, but also considers the nature of the genes introduced and their function and effect in the modified organism. 

Clearly, ANZFA would be in breach of good practice if it did not take into account the approval status overseas of a food but such information is not of ultimate significance to ANZFA's own safety assessment.
In order to fully outline the criteria which ANZFA employs in assessing the safety of genetically modified foods, I am arranging for a copy of the Guidelines for the safety assessment of foods to be included in Standard A18  to be sent to the Senator's office.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Foods</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Madam Deputy President, this is a very important issue. Let me give some history to outline why it is such a matter of public importance that it is worthy of debate in the Senate today. The ACCC was asked by the Labor opposition to consider the Howard government's advertising campaign on the 
 private health insurance rebate, in the light of the ACCC's responsibility to protect consumers from misleading or deceptive advertising. In this particular campaign the government has spent some $7 million on TV, radio and press advertisements, and on poster and billboard advertising with the headline `Private health cover will now be 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians.' It has done that to promote a $1.7 billion rebate policy.
The ACCC has found that the government's advertisements were likely to mislead the public because the claim that health insurance will be 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians was not based on fact. It is not true that private health cover will now be 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians, as the headline in the government advertisements said. It is not a fact because there are significant numbers of Australians who will not get a cut of 30 per cent in their health insurance premiums; for instance, those already eligible for the earlier failure of a policy, those who are insured with an organisation which is not a registered health benefits organisation, or those who are not eligible to receive Medicare benefits. So this was false, deceptive and misleading advertising and has been found to be such by the ACCC.
The Howard government just ignored these simple facts in developing this advertising program and it has been exposed; it has been found out by the ACCC to be airing advertisements deliberately designed to mislead the Australian public. In simple terms, what has happened here is that the independent watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has found the government guilty of misleading and deceiving the Australian people. This really puts the Howard government in the same league as shonky used-car dealers who consciously put to air misleading advertisements which are aimed at deceiving consumers.
The ACCC has the legislative responsibility to protect the Australian community from shonks and, clearly, there is an immediate and real need for Australians to be protected from the Howard government advertisements. It is a point that has been made consistently by the opposition. Let me be clear about the 
 opposition's position on this. We believe the ACCC should be given the power to scrutinise, decide upon and, where necessary, remove federal government advertisements which mislead and deceive the Australian public, who of course are the consumers of federal government services. We say that the Australian public deserve to be protected from deceptive advertisements like the ones that were run here in relation to private health insurance.
The Australian public also deserve to know why the checks and balances supposedly in place at present did not operate to protect Australians from the deceptive private health insurance advertisements. Why, for instance, didn't the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications twig to the fact that these advertisements were peddling mistruths and distortions? I suppose, being a Howard government ministerial committee, you would not expect accuracy to be their forte. Why didn't Senator Ellison, who chairs the committee, twig?
Why didn't the communications unit in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet wake up to this fact and advise the government that these advertisements were misleading and therefore a breach of the Trade Practices Act? Or did someone wake up? Did the government just ignore the advice of its bureaucrats? We do not really know. Why didn't the health department, which was paying for the advertisements, advise that these ads did not conform to the real effect of the policy on the community? Again, perhaps it did and the government ignored the advice.
At least we heard from Senator Herron in question time yesterday that the government is not blaming the health department or its secretary for this breach of the Trade Practices Act. We can only assume that he was not misleading the Senate in question time yesterday, but the question remains an important one. Who is to blame for these deceptive advertisements going to air? Who is stepping up and taking responsibility for these shonky ads going to air?
We wonder if the responsibility does not, at the end of the day, lie with the minister who actually authorised the advertisements and 
 who is named in every single advertisement that is published. Will that minister take responsibility for these misleading advertisements? Did he check the advertisements out? If he did, how did he do it and who did he do it with? I think, on all of the historical evidence of the nonacceptance of ministerial responsibility in the Howard government, you would expect the minister—Senator Ellison—and other ministers to welsh on their responsibility. Proper ministerial responsibility in the Howard government has, I think, gone the way of the tradition of federal governments telling the truth in advertising. Of course, this government has an awful lot of form when it comes to shonky advertising. It has got bucket loads of form.
Who can forget the notorious abuse and misuse of $20 million of taxpayers' money, on the eve of the last federal election, to flog the GST tax proposal and the tax policy that the government was taking to the election—not an operating program of government but just an election policy where the advertising was funded by Commonwealth taxpayers? Who can forget that the Howard government spent at least $37.3 million on advertising from June 1998 to the October election? That was an unprecedented level of advertising in the Commonwealth of Australia in the lead-up to an election. Who can forget that it was only focus groups that killed off the divisive Wik ads which the Prime Minister wanted to publish in all daily newspapers on Australia Day last year?
It does not surprise me that Dr Wooldridge and Senator Ellison have been caught red-handed by the ACCC writing porkies on billboards and producing shonky ads.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-04-28,"—I note that the issue now before us is a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Faulkner and which he has obviously scribed. I am concerned about the points that Senator Faulkner has just made in support of his proposal. By way of introduction, my initial 
 comment is that this debate is more about sour grapes on the part of the Australian Labor Party than any real attempt to improve the lot of average Australian families or the country as a whole.
This is where Labor stand in total contrast to the government. At the basest level, Labor have nothing of any worth to offer—no vision, no plan, and the voters of Australia told them as much at the polls last year. Very obviously, the Labor Party are out of touch with what the electorate is saying, particularly on issues of health. In the motion that is before us today, you can only go to those base motives of greed and envy which underpin so much of Labor Party debate when it comes to effective economic changes. Nothing highlights this better than their complete opposition to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate initiative in the Senate late last year—we should remember those debates and what was going on at that time—and now their total opposition to the government's new tax system legislation which is currently before the Senate.
Senator Faulkner's motion is based on an exchange of letters between the ALP member, Kelvin Thomson, and Professor Alan Fels of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Mr Thomson wrote to Professor Fels on 2 February this year, with Professor Fels replying on 6 April. Seventeen days later on 23 April, the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, fax-streamed both letters out to the media. Yesterday Senator Faulkner asked a question of Senator Ellison about this, to which Senator Ellison gave a clear and comprehensive answer. And now here we are today rehashing the rehashed.
Labor has been trying for the past week to get this issue up, and every effort has failed. This is old news and the bottom line is that there is nothing to it. Very obviously, the Labor Party is in a mood of distraction. The principal debate that is before us at the moment that is in the eyes, the ears, and the consideration of all Australians is the tax reform debate, where the Labor Party is obviously out of step and totally embarrassed. For that reason, it is trying any tactic to get 
 away from concentrating on the real issue of the day.
Yesterday Senator Ellison rejected Senator Faulkner's allegation that the government's advertising of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate was misleading and noted that the ACCC took no action in relation to the advertising. It is important to note that the ACCC, whilst it expressed concern about parts of the advertising campaign, did not find it necessary to take action over these concerns. No-one who was receiving the PHIS will be worse off under the new scheme. The majority of PHIIS recipients will be better off, because they will now receive a full 30 per cent rebate, whereas under the previous scheme it was much smaller. And mass advertising does not contain the level of detail that some people would wish. The claims that $7 million worth of taxpayers' money has been wasted on halted rebate advertising are totally false. The entire budget for the promotion of the rebate is around $7 million, which is less than one half of a per cent of the total private health insurance rebate program.
Of course the Labor Party's bantering does not focus on the reason for this advertising—and that is to advise people of their entitlement to a 30 per cent rebate, should they have private health insurance or be looking to take it out. This government is committed to maintaining a balance between the public and private health sector so that Australians have a choice when it comes to health care. We are committed to ensuring that the public health sector is complemented by a private sector that is fair, affordable, customer friendly and good value for money. To this end, we introduced the 30 per cent rebate initiative. The rebate is available to all Australians with Medicare eligibility who have an appropriate public health insurance policy provided by a registered health fund. It can be received as a premium reduction through a private health fund.
The rebate reduces the cost of health insurance premiums by 30 per cent, regardless of a person's income, the type of membership—whether it is hospital, ancillary or combined cover—or the level of cover. For example, a family with private health insurance contribu 
 tions of $2,000 will be entitled to a rebate of $600. This is what the Labor Party is fundamentally opposed to: cash in the pockets of Australian families who go to the trouble of taking out private health insurance.
But we probably should not be surprised at their attitude. They ran government for 13 years with exactly the same attitude and baseless bias against private health insurance and a balanced health care sector.	Labor's time in government was characterised by a series of cost shifting policies aimed squarely at private funds. Between 1984 and 1988 Labor phased out a $220 million program for health fund members spending long periods of time in hospital. In 1986 Labor removed a private bed day subsidy paid when patients were in private hospitals—today worth $235 million. And in 1987 Labor cut the Medicare benefit for medical services provided to private patients from 85 per cent to 75 per cent, forcing funds to pay the extra 10 per cent gap.
The compounding effect of these policies was of course to force premiums up and force members out—ultimately placing more pressure on the public health sector and giving us a system very much like the one this government inherited in 1996.
Of course, the great irony we are now faced with is the Labor Party's efforts to block government policies designed to reverse the damage Labor caused while in government. And we should not forget the 13 years of Labor Party administration and the fact that when this government came to office it inherited a dreadful economic legacy. Labor had mauled and abused the economy and undermined the security of all Australians. Labor is now expressing nothing more than what it  has in its guilt file, and we have to constantly cover Labor's legacy. Labor accepted no blame or responsibility for any of the issues that were covered. The whole issue goes very fundamentally to the principles of the Commonwealth-state health agreements and the need for capital that must flow properly through the system and must be available, whether it is in the private or public sector. We have increased the range of aged 
 care and health services to people living in rural and remote Australia.
It is important that we dwell on a broader picture than Labor would want us to focus on in this particular debate. On a broader level, the government is just as committed to improving health outcomes for all Australians, particularly those living in rural and remote areas and indigenous Australians. At the last election we made a series of commitments to maintain and strengthen the public hospital system and the private health sector. The government is also committed to ensuring that health resources are used effectively. In doing this, we are taking action to improve links across acute health care, primary health care, residential care and community care. The coordinated care trials are a great example of how this could be done, and you will, of course, have noted the Prime Minister's recent commitment to setting aside an additional $25 million in this area. We are also addressing major conditions such as asthma and diabetes and are building on our achievements in population health in areas such as immunisation, HIV-AIDS and tobacco—areas that need attention. These initiatives will ensure that Australia remains one of the healthiest nations in the world.
Labor's record on advertising spending is not much better than its health care record, and I am sure that Senator Knowles will concentrate on this in her contribution to the debate. I challenge everyone to look at the areas where there are very important new challenges.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-04-28,"—Unlike Senator Tambling, I do think this is an important public policy debate, and I think a lot of Australians agree with me, because a lot of Australians have found that the information they have been provided with, at great cost to themselves, through the government's advertising campaign is not accurate. The ACCC, after complaints from Australian citizens, has found that the government's campaign has been misleading.
What we heard from Senator Tambling today was a load of waffle about the Labor government's record on this, that and any 
 thing, but the one thing that people listening to the debate will notice is that he never actually addressed the issue. This government spent $7 million of taxpayers' money promoting this claim: `Private health cover will now be 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians.' They spent $7 million of your and my money saying that through all sorts of TV, radio, newspaper and billboard advertisements. What the ACCC has found is that that is not true. Private health cover will not be 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians. It is clearly and demonstrably not true, and what is interesting is that in Senator Tambling's response today he never once claimed that it was. He never once stood up and said, `These ads we put in the paper were true. We stand by them.' Did he say that? No, he did not, because the government will not.
Senator Herron and Senator Kemp, to their credit, have refused to stand by that claim in the Senate because they know that it is not true. They knew it was not true long before the ACCC told them it was not true. One of the key issues here is that the government knew it was not true the day they lodged the first ad. It was not when the ACCC brought it to their attention that they knew; they knew from the start that they were misleading the Australian public. They were telling a giant porky. They were misleading the Australian public deliberately and knowingly. That is the important issue. It is interesting to note that Senator Herron and Senator Kemp tried to find some soft words in expressing this, but they basically pleaded guilty. They admitted that, yes, the ads were misleading and people were confused and they got the wrong information from them.
But Senator Ellison gave a quite different response yesterday. He had two lines of defence. I will come to why I think this is critical in a minute. Senator Tambling used his first line again today. Senator Ellison said, `There was no action by the ACCC, therefore it is not a problem, it is okay. They didn't say we had to do anything about it.' There are two reasons why that is the case. One is that the government assured the ACCC that the campaign had ceased, that it was over and it was too late to do anything about it. The 
 second is that the ACCC have no jurisdiction over the government's advertising campaign. They had no ability to take action. So Senator Ellison's first line of defence—to say, `They did not prosecute us and therefore we are not guilty'—is a nonsense. It is a typical lawyer's argument. He knows the ACCC did not have any jurisdiction and were not able to take any action. So that is no defence. The other interesting line Senator Ellison used—I quote him from yesterday's Hansard—was:
I authorised those advertisements and, when I authorised them, they were certainly not misleading.
If they are misleading now, they must have been misleading then, because nothing has changed. So I do not know what he is trying to say. But it is interesting to note that Senator Ellison has a different line from the other ministers in this chamber. The only reason I can find to justify that is that he is the one who authorised them. Every advertisement that went into the newspapers and every ad that appeared on TV was authorised by C. Ellison for the Commonwealth government. He is the one with ministerial responsibility, it seems, for placing these ads. He is responsible for the accuracy and veracity of these ads. He said, using your money, that private health cover will now be 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians.
Neither he nor Senator Tambling will defend that position now because it was not true when the ads were placed and it is not true now. What is more, they knew from the start that it was not true. They deliberately misled the public to try and gain political advantage. You expect a bit of that in political advertising. Parties stress things that best suit them. That is part of the game. But this is Commonwealth advertising with Commonwealth funds. The taxpayers of Australia have funded a misleading political argument that those opposite cannot defend, and it is interesting to note will not now defend, because it was clearly misleading and false.
There are two parts of the claim that were central to the government's advertising campaign that are clearly false. The first was that private health cover will be 30 per cent cheaper when for over 2.4 million Australians 
 with private health insurance it was not going to be 30 per cent cheaper and for many it was not cheaper at all. The second was that it was for all Australians when clearly it only affected those on higher incomes as claimed. We have a situation where the government had a previous private health insurance scheme called PHIS, which already subsidised families and couples up to a maximum of $450 per annum. That had been largely a failure. In using it the government had been unable to stop the decline in private health insurance numbers, so they replaced it with this rebate. But the effect of that was that only those not currently eligible for PHIIS benefited to the tune of 30 per cent. Anybody who was currently eligible for PHIIS got a lot less than 30 per cent, because they were already receiving some form of subsidy.
It is not like we are arguing about a few people on the margin here. It is not like we are arguing about a couple of hundred people who might have been misled. These were 2.4 million Australians—on the government's own figures—who were eligible for the PHIS subsidy. People who were single on less than $35,000 a year or families on less than $70,000 were not going to get 30 per cent cheaper health cover. The government knew that.
The Secretary to the Department of Health and Aged Care admitted that in the inquiry into the bill in December last year. In giving evidence to Senator Harradine and me, he conceded that those already eligible for PHIS would not get 30 per cent cheaper health cover. So the government, the ministers in this place, have got that advice from the department—it was quite clear—and Senator Ellison knew because he was the one who took the PHIIS legislation through this parliament. Senator Ellison was well aware that that legislation already provided subsidised cover, so he knew when he authorised these ads.
—Senator Tambling did the legislation.
—The PHIIS legislation, not the rebate, Senator Knowles.
—Oh, sorry.
—The PHIIS legislation in the last parliament was taken through the committee stage by Senator Ellison, so he had personal knowledge that what he was signing off was not true. The department advised the government, the ministers had personal knowledge that the claims they made in the ads—paid for by you, me and the other taxpayers of Australia—were wrong.
Do we get an apology? No. Do we get any sign that they are going to retract these claims or that they are going to clarify the information? No. Government ministers are very keen to rush into the courts to clear their names when there is any suggestion that the public might have been misled about them. We know Senator Alston and Ministers Abbott and Costello have all been to the courts seeking to correct the record. But when the government are found out wasting $7 million of taxpayers' money and misleading their own constituents, we do not get any apology or campaign advising of the mistake. We do not get any apology. We do not get the treatment that the used-car dealer or anyone else gets—having to put an ad in the next day saying, `Sorry, we misled you. Our claims were not correct. This is the correction.' The standards the government insist that we apply to everybody else are not applied to themselves. The government are above the law and they are above the normal courtesies that should be applied. They have one standard for themselves and one standard for the rest of us.
The other issue I want to touch on is that the department assured me the other day when I questioned them on this matter at an inquiry into the  Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  that they had, as a result of the ACCC's advice to the government, not only ceased to run their advertising campaign but advised private health insurance companies in a circular that they should desist from making the claims that the government had made. Of course all the health insurance funds had copied the very claim that the health department and the government had made and had used in their advertising, claiming that the insurance was now 30 per cent cheaper.
The department told me that they were monitoring advertising to make sure that people were not continuing to be misled by advertisements. But in our local paper, the West Australian, of Wednesday, 21 April we had an advert from SGIO Health claiming, `SGIO Health premiums are now 30 per cent lower.' So as late as 21 April private health insurance companies were still misleading the Australian public about the price of health insurance, still responding to the government's lead in misleading the Australian public, and advertising quite misleadingly that health insurance premiums are going to be 30 per cent lower for all Australians. The government have to account for this. It is an important public policy matter. They have misused public funds and they have misused them knowingly.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-04-28,"—I rise today to talk on this matter of alleged false advertising. It is just breathtaking, isn't it? This is coming from a bunch of people over the other side who were the spendthrifts of the Australian people when they were in government. Over 13 years they spent a whopping $675 million of taxpayers' money on advertising. Here they are today quibbling about $7 million, and Senator Chris Evans is walking out of this chamber without even listening to a response to the wild and stupid allegations that he has just made.
Let me just go through some of those things and I will then come to the substantive matter that is before the chamber today, and that is whether or not the ACCC said that the advertisement that is being referred to today was actually false. But I just want to give some background. As I say, over a 13-year period the Hawke and Keating governments spent more than $675 million of taxpayers' money on communications. In the last six years of their office they had 350 advertising campaigns. This expenditure included $9 million promoting Working Nation and that campaign just happened to run right up to the point where the 1996 election campaign was called. So anyone who tries to say that was not a politically motivated campaign really does have to look at the modus operandi of the Labor Party.
But the most interesting one of course—one of the most interesting ones; I should not categorise them in such a way—was the $7 million spent in 1992 and 1993 on the superannuation guarantee campaign. That was a real corker and those opposite would clearly remember the ads that were run at that time. But the most interesting facet of those ads was that the Auditor-General, on page 36 of audit report No. 30 1994-95, when referring to one of the ads, said `in the second breach of the Advertising Code of Ethics, the Advertising Standards Council ruled that another superannuation guarantee print advertisement was misleading and deceptive'. Did we hear the Labor Party talking about any of that? No, we did not. But this is the Auditor-General's report and it found that there were two breaches. Yet the righteous mob over there are alleging that the ACCC has actually ruled on an advertisement in a way in which it has not ruled.
So we go to the substance of exactly what they are saying, that the advertisement was wrong. Senator Evans has just said that no-one will stand up for the advertisements as being accurate. I am here to tell him that I will stand up for those advertisements and say that they were accurate. But what they cannot understand over there is that the advertisements were advertising a scheme which replaced another scheme. I might add also that the people who have instigated this debate have voted against every single initiative to increase the membership of private health insurance schemes. Both PHIS and the 30 per cent rebate scheme have been voted against by the Labor opposition. So it is not in their interest to recall the details accurately. But it is worth remembering that PHIS—known as the Private Health Insurance Scheme—ceased being in existence on 31 December 1998 and the new scheme took over on 1 January 1999. So there was no scheme come 1 January 1999. The previous scheme had finished. Therefore, premiums went back to where they were prior to PHIS. So to advertise that the premiums would be 30 per cent cheaper is accurate, and I will stand by those advertisements to the end.
It is absolutely and utterly improper yet again of the Labor Party to try to suggest that 
 this is one scheme on top of another. One scheme lapsed, the other scheme took over. There was no overlap whatsoever. But it needs to be stated in crystal clear terms what the ACCC has actually said, because clearly they have not bothered to address that side of this debate while asserting that the ACCC has said and done various things. The ACCC has expressed concern that some individuals may not realise that the private health insurance 30 per cent rebate was not a further reduction on premiums of members who have already been in receipt of PHIS. The ACCC has expressed concern that members of non-registered health funds may believe that they are entitled to the rebate whereas only members of registered health funds are eligible.
The question I have for the opposition is: why has the ACCC found it not necessary to take action over these concerns—unlike what the Auditor-General did to the Labor Party? The reason is that if people have a confusion about it then it is the right, the responsibility and the role of government, combined with the funds, to let people know the accuracy of it. To that extent, a component of this $7 million that has been spent has been $1.6 million on print material and the television commercials. Surely the Labor Party, which are the big spender of all time of taxpayers' money on advertising campaigns, should not say that that money should be spent in order to inform people. The fact that they want to preside over an ever declining membership of private health insurance schemes and that they want to see a lengthening of hospital waiting queues is altogether another story. But at least come in here and tell the truth about what the ACCC has said and what the ACCC has done or, more importantly in this case, not done.
Besides the television and radio advertising campaign, the government has supplied to health funds and Medicare offices comprehensive information in the form of an information kit, brochures and fact sheets. To try to avoid any confusion whatsoever for members, the government established a federal government 30 per cent rebate information line available for anyone to call. In light of the ACCC concerns that there might be some misunderstanding about the way in which the legislation would operate, the government has 
 written to all health funds outlining the position of the ACCC and advising that health funds must make it clear that the rebate replaces PHIS and therefore the 30 per cent rebate is based on listed premiums and not the premiums that were being charged to individuals who were benefiting from PHIS.
But, no, we have this ongoing misrepresentation. Why have Senator Evans and Senator Faulkner come in here today to try to suggest—or state, to be more accurate—that this policy is in addition to the other policy? One replaces the other. Clearly, they are simply exaggerating the case for their own means. And they are the mob who spent $10 million in 1995 on the superannuation community education campaign and who paid $2.8 million between 1983 and 1996 to their mate Rod Cameron, the ALP official pollster, for research projects. The estimated total cost of all research projects known to OGIA and conducted between 1983 and 1996 was a mere $22 million of taxpayers' hard earned cash. Yet they are coming in here complaining about the use of $7 million to inform people of their rights in this regard. It is an appalling misrepresentation of the facts and of the way in which one piece of legislation replaced another, but it needs to be understood very clearly that the Labor Party voted against both initiatives. They stand against both initiatives and will continue to do so.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-04-28,"—The matter of public importance today is very serious because it goes to the veracity of governments. There is an increasing tendency for governments to use taxpayers' funds to advertise their programs. This has probably been more blatant at a state government level than it has ever been at a federal level—indeed, there are fewer checks and balances at a state level than there are at a federal level. But it is true to say that since the 1970s governments of all political persuasions have found it necessary to advertise government programs, which fall into two areas. Firstly, there is the classic information one. Let me give you an example: defence force recruiting—it is always at a very high figure, it is straightforward and it has continuity between governments of all political 
 persuasions. Secondly, there is advertising that goes to the merits of a particular government policy in order to explain it to the public so that they understand it.
This again falls into two categories: advertising for a decision of government, parliament or the cabinet, and a new form of use of advertising to explain the future actions of a government. The most notable use of advertising to explain the future actions of a government was the tax campaign. No legislation had been introduced for tax reform, but $19 million to $20 million was allocated to advertise that particular program immediately before a federal election.
Who controls all this advertising? Essentially it is the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications, which is backed up by a group of staffers who concentrate on this area full-time. I have to say, though, that the ultimate decision making is for government, not for those staffers. The ultimate responsibility lies with the ministerial committee, and it has been the practice of the Howard government to put on that ministerial committee people who are probably experienced in media management and advertising from their previous careers as parts of political machines—inevitably those people have the most expertise.
So in the last three or four years we have seen a range of people on that ministerial committee—Senator Minchin; Mr Georgiou; Mr Graham Morris, more latterly; and Mr Tony Nutt. These are all people who have a long history in the Liberal Party apparatus. They have been chosen for two reasons: firstly, they are experienced, which I acknowledge; but, secondly, because it is believed that these ministerial committees are political bodies—and political bodies they are. They operate in such a way that they can blatantly ignore advice from the staff of the Government Communications Unit, and they constantly do.
The first time this was brought to light was in the first six months of the Howard government when it was decided to advertise the guns buyback scheme. And what happened? The preferred firm was not even on the register of 1,000 firms, so Mr Graham Morris 
 wrote to the unit and got the Adelaide firm, DDB Needham, put on the register. When it came to short-listing the potential firms, guess what? DDB Needham did not appear on the list. Again, there was intervention at a staff and ministerial level and they were put on the list. Five firms went up to pitch, and the staff then ranked them from one to five. Guess who won it? No.5. It was not Nos 1, 2, 3 or 4; the fifth one won it. Who were involved as principals of that firm? The advertising gurus that assisted the Howard government's election in 1996 were all rewarded by getting the first major prestige contract out of the government.
On the public relations side, who should be rewarded but a company with links to Jonathan Gaul, long-term Liberal lobbyist, and Mr Mark Textor, one of the scummiest political opinion pollsters this country has ever seen. They were all rewarded through ministerial intervention time and time again. The ministerial committee therefore cannot be regarded as an objective body, and they must be open to scrutiny and held responsible for decisions they make. There is no possibility that they can devolve any mistakes down to the bureaucratic level because the actual choices are theirs.
The most recent example is that the ministerial committee approved health ads that were blatantly wrong. The health ads claimed that all Australians with private health insurance would be 30 per cent better off. Of course, that was not the case because it did not take into account the abolition of the previous scheme or those that were outside the registered area. It was all about selling the political points of government, and it was not about informing the public. This was a political campaign; it was not about putting factual details on the record—and it was not the first time.
The government's advertising for the tax package was an absolute disgrace. It was the use of taxpayers' money for blatant political purposes, timed—with the knowledge within a small circle of government of when the election was to be held—with an intensive advertising campaign and the launch straight into the federal election on the back of it. I 
 have to say that it was an effective tactic. Even worse than that, hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money went into public opinion research on tax issues. That information was not protected; it was sent to the Treasurer's office so the Treasurer could pass it on to his colleagues in the Liberal Party machine up at Robert Menzies House, and suddenly the money from the research became a massive donation to the Liberal Party. But, just in case the message was missed, that same research was sent on to the ministerial committee for its various occupants, such as Senator Minchin and Mr Georgiou, to look at. Did they look at it? Did they use that research? It was initially supposed to be a bit of qualitative research but the contract ballooned into quantitative research. The contract ballooned into tracking research so that they could track night by night to find out how their taxpayer funded political ads were going. In such a way, we saw a massive rip-off of taxpayers' funds.
So what can we do about this, Mr Acting Deputy President? I think the Auditor-General was right when he said that there should be some guidelines here, and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is currently examining these issues. No-one comes to this debate with clean hands. The real question now is starting to go to quantum. The quantum is so much more massive under the Howard government, and the abuse of process in which the old favourites are rewarded is something that is nothing short of sickening. All the old names turn up time and time again, not out of recommendations by bureaucrats and evaluation by the experts but by a very political ministerial council that picks out the Liberal Party favourites, like Mark Textor, and rewards them with work even though their competency levels, one would have to say, are highly questionable.
These health ads are the classic example—all the short cuts were taken. Poor old Senator Ellison was induced to have his name authorising these ads that were patently wrong. So his reputation has been diminished because of that. Really, some consideration should be given to this—and I hope out of the public accounts committee we will see a decent set 
 of guidelines come forward that will apply not only to federal government but also, one would hope, to the areas of greatest abuse in the state field and that they may give some consideration to adopting those sorts of guidelines for their own purposes.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Government Advertisements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-04-28,"—This debate this afternoon has been nothing short of pompous, unfounded self-righteousness. To have Senator Robert Ray get up here and talk about the fact that old favourites are getting jobs under the Liberals is just outrageous. His memory must be very short when he fails to remember the way in which the publicity campaign for the disability reform package was carried out under Labor, when somebody got a bright idea in the ministerial committee that they would use a different form of advertising, that they would use a networking form of advertising which had never been used before—an old Labor Party hack from way back had some concept that she was going to run this networking form of advertising. A $5 million contract was let to that company—and I am still suspicious about how it was let—and the company was balance sheet insolvent at the time.
So do not let Senator Robert Ray come in here and talk to us about people known to the party getting jobs. That was a job that was let to a company, to an old Labor Party hack, and the company was balance sheet insolvent. The contract was never completed, and I do not whether the Taxation Office is still trying to recover money owed to it. The people left floundering were those with disabilities who in many cases did not get paid. So to come in here and criticise the current government is just pure hypocrisy.
Labor's response to the issue of private health insurance has been characterised by a devious and cynical campaign of misinformation and misrepresentation. Health and misinformation seem to go hand in hand with the Labor Party. Time and time again the Labor Party has recognised the need to boost private health insurance but has simply lacked the courage to do anything about it. As 
 Senator Knowles said today, it has had many opportunities in this place since we have been in government to support people who take up private health insurance, but it has done nothing about it.
Maybe they have lacked the courage because top leaders like former Prime Minister Mr Keating and former Minister for Human Services and Health Ms Lawrence bragged that they did not take out private health cover but relied on taxpayers through Medicare to pay their health costs. So when you have that sort of leadership, no wonder you do not get them supporting private health insurance. But our government has not suffered from Labor's terminal reluctance to address the hard health facts. We are not prepared to sit by and watch our public system grind to a halt. Labor was, but we are not.
As recently as 1993 Graham Richardson, the then ALP Minister for Health, at least recognised the urgent need to bring back people to private health insurance. Despite the fact that he was the numbers man in the Labor Party, he could not do anything about it. He said:
We've got to look seriously at how to get the numbers in private health cover up. It was 70 per cent when we came to office and it's 40 per cent now. The drop last year was dramatic.
He said this in 1993, so he is talking about 1992. He went on:
If the drop continues at any rate like it has been over the next few years, it won't be long before there will be enormous pressure on the public health system.
We used to have Senator Crowley come in here when she represented the minister for health in this place saying, `If private health insurance drops, only young people go out and it won't put increased pressure on the public health system.' That was just nonsense, and it was demonstrated as nonsense. I am just very sorry that former Senator Richardson was never able to convince them that they needed to do something about private health insurance. Nearly all of his colleagues lacked the courage to do something. They saw the writing on the wall, they knew what was going to happen, but they did nothing about it. They did nothing and they let the health 
 system become a terminal case that only a coalition government could resuscitate, and we have set about doing that. We have resuscitated the health system, through the incentive scheme that Labor has had the gall to distort and misrepresent today.
Misinformation by Labor is a habit; it is rife and it is repeated, pompous self-righteousness. Comments such as those by the ALP shadow minister for health, Jenny Macklin, reinforce the total lack of reality to this Labor Party policy. We ought to hear what Ms Macklin said in relation to private health insurance in the 1991 report entitled Hospital Services in Australia, published by the National Health Strategy chaired by Ms Macklin. She said:
If increased funding to public hospitals reduces the perceived pressure on public hospitals . . . it is likely private health insurance will drop. This could result in increased demand for public hospitals and reduced revenue from private patients.
That is another example of what Labor really knew but did nothing about. But Ms Macklin's comments do not surprise me or any of my colleagues on this side of the house or in the House of Representatives because, from issues such as the Job Network to the pharmaceuticals industry and from the Clever Country Education Policy to disability funding, Ms Macklin has consistently misrepresented our policies. In fact she caused me to write a booklet called Macklin's Myths . She is the arch mythmaker. These are examples of where Labor's imagination and storytelling has got the better of them and where intelligent comment has been replaced by bold-faced lies and furphies.
Surely anyone conversant with the proposed tax reform system of the Howard government would have a ready example of Labor misrepresentation. I am nearing the end of my tether: I am fed up with the way in which the Labor Party have misconstrued and misrepresented issues surrounding the tax package and especially the GST. It is typical of the ALP. They know we needed a new tax system, a new employment network and a new health incentive system, and they are not shy in pointing this out. But they lack the wit or the will to fix the problem, and they still have no decent policies. The Australian Labor 
 Party just cannot and will not make the hard decisions for the benefit of all Australians.
I note the irony of the bleating by Senator Crowley in the Senate yesterday regarding the precious $7 million spent on this advertising campaign. But I did not hear Senator Crowley—and I wonder what the Labor Party was feeling—talking about the $10 million they spent on the 1994-95 superannuation campaign. Was that just as precious? There is, however, a big difference between these two campaigns. Senator Knowles pointed out, but it is worth reiterating, the findings of the ACCC about the government's health insurance campaign and the Auditor-General's comments on the Labor Party's superannuation campaign. The difference is that, in the case of the government's health insurance incentive, the ACCC expressed concern for the `potential to mislead' while the Auditor-General's report says of the Labor Party's superannuation campaign that the print advertisements were misleading and deceptive. It was a substantiated and proven breach of the advertising code of ethics.
Senator Evans came in here earlier and said that the government's health insurance campaign had breached the advertising code of ethics. That is not true. That is not what the ACCC said. But he came in here and said it, willy-nilly, with no regard for the truth. The Auditor-General's report, as I said, found that the Labor government's print advertisements were in breach of the advertising code of ethics—$10 million of taxpayers' money was found to have been used in breach of the advertising code of ethics.
Senator Faulkner had the gall to ask why the government communications unit did not wake up, and he said that this was a breach of the Trade Practices Act. This is another way that the Labor Party tries to perpetuate its myths. This is another half-truth on the part of Senator Faulkner. I want to reiterate what the ACCC wrote. It said:
It should be noted that the commission is of the preliminary view that the Trade Practices Act is unlikely to apply to government advertisements of this kind. 

The Labor Party come in here and skate on the circumference of the truth in implying that the government's advertising campaign is in breach of the Trade Practices Act when in fact their superannuation advertising campaign was found to be in breach of the Trade Practices Act. It is also misleading for Senator Evans to have picked over the letter from Professor Fels of the ACCC and selectively quote passages that he hoped would prop up his shaky accusations. He did not quote the whole of that letter. If he had, the fact that he was misrepresenting the situation would have been clearer to the public. The Labor Party have indicated that they do not have any policies. They will pick over and try to misrepresent the government's position. (Time expired)

That the Senate take note of the document.
I happen to be a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and I think that, if one goes along to any estimates hearings that I am involved in, one will see that I have a fairly keen interest in audit reports. In particular, I thought it was well worth taking a few minutes of the Senate's time to take note of this report. It refers specifically to pay-as-you-earn taxation—administration of employer responsibilities. The report points out something which many people would not be aware of. In the 1997-98 period, pay-as-you-earn taxation accounted for $66 billion, or some 60 per cent of the total tax take. So it is a fairly important source of taxation for any government.
The report went on to point out that 85 per cent of the Australian work force is covered by the PAYE system, although the report makes reference to the fact that there is slippage in that area with a greater number of people now being identified as contractors. The report points out that there is a real need for work to be done in this particular area.
The ANAO's audit sought to achieve a number of objectives. As it says in the report, the audit focused primarily on the following four areas of the PAYE adminstration: remittance monitoring, especially managing late remittances; follow-up action for end of year reconciliation, including discrepancies; handling compliance intelligence gained from the public; and the ATO compliance projects. On the matter of the monitoring of PAYE remittances, the report noted that the lack of timely action on overdue remittances represents a risk to tax revenue. That is obviously an important thing in terms of the cash flow of government. The audit also found that `client risk profiling would better target debt requiring timely action' and that `better analysis of available system based information' could improve remittance monitoring. It also stated:
. . . the majority of system generated indicators of late remittance are invalid. Where such items represent a debt owed, the estimates of debt are often inaccurate.
On the monitoring of PAYE remittances, the report, whilst not being severely critical, draws it to the attention of the Australian Taxation Office and it does make some recommendations further on in the summary. But that was not the area that I primarily wish to focus on. There were specific discussions in the report about the ATO compliance projects. At point 16 in the report, the ANAO found:
. . . ATO analysis and field work on its PAYE Erosion Project suggest that the majority of employing organisations are complying with PAYE provisions.
The report goes on to say:
Although ATO research indicated the movement of employees to contractor status is increasing, there was no indication of when this or other identified factors would have a significant impact on revenue.
It seems to me, from reading the report in the short time that I have had available to me, that this is an important area. We are debating a new tax system in this chamber—I do not want to introduce that issue here—and there needs to be some definite information as to what is happening in this area.
As I pointed out, the report at the outset identified that in the order of 60 per cent of the tax take in 1997-98 was through the pay-as-you-earn system. Of course, if there is this movement, then it needs to be identified and it needs to be known how that is going to impact on the revenue of government. At recommendation 10, the ANAO made a specific recommendation on this point, and it is worthwhile just canvassing this recommendation for a few moments. The ANAO recommended that, in relation to its analysis of PAYE erosion, the ATO should, firstly:
. analyse the downward trend in the proportion of revenue from PAYE to establish causes and project likely outcomes for the medium to longer term.
I am surprised that this has not happened. I would have thought—anyone with a reasonable management approach to this sort of issue would have thought—that the ATO would have had some analysis in place to look at this downward trend, because it is not 
 something that has just happened overnight. In that sense, that part of the recommendation is well received.
The second point in the recommendation on the analysis of the PAYE erosion is that the ATO:
. analyse the trend by large employers towards outsourcing of complete business units or functions to determine its impact on PAYE and overall revenue.
Again, that is something that has not been done. There has been a significant move, both by the private sector and, as we have seen, by government, to outsource various aspects of business and, in some cases, quite significant parts of those businesses. There has been no analysis done on this trend by large employers, in particular, to look at the impact on the PAYE system. Last, but not least, the third point in the report's recommendation 10 is that the ATO:
. conduct a suitable sensitivity analysis to determine when identified effects on PAYE revenue will become significant so that timely action can be taken.
It is important that this take place. Again, we are looking at the significant base of tax revenue in this nation. Even with the change—should it go through this chamber—to a GST, that recommendation undoubtedly is well warranted and well justified.
This particular report is not the sort of reading that most people would do at bedtime, but it does draw to the attention of the ATO and the government the need to respond to the changing environment. There were 11 recommendations in the report and all 11 recommendations were agreed to by the ATO. One of the things about these ANAO reports—these Audit Office reports—is that, whilst one finds that the recommendations are invariably agreed to, it is the implementation of the agreed recommendations that is really the interesting part of the report because, in many instances, one finds that the implementation can be very long in coming.
I hope that the ATO is swift to respond to the recommendations. As I said, I have not canvassed and I did not intend to canvass everything, but I wanted to focus on the PAYE erosion that is taking place and the 
 need for the government to do a proper analysis through the ATO. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,18,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I want to remonstrate with my colleague Senator Hogg very quickly. He said this is not bedtime reading. In fact, I suspect it probably is good bedtime reading, particularly for a lot of people who have trouble going to sleep at night, but the issues are actually very serious ones.
Senator Hogg alluded, towards the end of his speech, to the erosion of PAYE tax receipts. One of the issues that has concerned me very much in the tax debate, and there has not been much airplay on this so far, is the very question of the erosion of PAYE receipts. Because of the restructuring that has taken place in the Australian economy, particularly in the last decade, large numbers of people in Australia are able to incorporate incomes in the sense that they get a payout, usually from a state or federal government, they set up some sort of business of their own, and then they seek to take a tax advantage of those sorts of arrangements. That is starting, obviously, to show through and it is one of the reasons why, on this side, we agree with the need to look at tax.
We do agree that it is necessary to have tax reform. Of course, we do not accept the GST as the centrepiece of that tax reform and more will be said about that later today and presumably over the next few sitting days. The case to be made here is that the Audit Office has come down with a fairly timely report on compliance and other issues associated with tax in Australia. Looking through this particular report and the pamphlet attached to it, I think there are a number of key issues that senators need to be aware of. The background to the National Audit Office having a look at this particular question is well laid out in the pamphlet. It is a good summary and it says:
During 1997-98, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) collected revenue through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system totalling $66 billion. This represented almost 60 per cent of a total of $110.3 billion in ATO revenue collections for the year.
PAYE, introduced in 1941, is the ATO's most extensive collection system covering 85 per cent of the Australian work force. International research has shown that a withholding tax arrangement such 
 as PAYE is the most effective means of encouraging compliance.
The publication goes on, under the heading of `Audit objective and approach', to say:
The objective of the performance audit was to assess key aspects of the ATO's administration of the PAYE system in relation to employers' remittances and to identify opportunities for improvement. To achieve this objective, the audit focused primarily on the following four areas of PAYE administration:
.	 remittance monitoring, especially managing late remittances;
.	 follow-up action for end of year reconciliation, including discrepancies;
.	 handling compliance intelligence gained from the public; and
.	 ATO compliance projects.
I want to make a couple of remarks about this. I think these are very important issues. I suspect most people in this chamber believe that taxation, as administered by the ATO, is a socially necessary goal. It is a vehicle that achieves a number of goods for our society including, primarily, the redistribution of wealth—and that is where we currently have argument with some key elements of the new tax package that has been proposed. But, in essence, I think everybody agrees that the integrity of the system is absolutely essential.
The overall conclusion the Audit Office has reached in respect of this is a fairly good one. It gives a good mark to the ATO. Given that the ATO has been the subject over the last few years of a lot of criticism over cases of mismanagement, particularly from some of the magazine-type television programs, in general, when we look at the system, the mark that is given by the Audit Office is a fairly good one. In fact, the report states:
The ATO's administration of the PAYE system in relation to employers' remittances is generally sound. It ensures most employers comply with their responsibilities for remitting tax withheld from employees' salaries.
The ANAO found that there is scope for improvement in the ATO's administration of PAYE. The audit revealed a risk to revenue arising from the ATO's lack of timeliness in actioning late PAYE remittances and reconciliation discrepancies. Improvements in data integrity of support systems, coupled with implementation of client risk profiling, would lead to better targeting and timeliness 
 of compliance activity and therefore better outcomes.
—We are able to read the report ourselves.
—I wonder about that. From time to time I wonder whether you can actually read. I see you over there with your question time briefs, and I just thought I would help you out a bit here. I know that really deep down you probably can read, but you have not shown a lot of evidence of that in question time. So, if you want to carry on, I am quite happy do so. On page 44 of the report we have recommendation No. 5.
—Oh no!
—Minister, if you carry on like this, I will give you recommendations 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Recommendation No. 5, for the minister's interest, is the longest recommendation in the book and probably, arguably, one of the most important. I will quote from that recommendation just for you, Minister, in case you need some light reading when you are going to sleep tonight. Recommendation No. 5 states:
The ANAO recommends that:
.	 the ATO improves the timeliness of actioning self assessed reconciliation discrepancies to clear the backlog, within the constraints of cost and risk;
.	 reconciliation data entry keying errors be corrected at the bulk processing centre as part of the data capture process . . .
—Can't you just give us the reference, Quirky?
—I did. It is page 44, in case you want more of it. The third dot point states:
.	 the ATO improves its system to prioritise discrepancy items on the basis of risk profiling . . . 
There are three other parts to this recommendation but, in the interests of brevity, I will slip over to recommendation No. 6. This, I think, is a suitable point on which to end my contribution here today on this very important report. On page 49 the report states:
The ANAO recommends that the ATO implements a nationally based tip-off information management system with consistent procedures for collecting, recording, and reporting tip-off information. 

I really would emphasise the importance of this particular recommendation. At present we have the PAYE system. If the minister and his friends over there have their way, that is soon to become the PAYG system. I believe the integrity of that particular system, when it comes in, will be dependent on honest, loyal, law abiding taxpayers out in the community making sure that everybody who has a proper obligation for tax purposes meets that obligation. That recommendation No. 6 is absolutely fundamental to this report. With those remarks, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,18,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I also wish to take note of the report entitled Pay-As-You-Earn taxation: Administration of employer responsibilities  and pass a few pertinent comments. I must say at the outset that on occasions these publications we receive from the Australian National Audit Office are a useful and valuable tool for senators and members of parliament. They give great exposure to the many programs and differing methods of implementation of various policies of the current government and prior governments. I regularly keep all of these reports in my office; in fact, they are some of the few documents that are regularly delivered that I think are of interest.
What is of great value with these reports is the little pamphlet in the front, a sort of executive summary. It saves you from wading through 80 to 90 pages of often difficult legalese and introduces you to what are the important findings of the particular report. The pamphlet, the executive summary, in this one identifies that something like 60 per cent of taxation paid in this country is paid by PAYE taxpayers—$66 billion out of a total tax collection take of $110 billion. So that 60 per cent is an important figure.
To some extent, it is not surprising that the ANAO has taken the time to inquire into the implementation, the procedure and the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. If you could improve the ATO's efficiency by one or two per cent in terms of the revenue that it gathers—and that is its purpose, to gather revenue for government according to law—if 
 you could increase that take from something in the order of $66 billion to $68 billion, a one to two per cent increase, a lot of the problems that it is suggested this country faces in funding of necessary government programs may not be as critical as is sometimes suggested by the government in debate.
It is useful for the ANAO to be taking an active overview, if you like, of the activities of the Australian Taxation Office because, if revenue flow can be improved, if PAYE taxpayers and corporate entities in due course, one hopes, are examined properly, and the revenue flow legitimately obtained by government can be improved, that will help in the carrying out of many necessary government programs and policies. Indeed, if it had been done some two or three years ago, it may well have obviated the need to have the wholesale change that is suggested by the current government in moving to a consumption tax, the GST.
In the executive summary of the report, 10 recommendations are to be found that essentially can be conceptualised under three headings. The first goes to intelligence/ assessment/improvement. The ANAO has made some comments that are pertinent and somewhat critical of the role of the ATO in this area.
The second heading concerns systems implementation improvement, that some of the practices of the ATO in terms of carrying out its charter are not as efficient as government, or indeed opposition, might like. The final two recommendations are probably properly categorised as trend analysis to determine impact—that is, individual workers, corporate entities and other mechanisms established under law do undergo change. They are currently undergoing significant change and, as people in organisations structure themselves in different modes, the results of that restructuring can have an impact on the revenue flow to government.
The last two recommendations go to the issue of trend analysis to determine whether the structural changes that we think are occurring in the economy are having an impact on the nature of business and the way it organises itself and the way individuals 
 within the system organise themselves. Structural change does, of course, impact upon the revenue gain or the revenue take by government. The ANAO, in recommendations Nos 10 and 11, recommends that there should be serious trend analysis done to establish the risk to the Commonwealth government if these changes do occur and there is an impact on the revenue flow to government.
The major recommendations, as I said, can be conceptualised under those three headings: intelligence assessment improvement, system implementation improvement, and trend analysis to determine impact. The key recommendations in numerical order, if nothing else, go to the accuracy and reliability of the information system. It is somewhat surprising to me, as a disinterested observer, that a lot of the work that has been done by the ANAO in addressing apparent deficiencies in the ability to obtain and properly process intelligence and information as to the activities of taxpayers and business is not occurring on a routine and ongoing basis within the ATO.
We all know from the representatives of the ATO who come to estimates and other public inquiries that a lot of resources are addressed to maintaining the viability, the soundness and the integrity of the taxation system and the consequent revenue flow to the Commonwealth. I find it surprising that there is not established within the Australian Taxation Office a permanent unit, staffed obviously by economists and financial people, which automatically and on an ongoing basis reviews the activities of the ATO to determine that its systems, practices and policies are maximising revenue to the Commonwealth and are adjusting, as is necessary, to structural changes within the economy, so that the taxpayer revenue flow to the Commonwealth is not unnecessarily damaged, or damaged on a more permanent basis, simply because the necessary ongoing review procedures have not been established and maintained.
Recommendations 2, 3, 4 and 5 target particular issues that taxpayers face or, more properly said, that the ATO faces in terms of debt incurred, debt to be paid by particular classes of taxpayers, whether they be small or medium sized PAYE payers who owe debt to 
 the Commonwealth. Again the ANAO recommends that a profile be identified of the liability of particular types or classes of taxpayers and then that a risk analysis be done to determine whether the revenue flow from that subclass of taxpayers can be maximised to the Commonwealth.
Recommendation 4 follows on in the same way and addresses the issue of timeliness of debt establishment and indicates to the ATO how it should establish and refine its performance indicators to assist the ongoing management of PAYE debt and establishment performance—again, a useful recommendation. It is pleasing to see that the ATO has adopted that recommendation without demur and—I repeat my earlier comment—it is somewhat surprising that that has not been established for many years as normal management practice within the ATO.
One can speculate or postulate as to why that may be the case. I suspect it goes to the nature of the Australian Taxation Office. Indeed, like many other organisations, it is a large monopoly, bureaucratic in nature and answerable only to the government of the day. (Time expired)

The publication goes on, under the heading of `Audit objective and approach', to say:
The objective of the performance audit was to assess key aspects of the ATO's administration of the PAYE system in relation to employers' remittances and to identify opportunities for improvement. To achieve this objective, the audit focused primarily on the following four areas of PAYE administration:
.	 remittance monitoring, especially managing late remittances;
.	 follow-up action for end of year reconciliation, including discrepancies;
.	 handling compliance intelligence gained from the public; and
.	 ATO compliance projects.
I want to make a couple of remarks about this. I think these are very important issues. I suspect most people in this chamber believe that taxation, as administered by the ATO, is a socially necessary goal. It is a vehicle that achieves a number of goods for our society including, primarily, the redistribution of wealth—and that is where we currently have argument with some key elements of the new tax package that has been proposed. But, in essence, I think everybody agrees that the integrity of the system is absolutely essential.
The overall conclusion the Audit Office has reached in respect of this is a fairly good one. It gives a good mark to the ATO. Given that the ATO has been the subject over the last few years of a lot of criticism over cases of mismanagement, particularly from some of the magazine-type television programs, in general, when we look at the system, the mark that is given by the Audit Office is a fairly good one. In fact, the report states:
The ATO's administration of the PAYE system in relation to employers' remittances is generally sound. It ensures most employers comply with their responsibilities for remitting tax withheld from employees' salaries.
The ANAO found that there is scope for improvement in the ATO's administration of PAYE. The audit revealed a risk to revenue arising from the ATO's lack of timeliness in actioning late PAYE remittances and reconciliation discrepancies. Improvements in data integrity of support systems, coupled with implementation of client risk profiling, would lead to better targeting and timeliness 
 of compliance activity and therefore better outcomes.
—We are able to read the report ourselves.
—I wonder about that. From time to time I wonder whether you can actually read. I see you over there with your question time briefs, and I just thought I would help you out a bit here. I know that really deep down you probably can read, but you have not shown a lot of evidence of that in question time. So, if you want to carry on, I am quite happy do so. On page 44 of the report we have recommendation No. 5.
—Oh no!
—Minister, if you carry on like this, I will give you recommendations 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Recommendation No. 5, for the minister's interest, is the longest recommendation in the book and probably, arguably, one of the most important. I will quote from that recommendation just for you, Minister, in case you need some light reading when you are going to sleep tonight. Recommendation No. 5 states:
The ANAO recommends that:
.	 the ATO improves the timeliness of actioning self assessed reconciliation discrepancies to clear the backlog, within the constraints of cost and risk;
.	 reconciliation data entry keying errors be corrected at the bulk processing centre as part of the data capture process . . .
—Can't you just give us the reference, Quirky?
—I did. It is page 44, in case you want more of it. The third dot point states:
.	 the ATO improves its system to prioritise discrepancy items on the basis of risk profiling . . . 
There are three other parts to this recommendation but, in the interests of brevity, I will slip over to recommendation No. 6. This, I think, is a suitable point on which to end my contribution here today on this very important report. On page 49 the report states:
The ANAO recommends that the ATO implements a nationally based tip-off information management system with consistent procedures for collecting, recording, and reporting tip-off information. 

I really would emphasise the importance of this particular recommendation. At present we have the PAYE system. If the minister and his friends over there have their way, that is soon to become the PAYG system. I believe the integrity of that particular system, when it comes in, will be dependent on honest, loyal, law abiding taxpayers out in the community making sure that everybody who has a proper obligation for tax purposes meets that obligation. That recommendation No. 6 is absolutely fundamental to this report. With those remarks, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 36 of 1998-99</title>,Documents,18,2
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I also wish to take note of the report entitled Pay-As-You-Earn taxation: Administration of employer responsibilities  and pass a few pertinent comments. I must say at the outset that on occasions these publications we receive from the Australian National Audit Office are a useful and valuable tool for senators and members of parliament. They give great exposure to the many programs and differing methods of implementation of various policies of the current government and prior governments. I regularly keep all of these reports in my office; in fact, they are some of the few documents that are regularly delivered that I think are of interest.
What is of great value with these reports is the little pamphlet in the front, a sort of executive summary. It saves you from wading through 80 to 90 pages of often difficult legalese and introduces you to what are the important findings of the particular report. The pamphlet, the executive summary, in this one identifies that something like 60 per cent of taxation paid in this country is paid by PAYE taxpayers—$66 billion out of a total tax collection take of $110 billion. So that 60 per cent is an important figure.
To some extent, it is not surprising that the ANAO has taken the time to inquire into the implementation, the procedure and the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. If you could improve the ATO's efficiency by one or two per cent in terms of the revenue that it gathers—and that is its purpose, to gather revenue for government according to law—if 
 you could increase that take from something in the order of $66 billion to $68 billion, a one to two per cent increase, a lot of the problems that it is suggested this country faces in funding of necessary government programs may not be as critical as is sometimes suggested by the government in debate.
It is useful for the ANAO to be taking an active overview, if you like, of the activities of the Australian Taxation Office because, if revenue flow can be improved, if PAYE taxpayers and corporate entities in due course, one hopes, are examined properly, and the revenue flow legitimately obtained by government can be improved, that will help in the carrying out of many necessary government programs and policies. Indeed, if it had been done some two or three years ago, it may well have obviated the need to have the wholesale change that is suggested by the current government in moving to a consumption tax, the GST.
In the executive summary of the report, 10 recommendations are to be found that essentially can be conceptualised under three headings. The first goes to intelligence/ assessment/improvement. The ANAO has made some comments that are pertinent and somewhat critical of the role of the ATO in this area.
The second heading concerns systems implementation improvement, that some of the practices of the ATO in terms of carrying out its charter are not as efficient as government, or indeed opposition, might like. The final two recommendations are probably properly categorised as trend analysis to determine impact—that is, individual workers, corporate entities and other mechanisms established under law do undergo change. They are currently undergoing significant change and, as people in organisations structure themselves in different modes, the results of that restructuring can have an impact on the revenue flow to government.
The last two recommendations go to the issue of trend analysis to determine whether the structural changes that we think are occurring in the economy are having an impact on the nature of business and the way it organises itself and the way individuals 
 within the system organise themselves. Structural change does, of course, impact upon the revenue gain or the revenue take by government. The ANAO, in recommendations Nos 10 and 11, recommends that there should be serious trend analysis done to establish the risk to the Commonwealth government if these changes do occur and there is an impact on the revenue flow to government.
The major recommendations, as I said, can be conceptualised under those three headings: intelligence assessment improvement, system implementation improvement, and trend analysis to determine impact. The key recommendations in numerical order, if nothing else, go to the accuracy and reliability of the information system. It is somewhat surprising to me, as a disinterested observer, that a lot of the work that has been done by the ANAO in addressing apparent deficiencies in the ability to obtain and properly process intelligence and information as to the activities of taxpayers and business is not occurring on a routine and ongoing basis within the ATO.
We all know from the representatives of the ATO who come to estimates and other public inquiries that a lot of resources are addressed to maintaining the viability, the soundness and the integrity of the taxation system and the consequent revenue flow to the Commonwealth. I find it surprising that there is not established within the Australian Taxation Office a permanent unit, staffed obviously by economists and financial people, which automatically and on an ongoing basis reviews the activities of the ATO to determine that its systems, practices and policies are maximising revenue to the Commonwealth and are adjusting, as is necessary, to structural changes within the economy, so that the taxpayer revenue flow to the Commonwealth is not unnecessarily damaged, or damaged on a more permanent basis, simply because the necessary ongoing review procedures have not been established and maintained.
Recommendations 2, 3, 4 and 5 target particular issues that taxpayers face or, more properly said, that the ATO faces in terms of debt incurred, debt to be paid by particular classes of taxpayers, whether they be small or medium sized PAYE payers who owe debt to 
 the Commonwealth. Again the ANAO recommends that a profile be identified of the liability of particular types or classes of taxpayers and then that a risk analysis be done to determine whether the revenue flow from that subclass of taxpayers can be maximised to the Commonwealth.
Recommendation 4 follows on in the same way and addresses the issue of timeliness of debt establishment and indicates to the ATO how it should establish and refine its performance indicators to assist the ongoing management of PAYE debt and establishment performance—again, a useful recommendation. It is pleasing to see that the ATO has adopted that recommendation without demur and—I repeat my earlier comment—it is somewhat surprising that that has not been established for many years as normal management practice within the ATO.
One can speculate or postulate as to why that may be the case. I suspect it goes to the nature of the Australian Taxation Office. Indeed, like many other organisations, it is a large monopoly, bureaucratic in nature and answerable only to the government of the day. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 36 of 1998-99</title>,Documents,18,2
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-04-28,"—The question before the committee is an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats and further amended by the Greens (WA) on the GST legislation. I am hampered in this debate in that neither the mover of the substantive amendment nor the mover of the amendment to the substantive amendment are present. The amendment is to chapter 1 of the first of the 27 GST bills—A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998 . The bill is probably the most important because, if it were carried, by and large, the other bills are consequential. The bill sets out the tax to be imposed.
The Democrats have moved an amendment to chapter 1, Introduction, to insert a new clause 1-4, Intention of Parliament. They then set out two notions which go to a fairer system than the wholesale sales tax system, in their view, and the promotion of the `redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich'. On behalf of the Labor opposition, I have indicated that we will not 
 support that amendment, and we will not support it for the good and extraordinarily valid reason that you cannot make a GST fair. A GST is a regressive tax. `Regressive' in this context is not a political word; it is a technical description. A progressive tax is a tax that imposes percentage taxation so that, irrespective of income, you pay on a graduated scale a percentage of your income in tax. It is therefore regarded as progressive so that the actual burden borne by taxpayers is roughly or acceptably equivalent. A regressive tax imposes the same level of tax on everyone, irrespective of capacity to pay or income. So, as a percentage of income, it is a larger percentage for poorer Australians and a smaller percentage for wealthier Australians. Therefore, the technical description is regressive. So this is a regressive tax.
For the reasons that I stated before lunch, we will not be supporting the amendment, although I do not question the integrity of those who moved it. It is also for the reason that you cannot make a GST fair that we would not be supporting the amendment moved by the Greens (WA). I am not sure whether Senator Murray or Senator Margetts, who are now in the chamber, want to respond to the arguments that we have put. I am mindful of the fact that the government have not yet responded to the amendment moved by Senator Murray and amended further by Senator Margetts. Certainly we should hear from the government as to whether they accept the proposal. Senator Woodley has provided some explanation but, as cogent and as persuasive as that was, it does not change us from our conviction. This is a regressive tax that has to be compensated for. Even if you believe that the level of tax, the 10 per cent, will not increase—in our view that is a fiction and a fantasy that is proven in the broader community—you cannot accept that the compensation will eternally remain in order to offset the regressive nature of this tax.
Even if you believe that the 10 per cent will not go up, as it has done everywhere else in the world, compensation is dependent on the government of the day and governments of the day will vary it, as we have seen in every other country of the world. Therefore, the 
 compensation cannot be guaranteed to last. People will suffer. We cannot support the GST. Perhaps that is sufficient for me at this stage, but I am interested in knowing the government's position and I suspect that there will be some further interventions from our side once we have heard what that is.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-28,"—I just thought I should add some clarification to what we are about and go back to the very essence of the policy debate which is under way here. It is not just a question of the government's package but in fact the official opposition's alternative view and the alternative view of the crossbenches. The government has, in my view, rightly said that this is the largest package of tax changes probably since the war. To my mind, if you are going to do that, you must address the fundamental principles of what you are trying to achieve. It is not just a revenue raising exercise, it is not just an exercise of economic efficiency; it has to be about what forms of critical distribution you are providing in your society to balance out the way it might otherwise be.
I have already indicated that the Democrats will accept Senator Margetts's amendment, because she adds, quite properly, another dimension. My attitude and the attitude of my party is that if this package went down and later on another government—either yours, Senator Cook, or Senator Kemp's—came back up, we would expect them to commence the package with a determination of the principles, the objects, which should be set out for us. Although the government did that in its ANTS package to some extent, it did not do so in the bills.
What we are trying to do is to say at the beginning, `Look, there are certain things which should guide us and should guide the bills in what emerges.' Of course the bills do not meet, at this point in time, the prescript we have laid out in our suggested amendment. We do not think the GST as it is currently constructed is fairer than the wholesale sales tax system it replaces. We do not think—in fact, we very much think the opposite—that it promotes a redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich. And we 
 have to get the language right. The language of the Prime Minister and Treasurer was, first, that no person would be worse off, and then that no group would be worse off, and then later on, `Well, the average in the group wouldn't be worse off.'
But I believe fervently—as do my party—that the purpose of major changes to the tax system should be to make substantial numbers of the poor and disadvantaged and of the middle class better off. This is a package which actually makes it harder for battlers. It just goes against the very essence of what we should be trying to achieve. We all know that statistically the consequence of the last 25 years of government action has been, through the tax system, to increase the wealth and the advantages of the rich and of the elite. It has been a redistribution exercise in a negative sense. Having learned those lessons, having learned the downsides of the extreme forms of economic rationalism, we are arguing that we should start to redress this issue by an intention to redistribution in the old social democrat sense, in the sense of, `Let us give back some equity and some advantage to the poor, the disadvantaged and the middle class.' That is an honourable objective. It is not the province of socialists or of small `l' liberals; it is an honourable objective about making our society more just and more equitable.
—It's about a civilised society.
—It is indeed about making a civilised society. It is not about right and left and factions and ideologies; it is about trying to achieve those things which we should value as an advanced society. I do not want to use the words `advanced economy', because that immediately limits it. I think that was also the thrust of Senator Margetts's remarks—that we have to look more widely and look in a more open fashion at what we are trying to achieve for our society. That is why we have set this as the first amendment coming up—because we need to address what on earth we are here for, why we believe the tax system needs to be changed.
I fully understand the views put for the Labor Party by Senator Cook. I think they are 
 very understandable. Their view is obviously that some elements of the package can be worked out but that the core element of the indirect tax, the GST, cannot be made fairer. The Australian Democrats, as you know, take a contrary view, but we do require some pretty savage amendments in many directions to make this package fair. I enumerate them again for you: income tax cuts; the poverty trap—we are very interested in the tax credits idea, which is not in this package; the GST—making food GST free; sorting out the Commonwealth, state and local government issues; sorting out the compensation issues; the pension levels; and the levels at which the social security system and the income tax system interact.
Unfortunately, for want of ability to do otherwise, I guess, in terms of their directions, the media have tended to focus on single issues—about compensation or about food being GST free. But for us it is much more than that. For us, this is a philosophical and ideological divide whereby we want to say, `Put back the equity into our system. Put back the redistributional motive in our system.' That is something, frankly, that the major parties did live by in the 1950s, the 1960s and the early 1970s. It is something we have lost since. That is a message that I want to get over to the parliament, and that is what our motive is behind putting this amendment. Really, even if you end up not supporting it—Senator Cook, on behalf of the Labor Party, or, Senator Kemp, on behalf of the coalition—I would urge you to start to adopt this kind of language and thinking in our approach to our society, because I think it is motivated by the sorts of aims and ambitions that a civilised society should adopt.
It is not just about economics and making money and selfishness and markets and all that. It really is much more about the things which stand behind the great institutions of our society, which stand behind the churches with their views about faith, hope, peace and charity, about caring for each other. It is difficult for a government to do because of the impersonality of government, but at least we should try and do what we can through this great device which is available to us of 
 tax and of the redistribution mechanism. I hope you now understand a little more clearly our intent behind moving this amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-28,"—I think what we are probably going to get to in relation to this particular amendment and the amendment to the amendment is issues of fairness. I was writing down a few notes while this was going on. First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the Labor Party that there is no way that you can take this model of a flat tax and suddenly make it fair. I absolutely agree. I also agree that there is no way that the bits and pieces that we may or may not be able to achieve in the Senate in relation to this bill, this model and this process will suddenly make it okay, because they will not. I guess I was looking at the words about the intention of the parliament in relation to tax and saying, `This is what we think taxes should be.' I suppose that was the reason for our moving the amendment and being prepared to agree to the Democrats' amendment—that it is the intention of parliament that this act and associated laws should be fairer than wholesale sales tax.
I am certainly not saying that we believe that the government's intention is that it be fairer. Some people from the government side might think that it is fairer, but we are not suggesting that it is fairer or perhaps will be made fairer. It should, in our opinion, promote redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich, and it is a principle of the Greens that the taxation system should promote ecologically sustainable development. So it is a matter of what is the intention of parliament to do with tax systems. If at some stage by magic we got rid of every word after the words `An act to', maybe we could achieve this. So, yes, it is a hope and an intention. I would like to think that if there were ever a legal challenge they might look at the intention and say, `Well, they did mean for it to be fairer, they did mean for it to be more distributive and they did mean for it to be ecologically sustainable if there was going to be a change to the tax system.' We are not naive enough to think that is what we are going to get at the end of 
 this debate, no matter how many of these amendments get up.
Now we get down to the issue of fairness. Is the bill for a tax package that we have been given fair? No. Could it be made fairer? Possibly. But then the question is: fairer than it is or fairer than what exists now? There are very few analysts who would say that Australia has one of the most progressive taxation systems. So I could interpret what Senator Murray is saying as that the bill could be made fairer than it is. Yes. There is very little doubt that a bill that is as rotten as this can be made fairer. There is no doubt at all. But whether that equals a system that is fairer than we have now is the question. Should we as a parliament or as a Senate endorse something that is less fair still than we have now? I have to say that it is a bit like the 1996 industrial relations bill in making changes to an industrial relations bill that made the bill fairer than it was but made the system less fair than the existing one. Is that the way to go? From the point of view of the Greens (WA), it is not going to make the taxation system fairer than it is now. We will still be taking a step back, no matter how many of these amendments we get up.
That is my explanation to Senator Cook. This is a vain hope and wildly enthusiastic assumption that this is what parliament should do. This is what a taxation system should be, and perhaps at some stage we might magically get rid of all the other words in this consumption tax bill. I suppose it would not be surprising to you that Greens generally do not have a problem with consumption taxes. I have mentioned before that we like the idea of being able to use the tax system to link in some of the real costs of consumption choices and to be able as governments to have some influence in progressing in a really positive way to the future: green jobs, green futures and a healthy environment. Wouldn't it be nice? So consumption taxes are not a problem for the Greens. Flat rate, unfair consumption taxes are definitely a problem, because they give no signal at all—in fact, in many cases they give exactly the wrong signals—in relation to consumption choices. They suggest that the market will solve everything, and you 
 would have to be naive to suggest that that is the case.
That is my explanation. It is a vague, ideological hope for the future that I thought we might put into the tax system bill so that someone at some stage will say, `This is what the parliament would like,' even if we have got no hope whatsoever in this debate of achieving it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-04-28,"—I have been following this debate with great interest, and I think we are actually advancing our understanding of what is fair and what is not fair. In response to Senator Margetts, let me say that the Democrats really are aiming not just to improve this tax package but to set a vision for the future in terms of the present tax regime. As many speakers have said, that regime is not fair at the present time, whether you take the way that the tax burden is shifted onto PAYE taxpayers, whether you take the ability of people on high incomes to avoid tax to a very large degree or whether you address the issue of bracket creep. All of those things ensure that the current system is unfair. So our amendments, such as those proposing different tax scales, such as those addressing the diesel fuel issue and the effect that has on the environment, such as those making it fairer for local government, such as those addressing poverty traps, all really go beyond simply the package as it is presented and address the present tax system, which in itself is quite unfair.
I want to pick up something that my colleague Senator Murray said about the whole issue of language. Language is a very important issue. Language is very important when we are addressing the way in which this government uses language. I have been interested to watch the debates over the last three years and to see that often this government turns language on its head. It makes language mean something quite the opposite to its normal meaning or to the way in which we have used words in the past. A thing like `mutual obligation' has a very positive ring about it, but in the mouth of this government has really meant imposing impossibly high hurdles for those at the bottom of the heap to have to climb or jump over. So language is 
 very important, and I will address that issue in a moment to give an illustration of exactly what I mean.
The whole issue of compensation is also important, as Senator Cook has been pointing out. Not only is it that obviously this package must be unfair if you need to compensate people, not only is it that perhaps at a future time some government will reduce the compensation package—and that is not only possible but likely, I must say—but also it is the attitude which says to people, `Because you are losers, exist on the edge of society and are at the bottom of the heap, the only way that you can be included is if we compensate you with a kind of grudging charity. We do not treat you fairly. We do not see that you are part of the community and therefore to be valued for your own sake. You are a loser and because you are a loser then we will trickle down to you something, some grudging charity, which may serve to keep you alive, but we will impose on you mutual obligations. We will make sure that your life will be as miserable as possible.' That is really what the kind of language that this government uses means.
I said before that in the global market the largest group of losers is the unemployed. I also said in the previous debate that the plight of the unemployed is made worse by the attitude of the market which declares them not only to be losers but to be worthless as well. Let me illustrate this point about the attitude of this government by simply taking account of the history of the last three years. It is instructive to read a recent defence of Mr Peter Reith by the Prime Minister as an illustration of the attitude. The following is an unedited version taken directly from Australian Associated Press:
(The Prime Minister) backed Employment Minister Peter Reith after the release of his radical employment proposals, saying he was lucky to have a Minister who cared. Mr Howard welcomed the letter sent to him from Mr Reith last December outlining a raft of potentially drastic changes to wages, awards, benefits and tax.
""Can I again take the opportunity of congratulating the Minister,"" Mr Howard told parliament. ""Less than a month after he's got the responsibility, he's in there with 20 pages of ideas. I could be so 
 lucky to have a Minister who is so determined to do something about unemployment.
Talk about turning language on its head! It continues:
You want Ministers who care, you want Ministers who are dedicated and I am lucky that I have got a whole frontbench of Ministers who care.""
The article goes on:
Mr Reith was forced last night to release secret government papers outlining his proposals for a major shakeup of jobs and workplace relations after the opposition distributed leaked copies of a draft. Mr Howard asked Mr Reith to prepare a detailed paper on the proposals by this month.
Mr Reith wants to force all adults unemployed to take part in work for the dole, job training or literacy courses, or have their dole cut, and for work for the dole numbers to be counted as jobs in data. Other proposals include a discounted wage for the long-term unemployed, a single simplified benchmark award for the no disadvantage test for agreements, sidelining the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and exempting companies hiring unemployed people from unfair dismissal laws.
These are all examples of a minister who cares! That is not even turning language on its head; it is abandoning language altogether. I believe the most telling part of this report is the comment by the Prime Minister that the proposals put forward by Peter Reith show that the government cares. It is worth repeating part of his comment:
. . . I am lucky that I have got a whole frontbench of Ministers who care.
To me it is frightening that this Prime Minister and his government have so subverted the language of compassion that they can describe bashing unemployed people as caring for them.
Let me press a little further—in particular the decision to force unemployed people who fail to meet literacy and numeracy standards into remedial courses. No-one disputes the need for remedial courses. I know people who are illiterate. That they cannot read or write is a terrible burden for them, one they try to live with every day. Most of them desperately want to overcome this handicap, but to tell them that they will lose their unemployment benefits because they have refused to learn is to push that desperation beyond breaking point. 
There is one thing that this government does not understand or perhaps it is so determined to blame the unemployed for their situation that it refuses to admit it, but the fundamental reason why people do not have jobs is that there are not enough jobs. It is not that people do not want to work. It is not that they are illiterate, although no-one discounts what a handicap that is. The fundamental reason why people are out of work is that there is not enough work to go round.
So when the Democrats want to address the language of this government it is for very good reasons. And those reasons are not simply plucked out of the air. They are there for everyone to see in the history and attitude of this government to unemployed people, to people whom they regard as losers, to people who live on the edge. For those reasons the Democrats believe that this package must be addressed. It has to be radically altered and, in the end, if it cannot be made fairer then we will also vote against it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-28,"—Senator, I heard your remarks and it will not surprise you that I profoundly disagree with the interpretations you put on the government's motives. We think that just one of the ways you can help the disadvantaged in our society is to tackle the fundamental issue of unemployment. The record of this government shows that we have been able to get the unemployment rate down to 7.4 per cent, which is the lowest in a decade. So, Senator, we do not give any ground to anyone on the need to tackle fairness and the areas of disadvantage in our community, and we believe we have the policy program to achieve that.
In your remarks you entered into a wider debate. We think that some of the measures you have proposed, which have been vigorously debated in this chamber, do not tackle the issue of unemployment in this community and in fact work against making sure that issue is appropriately tackled. I do not propose to canvass those debates at this stage, but this government give the highest priority to making sure we tackle issues like unemployment. You are opposed to schemes like Work for the Dole; we are not. This chamber 
 is not. This chamber passed the government's bills on this issue because, presumably, at least the majority in this chamber thought that those measures were important and fair.
The government's major paper put out prior to the election, Tax reform: not a new tax, a new tax system, contains the objectives the government laid down for a new tax system. We set out in some detail what the government's objectives were. They cover a number of pages in the so-called ANTS document. For example, the heading `Incentive: a fairer tax system with greater reward for effort' is one of the summary objectives we put down. In that document we argue:
The new tax system will be fairer. It provides stronger incentives to work and save.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The new system will also give much greater recognition to the costs of raising a family.
Family benefits, as we know, will be significantly increased in real terms. We went on in some detail to outline what we see as a fairer tax system, including a greater reward for effort. Another objective is `Security: sounder finances for government services'. We argue:
The new tax system will deliver higher economic growth through more competitive Australian exports and import competing products, as well as through higher investment driven by lower industry costs.
We went through how we could put government finances on a sounder basis. All of us would think that is another important objective. I suspect it is one of the arguments Senator Murray has used from time to time. Of course, this is one of the reasons we have been able to achieve, with the state governments, a major reform in Commonwealth-state financial relations which provides state governments with a more robust source of revenue to finance their important responsibilities: health, education and welfare.
The next objective we put forward in the ANTS package was `Consistency: a tax system which boosts business and investment, and promotes Australian exports'. One of the ways to tackle unemployment is to make sure we have a vibrant, healthy and expanding business sector. In this very comprehensive tax package we put a range of measures to 
 assist business so that business by growing can create jobs. But there is not a given set of jobs—which is what some people may have taken from your remarks. What we need to do is create the circumstances in which jobs can be created. Hence we have given a particular focus in this tax package to a tax system which boosts business and investment and promotes Australian exports. Another objective that we outlined was `Simplicity: making the tax system easier to deal with'. We note:
The structure and administration of family assistance will be revamped and consolidated to simplify arrangements and reduce confusion and inconsistencies . . . Businesses will be able to deal with the whole of government through one business number.
I made some remarks on that particular issue in question time today. The Treasurer, in presenting these bills in the other place, drew our attention in his remarks to what he saw as important aspects of the bill, including increased fairness. He said:
Some high earners are avoiding obligations and taking advantage of government assistance given to low income earners by converting income into fringe benefits.
He highlighted this particular issue:
This way they get their monetary income down to qualify for income support even though their actual remuneration, including benefits, is much higher.
In his remarks in the other place, the Treasurer drew our attention to the importance of fairness. This leads to my attitude to the amendments which have been moved. As I said, the government supports a fairer tax system. We clearly support the removal of the outdated and inequitable wholesale sales tax. Our political opponent, the Labor Party, supports the wholesale sales tax. We do not support that system. What Senator Woodley has outlined does not go near what the government said in its very comprehensive statement where it outlined its objectives very clearly. It touches on some aspects of the government's objectives, but it does not touch on all of them.
In developing our tax package, we took particular care to ensure, as I said, that the new system would be fairer for families and those on low and fixed incomes. The new system has been designed so that any increase in the cost of living, for example, is more 
 than offset by income tax cuts, increases in pensions and benefits and other measures for lower income earners. The amendments, in our view, are not necessary. It is not appropriate to include them in a bill that deals largely with technical material and definitional issues. As I said, the government's objectives and aspirations are clearly set out in the document that I was reading from earlier.
To conclude, the amendment proposed by the Democrats, including the amendment proposed by Senator Margetts to the amendment, does not reflect the full range of objectives that the government is pursuing through this package of legislation. For this reason, as well as the others I have indicated, the government does not support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I rise to speak against the amendment. I would like to read it briefly, even though it has been talked about a lot. It states:
It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act and associated laws for a new tax system:
(a) 	 be fairer than the wholesale sales tax system they replace; and
(b) 	 promote redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich.
I would like to start by speaking briefly about (b) before I come back to (a). Probably the most interesting of the submissions on the question of the totality of the redistribution of the package came from Dr Johnson during his presentation. Dr Johnson, like almost all the academic economists that appeared before us, is a supporter of the GST.
—It's not Samuel Johnson.
—No, it is not Samuel Johnson. He was commenting on the impact in general and the notion of equity and fairness and what that meant. He said:
That means that, if you accept that being worse off is just related to their cash situation, you might conclude from that, `Oh well, everybody is better off, end of story—the package is fine.'
That was working on all the government's favourable assumptions. He went on to say:
But I would claim that it is not just the absolute cash effect but it is also the relative effect that is important. When people think about whether they are worse off or not, they have got in mind not just some sort of absolute concept but a relative concept 
 as well. It seems to me that a more appropriate target would be to have constructed a package that maintains exactly the same sort of distributional pattern that we have got before the change.
Senator O'Chee then made this telling interjection:
That assumes that you want to achieve that effect. It assumes that you want to have high effective rates of taxation on people who are earning, say, $40,000 or $50,000 a year.
Dr Johnson replied:
You are quite right, it does assume you want to have that effect, but the alternative is that you are saying that higher inequality is better because the incentive effect on higher income people will increase efficiency to a greater extent.
—Reward effort is what they call it.
—That is what they call it, exactly. Dr Johnson then said:
I think both of those things are debatable. First of all, it is not immediately clear that the highest tax rates are amongst the high income people. We have had a lot of discussion about what we call effective marginal tax rates.
That is a possible test for this package. It is not one that I would necessarily sign up to, but it is at least a starting point for the discussion on whether this package promotes the redistribution of the load in the tax system from the poor to the rich, which it clearly does. There is no better illustration than this government's desire to spend $13 billion worth of taxpayers' money handing out, in the form of tax cuts, 52 per cent—over half of that $13 billion—to the richest 20 per cent in this country.
—That's redistribution.
—Thank you, Senator Murray; I will take that. Senator Woodley is gesturing `up'. That is absolutely redistributing upwards from the poor to the rich. That is the reason St Vincent de Paul said that this was un-Australian.
—Un-Australian.
—That is exactly right. It is un-Australian. That is what St Vincent de Paul said. Almost every individual part of this package fails the fairness test, which is why we reject the amendment from the Democrats and, necessarily through that, the amendment 
 from the Greens. It is a brave and optimistic assumption that believes that this package was ever designed to be fair in any way, shape or form. It is a brave and optimistic assumption that by making some changes—I think Senator Murray used the word `savage'—you can make this package fair.
At the end of the day, even after you have made some changes—despite any haggling that goes on in these situations, you will not get all that you want—this cannot fundamentally fix the tax cuts and the income tax evasion that is still going on and which has not changed. They are proposing changes to the PPS system; they are going to weaken it and make it easier to slip out of the PAYE tax system. There is also the regressive nature of the GST itself and its impact on small business.
That is one of the ironies of this. For the party that for years has championed itself to small business, I will come to some of the effects on small business and what exactly they are as opposed to what is claimed. But before I do that, I would like to come back to the first part, where it says:
(a) be fairer than the wholesale sales tax system they replace;
I have always been perplexed by the argument that you can make a consumption tax, a GST, fair. The wholesale sales tax was designed to exempt food. It was designed to be multiple rated. As Senator Margetts suggested, she is not opposed per se to consumption taxes; she is just opposed to one flat rate.
The wholesale sales tax is designed in quite an equitable way. What has happened is that we have seen all the accountants and lawyers in the country who have spent their lives trying to find ways to exploit the English language in court—
—Not all of them.
—Almost all of them, Senator Forshaw. What we have seen is a concerted campaign from the business sector to try to portray that it is a ramshackle wholesale sales tax system, that it is complicated, that it is difficult and that the compliance costs are extreme. But even the tax office in a recent study found that the compliance 
 administration costs for the wholesale sales tax were actually the cheapest of all the tax systems proposed. In comparison with the GST, on which a whole range of studies has now been done, it pales into insignificance.
So I say to you: putting in place a GST instead of a wholesale sales tax is in fact your first fundamentally flawed belief in trying to make this package fair, because the wholesale sales tax allows you to tax luxury items. It allows you to make a choice and say, `I think this good deserves to be taxed at a greater rate than that good.' It is not some simplistic accountant's version of efficiency which, unfortunately, Treasury seems to have been captured by, and has been for years. I would have to say, particularly to any Treasury officials listening, to Dr Carnahan or anybody out there who is listening right now—
—I think they are far too smart for that.
—They probably are, Senator Kemp—that you have been captured by the accountants. Treasury are meant to be the economic brains of this country; they have been hoodwinked by accountants. There is no economic theory that says you have to have a single rate tax. It is actually not there. If you study Ramsay and his readings—and those of you involved in the tax debate would know whom I am referring to—optimal tax theory does not say `single rate'. Accountants have captured Treasury. That is quite unusual because it is normally the other way around—Treasury captures everybody. But in this particular instance we have seen, for 10, 15 or 20 years, Treasury of the belief that it is more efficient to have a single rate tax, ignoring all economic theory and all economic taxation policy theory.
It surprises me that Treasury has allowed itself to be hoodwinked in such a way over so many years. Yes, it is very difficult to have the Ramsay optimal tax theory in real practice—that is true. But when we are talking about the concept of economic efficiency do not confuse it with accounting efficiency. Of course accountants want just one single rate. It is simpler, easier, the best way to do it and less paperwork for an accountant—wonderful. Yes, that is accounting efficiency for you.
—My accountant doesn't like the GST.
—Most accountants have been pretty much hoodwinked so far by the organisations that they represent, and a lot of them are going to be in for a very rude shock, Senator Margetts; that is absolutely right. My accountant, at a global level, is rubbing his hands at the extra money he is going to be able to charge everybody but certainly, from the perspective of the amount of work involved, he is in for a lot more work. Turning to the Irish option, which was recently adopted and which is the core of your amendment—
—Is that Northern Ireland or Southern Ireland?
—Senator Quirke, I am not sure on that. Again, you have made a deliberate decision to leave out processed food—I am amazed. You have left out processed food, which means it is in the GST rate. What we have is an argument that fresh food can be GST free but that food bought in packets cannot be. I am confused by this because I am sure that if you did a study—like St Vinnies and a couple of the other associations that I have mentioned have—and went through it you would find that, despite the fact that studies over the years have always shown that fresh food is better for you, someone keeps buying processed food. Someone keeps going out there into those supermarkets and putting it into their trolleys and taking it home. I am willing to bet that if St Vinnies, Treasury or anybody else wanted to go and have a look they would actually find that it is people at the lower end of the market.
—It's the devil among the group.
—It probably is, Senator Murray, but your proposed amendments, not just this one but also the ones that carry through, are inequitable in their own right. Where you intend to leave the line on food means that if you are able to have enough storage, have a big enough car, make enough trips, wander down to the supermarket every couple of days and do not have a big family, you are able to stock up on fresh foods. But 
 if you do shift work and you do not have time—you do the one big shop a week or one big shop every two weeks—you are left in a position where you are buying the processed food and you are going to be taxed more. I said that I am willing to bet a lot that the people in the lower income brackets are the major consumers of the processed foods. So in saying that the system that has to be introduced has to be fairer than the wholesale sales tax system I think you are failing the fairness test yourselves.
—The model is very close to the wholesale sales tax system.
—No. I accept that it is very close, but it is not the same. You do not have to just adopt the Irish option. It could be the northern Irish, the southern Irish or the modified Irish—it could be anything you wanted; it is your amendment.
—Order! Senator Conroy, please address your remarks through the chair.
—In the couple of minutes remaining to me, I would like to mention one article in particular in today's press that needs to be read into the record. I wish Senator Harradine were here—I hope he is listening, and I particularly hope ACOSS enjoyed their meeting today. This is an article by Paul Cleary in today's Financial Review , and it is headed `30pc company tax ""wipes $500m a year""'. It states:
The Government's Ralph review cannot achieve the goal of a 30 per cent corporate tax rate without running down the Budget surplus by at least $500 million a year, according to confidential Treasury estimates that extend for 10 years.
I am just pleased Treasury found some time in their busy schedule to do a bit of long-term modelling on revenue—I am very pleased. It is just a pity they could not find the time during the tax debate or our inquiry to do some on the ANTS package. But the killer here for the government, which blows the whistle on fairness, is the following statement:
Sources from the Business Coalition for Tax Reform admit RBT cannot achieve revenue neutrality, but hope the Government will deliver a 30 per cent tax rate and deal with the revenue consequences later. One source said business groups 
 hoped the hidden cost of the agenda remained a sleeper in the tax debate.
Is it any wonder that the Senate stands here today and says, `Fair dinkum, this package is a crock'? The government have always been about looking after their mates. They could not help themselves—they have blown the whistle themselves. The revenue projections are shockers! Don't mention the war! No wonder they would not produce any ANTS package modelling.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-04-28,"—This amendment is very difficult to comprehend as to how it fits into the legislation, because it really expresses the aspirations of a couple of great senators, and this is one of the reasons why I rise tonight. Senator Murray, who moved the amendment, has done great work in this. And, Senator Margetts, I take this occasion to pay tribute to your work in this chamber. You leave here all too soon, and it is good to see that you have raised in your amendment to the amendment an issue that you have spent much of your time—but not all of your time—in promoting, and that is ecologically sustainable development. You have certainly done great work in other places too, and it is good to see that this amendment has come forward in the names of Senator Murray and Senator Margetts.
On the other hand, it is very difficult to see just what purpose this amendment serves in this legislation. If this legislation were to be brought before the High Court for judgment as to its meaning, I think the High Court would say, `The intention of this new system is that it be fairer.' Do we expect the court to legislate to make the system fairer? No, of course it cannot do that. It is for the parliament to make it fairer, and I would have thought it is the intention of everybody in the chamber, no matter what side they come from, to make it fairer. The big question is: does this make it fairer? And we have heard the various arguments that go backwards and forwards.
—It is a mission statement, Senator Cooney.
—It is a mission statement, but should a mission statement be put at the head of the policies that a party pursues 
 or at the head of a piece of legislation which is really a technical prescription as to how the goods and services tax is to work? If it is at the head of a piece of legislation, then it is probably not well placed. Perhaps we could move a motion that this is what we propose—that we propose good things.
The other thing is this: as I understand it, the new tax system contemplates a whole range of measures, and this amendment does not attend to those. It really says that the only thing we are interested in is the wholesale sales tax system. It leaves floating the views the Democrats have about the other parts of the system. The amendment goes on to say that we want to `promote redistribution of the load of the tax system from the poor to the rich'. If I were putting it forward I would probably say `promote redistribution of the load of the tax system so that those more capable of paying do the paying'.
I do not think it is a bad thing to be rich. I think it is a good thing for everybody to have sufficient assets. Everybody in any society, and particularly in Australian society, ought to have proper clothing, proper food, proper housing and a comfortable style of living. If that is attended to, I do not think there is any great problem about having rich people in society. We should not dislike the rich simply because they are rich.
I think the motion put forward by Senator Margetts that we as a parliament should `promote ecologically sustainable development' is correct, but again it is very difficult for a piece of legislation to have this at the front of it and then to go out and do its job. It really comes down to what function this amendment would perform, and it is hard to see that it performs any function except to indicate that there are true spirit and great aspirations in the hearts of Senator Murray and Senator Margetts. As I finally sit down, Senator Margetts: we are going to miss you.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-04-28,"—I now move to the conclusion of my remarks in this debate. As I have said, fundamentally the reason we are rejecting this amendment is that, however you fiddle with this package, the realities are that 
 the GST is a regressive tax and the 10 per cent GST will rise. We know that whatever fancy arrangement the government puts in place will be a fraud and it will not prevent the tax from increasing in the future. We also know the harsher reality is that the compensation will erode or future governments will override the compensation package. Finally, we know the reality is that the tax cuts offered up as a bait—a cynical money bait for what some people perceive to be a short-term dollar advantage but at their long-term cost—to buy their way into a new tax system will be regressive over time and damage ordinary Australians in the future.
Whichever way you cut it, the arguments all fetch up on the shores of those realities. That is the reason it is inappropriate, in our view, to enshrine in the legislation arguments which, on the first branch, I disagree with as a matter of fact and which, on the second branch, are a worthy aspiration in their own right but not true of this legislation and not true of the amendments that we have now seen that would, if all were successful, amend this legislation. I remain firm on that point.
It has been said in this debate that language is important, that we should pay attention to language because language expresses an idea, contains an aspiration and sometimes encompasses a view or a culture and that it is important that we use language in this way to express the aspirations of Australians about taxes. I do not disagree with what is being said in relation to the aspirations that we should express—indeed, they are fundamental to the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party—but I think it is improper or it does not fit, if you want to take a softer interpretation, to put those aspirations in GST legislation because they are not true of that legislation. It might be truer of some other legislation; it is certainly not true of this legislation.
While we are talking about the importance of language, let us just spend a second considering what the government has said about this. The government persists in saying—and many pundits write is as if it were a fact—that this package is tax reform. They keep calling it the `reform agenda'. Reform is a matter of opinion; it is not a matter of fact. 
 Reform is a subjective judgment. The word `reform' is a word that suggests change with improvement. To use the word `reform' here is to use language wrongly and misleadingly. This is not a package of change with improvement; this is a package of change with regression. Nonetheless, to give it the public relations glimmer that the government seeks, it uses the word `reform' and many people in the media slavishly refer to it as tax reform as if this were an objective fact of life—it is not. I was distressed last week to hear an ABC newsreader refer to this as tax reform as if it were a fact. It is an opinion. If we are going to use language correctly, we ought to be very careful not to describe this as tax reform but as a package of tax changes which in their sum total are regressive.
But those are not the reasons that I rise at this stage of the debate, because the debate has moved on from some of those points. One of the points that it moved on to was the point that Senator Woodley spent some moments talking about in what I thought was a very useful contribution to the discussion in this chamber. He referred to issues of employment. What we know from the independent work done by the Senate in economic modelling is that this tax package is a jobs killer. In his evidence, Professor Dixon used those words: `This is a jobs killer. This kills jobs.' That is what he said, and he is the independent commissioned expert. In fact, his modelling showed that 120,000 jobs would be lost because this tax would be imposed on services which were, in the main, tax free and which were in the most rapidly increasing areas of employment in Australia. If you impose extra costs on those services—tourism, in particular, but education, exports and a whole range of other services—it will reduce jobs because it will make those services more costly.
It is in that context that a question was asked in question time today of the minister at the table. Let me just go back to the background of that question. The European Union News is not a trade union journal; it is the news-sheet of the European Union Commission's delegation to Australia, accredited to this nation, representing the members of 
 the European Union. It is authorised by the ambassador accredited to this nation as the Ambassador of the European Union—and a very good ambassador he is. This is a regular publication that is published by that delegation accredited to Australia and its objective is to keep Australians briefed on developments in Europe—a laudable objective.
What did this year's April/March publication of the European Union News say? A page in that magazine headed `In Brief' deals with a whole range of things under the headings, `EU aid to education in PNG', `An end to pesticides in baby foods', `Delegation on the Internet', `Former Yugoslavia: EU aid worth Euros69mn'. There is a whole series of snippets of information, but among them was the headline `Could a reduced VAT help create jobs?' For the Hansard record, the article said:
For the past year, EU leaders have been considering the proposition that reducing the Value Added Tax (VAT) on certain labour-intensive services could help boost employment. Such services would include housepainting, house renovations, domestic help and aged care, housekeeping services, and some environmental services. They now suggest that a reduced VAT apply in Member States from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002 to test the truth of the proposition. Obviously, the impact is expected to be greatest in those EU countries having a higher VAT. The current minimum VAT rate in the EU is 15% with several countries applying rates of 20% or more.
The VAT is a GST type tax. What the European governments that have experienced this tax are saying is, `If we reduce it in services areas, more jobs might be created. Let's give it a fly, let's try it out. Let's run an experiment across the whole of the European Union—one of the biggest populations of advanced developed countries in the world—and test that proposition because we think jobs are more important than a flat regressive tax.' This is all governments, of all political stripes: conservatives, social democrat, whatever—a fairly comprehensive coverage of a developed country's political spectrum. It is not just the social democrats, the brother or sister parties of the Labor party, saying this; conservative governments are saying this as well.   
We should heed this in Australia. The message is in Europe: `We think a VAT or a GST destroys jobs. Unemployment is a big problem for us; let's try to address the unemployment problem by reducing VAT levels.' If the experiment proves to be right, obviously what follows is a more considered view, across the issue, of removing it. In view of that experience—in view of the laboratory of Europe for a GST—why should Australia move into that zone of following the leader and committing the mistake they made with a GST? This speaks to the findings of the Monash report on a GST, that it is a job destroying tax.
I have taken some time to put these views because they are important to the debate about fairness. It is not fair that Australians ought to be unemployed and not have an ability to obtain a job when they are seeking a job. This parliament should not put obstacles in their way to make it harder for them to get one. This parliament should not put obstacles in their way in the economic system or tax system.
—Unfair dismissals, that's what you did.
—Let's have another debate about unfair dismissals because this parliament should not penalise workers in the workplace by removing their rights to fairness in treatment as employees, and pretending that it is doing something about employment simply by rotating those in the workplace with those out of the workplace through the jobs that are available—and not creating new jobs and infringing the rights of individuals. It should not do that. That is why we took the view we did on unfair dismissals.
But the parliament should not put economic obstacles in the way of the unemployed. The message out of Europe, loud and clear, reported here, is that a goods and services tax will do that. It was interesting, Minister, to hear your answer in question time which, in essence, was that unemployment levels in Europe are higher than in Australia. Is that because they have got a GST and we have not? Is that the reason? Is the reason why unemployment is higher on average in Europe than in Australia that they are reversing their 
 VAT or reducing their level of VAT? These are messages that are fundamental to the debate about fairness and underline the reluctance with which the Labor Party approaches this issue.
I want to go to another matter of fairness because my time is rapidly eroding. We moved, in the second reading stage of this legislation, a number of motions attached to particular bills. This is a question for the Australian Democrats, because we are talking about a question of fairness, and in talking about fairness, we assume we are talking about the same thing. One of the motions we moved that the Democrats abstained from voting on, and therefore it was lost, was a motion in relation to the personal income tax cuts bill to add the following:
the Senate condemns the government for:
(a)	 unfair tax cuts, with more than 50% of the benefits going to the top 20%  of income earners;
(b)	 tax cuts for higher income earners which far outweigh the increases in social security payments for lower income earners; and
(c)	 creating a situation where a couple with no children earning $100,000 gets 5 times the benefit of a low single income family with three children.
I would like to direct a question through you, Mr Chairman, to the Democrats which they may wish to take on notice and answer when we resume this debate. Would they explain the fairness of not voting for that type of proposition?

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-04-28,"—This week is Quarantine Week and we should all reflect on how quarantine protects our primary industries, our lifestyles and our environment. Australia benefits substantially from being an island, geologically isolated from its neighbours. This isolation has ensured we maintain a relatively clean and pure 
 status, free from most of the diseases, pests and weeds that are so prevalent in other resourceful countries. Our agricultural industries are world-renowned for their quality, disease free status and low chemical usage. The agriculture from my own state of Tasmania is particularly sought after, being free from fruit fly and other pests which do inhabit mainland Australia.
In 1997 the Commonwealth government committed $76 million to overhauling and upgrading government quarantine resources. It is essential that Australians become aware of and practise good quarantine policy. In Tasmania, the Tasmanian Agricultural Productivity Group and Tasmanian Development and Resources have developed Tasmania's Agricultural Trail. This initiative was funded by industry sponsors and the federal Department of Industry, Science and Resources. Launched in February, the Agricultural Trail features stylised water tanks with storyboards explaining local crops and produce ranging from alpacas and tiger snakes to wine grapes and onions.
This agricultural tourism initiative is highlighting Tasmania's rich primary products to the state's constant stream of visitors. Tourists arriving in Tasmania see the water tank storyboards at major points of entry and, driving around Tasmania's scenic rural roads, they are alert for the water tank storyboards that tell them more about agriculture in action. They witness vegetables growing and being harvested and lean, clean, grass fed beef grazing on lush pastures. Dairy cattle feed on perennial pastures without grain supplements, giving sought after local cheeses their distinctive flavour and guaranteeing shelf space in gourmet delicatessens around the world. Mainland Tasmanian sheep are free from all major chronic sheep diseases, and Quarantine work very hard to maintain this.
Visitors are able to visit museums showcasing Tasmania's agricultural past and the rising industries of Tasmania's future. Cheese factories, vineyards, wool centres, honey factories, fruit orchards, aquiculture centres, a deer farm, a lavender farm, a spirit distillery 
 and the historic `Woolnorth' property are all featured on the Tasmanian Agricultural Trail.
A calendar of special events guides visitors to agricultural shows and other activities. On 6, 7 and 8 May, Tasmania's biggest agricultural fair is to be held. Agfest at Carrick in the north of the state is the Agricultural Trail's main tourist attraction in May. Agfest is a celebration of Tasmania's prowess in farming, food and crafts. More than 50,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days, and many of these people will come from interstate. Farmgate tourism is a growing industry in Tasmania, but it can prosper only because of the excellent quarantine efforts, the Tasmanian Quality Assured Program and other quality initiatives.
Tasmania's disease-free status and a significant quarantine push has led to the trial shipment of Tasmanian grown capsicums to Japan. This disease-free status must be maintained at all cost, and our quarantine endeavours must help us to achieve this. Tasmania is free from tobacco blue mould and fruit fly, and the rest of Australia is not. This is the only reason that the trial to Japan could proceed. Such is the significance of quarantine.
The capsicum shipment was part of a three-year industry partnership project led by Tasmania's Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment. Many people combined to make this shipment a reality and are to be congratulated on their initiative and enthusiasm. The capsicum trial is part of a wider program investigating the viability of greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and egg plants for Japan. Funding from the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation has been significant in making all this happen.
Tasmanians are indeed proud of their agricultural achievements, and they are proud of their reputation for clean, high quality food products in world markets. This is giving the state an edge in the development of new products and also with entering new markets.
The oceans around our shores provide a natural barrier against the spread of pests and diseases that endanger animals and plants. 
 Tasmania is the only state in Australia free from fruit fly, potato cyst, nematode, tobacco blue mould, the diseases of brucellosis and blue tongue in cattle and Newcastle disease in poultry, to name but a few. Their absence means that Tasmanian farmers are able to use fewer chemicals to protect their crops and animals.
Stringent quarantine requirements are in place to protect Tasmania's primary industries. All points of entry into the state are controlled by quarantine officers, and all imported plants, fruit, vegetables and animals are subject to examination upon arrival. Additionally, the gentle beagle quarantine dogs, much loved by older and younger visitors, assist significantly at passenger arrival points, whether by air or sea.
The quarantine threat is real and, in the words of our Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Mark Vaile, unless Australians lose their apathy towards quarantine the effort of providing $76 million in 1996 to overhaul and upgrade government quarantine resources will have been to no avail. Therefore, I use this opportunity to urge every Australian to become aware of what can and cannot be brought into Australia and, in turn, Tasmania to ensure our excellent quarantine status is maintained.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Quarantine Week</title>,Adjournment,22,1
