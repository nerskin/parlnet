"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-05-11,"—My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the European Union has expressed a formal concern about the negative effect of value added taxes upon employment in labour intensive industries? Can the Prime Minister confirm that the European Union is suggesting that a reduced rate of VAT apply to labour intensive service industries in order to increase employment in these industries and reduce the black economy caused by the VAT in these industries? Doesn't this demonstrate that value added taxes such as the proposed 
 GST destroy jobs and also worsen the black economy?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: European Union</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-05-11,"—Yesterday the Australian  included a public relations puff from Glenn Milne, headed `Moore's winning war game'. Its thrust was how clever the current Minister for Defence is in his dealings with the Defence hierarchy. We were regaled with the comment:
Moore has established his ascendancy. But the top brass and bureaucrats have responded positively. An accommodation has been reached and relations are now much smoother and more productive.
Quite frankly, that kind of view would certainly get very little currency with defence personnel or with those who are informed commentators in this policy field. As we all realise, a series of changes in Defence in regard to subcontracting and the disappearance of vast numbers of jobs finds morale in the defence forces at an all-time low. This matter of public importance today notes:
The disastrous impact on the Defence Reserves of the Coalition's industrial relations and defence policies.
The reality of the coalition's industrial relations policy is that it is hitting the question of the reserves in this country—their availability, the willingness of people to volunteer and their protection in doing so.
—Give it a go.
—The minister opposite says, `Give it a go.' His comments are certainly not reflected by the views of the Victorian state council of his own party, amongst others.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—`So what?' he says. The situation is that those changes to industrial relations have made reserve service so much more difficult and have left the Army Reserve understaffed and underprepared. These figures are borne out throughout this country, with virtually every state's recruitment figures at an all-time low, and 
 there is concern by the government as to the availability of people.
Reserves are different from career soldiers in that they are people who voluntarily give up their time; they are people who leave their studies and their families. If reserve service becomes too difficult with this lack of government support, people can easily depart from that service. It is a commitment that people willingly give to this country as a matter of very great importance. But, essentially, if reserve service is unattractive, if people find the sacrifices too much for them and if they are not protected, then they will simply drop out. They will simply not volunteer to serve in the reserves.
Reservists in this country comprise less than half of one per cent of the total work force. They obviously have very little bargaining power. Their interests are not taken up by strong organisations. It is not an issue that the media focuses on that often. They find themselves fairly isolated and unprotected. This means that it is incumbent on a government that is responsible—a government that makes speeches and issues press releases about the vital need for the reserves—to do something to protect their rights, given their lack of power in the political system and their lack of authority in the process.
But far from protecting reservists, the government has abandoned them to the marketplace. The coalition's Workplace Relations Act—driven as it is by an antiworker ideology—prevents reservists from obtaining defence leave as an award condition. In its determination to essentially strip conditions from workers in this country—the coalition has no faith in the ability of the Australian people to innovate, in our ability to educate, in our ability to be trained—and to drive down conditions so that essentially this becomes a rice bowl economy, this government has attacked the rights of reservists and removed their protection.
The chief blame for this rests with the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith. He has been determined and utterly committed to destroying the award safety net. He has legislated to remove defence leave as an 
 allowable award condition as of July last year. Essentially he is saying that it is not needed. He is saying that, when people in their workplace want to volunteer to work in the Australian reserves and to give up their time, it is not worth any consideration and is not worth any protection. Basically this means that people can get defence leave only at the discretion of their employer or through workplace bargaining.
Given the state of our labour market these days, which is an international phenomenon to some degree—the downsizing, the insecurity of people and the constant threat of people's jobs being contracted out—given that industrial environment, the question has to be asked: what is the workplace reality for these people? The reality is that employers are not keen to provide this leave. They are not bending over backwards to race out and allow people six or seven weeks off for induction training.
Equally, and I think this is reasonable, for all the altruism and sense of community of their fellow workers, what is occurring for the average worker in workplaces where there are fewer employees, where their fellow workers have to take up more of the burden and more of the slack when reservists are away, is that even their fellow workers are increasingly disinclined to want to have this leave for people. If one of your six work mates walks out to go away for six weeks, essentially you have to carry that burden. Very few employers are going to rush around and hire another person for the interim period.
We have a situation where both for this six- or seven-week induction period—this bright idea from the current administration—and for actually getting away for any reserve training, reservists are increasingly coming under pressure not to take that time. The coalition often recites words about encouraging employers to look after reservists. But, if reserve service is not important enough to be an allowable award matter, employers could be forgiven for thinking that the government's attitude towards reservists is that they are not important, not necessary.
The trade union movement have been concerned about the matter on behalf of their 
 members. To minimise the damage done by Minister Reith, they have attempted to argue that the Industrial Relations Commission should consider reserve leave as a form of cultural leave in terms of the personal leave test case. However, unfortunately, on 25 February Commissioner Lewin ruled against this submission in relation to the Higher Education General and Salaried Staff Award and removed reserve leave from that award. He clearly felt that the coalition's Workplace Relations Act gave him no other option. He had no way of protecting the rights of these reservists. I want to say that the pattern which the government told us was not going to happen is occurring around this country. Telstra, amongst other organisations, has indicated to its employees its belief that this leave is no longer necessary or important and its view that it will get rid of it.
We as an opposition think that the reserves are of vital importance to our defence preparedness. Our point is that the government's actions have seriously undermined the reserves. Quite frankly, the opposition is not alone in this view. The government's official Defence Reserves Support Committee is clearly dismayed by the government's action. The minister opposite, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, and others who are involved in this field would be aware of those views that have been made emphatically clear to the government. The chair of that committee—none other than former defence minister Sir James Killen—has made it clear that he is upset at the government's refusal to reinstate reserve leave as an award condition. He has promised to pursue the matter. I might add that it is not only in his official dealings with the government but also in the public arena that he has indicated his dissatisfaction with this government's policy. His concern—as a person who has been trying to encourage reservists—is that we are not recruiting reservists because of this government's policy.
I cite another person who has had some place in this debate, Minister Bishop. In February last year in her then role as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Minister Bishop wrote a nice, friendly letter to the Armed Forces Federation—another 
 lobby group that has an understandable interest in this policy area that is trying to secure some protection for reservists—saying:
I am well aware of the threat to reserve training as a possible outcome of the Workplace Relations Act, and my office is monitoring the issue closely. The ADF position and concerns are being well represented by the Office of the Assistant Chief of Defence Force (Reserves) who is actively pursuing the issue.
I am optimistic of a favourable long term outcome.
That letter was quoted in the Age  of 11 February last year. She promised a favourable outcome over a year ago. Her optimism was clearly misplaced. The minister for workplace relations, Mr Reith, has brushed her concerns aside and determined upon a policy which says that industrial relations changes are more important than protecting these reservists. More recently, Minister Reith has been disowned on the matter by his own party in his own home state. On 27 March the Victorian state council of the Liberal Party met to consider policy resolutions submitted by the coalition's state membership. They carried the following resolution. They thought the issue was important enough to resolve in this manner:
That this Council reaffirms its support of the Federal Government's commitment to strong and effective Defence Reserves, and urges the Government to ensure that `defence leave' for Reserve Defence Force Members is included as an allowable matter in federal awards.
Could there have been a stronger repudiation by the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party in a policy area Mr Reith has made an essential part of his ambitions? Repudiated by the Victorian state branch of the Liberal Party!
The other difficulty in this policy area, the other thing hitting reserves very badly, as well as the change to the Workplace Relations Act, is the issue of the difficulties coming from the Common Induction Training program. This requires new reservists to commit to up to six and seven weeks full-time induction training away from their home, their family and their studies, with full-time Army personnel. This change presents a further obstacle to potential reservists. How many employers will respond positively when one of their staff says, `Boss, I've joined the Army Reserve and I need six 
 or seven weeks leave for my induction training'? Obviously, precious few will respond positively. In fact, I know of no government of any state or territory, bar that of the Northern Territory—and obviously reserves are of great importance to that territory—to have legislated to give such leave in this circumstance. Certainly the federal government, supposedly so interested in reserves and their effectiveness, has not given such leave to its public servants.
Reservists are supposed to constitute 60 per cent of the Army. They are thus a crucial part of our defence preparedness. Under Labor the Ready Reserve ensured that there was a substantial reservist grouping who were well trained and at a heightened state of readiness for possible call-out for peacekeeping or humanitarian missions. The recent situation in Indonesia with its debate about whether Australia would send forces, at what level and how they would operate occasioned comment and concentration upon this issue—and, quite frankly, the Australian media exposed this government as basically being not able to put that force together without a heavy use of reserves.
Did the abolition of the Ready Reserve, a very early gesture of the government, do anything in relation to an increase in full-time Army positions? It certainly did not. Having accused Labor of leaving the ADF `undermanned', it has slashed thousands of full-time uniformed positions from our defence forces. The ADF has been battered on many fronts and, as I said earlier—and the government cannot deny this—the state of morale is at an all-time low.
It is not as though the government has not had some kind of indication of the problem. Late last year several newspapers revealed that, in every state, the Army was massively behind in its level of recruitment. Indeed, in four states it has apparently reached less than a third of the target. I repeat: less than a third of the target has been reached. On 12 January this year, the Townsville Bulletin, which does for obvious reasons take a deep interest in defence matters, reported that only 71 people had been recruited into the reserves locally 
 since the previous June. That represented less than 55 per cent of the local target.
While talking about Townsville, I would just move to the member for Herbert for one moment. He went on the public record in that same paper at one stage with the ridiculous proposition that defence reserve leave had never existed in awards in Australia. Quite frankly, with the number of awards that it has been taken out of and the debates about it in bargaining, et cetera mean that he is completely wrong in making that statement. It is quite unfortunate that, in an area where defence issues are so vital, we have a member who is so misinformed about industrial relations and the impact of reserves to say that this condition, which Mr Reith abolished, had never existed.
A further article in the Townsville Bulletin of 18 January quoted a reserves official, who was remaining anonymous, as saying, `We need the government to change the recruitment policy before the reserve falls over.' More recently, the issue has received extensive coverage following the government's decision to place a second brigade on 28 days readiness. On 3 May the Australian stated:
The Workplace Relations Act has resulted in many employers seeing a way out of having an obligation to provide defence leave . . . Defence leave is being thrown up more and more in negotiations in workplace bargaining agreements, whereas before it could not be. In a lot of cases it has been bargained away.
The following day, the Courier-Mail  stated:
In the three years since the election of the Howard Government, the Army Reserve—the army has most of the Defence Force's reservists—has endured enormous change without much obvious benefit . . . 
It went on:
The Ready Reserve was abolished. The reforms which followed the Defence Efficiency Review . . . were supposed to shift the emphasis from Regular-Reserve to full-time/part-time service.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,1999-05-11,"—I am happy to enter into this matter of public importance raised by the opposition. As usual, we are getting from the opposition spokesman 
 on defence personnel matters another confused message. It is one that does not reflect the policy that those opposite had in place and, as usual, their rhetoric never matches what they did when they were in government.
This MPI relates to defence policy and also the policy on reserves. The key principle of a reserve unit is to make it more relevant to the needs of the Defence Force today. That is why we have a reserve force. If those opposite would listen in some silence, as this side of the House did for them, they perhaps might learn something and be able to add something to the debate. If they are serious about ever wanting to be in government again, they ought to be prepared to contribute to this very important subject. And I would urge the shadow minister to make a more meaningful contribution than we have heard from him today.
What this government is doing is training the reserves to the same standard as the regulars so that they can be used more effectively than they have been in the past. That is the fundamental reason for having a reserve force; it is the fundamental reason for having a defence capability. We do not want a reserve force that is a `dads army'. We want a defence reserve force that is capable. That is why we have introduced Common Induction Training which provides training for regulars and reserves for a period of 45 days.
Already we are starting to see the results. I went to the first march out of the Common Induction Training of reserves and regulars at Kapooka in early January this year. The results speak for themselves. Around 94 per cent—and I hope the opposition is listening—of recruits are successfully completing training as opposed to around 80 per cent under the old system. Under the old Labor system, about 80 per cent would complete their training. Under our system, around 94 per cent are marching out. This will lead to higher retention and a better trained reserve unit, and that is what we are on about. They will be better trained.
Contrast this with the opposition's record on reserves. It is an appalling one. They were content to keep the regular reservists units separate from the Regular Army. They under 
 valued the skills that the reserves can bring to the Defence Force. That is what they have done: they have undervalued them. They do not place a benefit on them. We believe that if you are going to have a reserve force you have to value those skills and you have to give them the same skills as those in the regular services. Our policy is working, demonstrated by very positive results. Some 94 per cent of recruits are successfully completing their training as compared with 80 per cent under the old Labor policy. We intend to have an integrated defence force where reservists play an enhanced role. That is what we want, and we are committed to that.
The opposition spokesman spoke about reserve leave. An important part of reserve capability is having reservists available. They have to be available if you are going to have reservists. You have to have them available to undertake training in defence activity. If they are not going to be available for training and defence activities, they should not be in the reserve force. That is why you would have a reserve force. They need to participate in training on an ongoing basis. Our approach to reserve leave is one of consultation and one of cooperation, working with employers, the reservists and the Defence Force.
The opposition spokesman said that there was only one agency in Australia that had signed up to allowing reservists annual leave. He is wrong. He acknowledged employers like the Northern Territory government. I acknowledge that he got that right, but the Commonwealth Bank have signed up and Telstra have signed up. They have all recognised this and put in place flexible leave arrangements that give reservists the time they need to train. On the one hand, the opposition is acknowledging that the Northern Territory is doing something about this but, on the other hand, it is saying that no-one else is. That is patently wrong, because the Commonwealth Bank and Telstra are already recognising the value of reservists as part of their work force, because so often those who have trained in the reserves in the Defence Force have other skills—for example, leadership skills that are invaluable within the work force. That is what we are promoting as part 
 of the reserve training and encouraging recruits and employers to acknowledge the value of having reservists as part of their own valuable employees.
I think it is timely that we look at Labor's past record in relation to defence. I refer to Army 21, under a Labor government in power, and how they have run down the combat capability. This is the Army's own self-assessment taken from Army 21 after 13 years of Labor in power. I will quote from that document because it is enlightening to all members and to all Australians:
Units not adequately prepared for combat. Army lacks sufficient combat power. It would require substantial warning time and financial expenditure to mobilise for a major conflict.
It further states that with some exceptions units are understaffed, poorly equipped and have a low readiness level. This is an Army report on the defence capability, Army 21, after 13 years of Labor in government. We had to come to power to fix this mess up. That is the record. If that was on your child's record as they came home from school, what would you say? There is something wrong with that school. In this case, there was something wrong with the Labor Party in government because they did not have a commitment to the Defence Force and the capability of the Defence Force. That is the Army's own assessment.
I go back to it. It said that it would require substantial warning time and financial expenditure to mobilise for a major conflict. Why do you have a Defence Force capability? So that you can mobilise in the event that your Defence Force is required or that the Australian shores are being breached by other countries. That is why you would have a defence force. We have had to fix the mess that was left behind by the Labor Party, and the Army's own report condemns 13 years of Labor defence policy.
The defence efficiency review showed that under Labor around $1 billion or about 10 per cent of the defence budget was lost in waste, duplication and poor efficiency. We know that from their record in financial management. They were always wasting money. They were never really on top of the issues of efficiency. 
 This is what the defence efficiency review showed. Labor gave us the disastrous $600 million blow-out in the JORN program. Remember the over-the-horizon radar? That was great technology. In fact, the one in question is in my own electorate just south of Longreach, near Stonehenge. There was a blow-out of $600 million in one project. Who was going to fix that? The National and Liberal parties in coalition government have once again got to fix up another Labor mess.
The technology is great technology, but Labor cannot manage money. There was a $600 million blow-out and we have to fix it. At the end of the day, whose money is it? It is the money of the taxpayers of Australia. They provide the wherewithal for this infrastructure, and Labor was prepared to go down the line of wasting this money. There was no program management at all.
In 1993 Labor embarked on another badly thought through project, the ships of shame. It was a landing ship project for which Labor's projected cost was $61 million. You know what it blew out to? It blew out to $228 million. There was no management of the defence budget. It just ran itself. It lost capability. It would take a long lead time to mobilise our Defence Force. In other words, our country was at risk of invasion from a foreign enemy while ever Labor was on the Treasury benches. Those are the facts of the matter. When we came to government we said that we were going to fix it. What have we done? We are down the path of fixing the Labor mess. Let me just outline some of the initiatives that we have put in place since coming to government.
We have already freed up some 1,000 military positions, transferring them from administrative functions to combat or combat related duties. Already, a little over three years since we came to the Treasury benches, we have got 1,000 military positions out of the administration area—out of the hill up at Russell, pushing pens across desks and around corridors—into combat or combat related activities. This is all coming out of the defence budget, out of the efficiency review that we put in place. We are providing $100 million per annum to increase the readiness of 
 1 Brigade in Darwin; they have been put on 28 days notice to move. Labor had one brigade; we now have two. We have increased the capability and addressed the mess that the Labor Party left us.
We have increased funding for ammunition. If you are going to have a defence force, you must have not only the capability and the skills but also the ammunition—whether it be for the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force—to use in training. We have refitted the HMAS Tobruk—the Labor Party would have had it at the bottom of the ocean by now—with our Defence Reform Program savings money, and we have got an invaluable asset for the Navy. The HMAS Tobruk is retained in service. Most recently, we have leased an Incat catamaran from Tasmania to provide us with the capability to transport up to 500 troops at speeds of up to 40 knots across the open seas. That is about increasing the capability of our Defence Force. These are only very early results in relation to what we have been able to achieve in the three short years we have been in government.
At the last election Labor put forward a most interesting policy to the people; it was a real little pearler. They were going to form a standing Anzac battalion, an Australian and New Zealand battalion—they were going to ask the New Zealanders to commit to this battalion. But they were severely embarrassed over this, because they had not asked the New Zealanders, who thought it was a lousy idea and they rejected it. Once again they were embarrassed. Never thinking through the policy, and looking at a bit of populist rhetoric, they went out and said that we would have an Anzac battalion. We in this country—as do the New Zealanders—value our sovereignty and our independence when it comes to defence matters. That is what the Labor Party was prepared to trade away, but the problem was that they did not go and ask New Zealand whether it would agree.
Labor was going to reinstate the Ready Reserve. When they originally introduced the scheme in the early 1990s, they cut two battalions from the regular force. Their reserve policy is to reduce capability. They cut two battalions out of our capability, dimin 
 ishing the capability of our regular force, to put in a reserve force which we know was not working. The Army 21 report shows that our defence capability was being run down year after year whilst ever the Labor Party remained in government. We have had to fix up this mess.
We will continue with the Defence Reform Program, because we as a coalition government are committed to ensuring that our combat capability is second to none in the world. We are not going to listen to this populist rhetoric from the other side which is ill-informed and has no basis in policy at all.
—Before I call the next member, I say to the member for Bruce that the chair would be much obliged if he could refrain from muttering continually through the next speaker's contribution.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Defence Reserves: Government Policies</title>,Matters of Public Importance,8,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,1999-05-11,"—Having just listened to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, I shake my head. Obviously the minister has no grasp of his portfolio, no grasp of his responsibilities. I doubt that, in the times he has visited the various defence units around the place, he has ever gone beyond the officer's mess. That is certainly the indication one would get from listening to him. The minister bragged about a figure of 94 per cent of reservists graduating: 94 per cent of what? Once you counted Army reservists in their hundreds, particularly in country towns and regional areas. Now you can count them on the fingers of both hands; the numbers have fallen away. This government should start to take responsibility for that.
There is in Australia considerable concern at the run-down state of our armed forces and the lack of morale of our service personnel. If the minister got beyond the officer's mess he would find this out for himself. Evidence of this concern was well reflected by Lieutenant Colonel Ken Bladen (Retired), President of the WA branch of the Returned and Services League, who, during his Anzac Day address—I thought it was quite a courageous address—said:
In August last year US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and US Defence Secretary William 
 Cohen warned Australia that we were in danger of falling so far behind American military technology that our ability to participate in joint combined operations could be `severely restricted'.
Mr Bladen went on to say:
Currently, Australia is weak and unprepared.
We are well aware that the RSL is an extremely conservative organisation, and for them to express such views on a day like Anzac Day is a fair reflection of the concern they and the broader community have over the run-down and neglected state of our defence forces.
We also know that the Minister for Defence has said publicly that there will be no increase in defence spending in this budget. This is despite the uncertainty and instability of many regions of the world, some of which are uncomfortably close to Australia, and despite the urgent need for the upgrade of our defence equipment. A further reflection of our weakened state is seen with this government's decision to commit untrained Federal Police to East Timor rather than the properly trained and prepared Defence Force personnel who ought to be going to do a job like that.
In the face of these facts, you would think that this government would want to show some support for that all-important component of our defence forces, the Army Reserve—but no. Instead of support, we find that the bullyboy of the cabinet, Minister Reith, gets his way again and displaces good policy. The ministers for defence are either not interested in crucial portfolio issues or are so weak in cabinet that they are rolled and our defence interests are made subservient to ideologically driven workplace reforms. This government's strategy seems to be dogma first, defence last.
The Army Reserve is an integral part of our defence strategy. Indeed, I understand it is government policy to have 60 per cent of our Army made up of reservists. An integral part of reserve service is the ability to access paid leave for at least a portion of the time soldiers are required to commit to attending parades, camps, exercises and training. Paid leave only covers a portion of the time a soldier has to commit. The rest is made up of annual leave or leave without pay. A reservist negotiating a workplace agreement has hard choices to 
 make in difficult economic times in an environment of decreasing job opportunities with some employers seeing little value in allowing time for reserve training, and the time that is required is quite considerable.
On joining the reserve, a soldier is required to undertake 45 days of basic training—and you have to add to that travel, particularly for people who come from WA—an additional eight weeks of core or trade training and attendance at weekly parades and various camps during the year. In negotiating a workplace agreement, the soldier has to balance these commitments against the need for a decent wage and other workplace benefits he or she may be forced to concede in order to meet reservist responsibilities.
We all know that the heavy hand of Minister Reith's industrial relations legislation makes it much more difficult for workers in these situations when they are forced to negotiate from a position of relative weakness. The coalition's defence policies do little to take into account the needs of either the worker who is a reservist or the genuine employer who wants to support the reserve system. There needs to be a policy of support that gives incentives to both parties to ensure our reserve system again becomes a viable tool in our defence strategy.
The ministers responsible for our defence, Moore and Scott, should find the courage to stand up to Minister Reith and restore defence reserve leave as an award condition. The truth is that if these two ministers are good at one thing it is procrastination. They ought to get out into the defence service, talk to the reservists and make themselves aware of the commitment, the professionalism and the dedication of these soldiers and give them a bit of support.
The minister said during his rather inadequate response to Mr Laurie Ferguson that these people speak for themselves—that is, the reservists speak for themselves. I have a letter here from a reservist which I would like to share with the House. It states:
Dear Mr. Edwards
I am currently a member of the Australian Army serving under the now defunct Ready Reserve Scheme. I was attracted to the Ready Reserve 
 Scheme in 1995 whilst still at high school and as a prospective university student. I saw the scheme as an excellent way to enjoy the benefits of serving in the armed forces whilst studying for a university degree and subsequently joined under the conditions of a Ready Reserve soldier in January 1996 after my graduation from high school.
On the 9 February 1997, the Ready Reserve Scheme (RRes) concluded and many of the soldiers in the scheme transferred to the General Reserve (Special Conditions) or the GRSR, an idea designed to last until the last person who enlisted under the RRes completed their obligations. The GRSR was to have the same conditions of service that the RRes had. My reference for the information in this letter is the ""GENERAL RESERVE-SPECIAL CONDITIONS READY RESERVE PERSONNEL POLICY"" (DI(A) PERS 173-9). This document defines the different terms and conditions of service for the GRSR soldiers.
Recently these terms and conditions have been modified in such a way that they are detrimental to the majority of the GRSR soldiers myself included.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Our grief is simple in that the methods and ways in which we GRSR soldiers train now and the way that we used to train under the RRes system have been significantly altered. One of the most basic conditions of our service contract is that we must serve for a minimum of 50 days a year, 32 of which must be Continuous Military Training days (CMT). Hence there was two 16 day long exercises and one 32-35 day long exercise, which were scheduled in accordance with the major university holidays. The 32-35 day exercise, which normally operated in January/February and attracted the highest attendance of soldiers, has been cancelled. In place there is eight weekend training `opportunities'. Most of us are university students and some of us have part time jobs—which include working on the weekends. The conditions of the scheme that we all signed on to did not include weekends, and in the DI(A) PERS 173-9 paragraph 12 states that
"". . . formations and units must be mindful of the external demands placed on GRSR members, such as civilian employment and study.""
Those of us at university needing to study and complete assignments and projects, and those of us in civilian employment on the weekends will find the training schedule for 1999 very hard to complete.
They are put in an adverse position. I cannot finish all of the letter, but he goes on to say:
. . . but we did not join this Army just for the money.  

These blokes do a good job. These women do a good job. It is time this government gave them a bit of support. It is time they stopped the rhetoric. It is time they stopped trying to come in here to convince their colleagues that they are doing a good job. The people outside in the community know they are not doing a good job and they ought to wake up to themselves.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Defence Reserves: Government Policies</title>,Matters of Public Importance,8,1,speech
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,1999-05-11,"—I did not intend to cover any ground relating to my own Defence Force experience. Given those last comments, I am moved to say that, training at the infantry centre at Singleton in the early 1980s and training what we called initial employment trainees to go into the infantry corps, I was forced to train 10 soldiers at a time with two M60 machine guns because those who sat opposite, who were in government at the time, did not have the wherewithal to provide us in the peak training units with the weapons and the ammunition or the training hours with which to do the basic requirements for the defence forces which made up our regular defence forces, let alone our reserves.
I want to turn to this whole issue of `the disastrous impact of the coalition's industrial relations and defence policy on our defence reserves'. First of all, let us look at the second part—the defence policy. The defence policy to bolster our reserves is a simple one. Two weeks training is insufficient to enable any person to come off `civvy street', as we called it in the Army, and be made an effective member of the defence forces. It is simply not enough. Those opposite are basically standing here today saying that we should put reservists with just two weeks minimal training, which allows them to know how to put a uniform on, how to parade, how to put a rifle on their arm, and perhaps to know what the sharp end is and what the blunt end is, out with our regular forces. That simply is not the case.
When I was asked to speak on this today I rang some of the units and contacted some former colleagues of mine and asked them for their opinions. For those who do not know, today our regular forces and our reserve forces do the six weeks basic training to 
 gether, integrated—they get identical training. So no longer do we get comments back from the Army Reserve of `weekend warriors', `cut-lunch commandos' or `chocolate soldiers'. In my day they were held in absolute contempt because of their inability to work alongside the regular forces in training, let alone the thought of having to operate with these people in operations. It is not that we did not respect them for what they were trying to do; they simply were given neither the resources nor the time in training to be an effective force.
Today, with six weeks training, identical in every way and integrated with the regulars, they now have a sense of belonging. Without that sense of belonging, without that additional training, we find that we have an inadequate force to fall back on. Australia has always based its defence capabilities on having an expansionist force. We do not have the defence budget of America. We do not have the population where we can maintain a defence force of a million people or even of 150,000 or 200,000 people. So we rely on those people, as those opposite agree, who have the dedication and commitment to do something for their nation. They do not do this for nothing, as it was basically put by those on the other side; they are paid for all the time in which they train. They are paid to make a commitment for themselves and for their country, and we thank them for that.
Why do we stand here and argue a point from someone who knows nothing about defence matters that two weeks training is sufficient, when we all know that not to be the case? What do they get in six weeks? They become a more capable force. They have equal training with their regulars so they have the right footing to start off with. They are able to serve alongside regulars, and further down the track when both regulars and reserves are promoted through the ranks they will have had something in common. They will have built bonds and friendships, some of which—I must say, 20-odd years after I left the defence forces—still endure for me today from the days when I was in training. We will see an intermeshing of the experiences that they all shared at that junior level, at 
 recruit training, coming through when they are perhaps warrant officers or even officers. It also provides a solid basis upon which to deliver more advanced training.
In talking to one of the COs of a unit today, he pointed out to me that, whilst the reservists have now increased their training to six weeks, the regulars have come back to six weeks. That has highlighted a problem which I intend to take up with the minister, because the battalions and the other field force units are having to do a little more when they get them into the unit. But he said, `The flip side to that is that when we have reservists and when we are involved with them, they now have so much more basic training that we find it much easier to build on that and to come up with a far more competent soldier who can actually achieve something for Australia's needs.'
As I said, in my days in the defence forces it was not uncommon for everyone, from a private soldier through to the highest ranks, to refer with contempt and ridicule to our army reservists as `chocolate soldiers', `weekend warriors' and `cut-lunch commandos'. I think this will go a long way to integrating and making the reservists feel part of our defence forces in a real fashion, rather than being seen as the poor cousins.
Why the importance of training? Why do we, on this side of the House, see that it is not good enough just to simply have numbers so that a minister can stand before the parliament and say, `We have X number of units with X number of people'? Because in reality when they go to deliver on the ground we know that we cannot put those men into battle because we will be putting their lives more than at risk: we will be condemning them to death because we have not given them the basic training in the first place.
Go back through history to the American Civil War. At the battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, General Lee, the great general, defeated a much larger force. Why? Because he had better quality, better trained soldiers and good leadership. The Six-Day War saw the Israeli force of 260,000 men defeat a combined Arab force of 550,000. That is because they had the basic training and 
 because they were a well-oiled and cohesive team. If you want to turn to Australia, you need to look no further than to 6RAR in the battle of Long Tan in Vietnam when the courageous Delta Company overcame massive odds to defeat an enemy and remain intact. I had the privilege of serving with 6RAR many years after that battle. Esprit de corps comes from those sorts of victories in battle because of the training that was delivered to our professional soldiers. We should be delivering exactly the same level of training to our reservists.
When you deliver good training you do not just deliver the practical experience of how to fire a rifle and how to do fire and manoeuvre, and how to run, crawl, observe, aim and fire; you teach esprit de corps, you teach soldiers some of those enduring skills which are the ethos of the military, where mateship is so important, where you know you can rely on the man next to you. They are not qualities that any of us in this place who have not experienced esprit de corps—and there are one or two who have—can understand. It is when you know that you do not have to look to the man next to you and you do not have to look to the unit that is supporting you because you know the level of their training.
I go back to my uncle who fought in World War II with the 2nd/25th Battalion. He speaks of, in some instances, the American forces that were there to support them—those who did not have the same level of training that they had—and the fear that they would often encounter knowing that they were on their flanks. I know from my own training when we have trained with some units from other countries which have had less than the discipline and less than the training we had who have left the training field. What despair that leaves you with! We do not need to have one Australian regular or reserve soldier ever face that because of one of his colleagues who wears that Australian military uniform. We must know that anyone who represents this country in battle does so from the basis of the best training that we can provide, and that is what we in the coalition are about.
When you turn to industrial relations I acknowledge that there are employers who do 
 not understand the importance of this, and we in the government also knowledge that we need to do more to make them understand. But it is not about legislating and putting into awards that you must release people for training, because what will they do? Quite simply, they will say to the potential employee, `I am sorry. You were not suitable,' not, `You were not suitable because you were putting your hand up for Australia's defence.' They will make any other number of excuses.
We need to break down the barriers between employees and employers. This must be a win-win situation where employees say, `This is what I want to do for me. This is what I want to do for my employer. This is what I want to do for my country,' and the employer says, `I can acknowledge that. I can see how this can benefit us all.' When that happens, everyone is a winner. Most of all, we as a nation are winners, because we have people who will stand up for Australia in times of peace who will also stand up for us in times of war.
This government has the right policy. It should be supported by those opposite. We must make sure that it is implemented in full, and that our reserves get the training not only that they deserve but that is absolutely paramount for them to deliver the sort of service they will, in good faith, deliver for us, whether it be in East Timor, in Darwin or in any other part of the world.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I rise to oppose the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  and to support the amendment moved by the member for Dobell in his capacity as the shadow minister for education. I oppose this bill because it is appalling public policy and a breathtaking act 
 of hypocrisy. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs told us that the government believed in freedom of association. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government proved that it did not believe in freedom of association during the waterfront dispute. On our wharves we had workers who had exercised their right to freedom of association and, in particular, to come together as a trade union, the MUA. This government found that situation, that exercise of the right of freedom of association, abhorrent. Indeed, so abhorrent, so disgusted, so anti the right to freedom of association was this government that it was prepared to send in guards, dogs and Dubai trained workers to introduce non-union labour and to break the MUA, the organisation formed by workers through free association.
So let us strip this debate of the government's pious cant and be clear about what is the true motivation for and the philosophical underpinning of this bill. This government does not believe in the positive right to freedom of association. Instead, it believes in the negative right of freedom not to associate. One may wonder about the mental and philosophical gymnastics which would lead one to abhor a positive right but champion the associated negative right, but that is what this government believes in. This government believes that, if you are a worker who wants to freely associate and be part of a trade union, you are clearly a demonic wrecker of everything that is fair and good in our society whereas if you are a student who says, `I don't want to join my student union,' you are a champion of freedom of association. I would suggest that there is no consistency of approach to the question of freedom of association in this philosophy. Rather, the only consistency in this approach is the hatred of anything called union. One is entitled to wonder about bannering such a philosophy as a Liberal philosophy when true Liberals throughout the world have championed the right to freedom of association in the face of oppressive and violent regimes.
But the intellectual and philosophical paucity of this government and this minister does not stop there. Cloaked in the pretence 
 of believing in freedom of association, while they actually believe only in the freedom to not associate, this government and minister then take the next step and pretend that the freedom to not associate applies in all circumstances, public and private. Clearly this is not right.
In the public domain when dealing with public entities we accept for all sorts of public purposes that there is no freedom to not associate in our society. This simple statement explains why, for example, you cannot rely on some trite statement about freedom of association and opt out of paying tax. It is why you cannot say you want to be registered as a medical practitioner in our society but rely on freedom of association to refuse to register with the appropriate medical boards and pay the requisite fees. It is why you cannot say you want to own a dog or a cat but rely on freedom of association to refuse to register as an owner and pay the licence fee.
Properly viewed, student associations and the payment of services and amenities fees by students are in the same category. Universities are public entities incorporated by state law for a valuable public purpose—the provision of higher education and the undertaking of research. In line with our long cherished belief in academic freedom and autonomy, these state laws give universities wide discretion in relation to governing the university community.
Universities generally regulate the working of their community by having the university council enact statutes or by-laws. As a former university councillor, I am able to say that those statutes and by-laws deal with a vast range of matters. For example, a university might require a student to have a student card complete with a photo on it and to produce that student card for certain purposes like accessing library books or computer facilities. A prospective student could say, `I object to being required to have a photo ID document.' Some people do. To this the university would be entitled to say, `Bad luck. That is a condition of being a student at this university. Accept it or don't enrol.' Would the members on the other side be chanting, `Shame! Free 
 dom of association! How dare they!' to that kind of conduct by a university? I think not.
A university could say that it is a requirement for a student to undertake a particular form of assessment, a gruelling exam or compulsory attendance at a certain number of classes. Would we hear freedom of association rhetoric from the other side in relation to those conditions? Once again, I think not. But somehow everything changes if a university says, `We think the best way of providing student services is through a student controlled body and we are requiring payment of a fee to support those services.' How is this position intellectually defensible? How can these distinctions be drawn?
I urge members on the other side, particularly the large number who are already deeply concerned about this legislation, to think through these questions. I know that they are unlikely to be open to a chain of reasoning laid out by a Labor Party member of this House. After all, by definition, I am the lowest form of life. I am not only a trade union member; I was that most dangerous of animals, an active student unionist.
—It never passed my lips.
—I was a successful student politician, unlike the current federal Treasurer, but I will come to that later. Indeed, I was a national president of the Australian Union of Students, the only president of that organisation or its successor, the National Union of Students, to enter this parliament—a fact I know will so horrify members opposite I am lucky security has not been asked to clear me from the building. So I am specifically saying: `Don't listen to me about these matters. Listen to Alan Goldberg QC, who has written the definitive legal advice on the question.' Members opposite can be reassured that Alan Goldberg QC is no radical, no subversive supporter of trade unions. Indeed, he was the man who acted for the employers in the noted Dollar Sweets case whilst the current federal Treasurer, as his junior, carried the bags and procured the sandwiches for lunch. Alan Goldberg is an eminent Victorian lawyer who was appointed by the current government to be a judge of the Federal Court.
In May 1994 he provided a memorandum of advice to the National Union of Students on the question of whether student unionism breached the principle of freedom of association as laid down by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Alan Goldberg concluded:
Even though there may be differences in the formal constitution of the various student associations, they all have the same essential functions and purposes, and are an integral part of these public educational institutions. They provide essentially the same services and activities. Their role as part of the institution, and as representing the student body, no less an important part of the university than the other constituent parts, is formally recognised by the institution in the majority of cases. They function as a formal means by which student participation in the university or other post-secondary institution is organised. We—
that is Alan Goldberg and his junior counsel—
have considered the relevant principles and have had regard to a number of decisions of international courts and have reached the conclusion that reliance on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to support the proposed introduction of what is said to be voluntary student unionism on the grounds that the present situation in most Victorian post-secondary institutions does not accord with these instruments, is misconceived. We are of the opinion that the argument advanced fails to recognise and appreciate the integral and symbiotic relationship between a student association and a university. The significance of this is that a university is an institution of a public character and principles and decided cases to which we shall refer demonstrate that the relevant Articles do not apply to public institutions and organisations. Rather, they only apply to voluntary non-public organisations.
The advice then deals in great detail with Australian and international case law precedents. It should be noted that each and every Australian case on this question and each and every judge who has looked at it has reached the same essential conclusion as Alan Goldberg QC—now Judge Alan Goldberg.
At every turn, the Goldberg advice reinforces the precept that we accept compulsion, some limit to the right to not associate, in public institutions and for public purposes. As I have said previously, this is why we accept without question that government can compel 
 the payment of taxes, councils can compel the payment of rates and registration boards set up under statutes for various purposes can compel those who want to be recognised as a doctor or a lawyer to register, pay a fee and comply with rules set down by the board. This is the correct set of analogies when looking at universities and their associated student organisations—not the analogy the government seeks to put of voluntary, private organisations like trade unions.
Whilst on the question of legal advice, my attention has been drawn to legal advice provided to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee by the law firm Minter Ellison. In that advice, they canvass whether or not the legislation before the House this evening is in fact constitutional and they cast some doubts on the question of its constitutionality. I commend that piece of advice to members opposite and suggest that, prior to casting their votes on this bill, they read it and think long and hard about that fundamental legal question.
When analysing the situation with student organisations, we must not only be clear about the question of freedom of association in the way that Alan Goldberg was clear about it but be more intellectually rigorous about what is being compelled. The government paints this broad brush and highly inaccurate picture that what is being compelled is membership of a student union. The reality is very different.
Student organisations are constituted in various ways. Whilst all are structured around a concept of universality—in that they aim to provide services to the full student community and define the electorate for their democratic structures as inclusive of the full student community—many are not structured on the basis that each and every student is a member. For example, the Monash Student Association is structured on the basis that the only members of the association are the members of the governing councils of the association, while the student body forms the constituency and the electorate. Indeed, this model of limited membership is the traditional model for universities on the east coast of Australia. What is being compelled in this model is not 
 membership; what is being compelled is payment of a fee, which is then used to support services. What can be the objection to that? Clearly, when analysed properly, the government's justification for this bill stands threadbare. It is not about freedom of association; it is not about ending compulsory membership.
As a former President of the Australian Union of Students, I have a strong view about the real motivation for this legislation. This legislation is about nothing more or less than a bunch of failed student politicians on the other side of the House trying to win in the 1990s the war they lost in the 1970s. It is time warp legislation through which middle aged men are seeking to relive their youth and come out victors this time. Essentially, this minister and his ageing student cohorts opposite have failed to realise life on campus in the 1990s is fundamentally different to life in the 1970s.
There is no doubt that in the 1970s the then Australian Union of Students lost its way. Instead of properly performing its core role as an advocate for student interests and a provider of student services, it became hostage to extremist views more interested in international affairs than domestic education policies. But it should be noted that this problem was basically confined to the national level of student politics and, even during the height of concerns about AUS radicalism, student unions at campus level throughout the country continued to provide welfare services, counselling, jobs boards, student housing schemes, cut price goods and services, campus bands, student theatre, student sports, services to overseas students and the like.
Members opposite sought to answer AUS's radicalism by destroying forever national and campus student unionism. In that they failed. The radicalism of AUS at that time was always going to prove to be a transient and unsustainable political stage, and so it was that this extremism was ultimately defeated through democratic processes; not by the members opposite, but by a coalition of progressive and pragmatic forces led by Labor students. At that time, a new student political culture developed and the culture has been 
 seared into the current student activists who have learnt well and truly the lessons of the past. Student activists from that time on have understood that their job was to meet the needs of, and truly represent, their student constituency.
Inevitably, undertaking that role leads to a collision course with government. For example, during the period I served as the national education vice-president of AUS prior to becoming president, we defeated by public campaigning the Fraser government's student loans proposal. In doing so, we clearly did not endear ourselves to the coalition, but we did play a legitimate role representing our constituency. In the same way, the student campaign of today against the GST might not be endearing to the coalition, but it is a legitimate campaign on behalf of the student constituency.
What we find in this legislation is a cruelly destructive sledgehammer being used to crack a 20-year-old and very mouldy nut. This is a government full of members who want to destroy 1990s student associations because they hated the 1970s student union bogyman. The fact that the 1990s version of student unionism bears no resemblance to the 1970s bogyman does not seem to have sunk in. The question for members opposite is clear: will they allow themselves to be used so that this minister and his failed student politician mates can have a pyrrhic victory over the bogyman of their youth or will they stand up and say, `Students need services, and we will defeat this legislation to ensure those services continue to be provided by democratic student organisations'? Clearly, if they listen to their electorates and their constituencies the answer will be that they will vote against this bill.
I want to refer in the final minutes of this speech to the position taken by the Victoria University, which is represented in my electorate by its campus at Werribee where they do some fine work in food technology and science in cooperation with Food Science Australia in the technology precinct we have at Werribee. I commend members who want to look at a fine example to come to Werribee and I will happily show them around. The council of Victoria University has considered 
 the student union legislation that is before the House today and has written to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, and put their view that the legislation will be bad for students and, in particular, will be bad for the Victoria University. I want to quote from that letter of 30 March:
New universities like ours, with a large number of campuses, have not had the opportunity to build up the student support and amenities infrastructure which exists in more established institutions so the inevitable losses of revenue—
that is, the loss of student fees should this legislation go through—
will be particularly damaging. The problem is made even worse by the lower socio-economic group from which much of our student population is traditionally drawn, making it difficult to raise what would need to be a greatly increased general services fee (GSF) as a voluntary contribution.
The letter goes on:
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that in an effort to establish the standard of amenities required to attract students to the newer Victoria University campuses the Victoria University Student Union arranged to borrow money from the University to build new facilities. The University lent this money on the understanding that the debt would be served by future GSF proceeds.
That is, proceeds from the general services and amenities fee. With your proposed legislation, it is unlikely that this debt will be honoured.
Apart from these practical problems, the letter goes on to say that, in the council's view, the student organisation plays a pivotal role in the governance of the university.
I therefore say to members opposite that, if they consult with the student communities and the academic communities in their electorate and reflect those views, they will vote against this bill. They ought to vote against it because it is wrong in terms of public policy and it is wrong on the question of freedom of association. They ought not be prosecuting in this House a case that was prosecuted in campuses in the 1970s and on which campuses in the 1970s returned their verdict.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1999-05-11,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I present the following report entitled Report on the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 1999-2000.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—In accordance with the provisions of section 53 of the Auditor-General Act 1997, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has considered the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office for the 1999-2000 financial year. The committee is able to advise the parliament that it is satisfied that the draft budget estimates submitted by the Auditor-General to the committee on 24 March 1999 are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the act covering financial statements, performance audits and audit services. In his submission, the Auditor-General noted that the ANAO's total cash budget appropriation in 1998-99 was $53.8 million and that no additional estimate funding had been sought. The 1998-99 budget allocations were used to fund strategically important projects such as restructuring and computer replacements and enhancements to the ANAO financial management and human resource management systems.
The Auditor-General told the committee that there were a number of significant changes to the environment in which the 1999-2000 budget and forward estimates were constructed, the most important of these being the implementation of an accrual budgeting framework for the Commonwealth to take effect from the 1999-2000 budget. The ANAO has for some years been costing its products on an accrual basis and is well placed to move to an accrual based budget. The ANAO has also implemented, with effect from 1 July 1998, a new financial management information system to support the revised financial management framework.
The implementation of accrual budgeting is accompanied by the introduction of an outcomes and outputs structure which will replace the existing program structures. The new framework places a particular focus on the outputs or goods and services produced by agencies and the links between them and the desired outcomes of government activity. The ANAO's outputs are defined as follows: one, performance audit services; two, information support services; and, three, assurance audit services.
The key elements of ANAO's business summarised in the Auditor-General's submission are: running costs account for a significant majority of ANAO resources; property operating expenses, covered by a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Finance, are included in running costs; under the accrual budgeting environment, the previous system of annual appropriations for agencies will be replaced by appropriations for departmental items and appropriations for administered items; for the ANAO, future appropriations will, for the most part, relate to departmental items; and the Auditor-General's salary and allowances will continue to be funded by the special appropriation under the Auditor-General Act.
The total budget allocation being sought for 1999-2000 is $53.6 million. In terms of output groups, the performance audit services output group estimates were $18.7 million. The information support services output group estimates were $1.7 million, and the assurance audit services output group estimates were $26.6 million. Although the Auditor-General understands that carryovers will not form part of the budget parameters beyond 1999-2000, it is proposed, in line with existing practice, to maintain a strategic reserve fund which is needed to assist in the management of the ANAO's businesses.
The process by which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has been able to fulfil its enhanced responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act and the Financial Management and Accountability Act has continued to evolve during this year. It is only by the experience of deliberating on matters like the appointment of the independent auditor 
 and the approval of ANAO's draft budget estimates that the practical extent of the committee's powers of scrutiny can be defined in a way which enhances the powers of the parliament to keep government accountable.
I advise the House that, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth parliament that budget appropriations have been tabled prior to the budget. I move:
That the House take note of the report.

The total budget allocation being sought for 1999-2000 is $53.6 million. In terms of output groups, the performance audit services output group estimates were $18.7 million. The information support services output group estimates were $1.7 million, and the assurance audit services output group estimates were $26.6 million. Although the Auditor-General understands that carryovers will not form part of the budget parameters beyond 1999-2000, it is proposed, in line with existing practice, to maintain a strategic reserve fund which is needed to assist in the management of the ANAO's businesses.
The process by which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has been able to fulfil its enhanced responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act and the Financial Management and Accountability Act has continued to evolve during this year. It is only by the experience of deliberating on matters like the appointment of the independent auditor 
 and the approval of ANAO's draft budget estimates that the practical extent of the committee's powers of scrutiny can be defined in a way which enhances the powers of the parliament to keep government accountable.
I advise the House that, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth parliament that budget appropriations have been tabled prior to the budget. I move:
That the House take note of the report.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.

(2) Has the Government allocated extra resources or funding to Australian Customs for the detection and confiscation of imported pirate CDs; if not, why not.
(3) Is Australian Customs conducting an operation specifically designed to detect and seize imported pirate CDs; if not, why not; if so, (a) what is the name of the operation, (b) when did it begin, (c) how many staff have been allocated to work on the operation, (d) is the operation ongoing or does it have a scheduled end-date and (e) what is its budget.
(4) Has the Minister directed Australian Customs to be alert specifically for imported pirate CDs since the Government approved parallel importation; if so, when was the direction made; if not, (a) why not and (b) will the Minister direct them accordingly.
(5) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to comments by Mr Michael Speck, Manager of Music Industry Piracy Investigations (MIPI), that triad gangs controlling CD distribution in Asia have unwittingly been granted an entry into the Australian music market by the Government's approval of parallel importation; if so, what is the Minister's response; if not, will the Minister examine the comments and respond; if not, why not.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1999-05-11,"—The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) Australian Customs has examined numerous consignments of CDs imported into Australia for compliance with the import provisions of the Copyright Act 1968; (a) since 31 July 1998 it has seized 2,438 pirate CDs, (b) estimated Customs value is $5700.00.
(2) No. Customs officers at the border are alert to a range of prohibited goods including narcotics, guns, quarantine items, child pornography and counterfeit CDs. Apart from narcotics having the first priority of search and detection, all other goods including counterfeit CDs are treated the same, that is, when they are detected action is taken to seize.
(3) No. For the reasons mentioned above.
(4) No. Customs was already aware of the importance of this issue but the effectiveness of any enforcement action will continue to be limited by the lack of information/intelligence to identify illegal importations.
(5) Mr Michael Speck, Manager of MIPI, is reported as making such comments. However to date, he has not produced any information to Customs or the Australian Federal Police to corroborate the statements. Should he provide such specific information, appropriate action will be considered.
(6) No. This issue has been raised by the music industry, in particular MIPI, but they have not produced any evidence to support this claim. Should specific information be forthcoming, Customs and the Australian Federal Police will use it.
(7) Yes. Customs often call in an ""industry expert"" to establish if imported goods infringe the legislation whilst being conscious of commercial confidentiality and privacy. Customs has, however, advised the music industry and MIPI on numerous occasions that it would welcome any specific commercial information or intelligence which might 
 assist it in the targeting of possible infringing imports.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Customs Service: Compact Discs</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,26,1,answer
