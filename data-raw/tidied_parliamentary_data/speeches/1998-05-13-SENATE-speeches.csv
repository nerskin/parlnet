"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-13,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill. This is the second of a package of bills to put into place the youth allowance arrangements which have been put forward by this government. I suppose in most cases you would consider that a bill which is entitled `consequential' would be only that, but although it does contain the administrative arrangements for the new youth allowance, it goes a little further. 
Before I go on to deal with those matters, I remind the chamber and the community at large about the effect of the youth allowance package, because although it was put forward by this government as a move to put more young people back into education, in fact the real effect of much of this package is to punish families who are not particularly well off, despite being labelled as such by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman).
This legislation requires families who earn as little as $23,700 to support their children between the ages of 18 and 21—and although this legislation uses the term `children', they are in fact young adults between the ages of 18 and 21. I do not believe that families on those levels of income—and we are talking generally about a family with two parents, at least one adult child and sometimes other children—should be expected to support their children at an age when the community at large accepts that they are adults, as they are over the age of 18.
To return to the bill that is before us, as I said, it puts in place a number of administrative arrangements relating to the youth allowance proposal, but it does some other things as well. It transfers from DEETYA three payments that were generally regarded as education payments to the Department of Social Security and, subsequently, they will also be administered by Centrelink. They are, firstly, Austudy; secondly, the pensioner education supplement; and, thirdly, the financial supplement loans scheme which was introduced by the previous Labor government and which is probably better known as the student loans scheme.
One of the sad things about all of these changes is that, even though the government has stated that it will encourage people to go back to education, I believe that `encouragement' is a dangerous term, because it beats young people around the head and forces them to go back into education. With regard to the 27,000 people who are expected to be forced back into education—and that is school education—there has really been no provision made by this government to ensure that proper funding and services are provided for 
 those young people. There is a great fear on the part of the Labor opposition—and I believe it is a fear that is shared by many parents of children at school and also by schools and teachers—that those young people returning to school who are unwilling or not suited to the school environment may disrupt educational services and the classroom. In fact, the result of this package will be that those who are happily at school and are pleased to be there may find that their educational opportunities are limited or restricted by those people who have been forced back into school by this government's policies who are not suited to that environment.
It is quite ironic to see that at the same time there have been major cuts in TAFE education. Certainly, in my time, TAFE education was often an alternative form of education for those young people who might have liked to continue their studies but who found that school was not suited to them or who wanted a more practical, hands-on type of education.
At the same time as forcing young adults back into education, there has been a major cut in TAFE funding, a major cut in higher education funding and a movement to user-pays based academic education in the universities rather than a merit based education. That move is a great negative and one which I think we will regret in the future. I always saw a great distinction between higher education in Australia and higher education in many other countries where you could only get into university if you had parents who were affluent. I am saddened by the fact that we are seeing a movement here in Australia where students are not getting into university based on how hard they work and how bright they are; students are getting into university on the basis of how much mummy and daddy can provide financially. That is a pretty poor situation.
Going back to the bill: those three payments which are presently made by DEETYA will now be administered through Social Security. I understand that as of 1 July 1998 these payments will come from Centrelink. The transition is not as straightforward as we would like to be told by the government. As 
 there seems to be every time a change is put forward by the government, there is a nip here and a tuck there. Somehow the people involved always come out of the transitional process with just a little bit less and in some cases a lot less than they started with. This is exactly what is happening with this bill.
As always with this government, the people who are worst off—ordinary Australians, families who do not have big incomes—are the people who pay in the end. We saw that last night. I suspect, as long as we have this government, we will continue to see that the people who pay are the people on low incomes who are ordinary Australians.
Who are the people who will be worse off as a result of this bill? Personal income tax currently allows students to earn $6,000 before their Austudy entitlement is reduced by 50c for each $1 earned. This new bill proposes that only the first $80 per fortnight of additional income be reduced at the 50 per cent rate and that after that reduction will be 70c in the dollar; in other words, a much steeper taper. My belief is that this sort of very steep taper is quite contrary to public policy and the way we have been treating the integration of government payments and income over some period of time.
There is always a very big concern with these steep tapers that the steeper you make the taper, the more people lose when they earn some small additional income and the more likely it is that people receiving these payments will be discouraged from earning additional income. This is bad. It is bad for students because they do not have the advantage of additional income. It is also bad for the government and for the rest of the taxpaying community because, if students do not make an effort to earn additional income, in the end government payments will be higher.
I am very concerned to see this sharpening of the taper, the taking of more money from students when they earn small amounts of additional income. I might go back to this later and give some further examples of it. This particular cut-out provision also applies where income is earned by the partners of Austudy recipients.
There is another group of losers in the bill, that is, students who are over 25 years and are living at home. There seems to be some discussion about the government giving way on this issue. If that is the case, I will be very pleased to hear that. Possibly Senator Newman, when she speaks to the Senate later today, might point it out. This is not a large group—it has been estimated to be 1,000 students—but these students have been particularly adversely affected because a new at-home rate for over-25s has been introduced which means a reduction of approximately $90 a fortnight for those on the maximum rate. For students on limited income such as Austudy, $90 a fortnight is a large amount of money. I am sure many senators would be a little upset if they lost about a quarter of their income with the stroke of a pen, as seems to be occurring here.
Apparently, this will be a fairly minor cost saving of $2.35 million a year. I encourage the government to review their position on this particular matter and, if possible, announce to the Senate that they will not be proceeding with this fairly retrograde step in relation to this group of people who live at home and are over the age of 25.
Another major concern with the way the bill is being implemented is the fact that it comes into effect on 1 July this year. I can understand that the minister feels some pressure from the Minister for Finance and Administration to put in place the government's budget savings, but it seems to me rather extraordinary to put a change in place right in the middle of the academic year.
Young people have made decisions about their future, about whether they should be studying or whether they should be seeking work, based on the circumstances that existed at the beginning of the academic year—for most people, I suppose, that is early February. And then, suddenly, along comes the coalition government which makes a decision to review all the regulations that affect them, and to put this into place on 1 July this year. I really believe that the government should have some serious thought about this. Is it really fair to change the rules and regulations halfway through the academic year? It may well mean 
 that some people, who have done six months in a course, suddenly find their circumstances have changed and they can no longer afford to continue. So they have to go off and either get a job or, sadly, go onto unemployment benefits and the effort and expense that they and the educational institution have gone to will be wasted.
Alternatively, I suppose, there could be circumstances where young people might have gone into education if they had known these changes were coming, but who had made a decision not to, and to seek work or do something else. It would seem to me much more logical and fairer to everyone concerned to put these changes into place at the beginning of the next academic year. Maybe, when the minister is on her feet, she could also explain what the great necessity is for putting this into place in the middle of the year. Certainly, I personally cannot see any great benefit that is gained. I believe that a lot of young people will find this change in the middle of the year very difficult.
Another negative that arises from this legislation is the fact that those students who are over 25 will not be receiving rental assistance. I do not know whether the government believes that those over 25 suddenly do not need accommodation or, alternatively, that once you reach 25 you have access to some cheaper form of accommodation that those under 25 do not have. But this does not seem to me to be the case. It certainly seems unfair not to allow one group of people to have access to rent assistance just because they reach the age of 25 years, even though their personal circumstances and, I suppose, their financial circumstances have not really changed.
There is one other matter that I would like to raise that is of concern in the bill, though I hope it will be remedied, and that is that much of the detail of the student loan scheme—this is set out in the Student and Youth Assistance Act—are missing from this bill entirely. I do understand that this bill gives the power to the government to establish the scheme and I think it was originally suggested that the vast bulk of the scheme would be set out in regulations to be dealt 
 with at some later stage. But I have to say that there is a great deal of concern within the student population that, if it is to be done in that secondary way, some of the provisions could be changed to be less generous or, alternatively, the regulations in the lead-up to an election and post the budget could be lost. It appears that Mr Howard is suggesting that this could be the last session. We obviously do not have a lot of time to get legislation through. They are very concerned that, in fact, between now and the election this particular group of regulations could be lost.
We ask the minister to give an undertaking, when she is on her feet, that the provisions for the student loan scheme will be incorporated within the Social Security Act as soon as possible. We also ask her to give a commitment as to a certain date when this might occur and an assurance that it will, in fact, take place before the election is held—whenever that might be. Certainly, if in the lead-up to the election the student loans schemes were to be lost entirely, it would be a great loss to a large number of students who rely on it to assist them in getting through their education.
There are some positive amendments. They are fairly minor in this bill and I really feel, in fairness, I should mention them. I am sure that any that I miss, the minister will take great pains to draw the chamber's attention to. One of them is that there has been a fairly major change for assessing income for students—from an annual to a fortnightly estimate. That is a positive thing, because for many students—with the ups and downs of their income over the year—it is very hard to estimate accurately what their annual income might be. In fact, this often leads to overpayments, which means that students have a difficult time having to repay the money. Alternatively, they find at the end they have overestimated and they get the money back. But they will have suffered a great deal of financial distress throughout the year and, even though that might give them a little bonanza at the end of the year, it probably would have been nice for them to be able to access that money for what it was meant to be 
 used for, and that is for their support throughout the year.
There is somewhat of a concern in the shift from taxable income to gross income, as this could reduce the entitlements of some students to what used to be called Austudy. I suppose, to some extent, we are prepared to wait and see on this issue. There may be some minor losers—I hope not. But I hope that some of the advantages of greater flexibility for students will offset some of the problems that are created by this change.
The positive amendments are minor ones but I am sure they will be gratefully received by the students. They include an additional three days payment in the changeover. I suppose they could have one good weekend before they lose it all. In fairness, I suppose this additional three days will be of some assistance. It is largely due to the fact that there is a changeover in the cycle of payments between Austudy and social security payments. I suppose we should be grateful that they have not made a decision to do the reverse, which is to take three days from students to make the cycles align. I am grateful that they have been given an additional three days. Personally, I still believe that this slight benefit does not offset the disruption and difficulties created by introducing the scheme in the middle of the year, but I suppose it would have been worse if they had lost some money.
There is also the introduction of a liquid assets test for students. I understand that there is a broadening of the exemptions for the liquid assets test to allow for the educational expenses that relate to students. This is a matter that I would like to clarify in the committee stage.
Overall, the opposition is still concerned about some of the negative aspects of this bill. We are concerned about the fact that the whole package of bills is stated by the government to encourage young people back to education but at the same time this government is slashing and burning in terms of its funding of education. We are fearful that the additional strain put on schools and other educational institutions may hurt those people being educated now. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-13,"—Before I begin to address some of the problems associated with this consequential bill, I would like to place on the record some comments related to the passage of the original youth allowance bill in March of this year. On behalf of the Greens (WA) I moved 56 amendments to the youth allowance legislation in March in an attempt to curtail many of the harsh measures contained in the bill. Unfortunately, the Senate caved in to government threats to shelve the entire youth allowance scheme if they did not get their way, and many of the important, commonsense amendments proposed by the Greens and the Democrats were rejected. I hope we will not see a repeat of that situation with this bill. The job of the Senate is to make amendments to legislation to effect benefits to the Australian community or to prevent harm—not to be a rubber stamp for unjust government changes when they threaten the Senate with double dissolution triggers.
I will now go over some of fee key areas in the March debate. I am sure many of the issues raised will come back before this chamber when they start to impact upon the community. To start on a brighter note, government plans to force 16- and 17-year-olds to be engaged in education in order to receive youth allowance were changed. The Greens (WA) were successful in moving an amendment which allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to undertake employment case management as an alternative to full-time study. Thankfully, this change was accepted by the House of Representatives, despite the government's opposition to it in the Senate.
The Greens (WA) were also successful with amendments which allowed de facto couples with a relationship of 12 months to qualify as a youth allowance couple, improved notification requirements, and ameliorated criteria relating to independence as a self-supporting person.
Now for the bad news. In relation to the age of independence, one of the key aspects of the youth allowance is the parental means test. At least 45,000 young people will have their payments reduced or abolished due to the amount of money their parents earn. 
 However, if a young person is classified as independent they are exempt from the parental means test. The government set the age of independence at 21 for the young unemployed and at 25 for full-time students. The Greens (WA) moved amendments to have the age of independence set at 18 for both students and the unemployed. The Greens (WA) also supported amendments by the Australian Greens and the Democrats to have the age of independence set at 21 for students and 18 for the young unemployed. Unfortunately, all age of independence amendments were defeated. It is worth noting that while the ALP supported the age of independence being 18 for young unemployed, they did not support the age of independence for students being lowered from 25, contrary to their policy when in government.
The parental income free area basically sets the level at which parents' income starts to affect the youth allowance payments of a young person. This level was set at $23,400 per annum for both parents. The Greens (WA) moved amendments to set this amount to the average weekly ordinary time earnings  figure of approximately $36,000 per annum. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated by the government and Senator Harradine.
Rent assistance for students was the big `carrot' in the youth allowance package. Whenever the Greens (WA) spoke to the government about changes to the bill, we were told that any extra cost incurred by our suggested changes would prevent rent assistance being paid to students. In other words, this measure was included to play one group of young people off against another. The young people did not fall for it, however.
In any case, the youth allowance rent assistance provisions remained restrictive for students. Some will not receive it because they are not paying enough rent—a person's rent has to amount to 28 per cent of their maximum allowance before it can be paid. Others will not receive it because it is being paid only to those who need to live away from home, as opposed to those who choose to live away from home—or find it difficult to prove under the government's restrictive category. Of those who are left, many will 
 receive only two-thirds of the maximum because they will be sharing a house. The Greens (WA) and other parties moved amendments to remove those restrictions, but unfortunately they were defeated by the government and Senator Harradine.
On the youth allowance activity agreement, the Greens (WA) amendment sought to exempt full-time students from the possibility of having to enter into a youth allowance activity agreement or lose their benefit. This was defeated by the government, Senator Harradine and the ALP. It means that the department could require a student to perform a range of activities if, for example, the secretary of the department considered that the full-time student was not performing satisfactorily in their course.
And we have the work for the dole, of course. The Greens (WA) moved amendments to remove provisions which allow for the young unemployed to be forced into a work for the dole program or lose their benefit under the youth allowance legislation. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated by the government, Senator Harradine and the ALP. And just look at the budget and see what the impacts are this time.
The government's youth allowance scheme retains the controversial actual means test that exists under Austudy. However, it leaves most of the detail on how the actual means test operates to regulations and guidelines. The ability for the department and the minister to botch these regulations has been dramatically evidenced during the last two years with the mishandling of the actual means test, leading to the downfall of Senator Vanstone and continuing problems for previously self-employed independent students caught by the test. The Greens (WA), the Democrats and the ALP all moved amendments that the actual means test be in the legislation in full or not at all. Unfortunately, they were all defeated by the government and Senator Harradine.
On the industrial action exclusion, the Greens (WA) moved to amend sections which prevent youth allowance being paid to people who are unemployed due to industrial action. The provisions even prevent a person receiving youth allowance if they are a member of 
 a trade union involved in industrial action which leads to the person's unemployment. Doesn't that sound familiar! Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated by the government, Senator Harradine and—wait for it—the ALP.
I now turn my attention to some of the changes proposed in this bill and foreshadow some of the vital amendments which the Greens (WA) will be moving. First of all, rent assistance for students over 25. When the proposed changes to payments for students under the youth allowance bill were debated earlier this year, the big carrot was the long overdue payment of rent assistance to full-time students. While the Greens did not agree with many of the regressive changes which were traded off for the provision of student rent assistance, we did welcome this long overdue change.
Predictably, the government trumpeted the introduction of student rent assistance as reflective of their commitment to students and delivery of their promises made in opposition. All those who criticised the youth allowance package were chided by Senator Newman for ignoring the provision of rent assistance. Organisations such as the National Union of Students and APAC were derided for not embracing the youth allowance changes on the basis of the provision of rent assistance to students. In fact, one could say that it was one of Senator Newman's favourite sales pitches when selling the youth allowance package to the young people of Australia.
It seems proven that this so-called commitment to students receiving rent assistance was nothing more than a trade-off for the regressive changes in the last youth allowance bill. But, really, where is the real commitment to providing rent assistance for students? In this bill, all students who happen to begin their studies after the age of 25 will be ineligible for rent assistance. Perhaps they do not have to pay rent if they are over 25.
We will have a ridiculous situation in which a person who begins study when aged 24 years and 11 months—and therefore receiving youth allowance—will be entitled to rent assistance whereas someone who begins study at 25 years and one month—and therefore 
 receiving the new Austudy payment contained in this consequential bill—will not be entitled to rent assistance. All in all, there will be 35,000 people around Australia who will be discriminated against by virtue of the fact that they have been unable to begin study until the age of 25.
We know how quickly things are changing. We know how the blame for unemployment is being put on the individual—the need to keep up, the need to be relevant—and now the government may be punishing people for the situation they are in. How absolutely ridiculous; how utterly insensitive; how manifestly inequitable.
I assure all senators in this place that this issue will haunt those who do not support such a basic point of equity. I assure you that a situation in which students of the same age, studying the same course, and in exactly the same financial situation, receive benefits which differ by up to $75 per fortnight will be an ongoing source of justifiable anger, frustration and disillusionment. Perhaps we can pass a law which says that students are not permitted to talk about their allowances. I urge senators to support the Greens (WA) amendment to allow all students access to rent assistance if they need it. After all, isn't consistency what the whole youth allowance package is supposed to be about?
Currently there are about 1,000 students aged over 25 who live with their parents. The current Austudy system, quite sensibly, makes no demarcation between over 25s living away from home and those remaining at home. The current maximum rate for these students, provided they are not long-term income support students—in which case they receive more—is $265.39. However, under the provisions of this consequential bill, from 1 July their payment will be reduced to $174.80 literally overnight.
Most of these people have no idea that such a change is coming. In fact no-one apart from a few people in the Department of Social Security knew this was coming until March this year. So these people who have been tightly budgeting on their existing meagre payments are about to be kicked in the teeth with a reduction of about $90 per fortnight, 
 which will cause confusion, anxiety and real financial hardship. This is what you get for being a full-time mature age student who has taken up the government call to educate yourself and contribute to your community.
Even this government recognises that those over 25 are financially independent from their parents. The Greens (WA) argued vigorously during the debate on the youth allowance bill that those people should be considered independent at 18 for the purposes of student assistance—as they are under just about every other law in society. Nevertheless, even using the government's definition of independence at age 25, the logic of applying a different rate of payment to those who happen to live at home is entirely inconsistent.
Let us look at who we are considering whacking with this 33 per cent reduction in payment. Many of these people will be in a situation where their parents are elderly—perhaps on an aged pension or living on superannuation payments. Remember that this is the government that says that $60,000 or $65,000 for a couple is okay to qualify for a health card. So while it is concentrating on blaming and punishing students and young people, the government is looking at increasing its own votes in this forthcoming election.
If a student's parents are elderly, perhaps on an age pension or living on superannuation payments, what sense is there in reducing the amount they can contribute to the family home? Does this government really want to force students over 25 out of the family home in a situation where they are assisting their aged parents? Perhaps Senator Newman wants these 25-, 30-, or 40-year-olds to be going cap in hand to their 55-, 60-, 70- or 80-year-old parents for some pocket money as of 1 July. The whole idea is rather offensive and cruel, to say the least.
The Greens (WA) will be moving amendments to remove the artificial distinctions in both this bill and in the yet to be proclaimed youth allowance bill between over-25s living at home and those living away from home. We also have a `break glass in case of emergency' grandfathering amendment which, in the extraordinary circumstance that the situation for students aged 25 and over is not 
 returned to normal, means that at least those who are currently in receipt of Austudy will retain a maximum rate of $265.50 a fortnight for the remainder of their course.
Under the liquid assets test, students can be excluded from receiving youth allowance or Austudy payments for up to 13 weeks if they have more than $2,500 in the bank. In the previous youth allowance debate, the Greens argued for the liquid assets test to be eased for students, given that many people, especially those over 25, often save more than the limit to use for legitimate education expenses such as computer software, transport to university and many other costs integral to pursuing their course of education.
The Greens (WA) felt that it would be unfair for a student to be penalised for up to 13 weeks for being responsible enough to save money for education expenses not specifically covered in the current guidelines. Unfortunately, our amendment was defeated. On this occasion, we are simply asking that the allowable deductions be placed in the legislation rather than in the attached guidelines, for both youth allowance and Austudy payments for over-25s, and that the deductions specifically include computer software and other matters necessary for a course of study as approved by the secretary. I look forward to this amendment receiving government support, as was indicated to my office by Senator Newman's staff.
We stated in the last Senate debate on youth allowance that the concept of the student income bank is a good one as it allows students who typically earn their extra money in the holiday periods effectively to spread their earnings over the year without running the risk of receiving overpayments. We support the idea of students receiving $230 per fortnight or earning credits up to a maximum $6,000 before their earnings begin to affect their youth allowance or Austudy payments.
However, there is a potential glitch, both immediate and ongoing, which could undermine the effectiveness of the student income bank and cause unnecessary hardship. The problem we have identified relates to those who happen to earn a significant amount of 
 their extra income when they first receive youth allowance or Austudy. For example, a person who has been receiving Austudy this year will be transferred to the new payment system on 1 July. If they had planned, say, to pick fruit for three weeks during their July break, they would be expecting to be able to earn up to $1,500 without affecting their Austudy payments, as was the case under the old system.
However, because the new student income bank has an opening balance of zero, it will take nearly 12 weeks before this person has enough credit in their student income bank to prevent these earnings affecting their payments. In fact, in this entirely typical example, the person's payments will cease altogether for a month. This is going to cause much distress for the hardworking students who have the initiative to find holiday work in order to afford textbooks and other essential costs—perhaps when the tyres blow on their old car—in the second half of the year.
In addition, as many students will be taking exams and then be on holidays during the introduction of the new system, the removal of their payments will come as a complete surprise. This situation will be ongoing for all those who take up youth allowance or Austudy payments during a holiday period in which they have the initiative to take on casual or one-off work opportunities.
On 12 March 1998, during the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said:
There are differences in this element between students and the young unemployed. Students have a much more constrained opportunity to take work because of the nature of their studies and their time commitments. It is much more difficult for them to take part-time work during the year, but they can take it during semester breaks and the long break during the summer. That is why we have tried to make special arrangements for students.
To put that in context, it shows the inability of the government to see that it could allow up to $15 a week for people on youth allowance—mingy as that is. Clearly, in the examples I have given, the well-intentioned aims that the minister has expressed are not going to be achieved.
The Greens (WA) have proposed an amendment which may serve to ease this problem by changing the opening credit balance in the student income bank to $2,000—hardly a sovereign's ransom—rather than zero. However, we would welcome any other amendments from senators which address the rather serious problem we have identified. It must also be said that this highlights a potential problem for all students who plan to earn a substantial amount of their $6,000 extra income in the first few months of the period in which they receive youth allowance or Austudy. It seems that these people will, in fact, be worse off under the new student income bank than they are under the current system.
Clearly, quite a bit of work has to be done before this package is ready to be unleashed on the unsuspecting youth and student community of Australia, therefore, I sincerely hope that the government takes a cooperative approach during the committee stage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-05-13,"—In speaking to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998 , which is a complementary bill to the youth allowance bill which was passed by this parliament earlier this year, I am unfortunately reminded yet again of how the government treats education. Over the past two years, the coalition has put education and training at the top of its hit list. Australia now stands alone amongst the developed nations of the world as the only nation with an increasing ratio of military to education spending. The Howard government is the first in our history to scale back the level of public education, research and training funding.
Already Labor has made clear it that it has a huge agenda for broadening educational opportunities. The Labor Party has historically and will always continue to view education as the best investment in our nation's future. Labor is committed to regrowing the university and TAFE sectors, with the latter sector alone having $240 million cut from it by the coalition.
Labor is also committed to abolishing up-front undergraduate fees—so proudly introduced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) in one of his regular ideological bouts of zealotry against the public education system. Labor is determined to offer a better way—to treat education spending as an investment rather than a cost, to restore fairness and growth of post-secondary access, and to strengthen our society and its economy through the higher education and TAFE systems.
 In the original youth allowance legislation, we have already witnessed how this government is prepared to further burden the battling families of Australia with the responsibility for the income support of their unemployed young adult children aged 18 to 20. Never mind that this provision applies to families earning as little as $23,400. According to the coalition, these families are considered relatively well off and capable of fully supporting their unemployed children. I do not think anybody would regard a family income of $23,400 as relatively well off; I would consider them to be battling. For ideological and cost saving interests, the coalition are denying that young adults aged 18 to 20 are independent and should not be forced under the imposition of parental income assets and actual means test requirements.
At the same time, the coalition have failed to tackle the youth unemployment issue, with the rate well over half a percentage point higher than when the coalition government was elected—despite lower participation rates. This is a failure of the personal pledge made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on election night that his highest priority was to make major inroads on youth unemployment. Like that pledge, this bill continues the coalition's policy failure towards Australia's young people. It continues to remove their sense of identity and independence and replaces it with a mean-spirited, strict and rigid set of requirements before any income assistance is forthcoming.
 The  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998  contains a large 
 number of measures to transfer program elements from DEETYA to the Department of Social Security. It also creates a new Austudy payment under the Social Security Act which will replace the existing Austudy scheme for students over 25 who are not covered under the new youth allowance payment.
 Also contained in this bill are a series of draconian measures such as activity tests, waiting periods and income maintenance periods, which are new initiatives not found in the existing Austudy legislation. Their existence is designed purely to hinder access to income support and save money for this government.
As a result of this bill and earlier legislation, it is not difficult to identify why the coalition will have cut $500 million to Austudy before the end of its first three years of government. In general, the rates and conditions affecting former Austudy students under DEETYA will be significantly altered by this legislation. First, under section 569G of the bill, the secretary to the Department of Social Security has the legal authority to make judgment on secondary students in receipt of Austudy. It is the secretary's judgment as to whether a student is making `satisfactory progress' through their secondary studies. Under the current Austudy regulations, a student's school had to be satisfied that the student was doing sufficient work to satisfy the test of being full time. It is difficult to see why this change has been made as schools are generally in the best position to make this judgment. It is to be hoped the departmental secretary does not exercise an unrealistic expectation of `satisfactory progress'.
This bill also applies new terms which were never mentioned in the previous Austudy legislation. Two in particular—the `waiting period' in proposed section 575 and `income maintenance period' in proposed section 1067L-D6—are draconian measures aimed at depriving students access to welfare support. Waiting periods are an application of the liquid assets test waiting period and effectively will deny students access to support until all their existing liquid assets have been run 
 down; for example, any personal savings in their bank account.
Similarly, the income maintenance periods will apply to those seeking support but who have received a prior termination payment, lump sum leave payment or other leave payment prior to taking up study. This will act as a major disincentive to people to seek training and education opportunities. Already these people are making a financially costly decision by leaving to work to pursue a study opposition. Why is the government providing a further barrier to their aspirations and preventing their ability to better their education achievements?
Apart from these particularly mean-spirited initiatives, there are a range of other measures in this bill which have previously never existed under Austudy legislation or are simply inconsistent with other initiatives the coalition have announced in other areas of welfare support. For instance, a non-payment period exists where a newstart recipient who has breached in any way the activity test carries over to Austudy the penalty provisions incurred under newstart. This is coupled with a rate reduction period in that a person who has already had their payment suspended or cancelled has to—on reactivation of their eligibility—be subject to a rate reduction period. This is a form of double punishment, which is particularly unfair to those students who are unaware of their original error in the first instance.
This bill also contains a lower rate of payment for those undertaking short-term studies. This is inconsistent with any existing Austudy requirements and it will lead to greater inflexibility and fewer options for students in the non-university environment. In particular, many students at various business colleges and training academies doing short, practical courses will be affected.
One of the most glaring inconsistencies in this legislation with other welfare support measures is the existence of a lesser payment rate category for students who are living at home with their parents. Under the new arrangements for newstart allowance, a person aged 21 or more and living at home is paid the same as a person who is not living at 
 home. The existence of this living at home provision in the new Austudy payment is purely a cost saving measure and makes a mockery of the coalition's much lauded claims of consistency between welfare payments.
It is equalled in its money saved obsession by the new student income arrangements. Under these initiatives, a student's entitlement will be reduced by 50c for each dollar earned between $230 and $310 per fortnight and by 70c for each dollar earned over $310. Further, a student will lose 70c of Austudy payment for each dollar by which their spouse's income exceeds the spouse free area. These terms do not exist in the current Austudy measures and they are therefore significantly harsher than the current Austudy income provisions.
The coalition is sending a message to students who come from battling families and who want to supplement their incomes while studying to back off from seeking a part-time job. The coalition is telling these people that part-time jobs in Australia can only be taken by either the very poor or the sons and daughters of those parents who are already wealthy and who do not require welfare support.
There will be a major proportion of the student population forced to make a decision between accepting a part-time position and regularly forfeiting part of their Austudy because they have earned too much or deciding to put their studies on hold. Unfortunately, through financial pressures I believe many will be forced to choose the latter option and risk being lost to the education sector indefinitely.
I call on the government to reconsider the fine detail in some of these initiatives. When they do they will discover that several of their initiatives are either unrealistically harsh or are inconsistent with other measures they have introduced. I accept that the creation of the youth allowance is necessarily a technical and complex task as it represents a merger of previous disparate income support payments.
However, I believe the intention of the coalition has not just been to rationalise and streamline Australia's system of income support payments but to re-align and alter the 
 purposes and origins of many of these payments. In the process, they are fundamentally changing the nature of Australia's social security system and denying many people the principles of fairness and equity which have been inherent in the system for the past half a century.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-05-13,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to address the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998 . Following on from some of the comments of Senator Gibbs, I think we all appreciate that there are aspects of this bill that are in the interests of the nation—such as the streamlining of payments—and at all stages the Democrats have been willing acknowledge those positive elements of the bill. At all stages during the debate on the previous legislation and during this debate we have also acknowledged that there are a number of hidden nasties and some not so hidden nasties in this bill.
Reference has been made in previous speeches in this debate in this place to the low threshold at which the parental means testing kicks in and the fact that it has always been a cause for concern. Despite attempts by the Australian Democrats to amend that very low threshold, we were unsuccessful. That threshold remains at that incredibly low level of just over $23,000 per annum. That is something about which we continue to object.
Another aspect of the common youth allowance is the nature of payments to 16- and 17-year-olds who are not in some form of employment, education and training. We have strongly objected to the fact that those 16- and 17-year-olds will, in most cases, receive no benefits whatsoever. At all stages we have said that we are concerned about that. Not only that, we are concerned that there are no employment opportunities or strategies being created to deal with those 16- and 17-year-olds who, for whatever reason, may not be participating in the education, training or employment sectors.
The other aspect that has been mentioned by both Senators Neal and Margetts is the age 
 at which young people will be considered independent—that is, the age they will be considered adults for the purpose of receiving the youth allowance. Again, the Democrats tried very hard to ameliorate the worst aspects of this bill. In particular, we tried to decrease the age at which young people were eligible for the independent rate of the youth allowance—in the case of young unemployed people to 18. I concur with Senator Neal that it is outrageous that young people should be considered dependent upon their families up to the age of 21 if they are unemployed and, similarly, up to age of 25—an absolutely concocted notion of independence—if they are in some form of education and training.
Unfortunately, the attempts by the Democrats, with the support of the Greens (WA), to amend both those aspects of the bill but in particular the latter, the age of independence for a student, were defeated. The latter was defeated with the support of the Australian Labor Party. Again we put on record our concern that young people and students were not supported by the opposition in relation to the age of independence.
The bill before us does a number of things, including establishing a new Austudy payment for students who are 25 and over. I understand that some market research has gone into determining the best name and way of promoting the new Austudy payment. The bill also establishes a pensioner education supplement, PES, as currently exists, for common youth allowance, Austudy and PES recipients, and provides the details of the supplement loan scheme for the youth allowance and the Austudy payment.
We have said many times that we believe the common youth allowance, despite some positive elements, will hit hardest at those young people who are on a lower socioeconomic scale—from lower paid and middle income families. They are the ones we anticipate will lose most under this legislation. The Democrats believe that the decisions made by this government in relation to the common youth allowance have overlooked many of the economic and social realities of family life today. 
I note that only last night the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was very keen to promote his budget as one that would assist families and young people. Already we have before us a measure that hits hardest at those two very groups. I should note that we can only begin to anticipate some of the economic and social hardships that will be wrought on families as a consequence of legislation such as the increased economic burdens for families where parents are going to be responsible, financially at least, for their children who are students up to the age of 25.
The government claims that these incentives or proposals have been introduced to encourage young people to participate and stay longer in the education and training sectors. I think many of those young people who are affected by this legislation in one way or the other will be asking the government why it has not put as much effort into job creation as perhaps some of the efforts it has put into scapegoating young people with schemes such as work for the dole, dob in a dole bludger or employer contact units, which overlook some of the extensive voluntary work that many young people do. I think we have seen a distinct lack of job creation measures for young people in this budget, let alone some form of assistance to the education and training spheres, which are apparently so important to this government that it would want young people to stay in them for longer.
I note, to follow on from Senator Margetts's comments, that the work for the dole scheme was extended in last night's budget to cater for another 25,000 young people. I still put to the government: what jobs will those young people occupy when they have finished their work for the dole? Even if they do take up the common youth allowance and education and training places, what job opportunities will be available to those young people when they have finished?
—More than they had before!
—I will take that interjection, if you are not careful, Senator Crane. If you can point out one job creation strategy in last night's budget I will take my hat off to you. No-one disputes the notion 
 that young people staying in education and training is not bad; no-one suggests that it is not a good thing—of course it is. We believe very much that education and training and access to knowledge and skill development is one way of ensuring that we have an enlightened work force and one that is competitive. That is the way job opportunities of the future will be occupied by young Australians, and indeed older Australians, if they have a sound skills base and understanding of technology and changes. 	 However, you cannot suggest that young people should stay in education and training longer without providing sufficient and adequate resourcing of those sectors, such as technical and further education, higher education and, of course, schools. But, as opposed to introducing incentives, certainly last night's budget did nothing to change the situation. We have seen only barriers put up in front of younger, and indeed older Australians, in relation to access to education and training. The barriers are the fees and charges that are obvious disincentives, as well as financial assistance packages that remain below the poverty line.
If this government really wanted to fulfil its election promises to give hope to young Australians it would be giving some realistic education and training opportunities. It would not be putting up fees and charges and other barriers to education, at whatever level. It would provide young people with realistic and adequate levels of income support, not income like Austudy or the common youth allowance which, at its maximum rate, is only 60 per cent of the poverty line. It would fulfil what it likes to refer to as mutual obligation. We certainly heard a lot from the government last night about that.
In relation to this bill, the Democrats will seek to amend various parts of it with the introduction of a rent assistance component for Austudy payment. Under the provisions of the bill, rent assistance will be made available to students who are eligible and receive the youth allowance. That is under the social security youth allowance legislation. This bill does not make comparable provisions for students who are 25 years or over when they 
 begin their study or qualify for benefits due to their age related independent status.
The Democrats will seek to delete the at-home rate for a single person over the age of 25 and the living with a parent category at the rate of $174.80 per fortnight, as opposed to what was $265.50 per fortnight. Under this rate a single mature adult living with their parent for whatever reason—for safety, security, or to provide a small amount of care—will not be treated as an independent adult, and we have a problem with that. Not content with treating young Australians as children up until their 25th birthday—certainly in the case of young students—this government is prepared to treat anyone who continues to live in the family home as dependent. We have a major concern with that and we will also seek to amend it in a way that Senator Margetts has indicated.
The Democrats will also seek an extension of the minimum time for students with an intellectual or physical disability. Twenty-five per cent of concessional load students should be given more time than simply twice the normal full time to complete their course. The government—and it may want to clarify this—expects those students to transfer to disability support payments, which to me would defeat the very purpose of the government's claim that it is trying to streamline and ensure there is a social security system which is more seamless.
 This bill changes the way in which the eligibility of a student over 25 for an Austudy payment is assessed by changing this assessment from taxable to gross income and so removing the need for the rather controversial actual means test. The Democrats support this. However, there is the concern currently that students will not be able to claim certain self-education expenses due to recent rulings. The Democrats do believe that these should be tax deductible. I acknowledge that this should be viewed perhaps as a separate issue and I understand that it is currently the subject of an ATO draft ruling. We do call for self-education expenses to be made tax deductible.
 The Democrats' second reading amendment to this bill acknowledges the fact that we have had substandard student financial 
 assistance provided by this government, or certainly that this government has perpetuated an inadequate system of student assistance that has previously existed. The Democrats have always complained about the fact that the Austudy scheme has been below the poverty line. This bill does nothing to change that. I move:
At the end of the motion, add: "", but the Senate condemns the Howard Government's perpetuation of a student allowance which is not a living allowance and is of the view that rent assistance should now be, and should always have been, made accessible to Austudy recipients"".
The Melbourne Economic and Social Research Institute sets the poverty line for December 1997 for a single person, and this includes housing, at $200.37 per week. The new Austudy payment is set at a maximum basic rate of $265.50 per fortnight, or $132.75 per week. The at-home rate is set at $247.80 per fortnight, or $123.90 per week. In December 1997 the unemployment benefit was $160.75 per week. The rent assistance available to these people was averaged by the Melbourne Economic and Social Research Institute at $37.40. That brings the total benefits available to an unemployed adult to $198.15, and that is just $2.22 shy of the poverty line. I should acknowledge that pensioners are indeed above the poverty line. Without the rent assistance available to the unemployed or even to a common youth allowance student, the recipients of the new Austudy payments will be a lot more than simply $2 shy of the poverty line.
 The Democrats have put on record, a number of times now, our concern with the common youth allowance scheme. We made attempts in the last discussion on this legislation to alleviate some of the worst aspects of the bill. We will be doing the same specifically in relation to the rent assistance issue during the committee stage of this bill. We believe very strongly that this government and, indeed, former governments of a Labor persuasion, stand condemned on the issue of student assistance.
We acknowledge the words of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. He may have promised that no child need live in poverty, yet he and his successors, whether it is Keating or 
 whether it is Howard, have stood back and effectively condemned hundreds of thousands of students to poverty as a result of the meagre benefits that they have been able to access. We will be supporting the changes to rent assistance in line with the request by the National Union of Students. We urge all parties, especially the opposition, to support those amendments regarding rent assistance.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-13,"—In speaking to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill, I pick up the Democrats' proposition that the Labor Party ought to be condemned for its record on student assistance when it was in government. Once again we hear from the Democrats a sanctimonious, turgid response which is completely irrelevant to the facts, as of course is well-known to this parliament. There was a 164 per cent increase in student income support measures under the Labor government, which is an historic all-time high. We hear from the Democrats this hypocritical response where they seek to distance themselves from what I believe to be quite extraordinary achievements of the Labor government in higher education.
It is important to remind the Senate that between 1983 and 1995 there was a 73 per cent increase in the number of students in higher education. The number of students commencing higher education increased by 91 per cent over that period. University participation rates increased from 37 per thousand in the 17- to 64-year-old population cohort in 1984 to 51 per thousand in 1994. Those are a few figures that I have
available. While those figures are a little dated, it does indicate to me that the Labor Party's record in higher education is one that we ought to be rightly proud of. I quite frankly find it extraordinary that the Democrats persist in putting these positions which are completely at odds with the facts. There are a whole series of indices which highlight that the Labor Party has a very good record when it comes to the question of higher education in this country.
In terms of this bill, what you have is a bill being introduced to complete the administra 
 tive arrangements for the introduction of the common youth allowance. It establishes Austudy payments within the Social Security Act and provides income support for students commencing study at the age of 25 or over. This bill is about administrative arrangements, but if it were merely about administrative arrangements one could expect that the impact on students would be negligible. Of course the facts are somewhat different. What you will see as a result of these changes is that many students will be significantly worse off.
In moving students from the education portfolio to the social security portfolio, the government is subjecting those students to a harsher income test which will leave some of them $62 a fortnight worse off. Currently, students can earn $6,000 of personal income before their Austudy entitlement is reduced. After that, their entitlement declines by 50c for each dollar of additional income. This bill proposes that only the first $80 a fortnight of  
 additional income be reduced at the 50c rate. After that, the reduction will be 70c in the dollar. I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard tables which outline the figures as the Labor Party has calculated them.
—Is leave granted?
—Leave will not be withheld, but I did ask Senator Carr to do me the courtesy of giving me a copy. That was an hour ago, and I think it is very strange that he did not observe the courtesy and honour his acknowledgment that he would do that. These are tables of figures produced by the ALP. There is no other certification on them as to where they come from. It is not the way this chamber operates. I find it unacceptable, and he deserves a reprimand.
Leave granted.

—I thank the Minister for Social Security for granting that leave. She will notice that the tables highlight that, for many students of independent status, the loss in income as a result of the government's measures ranges, on our estimates, from $7 for those with a student income of $9,000 through to $62 for those with a student income of $16,000. Similar measures will apply to the income of partners of Austudy recipients. Students with an assessable partner and no child will lose some $68 a fortnight if their partner earns $25,000 a year. These are not very large sums of money in terms of income per annum, but they are considerable sums of money per fortnight, if you are a student trying to make ends meet on these very low levels of payment. It is these very simple and easy to demonstrate measures that do disadvantage students so dramatically that the government is, of course, highly conscious of.
In a briefing paper produced on 25 March 1998 entitled `Youth allowance media strategy', the Minister for Social Security 
 (Senator Newman) was advised that there were serious problems emerging with the youth allowance highlighting serious community concerns on a range of issues. It was, of course, pointed out to the minister that:
. . . welfare groups such as ACOSS and Youth Action groups such as NUS—
and others—
have expressed their opposition to parts of the initiative. However, opposition has also come from church groups and organisations with religious affiliations such as Centacare. Vocal opposition from religious groups are a concern for the successful introduction of this initiative as they will have credibility with middle Australia as well as those families affected by the Parental Income Test.
As we understand, Ms Wheatley from the youth and student communication team in the Department of Social Security argued to the minister that:
We can expect more vocal opposition from families after July 1 when families of young unemployed people start to feel the effect of the Parental Income Test. We can expect disaffected families to air their grievances through the media. 

She went on to list a range of concerns that were being highlighted by the department, including the fact that unemployed persons over 18 will be financially dependent on their families until they are 21. She expressed the concern that the youth allowance will cause more family disputes and encourage family breakdown. The view was expressed that the youth allowance will cause young people to leave home and leave the security of family support, that it will cause more youth homelessness, and that $23,000 is not a lot of money before the youth allowance starts to cut out because of the parental income test.
These are measures that have not picked up the questions that have been raised within this particular bill. Ms Wheatley's advice to the minister failed to highlight the number of other issues of great concern to the Australian public, including the way in which these measures are being introduced without supporting measures to ensure that people have adequate resources when they return to education, be it at school, TAFE college or university. Resourcing to schools is some $100 million short as a consequence of the various measures this government has taken to remove funding from the education system, particularly the public education system, of this country. Of course, these are desperately needed moneys and desperately needed resources to cope with the influx of students that will follow the introduction of these measures.
The advice to the minister from Ms Wheatley failed to point out that students will have to be dependent upon their families for support up to the age of 25. This document also highlights the fact that the government proposed a series of deceptive media strategies aimed at trying to persuade people that the actions it was taking were in fact different from the measures actually proposed within these bills.
It is suggested that there would be provided `a dedicated officer to monitor media and advise the Minister's Office of appropriate responses.' That is, the old propaganda tools would be provided to the minister, such as liaising with program producers and writing letters to the editor—that old manipulation 
 trick that we have seen put into effect so many times. No doubt there is a whole string of people out there somewhere being organised by the department to ring into radio stations right now to make sure that the talkback programs are well seeded with the particular devious thoughts of this government. I have no doubt that we are seeing a great fertilisation of the public mood in this country to ensure that there is appropriate understanding of the actions this government is taking, which in fact leave 45,000 people worse off as a result.
There are measures outlined in this briefing paper to the minister which highlight that this government is seeking to produce publicity products and to distribute information regarding the youth allowance to customers. This will be outlined in an action plan, as advised in the various sections of this document. The measures include:
Identify geographical hotspots of young unemployed people and provide extra assistance to Customer Service Officers in these areas.
Utilise Business Television to broadcast to community groups and regional media.
Develop a Youth Allowance web site . . . 
And so it goes on. What they did was develop storylines for various TV programs to ensure the right spin was being put on these draconian measures which are doing nothing to assist young unemployed persons. For that matter, by this government's own admission, they are doing nothing to ensure there is a much deeper spread of educational opportunities in this country.
What we see in this government's proposals is the introduction of an at-home rate for students 25 years and over living at home. This would mean a rate reduction of some $90 a fortnight for those on the maximum rate. This decision has been made on the extraordinary assumption that students in their late twenties or older and living at home are automatically receiving a substantial level of support from their parents.
—You can earn $40,000 a year and get a seniors card.
—That is the whole issue summed up very nicely, Senator Conroy. What we have here is a government that 
 works on the assumption that all the people in this country are nice, comfortable and middle class and that all the people can afford to support their kids, irrespective of their desires or aspirations. It is an assumption based upon this retrospective view of Australian society that sees everyone in the `Hyacinth set' that we so often see expressed by this minister.
—Do you think Mr Bucket is eligible for a seniors card?
—Perhaps we see the Keeping Up Appearances  style of this government reflected in this legislation. Quite clearly, the ideological underpinning of this government's actions is to try to force the parents of this country to support their adult children at school, irrespective of whether they have the resources to do so. It is fundamentally unfair and unjust.
What is unreasonable is demonstrated again and again by this government's actions with regard to providing support to Australians to ensure they get the most out of our public institutions and to ensure they are able to fulfil their total potential to contribute to our society. This is a measure, yet again, that will restrict access to publicly supported institutions like our education institutions. It is quite an extraordinary proposition, as Senator Neal pointed out, to suggest that elderly parents struggling to find their way in terms of nursing home fees will still be expected to support their adult children in study.
We understand that, as a result of the pressure being applied by the ALP, the government is not proceeding with the introduction of a particularly harsh measure which would have seen up to $45 a week taken out of the at-home rate payments currently being made to some students. Nevertheless, the cuts to some students' payments due to the new income test will be introduced and they will be introduced in the middle of an academic year. As Senator Neal pointed out, these measures seem to reflect some of the problems with having a social security measure being taken on what is essentially an educational program. There is some difficulty here, as I see it, in getting social security payments measures to take into account the educational 
 effect of particular measures that are being introduced by this government. What we have are changed circumstances being introduced in the middle of an academic year, so payments will be made on a different basis to what they were at the beginning of the academic year.
What we are also concerned about is the fact that rent assistance will not be available to older students, as it will be to those receiving the youth allowance. This decision of the government is totally unjustified and implies that somehow, on turning 25, students no longer need a roof over their heads. Other measures in the bill, such as the harsher income tapering arrangements, are defended by the government representatives as being necessary because they are in line with what is happening under the youth allowance and with other measures in the Social Security Act. Here we see again the inconsistent approach to the issue of consistency across the Social Security Act. Keeping measures consistent seems to no longer apply, and failure to support older students in this way shows the shallowness of the government's professed commitment to help younger people complete their education.
What has to be understood is that these measures are being introduced against the backdrop of some $514 million being taken out of student support measures. These are measures that go to questions such as the cessation of the school incidentals allowance for secondary students, the reduction in the maximum rent assistance payable to singles in shared accommodation, the introduction of a two-year waiting period for students newly arrived from overseas, the tightening of the Austudy actual means test, the raising of the age of independence, and the changes to the range of fringe benefits measures taken into account with other family payments and child-care assistance. What we have is a whole raft of measures which actually reduce assistance to students, and these measures have to be seen in that context.
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the important omission from the bill in regard to the financial supplement loan scheme, which was set up by the Labor government in 
 1993. Under this scheme, students could earn $2 on a loan for every $1 of Austudy entitlement up to a maximum of $3,500. Repayments were not required for five years and only then if the recipient's level of income reached average weekly earnings. In 1996, some 68,000 students had taken advantage of these measures.
The full details of the scheme will be set out in the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment Bill that is to come before the Senate, yet this bill provides only that a student financial supplement scheme be established and no details are provided in this piece of legislation. We are told that these are matters that will be dealt with by regulation and that the department has run out of time to get the details right in terms of introducing similar measures in this bill. To me, that is not good enough. I can only suggest that that is because of the serious cutbacks to the Department of Social Security, and I notice in the current budget that the department's running costs are to be reduced by a further 93 per cent. I can only suggest that this government is not able to meet its requirements to the parliament because of the reductions in the Public Service. It seems to me to be an extraordinary proposition that we have not got the details of these programs spelt out in legislation, yet we have a commitment from the minister that, as soon as the department has the time to do it, it will be done in the future.
When we consider the overall impact of the government's common youth allowance—the extra burden it will place on parents of young unemployed, the impact on schools of an additional 27,000 16- and 17-year-olds entering the system, the penalties it imposes on students who work or whose partners work—we can see that the government is not serious about helping Australians complete their education and move into jobs.
For me, the real issue here is that this government is winding back the role of government. It is trying to withdraw support from young people in this country and abandon its responsibility to those young people. It is a measure which must have long-term detrimental impacts for this country. It is a 
 measure predicated on an assumption that the government does not have a responsibility to support young people, to ensure that they are fully participating in our society and are fully capable of enjoying the full benefits of public institutions and of making a full contribution in return to this society. For that this government ought to be condemned. I have no doubt that, in the fullness of time, these issues will become apparent. The issues that Ms Wheatley drew to the minister's attention will be ringing in the minister's ear—not only those issues, but the many other issues that Ms Wheatley has neglected to point out, simply because I do not think that the officer concerned, understandably, had the full experience of the range of issues, particularly on the educational front, that are quite apparent to all those with eyes to see.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-05-13,"—Goodness me, wasn't that a barrage!
—Perhaps you enjoyed it.
—I did not enjoy it, really, and the reason I did not enjoy it is that it gives one a clearer understanding of why it is important that there be a good, strong information campaign to the young people of Australia and to their families as to the positive purpose and the positive outcomes that will be achieved by the youth allowance reforms. If we were to leave the people of Australia under the misapprehension of what has been going over the airwaves this morning, then they would have every reason to think that this was something nasty in the woodshed.
Of course, it is nothing of the sort. It is over $200 million of extra expenditure. It is not a savings measure; it is an important social policy reform which is intended to make sure that young people do not see the dole as an acceptable alternative to study. It is intended to make sure that those aged under 18 do not go on the dole; that they go into some form of skills acquisition. Is the Labor Party suggesting that that is not a worthwhile and important national goal? I would think not. But from the noise we have just heard, you would assume that there was something dreadful about requiring under 18- 
 year-olds to be getting the skills which will actually allow them to get jobs.
One of the most important initiatives that my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, has been pursuing in his portfolio is that of trying to make sure that young people in Australia are not illiterate and innumerate. Under the previous government, we found that that was all too often the case, so that people queuing up at Social Security in unacceptable numbers are illiterate. What chance do they have of getting a job in today's society when unskilled jobs have disappeared under the previous government and around the world? Consequently, if the young people of Australia are to have any hope of getting jobs, they should acquire skills. They should be encouraged to be studying and getting into training rather than being on the dole.
—Why don't you provide the money to run the schools? You took $4 billion out of education.
—Under your government, the Labor government, the encouragement financially was for young people to be on the dole because they were much better off on the dole than they were under Austudy.	  Apart from Senator Carr, I have heard some acknowledgment this morning by senators in the debate that some very positive initiatives have been introduced as part of this youth allowance reform. The rent assistance for the very first time has to be one of the most important initiatives. During the 13 years that Labor ran this country, they had every chance to increase the standard of living of students, and they did not. So we have had students living in poverty and, worse still, we have had young people in country areas not being able to go away to get an education because their low-income to middle-income parents could not afford to send them away.
Now, we have the opportunity for families, especially those with several children, to be able to afford to send their young people away for further education, largely because the availability of rent assistance of up to $75 a fortnight per young person makes the difference. They have a chance of getting 
 skills; they have a chance of getting an education.
I noticed when Senator Carr was giving us the benefit of his wisdom a few minutes ago that he tended to focus on those going into tertiary education. Let me remind the Senate that one of the big problems this country faces now is because the previous government focused on that fortunate 30 per cent who did go on to tertiary education and ignored the 70 per cent who do not. As a result, there are not sufficient vocational education opportunities or traineeships.
—So why have you cut the TAFE program?
—The new apprenticeships introduced by Dr Kemp all will go a long way towards improving the job prospects of young Australians. So don't bellow at me, Senator Carr.
I want to address one issue which Senator Carr was very keen to get on the record—the issue of the personal income test for Austudy payment. What is not recognised is that the personal income test for Austudy payment is based on the allowance test used for all social security allowances, but it gives students access to a higher income-free area and an income bank, as is the case under the youth allowance. So it is better. Under the existing Austudy, by comparison—the one that Labor administered—a student's annual entitlement is worked out using a complex assessment process involving current and estimated future taxable income. Anybody who has been involved in Austudy applications would agree with me; it is something that some senators who spoke previously have acknowledged.
Income above $6,000, under the current arrangements, reduces a student's fortnightly entitlement by 50c in the dollar. If a student has an increase in income part-way through a year, their entitlement may have to be recalculated and an overpayment raised. Students may be assessed under the actual means test if they or their partner are in a designated category.
By contrast, Austudy is a fortnightly payment responsive to a student's circumstances in that fortnight. I thank Senator Neal for her 
 recognition of what a major improvement this is. When a student has gross income above the income-free area of $230 in a fortnight, their entitlement for that fortnight may be reduced unless they have credits in the income bank. For income above the free area, a 50c in the dollar reduction applies for the first $80 with a 70c in the dollar reduction applying to income that exceeds the free area by more than $80. The actual means test does not apply to Austudy payment.
We heard a lot of noise from Senator Carr, but the reality is that more than 98 per cent of the Austudy payment population aged 25 and over will not be affected by adopting the allowance personal income test because the majority of those students have nil or very low personal income. Out of a population of something like 43,000, we are talking about 860 who may be affected because they have income over $6,000. From the noise we heard from Senator Carr, you would have thought we were sending students into gross, grovelling poverty. You can see, Senator Carr, that that angst was grossly overplayed.
The positives of the Austudy payment income test are that a student's income in the fortnight determines their rate of payment. That eliminates the possibility of an Austudy style overpayment, which led to enormous stress and strain and worry for students. It is a major improvement. Students who work over vacation periods can continue to be paid Austudy for periods in the year when they have little or no other income. Under the previous Austudy they may have been excluded from payment for the whole year because of their income. This is a major improvement. We did not hear Senator Carr acknowledging any of that.
Under Austudy payment, the impact of assessing a student's gross income rather than taxable income is expected to be minor. The majority of students, as I have said, have nil or very low income and because Austudy payment is a fortnightly payment, the impact is limited to the fortnight in which expenditure is made. It is a great shame that Senator Carr did not do his homework effectively and was prepared to dishonestly represent the situation in order to frighten people for 
 political purposes. It is not fair. It is clear that this government needs to have an important and effective information strategy to address the disinformation and the fear campaign that some people in the ALP think is going to get them back into government. I think they are rumbled and the people of Australia now know that fear campaigns from the ALP are not based on fact.
Before I conclude, I would like to indicate that we accept the ALP requests for amendments. We undertake to put all the youth allowance related subordinate legislation in the Social Security Act as soon as drafting resources allow—it is not a question of delays in the Department of Social Security; it is pressure on drafting resources—and we expect that to be in the next sittings. As a government, we have undertaken to put the subordinate legislation into the Social Security Act when the drafting is concluded and it comes into the Senate. Of course, provided we win the next election, that commitment will be honoured. I can only say, if an election were to take place in the intervening time and we were not the successful government, I would be asking the Labor Party whether they were prepared to put it in legislation. We also accept the Greens amendments in relation to the liquid assets waiting period and we accept amendment No. 1 from the Democrats.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-13,"—I think it is disappointing that, after an expression of support for the broad policy area of this bill, its passage appears not to be achievable in a manner acceptable to the government. In the spring sittings last year, the government and the other house considered a large number of amendments proposed by the Senate and were unable to agree to those amendments. On 5 December 1997, the Attorney-General said, and I quote:
The government has indicated in the past its desire for the streamlining of the way in which government regulations are produced and scrutinised in order to ensure regulations are relevant, workable and effective and that any unnecessary regulatory burden on business and the community at large is removed. At the same time, the government has modelled the legislation to ensure that the government is able to maintain control of important programs for which it has a responsibility to the community. It has done so by providing minimum exemption from compliance with parts of the 
 legislative package or by exempting parliamentary disallowance of certain limited instruments.
It is important to remember that the reforms contained in this bill reflect a fundamental commitment of the government to the legislature and the legislative process. These reforms may not excite the interest of the masses but they should be welcomed by all parliamentarians. The Legislative Instruments Bill significantly increases the power of the parliament to scrutinise delegated legislation. However, this does not, nor should it, extend to parliament exercising executive power granted by parliamentary delegation. It is incredible that the Senate, the chamber most likely to benefit from these changes, now appears to be obstructing and delaying once more the commencement of these long-awaited changes.
Over the recent recess, the government sought agreement with the Democrats to overcome a number of concerns expressed during the second reading debate. In particular, we sought to overcome the very real concerns regarding sunsetting that had been expressed and also the concerns about gender-specific language. The Attorney-General also said:
One of the most significant issues to come out of the parliamentary consideration by the 1995 Labor chaired House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was the recommendation that sunsetting of all delegated legislation be provided for. This bill gives effect to that recommendation. Now the opposition is trying to move away from sunsetting, making spurious claims that the provisions allow the government to renege on continuing desirable delegated legislation following its sunsetting.
In March the Attorney spent considerable time with Senator Murray or his office trying to overcome his serious concerns with sunsetting. The Attorney thought that those negotiations were very productive and would have resulted in amendments which the government could accept. To assist that process, we developed a mechanism which would ensure that instruments of importance to the parliament would not be sunsetted without the parliament having two opportunities to convince the rule maker that the instrument should be remade. We understood that the Democrats had accepted that approach and were prepared to support that 
 amendment in this chamber. As I am advised, it now appears that our understanding was erroneous and that the Democrats were not serious in trying to seek resolution of the concerns to enable the passage of the bill.
The latest draft of amendments put forward are entirely unacceptable and depart significantly from the approach that we had understood was being adopted following our discussions. For the reasons given to the Senate last year, the government is unable to accept the many recycled amendments that I understand are now being proposed by the opposition and the Greens. The government will again reject those amendments in the other house and the bill will not be returned to this chamber.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-05-13,"—I would like to talk about some of the resource development projects in the north of Western Australia which I visited during the break and to report to the Senate about how these projects are proceeding. First of all, I would like to say a little about the Ord River stage 2 development. The Western Australian and Northern Territory governments announced in April that a joint venture between Wesfarmers and the Marubeni Corporation had been awarded a contract to further evaluate the Ord stage 2 proposal. Wesfarmers, as many senators will know, is a significant Western Australian company with thousands of shareholders and headquarters in Western Australia. Wesfarmers will hold 80 per cent of the joint venture. It is a company with a very grand history of involvement in agriculture in Western Australia and it is appropriate that it should be involved in stage 2 of the Ord development.
The other partner in the joint venture is the Marubeni Corporation, which is one of Japan's leading trading firms and has a great deal of experience in the sugar industry, particularly in the development of sugar mills and refineries. The proposal for the second stage of the Ord is for an investment of some $300 million in an export oriented, raw sugar industry which will produce 400,000 tons of raw sugar per year. It will include the establishment of a sugar mill and development of 
 storage facilities near the port of Wyndham on the far north coast of Western Australia.
Under the plan, irrigated farmland in the Weaber, Knox Creek and Keep River plains will be developed to extend the Ord River scheme to nearly 65,000 hectares. This will take it over the border into the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory government has been involved in the awarding of the contract to Wesfarmers and the Marubeni Corporation, because the second stage of the Ord is going to bring great economic development to the Northern Territory as well as to the north of Western Australia.
It is proposed to set aside land for independent small farmers, thus allowing crop and land ownership diversity in this second stage development. The memorandum of understanding currently being discussed with the proponents is for a feasibility study of the project, so that all issues of controversy relating to the project can be dealt with. If the project is shown to be sound from a financial, economic, technical and environmental point of view, stage 2 will go ahead and this will lead to the development of a world scale sugar industry based around significant sugarcane plantings and a sugar mill on the Ord River.
This will, as I have said, bring major economic development to east Kimberley. It is anticipated there will be some 500 jobs created in the area during the construction phase and a further 170 permanent jobs when the sugar mill is established. In addition, there will be 550 seasonal jobs during harvest time on the sugar plantations and a further 1,200 jobs created in local service industries. Hopefully, some of those jobs will go to indigenous people. It is hoped that indigenous people will take up some of the farmland in the second stage of the Ord and that Aboriginal communities in the north will benefit from this development.
There will be new port and storage facilities at Wyndham and this will lead, in addition, to other jobs. The port of Wyndham will be greatly expanded. There will be dredging of the channel performed and much other infrastructure created in that town—which is one of the oldest towns in the north of Australia 
 and which has gone through something of an economic recession in recent years with the closure of the meatworks there. So the development of stage 2 of the Ord will have a very strong and positive impact on the community of Kununurra and in Wyndham and the whole surrounding area of the north Kimberley, if it goes ahead.
Unfortunately, it is an if—if it goes ahead—and the if, of course, is the question of native title. As it happens, there are three conflicting native title claims on the second stage of the Ord. It is a matter of great concern that, unless these claims are resolved, then this great project will be held up for who knows how long—perhaps many years—and this great development will not occur. I must say it is quite clear that if the development of Ord stage 2 is put on the backburner and deferred for years until the native title issues are resolved, the responsibility will lie with those on the opposition benches who blocked the passage of the government's native title legislation which would have enabled these claims to be resolved in a sensible and equitable way within a reasonable timeframe. If, in fact, this does not happen, then I am sure the people of Australia will know who to blame for it and they will certainly bear that in mind when they go to the polls, presumably in the latter part of this year.
Just for the information of the Senate, there have been no new land releases at Kununurra made in the town or surrounding areas since the introduction of the Native Title Act in 1993, other than a single farming block—and that resulted in extensive litigation. A major residential subdivision involving 200 lots has been delayed due to the impact of native title. In addition, 22 light industrial lots, 10 horticultural lots, a commercial centre and a tourism site have not been able to go ahead due to the slow processes of the existing Native Title Act. As I have said, I am sure that the voters of Australia will bear these facts in mind when they go to the polls in the next federal election. It is quite clear that it is thanks to the opposition and the Democrats that developments—such as the Ord stage 2—have been delayed and that many other similar developments around Australia will be 
 similarly delayed because the government amendments did not pass through the Senate.
Two weeks ago, I visited Karratha and Dampier, where the Pilbara Development Commission informed me that in the next five years it is possible that some $20 billion of investment will be made in resource developments in that area. That is an enormous amount of money and it is going to be the major resource development area of Australia if those investments are made. The possible projects there include: expansion, by a factor of three times, of the liquefied natural gas projects off the north-west coast; the development of a petrochemical plant; and secondary downstream processing of iron ore—which has been a long-term objective of the Western Australian government and is something which we all, as Australians, should be encouraging to happen. We need to not just export iron ore but to develop it into other products and get some superadded benefit to this country from so doing. As I have said, it would seem that Karratha-Dampier is set to become one of the most important industrial areas of Australia, if all the projected development in the area goes ahead.
Again, I am sorry to say that one of the major hindrances to the success of these resource and energy developments has been, and is, native title. The frustration of those in the north was evident on my recent visit when the Shire of Roebourne—the shire that covers Karratha and Dampier—informed me that around 2,500 building sites for workers' homes are being held up due to native title.
The point is that unless accommodation can be built for the workers of these great projects they will become fly-in fly-out projects. That means that they will make almost no contribution to regional development, because fly-in fly-out means that workers come in for a period of two or four weeks and then they are flown back to Perth or to wherever they come from around Australia. They put no roots into the communities and make no contribution to the development of those communities.
So while these projects could go ahead without land being available for worker accommodation it would be at the cost of a contribution to regional development. Once 
 again, we come back to the issue of native title and to the fact that the mechanism which might have resolved the blockage in the provision of land for workers' homes in this area has been caused by the failure of the opposition parties to pass the government's native title amendments. And if regional development suffers as a result of this failure to be able to provide homes for the workers in the Karratha-Dampier area, the voters of Australia, I am sure, will remember that the opposition and their compatriots—the Democrats and the Greens—are to blame for failing to pass the government's Native Title Act amendments.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Western Australia: Resource Development Projects</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to questions without notice asked by Senators Chapman and Senator Lightfoot today, relating to the 1998-99 Budget.
The surplus that has been trumpeted here today in the answers to those questions was built on the back of cuts to health, nursing homes, education, child care, jobs and industry support. The sad thing about those cuts is that, whilst this budget puts some pennies back, it leaves the pounds away. This is a cut that has been borne by families, by workers and by the Australian community, and there is no real gain for them in this budget. The pity is that it was not necessary. Those cuts did not need to occur. Left to the parameters that we set as we went out of government, the budget would have grown, with the changes 
 that we had announced, to being in surplus at this time. That is important to keep in mind when we debate what has so far allegedly been achieved by the Treasurer.
Today we are not so much debating a budget as we are talking about a May economic statement. We know that the real pain and the real issues are down the track, lurking in wait for the Australian electorate as the government announces its so-called tax reform package, a tax reform package that will almost certainly include a goods and services tax—a regressive tax—which will be applied to all Australians irrespective of income. That will be another thimble and pea trick. It will offer tax cuts to middle Australia bought on the backs of all Australians. It will give back less than it takes from the pockets of ordinary Australians.
We know too that the budget surplus that has been trumpeted here today is a surplus that will remain intact for as long as it suits the government. They will use and plunder that surplus when it comes to giving give aways and pork barrelling to those wish-list groups that it favours in the Australian electorate. That is the truth about this budget. Brace yourselves for an election campaign. Brace yourselves for a fist full of dollars election campaign. Brace yourselves for a thimble and pea trick.
The government tells us a number of things about this budget but it also interestingly omits to say a number of things that are important. To get a real picture of the outcome, you need to know that this budget forecasts that export growth will decline. It forecasts that investment levels in the Australian economy will fall. It forecasts that consumer spending for the next year will be down. It forecasts that investment in housing will also drop considerably. It announces in its forward projections that business investment will fall and it discloses in its report that research and development investment in Australia has fallen through the floor. It does those things on the back of a forecast that national savings, the much trumpeted element of this budget, is in fact in decline as well.
Unemployment in this budget is just unbelievable. It is stuck in any case, according 
 to the projections, at a very rubbery eight per cent, not underpinned by the economic growth that the economy needs to sustain the figure. It is a most unbelievable forecast. As well, we know in this budget that the current account deficit for the nation is reeling out of control and has virtually doubled in the last two years from $17 billion to now being a projected current account deficit of $31 billion and that foreign debt has leapt by $26 billion to now rank at the highest in the history of this nation—$222 billion. That is $26 billion above the level of when the now government, when in opposition, rolled its so-called `debt truck' around Australia to declaim the previous government. Under this government, it has risen by $26 billion.
It ought to be remembered that the cuts made in the earlier budgets took $36 billion out of public health; it has only put $2 billion back. In the previous budget, $500 million were taken out of nursing homes; nothing goes back. Cuts of $800 were made to child care; not a cent goes back. Cuts of $3 billion were made to universities; nothing goes back. The jobs programs were cut by $1.8 billion, while youth employment has risen unemployment by 27.1 per cent: a give and take budget. Now wait for the big whammy—the goods and services tax.
In the election that the Prime Minister announced to his party room yesterday, you can be sure of one thing from Labor; you will not have a goods and services tax. You can be sure of one thing from the government; you will have a goods and services tax and, while it will be coated by lucrative tax cuts, look at what you really save. Australia will be the loser.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1998-05-13,"—What humbug we have heard from Senator Cook today. We hear it every time he gets up in the Senate on some matter he wishes to raise in response to questions that have been asked and answers given during question time, but today certainly takes the cake.
The most important priority of a federal government is to maintain a nation's finances in a sound position. Governments cannot do anything else unless the nation's finances are 
 sound. All the other demands that are made on government for initiatives here and action there are dependent on the country and in particular the government finances themselves being in a sound position.
But that is a dictum that was completely ignored by the Labor Party when they were in government because the philosophy of the Labor Party was to spend, to borrow and to tax—nothing else; no responsibility at all as far as financial management was concerned. Let us hear what Mr Gary Evans, the shadow Treasurer said yesterday when he was interviewed on 4QR, in answer to a question that was put in this form:
I can't help but asking if you could have done all these marvellous things with the economy.
These are, of course, the things that the Liberal-National government have done in the last two years—delivered a surplus and reduced unemployment to the lowest rate since 1990 at 8 per cent. `Why didn't you?' the interviewer says to Gary Evans. This is the shadow Treasurer's response, and I quote:
Well, we were—I mean, we ran into the problem of the recession of 1989-90 and 1990-91 with high interest rates and all the rest—
that we all remember with a shudder. What he forgot to say, of course, was that it was a deliberately induced recession by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, who described it as the `recession we had to have.' It was deliberately induced by raising interest rates through the roof and sending small business and home owners through the floor. Small business overdraft rates were 17 to 20 per cent during that period—that is the sort of financial management we saw under the Labor Party, which absolutely sent our economy through the floor.
Over the last two years this government has acted responsibly to restore sound financial management and to lay the basis for economic growth in this country. As a result of that, we have in the budget delivered last night a $2.7 billion budget surplus projected for the 1998-1999 financial year. That is important, not only because it provides a sound basis for the private sector to develop and grow and provide jobs and all the other benefits for the community, but also because it allows us to 
 pay off that other dreadful legacy of the Labor government—our massively accumulated government debt. There was something of the order of $97 billion accumulated under 13 years of Labor—about $80 billion of which was accumulated during their last five years in office.
—A disgrace. A national disgrace.
—An absolute disgrace in terms of economic management—that is right, Senator Lightfoot. Now, because we are generating a surplus, we can start to pay that debt off. Already, we will have succeeded, by the end of 1998-99, in paying off some $31 billion of that debt. With further privatisation of Telstra, over the next three or four years beyond that, we will have that debt down to $23 billion dollars—a massive turnaround and a massive success on the part of a Liberal-National Party government. That not only restores international confidence in the Australian economy but also, most importantly, it frees up money in the annual budget so our budgetary position on an annual basis is even better.
Under Labor, of course, more was being paid out each year by the government in interest than they were spending on defence or education because of the massive debt that they had accumulated. We will get that down to $23 billion and this will free up $5 billion or $6 billion a year out of the annual budget for either further tax reductions and benefits thereby to the Australian community or, if areas of need are identified, provide extra expenditure in those areas of need. The Labor Party fails to recognise this basic fundamental of economic management. As I said, their whole approach is to spend and worry about it later. They will either borrow the money to cover the spending or they will raise taxes to cover the spending; but they do not analyse things properly, they do not get to the nub of issues as far as sound financial management is concerned.
Now we have got the lowest home mortgage rates that Australia has experienced since 1970, falling from 10.5 per cent down to 6.5 per cent—worth $3,800 a year for the average home buyer. These are the benefits delivered

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-13,"—In the context of the questions that Senator Kemp answered on the budget, there has been a great deal of focus on the budget surplus of $2.7 billion. There has also been a great deal of focus in past years on how that has been achieved. We all know of the massive cuts to state funding, health, education, aged care, child care and many more areas. Suffice it to say, it was not necessary to cut to that degree and to the extent to which you did. But the focus on the budget surplus and the contribution to the level of government debt is only part of a very important story. Senator Cook quite rightly raised the issue of what is an extremely worrying figure in respect of the current account deficit.
Senator Cook also raised the issue of total foreign debt, which is also of great concern, given that it has increased by some $26 billion. I looked through budget paper No. 1 in an attempt to find some reference to total foreign debt, particularly given that this government asked question after question on the subject during their period in opposition—in fact, they had a debt truck roaming the country. And surprise, surprise! There is no reference whatsoever to total foreign debt in budget paper No. 1. But, of course, there is extensive reference to the current account deficit and the need for saving—not just government saving, but an increase in total national savings.
If we look at the table on page 1.12 we see the government's projections are for a decrease in private saving and a decrease in gross national saving. In the context of our current account deficit, which is increasing rapidly, this is an extremely worrying economic trend. It is one that Mr Costello and Senator Kemp quite conveniently attempt to evade as much as possible.
If we look at the budget papers on 3.11, in respect of private saving—which the government argues should increase—there is a reference to a prospect and a suggestion of factors that improve the outlook for private saving. There is a reference to the superannuation guarantee—that was an important 
 Labor initiative. There is a reference to the savings rebate—and that, if anything, has cut private saving. There is a reference to tax reform and the prospect that it has the potential to enhance private saving—that, presumably, is a reference to the foreshadowed introduction of a goods and services tax. The argument is that, if you tax consumption through a goods and services tax—sorry, it is now called a BIBIT or a BOBIT; the government is not anxious to use the name GST—
—Do you blame us?
—BOBIT or BIBIT: it will be interesting to see which one you use in the election period. The argument is that if you tax consumption through a GST saving will go up. There is absolutely no evidence that that will happen. I must say that the next paragraph did surprise me. It says:
Finally, quite apart from these policy influences, demographic change over the next decade or so is likely to see a rise in the proportion of the population age groups which historically have been high savers and a decline in younger, low-saving age cohorts.
That is in Budget Paper No. 1 at 3.11. We all know that this country faces an ageing population, and I would have thought it was common knowledge that an ageing population with a increasing proportion who are retired are net dis-savers. So how on earth that can be referred to as a factor that will lead to a very important increase in private saving is beyond me.
Lastly, in Budget Paper No. 1 at 2.7, there is continual reference to Japan:
The outlook for Japan is a matter of concern. Not only is Japan heavily exposed to regional developments, its domestic economy is experiencing substantial weaknesses and shows no sign of an early turnaround.
Well, thank goodness, because we know why Japan has significant economic problems: it introduced a GST at a rate of three per cent some five years ago and it increased that goods and services tax to a rate of five per cent last April. It has absolutely flattened the economy.
There is extensive reference to the strength of the US. What is one outstanding feature of 
 the economy of the United States? It does not have a goods and services tax.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-05-13,"—I am delighted that Senator Cook is still here, because we are eternal optimists on this side of the chamber and we are quite sure that at some stage in the future Senator Cook will try to redeem his economic credentials by eventually apologising for misleading this chamber just prior to the 1996 election by saying that the government's budget was in surplus. Senator Cook, we do actually live in hope that the longer you stay in the chamber—
—Would you like to address the chair, please?
—Yes, Madam Deputy President, I most certainly would. On this side of the chamber we are optimistic enough to think that the longer Senator Cook stays in this chamber, the more chance there is that he might admit that he made a terrible mistake and that he did mislead this chamber by saying that the previous government had a budget that was in surplus prior to the 1996 election when we know that in fact they left us with an enormous deficit.
Senator Cook talks about the surplus we are creating being built on the spending cuts to a range of people. In fact, the surplus this government has brought forward is even more marvellous because it has been built on the back of your enormous deficit. If Senator Cook and Senator Sherry want to claim some economic credentials in this chamber, people only have to look at their efforts over the previous time they were in government to see that they have none at all. Nobody believes what the members of the opposition say with respect to this budget.
If you really want to get some accurate comment about the budget that was put down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last night, you really need to have a look at some third party endorsements from people outside of this place who actually make comments about the budget with some authority. We only need to go as far as the Business Council of Australia and its president, Stan Wallis, who is well regarded by people on the other side of this chamber. He says:
This is a budget that is absolutely right for the times. More importantly, the Howard government has honoured its promise to the Australian people by delivering a budget surplus.
That is something that Senator Cook could never claim. He could never claim to have honoured his promise, because he promised that the budget was in surplus when in fact it was in deficit. Mr Wallis also said that this budget makes sure that we can keep a check on interest rates and inflation. Anybody who remembers the Hawke-Keating period of government will know how devastating high interest rates were to businesses in Australia.
The National Farmers Federation themselves have commented this morning that `the drop of 2.5 per cent in interest rates since March 1996 that has applied to most farmers has been worth $450 million in reduced interest payments for farmers.' On top of that, the provisional tax uplift factor has been further reduced. When the previous government was in place, the provisional tax uplift factor was 10 per cent, and now we have guaranteed that this will be reduced a further percentage point—and this will provide major savings to farmers as well.
Let us go to the comments of some other people. People have talked about the effect on tourism. The chairman of the Tourism Task Force, Mr John Brown, said that the money that has been allocated could not have come at a better time; that the minister, Andrew Thomson, deserves the applause of the industry and its one million workers for this budget result.
—Is that the former Labor Party minister?
—I am not sure if it is the former Labor Party minister, but the name, John Brown, is very familiar. The housing industry says that the government's commitment to a substantial budget surplus is `the right defence for Australia against the Asian economic fallout.' Then you can go to those people who really count, older Australians, the National President of the Association of Independent Retirees, Maureen Kingston, says that she is `delighted that the government has listened to the voice of independent retirees who have endeavoured to provide 
 their own income in retirement and made sure that they are not a burden on this government when it comes to providing an income in retirement for their own good.' (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-05-13,"—I also wish to take note of the answers to questions on the budget. Those on Senator Ferguson's side certainly are eternal optimists. Today's performance seemed to be an example that if you assert the same proposition strongly and often enough, some people eventually will believe you. But people are concerned with both the social costs and the methods of achieving this surplus. None of that was addressed today by the government.
If we look at the costs of this surplus over the term of this government, we come up with figures, contrary to Senator Payne's question about the boost in health, showing a decline of $1.62 billion spending in health. We have a decline of around $400 million spending in aged and community care at the same time as the nursing home debacle; we have a decline of $1.5 billion in employment programs; we have a decline of around $3 billion in education; and we have a decline of around $800 million in child care. People in the community are concerned about these things. People want their services back from this government.
It is incredible that in this budget, as was canvassed during question time with some of the questions, at a time when we have a GDP growth forecast declining from 3¾ per cent down to three per cent, the government predicts that employment growth will increase from its forecast of 1¼ per cent to 1¾ per cent. This is simply incredible, even with the low participation rate, where the government has been driving 100,000 people out of the job market to achieve the still unacceptable level of unemployment remaining—and predicted to remain—at around eight per cent.
I am reminded of this government member's position at the time of Working Nation. We were criticised about the nature of some of our employment programs during Working Nation. At least these people were still in the job market. This government is driving people out of the job market to reduce their unemployment levels—it is incredible.
At the same time, we have this government claiming the benefits of low inflation rates and the benefits for people in home ownership. What we did not hear today is that there is a decline in the home ownership growth; it is contracting. Why is it contracting? Because to own a home and to pay off a mortgage you need a job, and this government is not concerned about employment. Employment is a non-core promise; it is not important.
At this stage we need to be concentrating on growth. We need a higher level of growth if we are going to do anything about unemployment. We cannot get ourselves into a position where we solve our balance of payments problems unless we start looking at issues such as skills, infrastructure, innovation and net exports. We need to be doing more than just the 1½ pages of comments on the millennium bug. Sure, it is an important problem, but we need to be doing far more in relation to Australian industry than that and additional assistance to tourism. We will not generate employment for our future work force.
Let us look at what the budget did do for Australian industry. There is nothing in the budget to relieve the pain that Australian industry is going through at the moment. Instead, the government has delivered the following: a $300,000 cut to the anti-dumping system at a time when manufacturers are facing unprecedented international pressure with the Asian economic crisis; and a major underspend of R&D START program. In the 1998-99 period, there will be a further 2.36 shortfall according to the budget papers. Where is innovation?
Not one cent has been set aside, despite the Prime Minister's promises, for the textiles, clothing and footwear industry assistance package. It must not have been a core promise. There is a continuing decline in support for manufacturers from $542 million in the 1997-98 period to $405 million in 2001-2002. There is the abolition of the shipbuilding bounty in 1998-99. There is a collapse in support for information technology. This area, where the government has claimed major initiatives, is going from $84 million to only $6 million over four years.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-05-13,"—I would also like to join this debate in regard to the budget. Like Senator Ferguson, I am also bewildered that the day after the budget is delivered back on track in the black with a reduction of the $10.5 billion deficit, the opposition happen to bring out as its lead attack in the first question, Senator Cook. Senator Cook, as we all know—Senator Ferguson made the point—has no credibility to discuss budget surpluses or budget matters at all, when he was party to the cover-up of the previous government's $10.5 billion deficit.
Even his shadow minister, Mr Gareth Evans, has come clean on the matter. He has told us, `Yes, there was a $10.5 billion deficit.' So why doesn't Senator Cook, before he makes comments on this government's budget, come in here and apologise for his cover-up? Then we may turn our attention to some of his questions. He came in and quoted the Treasurer's past comments in 1995. He quoted them quite correctly because they were good comments in relation to the current account.
The current account deficit of this government is far apart and different from the previous government's. The difference is that your current account deficit was a higher percentage of GDP—6½ per cent and rising and dangerously rising—while our current account deficit is in fact falling.
—It's getting worse.
—It is around the five per cent mark, Senator Sherry. That is the difference. But more than that; the current account deficit has taken—
—What about foreign debt?
—I will get on to foreign debt. The current account deficit has been affected of course by the Asian economic crisis. So it is not an import-driven current account deficit as it was in your time, affecting interest rates and affecting the inflation rate. Rather, we have—and how could we avoid it—a current account deficit affected by our exports. That is the second difference.
The third one is, as the Treasurer has said, if you had a current account deficit problem— 
we do not deny that it is an ongoing problem that does require management—then what is the first thing you do? What is the first advice you would get? It would be to bring your budget into surplus, and that is exactly what we did and that is exactly what you did not do. That is the answer to the current account deficit and it is very similar in relation to the foreign debt.
The foreign debt has levelled out. It has not jumped from $30 billion in 1983 when you first entered government to around the $200 billion mark—that was the jump in your 13 years. It has increased slightly; it has in fact levelled out. How do you tackle foreign debt of this level? You introduce a surplus budget; you get your own government expenditure and revenue into order. And that is what we have done.
In fact, the foreign debt has also decreased as a percentage of GDP. They are very good figures. They have been achieved with no tax increases and on time, as has been said, even with the Asian economic firestorm which is engulfing the whole world. As a result, we have the lowest interest rate since pre-Whitlam days. We have the lowest inflation rate since pre-Whitlam days. We have the first true, underlying surplus since pre-Whitlam days. And we have the lowest unemployment rate since the recession. That is still an ongoing problem that requires management, but it has been wound back since the worst days of your government. We will not stop there—that was the first leg of our journey. The second leg of our journey is to reduce debt.
I want to pick up two points with regard to Senator Cook's hackneyed comment that this surplus has been achieved on the back of cuts in health and social security. They were fair and necessary cuts, and the market and the community judged them as such. Also, Senator Cook should speak to former Senator Kernot about this, because she says that the reforms introduced by this government, particularly in the social security area, will not be changed if the Labor Party gets into government. That is an endorsement of our changes and it utterly contradicts what Sena 
 tor Cook and Senator Jacinta Collins are trying to sell here today.
—Order! The time for the debate has expired.

Appendix 1
Name of bill:

Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Reform Bill 1998
Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
Consideration needs to be given to the fact that the Bill seeks to remove the guidance provided by Part III of the Disability Services Act; AAT appeal rights and the training allowance. There may be implications regarding workers compensation insurance for people placed in employment under the scheme. The potential effects of opening up the disability services employment and rehabilitation market to private enterprise need further consideration especially in relation to services in regional and remote areas. The way that the corporatised CRS is to interact with flex services needs to be examined, specifically the charging of fees for service to both employers and job seekers. Issues of accountability and the regulatory environment of the scheme need further examination.

Leave granted.
—I have not moved the usual motion for the adoption of the committee's report at this stage, but I intend to do so by leave after the tabling and consideration of committee reports tomorrow morning. I understand that agreement has been reached on this course of action. The delay results from the inability of the committee to make a recommendation in respect of the referral of the provisions of the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998  and the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  and that time for further negotiations is required.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-13,"—by leave—I apologise to Senator Harradine if he was not consulted about this. It was done at the request of the opposition following the impasse at the Selection of Bills Committee yesterday and partly because Senator Schacht, who handles the matter for the opposition, is a pair and away from parliament today. He wished to be in the chamber for the debate on how we handle the reference of the bill. He will not be back in parliament until tomorrow as he is dealing with a personal matter in Adelaide. We sought deferral for a day so that the chamber gets a chance to debate it, but while Senator Schacht is here. We initiated the request and the government agreed. It was 
 also hoped that there might be some chance of reaching an agreement in the mean time. The delay was brought about by our seeking that indulgence for Senator Schacht.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-05-13,"—Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Faulkner moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1106.
Briefly, there are two motions today for the discovery of certain documents. Mine is a much more specific motion. It only refers to focus group research undertaken by this government. The government has basically given, over time, four reasons for the non-production of documents: firstly, commercial-in-confidence; secondly, advice to government; thirdly, that there may be some threats to the security of individuals; and I would anticipate a fourth one that there are currently certain court proceedings in the Federal Court. May I say, Madam President, that none of those four objections could possibly apply to this far more restricted return to order.
Firstly, it is certainly not commercial-in-confidence to get focus group research. Secondly, it is not advice to government, otherwise this government would not have produced and forwarded to an estimates committee and to myself two sets of research in the last six months—namely, the focus group research into regional forest agreements and, secondly, focus group research into the testing of the Wik ads. On both occasions, the government, by way of request—one by way of request of an estimates committee and one by way of request of freedom of information—has supplied that material.
The third ground, which generally and broadly covers the ACIL documents that Minister Alston has referred to on occasion, is that he is worried about the threat to security of people involved in these reports. No such prohibition applies simply to getting the results of focus group research. Finally, that focus group research has absolutely no relevance at the moment, and never will, to conspiracy proceedings in the Federal Court. I think there is an arguable case for the 
 government to produce this focus group research, and to do it urgently.
It is made a little more poignant, however, when you look at to whom the focus group research was given. It was given to a company run by Mr Mark Textor. Mr Mark Textor of course is the Liberal Party pollster. I would like to know and I would like to be assured by the production of this material that he was not doing research that was useful to the Liberal Party. I suspect not. I suspect that, once these documents are handed over, if this motion is eventually carried and if we go through all of the proceedings and they actually hand over the focus group research, there is not going to be any dynamite in it. It will show, however, that the government used taxpayers' money and employed the Liberal Party pollster to let them know what the community attitudes were on the waterfront issues before they in fact launched their general strategy.
I can remember in government on many occasions the present government members demanding the production of opinion polling research. On many occasions it was handed over, on some it was not. Similarly, once we reverse our roles, we demand the opinion poll research. Sometimes it is handed over, sometimes it is not. But on this occasion I believe it should be because all the objections to the production of the rest of the ACIL documents are not relevant to the production of the specific documents.
They will show a government quite happy to spend $42,000 of taxpayers' money employing a Liberal Party pollster—and, on occasions, I might add, a push pollster—to do their research before they in fact developed a strategy on the waterfront. I would have liked to have included in my motion the report by Mr Jonathan Gaul, another member of the Liberal Party glitterati, who was also paid to provide a communications strategy, but I did not include it here because at least it possibly would have been barred to me under the question of advice to government.
So, in summary, I believe this motion is urgent. I believe it should be carried. I would hope that at some stage we might be able to cut to the chase and not go through another 
 25 minutes of debate and, if that is carried, another 25 or 30 minutes of precedence debate and then the substance of the motion, because I do not think any of that debate will change anyone's vote on this particular matter. I would hope that at some stage we might get an indication from people around the chamber so we can cut to the chase, have a vote and win or lose it.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>WATERFRONT</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-05-13,"—I can certainly say, with confidence, to the Senate that this matter of public importance is supported not only by members of the opposition but, indeed, by many members and leaders of the coalition parties around this country, because what they know—what the premiers and ministers for health in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory know—is that the health system, the public hospital system in this country, is fast approaching a crisis.
What the people know is that this government has inadequately funded the public hospital system during the two years since it came into office.
The people of Australia will recall that at the last election John Howard promised to maintain Medicare and to look after ordinary Australians. Yet in two years that promise has been broken time and time again. In two budgets, this government has almost destroyed the public hospital system in this country. It has wrought such havoc on the public hospital system that, at the last premiers conference, five premiers from the coalition parties—which John Howard and Mr Fischer represent in this parliament—together with the leader of the Northern Territory walked out of the premiers conference because of the inadequate proposals by this government for future health funding in this country. It was an historic first.
These were not Labor Party premiers who did this. Only one of the premiers—Bob Carr—is a Labor premier. All of the others represent the parties that make up the federal government in this country, and they walked 
 out. Why did they walk out? They walked out because they knew that this government was not living up to its promise and, furthermore, was continuing to drive nails into what could well be the coffin of public hospital and public health in this country unless remedial action is taken quickly.
Over the last two years, the government has reduced funding for health care in this country by $3.6 billion. It  reduced funding to public hospitals by $800 million. Funding reductions were forced upon the states by this government's fetish for reducing the deficit. That was the first ingredient of that $3.6 billion. Secondly, it abolished the public health dental program established by the previous Labor government—a program costing some $400 million. Thirdly, it cut a total of $1.4 billion out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, forcing up the prices of many necessary drugs and also removing many important drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.
A further $1 billion funding for Medicare was cut as a result of the government's refusal to adjust the Medicare rebate. That has now been belatedly recognised in last night's budget but, nevertheless, it has been criticised by the AMA as a drop in the bucket compared to what is required for public health funding in this country at the moment. On top of those $3.6 billion worth of cuts in federal government funding to the states for public health, and particularly for the public hospitals system, we have also seen a continuation in the decline of health insurance even though the government put $1.7 billion into trying to prop the system up.
There has been further pressure on the public hospitals systems in the states as a result of changes to nursing homes. As a result of this government's insane desire to force the elderly to sell their homes so as to pay huge accommodation bonds to get into nursing homes, or to pay huge increases in charges for nursing homes, greater pressure has been applied to the public hospital system as people are staying in public hospitals when they should be in other forms of aged care, such as nursing homes. This is a form of cost shifting back to the states. Yet this govern 
 ment penalised the states last year by withholding $81 million, supposedly for alleged cost shifting by the states. That has not been proven. Last week it was admitted in evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs that the Commonwealth suspected there was cost shifting by the states. They do not have any real proof. Nevertheless, they decided they would not write out the cheque for $81 million to give to the states as they originally were committed to do.
The record of this government over the past two years has been massive reduction, as I have said, of around $3.6 billion in funding for public hospitals and associated programs which are administered by the states but which—as has been recognised for many years—require a significant federal contribution. It has been the case that the states—if you track back over the last five years or so—have had to increase their spending on health by around 22 per cent.
The federal government increase has only been of the order of 16 per cent. The significant difference relates to the last two years under the coalition government when they have slashed their proportion of health funding that was otherwise required. I notice the minister is in the chamber. He will probably again try to distort the picture of what the government's offer is, as he did in question time.
The government claim that they are increasing the funding for health by $2.9 billion. I am not allowed to use the term `lie' because it is unparliamentary; but Huckleberry Finn used to say, about his sometime colleague Tom Sawyer, that he `stretched the imagination', sometimes a bit, sometimes a lot—and then there were what he called `whoppers'. And this is one of the whoppers of all time—this claim by the government that they are increasing funding by $2.9 billion or 15 per cent.
The real increase in this budget—which has been on the table for the states for the last six months but was rejected by the states—is of the order of 1.1 per cent. That was made clear in evidence to the Senate committee last week. For instance, $300 million of this $2.9 
 billion results from a statistical recalculation of the forward estimates—due to changes in the forecast for the wage cost index. Of this $2.9 billion, $479 million is for mental and palliative care programs—but that is really just a continuation of existing programs; it is not new money. It is not a real increase; it is a carrying-on of previous programs. An amount of $682 million is said to be for quality and access programs—but there is no indication of how those funds will be distributed, they are at the discretion of the Commonwealth and there is no guarantee that all states and territories will receive a share.
More importantly, none of these funds are available to meet ongoing service delivery costs. They are one-off payments to the states for particular `quality and access' programs. Further, there is $500 million of this $2.9 billion which is one-off project funding for what is called `systems restructuring in accordance with the Commonwealth priorities'. Again, this is not for the basic services of treating public patients in public hospitals.
We have ended up with a position whereby around 1.4 million Australians will be unfunded for public hospital treatment over the course of the next five years. They are not just my words. If you do not necessarily believe me then listen to what your own five state ministers are saying, because last night they put out a press release. The ministers—Dean Brown, Liberal from South Australia; Kevin Prince, Liberal from Western Australia; Robert Knowles, health minister, Liberal from Victoria; Peter McKay, Liberal from Tasmania; Dr Andrew Refshauge from New South Wales—he's Labor; and Denis Burke, Country Liberal Party, from the Northern Territory,—expressed amazement that the federal budget does not contain one extra dollar for the nation's hospitals, despite being billed by federal Treasurer Peter Costello as a `big winner for health'. The press release says:
""This budget will barely help us keep up with the growing demand for heart surgery alone,"" the Ministers said.
I have not got time to read this press release, Madam Acting Deputy President, but I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.

FEDERAL BUDGET IGNORES THE PLIGHT OF THE NATIONAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM
State and Territory Health Ministers today expressed amazement that the federal budget does not contain one extra dollar for the nation's hospitals, despite being billed by Federal Treasurer Peter Costello as a `big winner' for health.
`This budget will barely help us keep up with the growing demand for heart surgery alone,' the Ministers said.
The States have conservative figures showing that the current Medicare offer will leave more than 1.43 million patients unfunded over five years, and this budget will be absolutely no comfort for them as they face longer waits for treatment.
`We welcome the initiative to give GPs additional funding, but this is only half the equation. We need immediate and significant financial recognition of the strain faced by our nation's hospitals due to declining private health insurance, an ageing population and high-cost technology.'
The ministers disputed again the Federal Government's claim that the new Medicare offer contains $2.9 billion of new funding.
`As a group, we have sat in meetings with Minister Wooldridge where he denied that figure, and certainly our combined top bureaucrats cannot find that money in the bottom line.'
`The reality is that there is only $69 million of new money over five years—not enough to run the nation's hospitals for a day, let alone the whole term of the Medicare system.'
`The truth is that the Federal Government made an explicit promise at the last election to maintain Medicare as an accessible, quality service for Australians, and now they must put adequate money into the system to keep that promise.' 

The Health Ministers have been fighting for increased funding for hospitals for more than six months now, in the negotiations of the new Medicare agreement.
`Yet all we have received in return is a budget which totally ignores conditions in our hospitals, and insults that we have ripped State funding from our hospitals. There is not one jurisdiction that is not paying significantly more for its hospitals now than it was five years ago.'
`The Federal Government seems to think the Medicare negotiations are just a political game, in which they can push and pull figures at will.'

—Before calling Senator Herron, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of former Senator Shirley Walters—welcome back.
—Hear, hear!",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-05-13,"—I take a great deal of pleasure in responding to Senator Forshaw's motion. I am delighted that Senator Shirley Walters and Dr David Walters are in the public gallery, because Senator Walters would recognise the blatant hypocrisy of what we have just heard from the opposition. They have got form—they were 13 years in government. I have been here for eight years and for six of those years I tried to tell them what was wrong with the public hospital system. Do you think they took any notice? Not at all.
It is very simple: when they came into government 13 years ago there was a balance—50 per cent of people went to public 
 hospitals and 50 per cent to private hospitals. Sixty per cent of people were actually privately insured. The first thing they did when they were in government was to pull the rug out from under private health insurance. It is no wonder, because I have got lovely quotes here from over the last 13 years. You will have to forgive me, Madam Acting Deputy President, but this is Paul Keating on 11 March 1993:
That is where Medicare is fair as it pushes out the private doctors and private insurance—they will rip the sick apart.
That was their Prime Minister, and he pulled the rug out from private health insurance. It is no wonder that private health insurance went down the tube.
But you can go later than that. Carmen Lawrence in parliament on 30 August 1994 said:
We are going to make sure that those premiums come down, that people get value for money and that it will not be at the expense of the public health system.
That was the Labor Party's own health minister. But there is more. On 15 April 1994:
The government has an obligation to provide quality health care for every citizen. If people want more than that, in the form of private rooms or choice of specialist or access to cosmetic surgery or whatever it is, they pay for it.
So they pulled the rug out from under the private hospital system and, of course, people are forced into the public hospital system.
Who provides the health system in the states? The states do. The states are responsible for health care within the public hospital system. They are being overwhelmed by the number of people who are accessing it, not only because of growth of population but also because of the ageing population. The demands of the ageing population are putting enormous difficulties onto the public hospital systems of this country.
It did not happen in the last two years, Senator Forshaw; it had been going on for 13 years under your government and we are trying to clean up the mess. We inherited a $10.3 billion deficit, as you know, and we have had to cope with bringing the budget into surplus and, at the same time, trying to address the problems in the public hospital 
 system. We have pumped money into private health insurance to try to restore that balance. I can forecast confidently, as I have done before, that it will plateau. It has still been falling, but it plateaued in the December quarter. There has been a slight rise in the March quarter, but I expect that it will now plateau because it has plateaued in my own state of Queensland for the last 13 years because we have had a different system there.
Senator Forshaw has come in with crocodile tears and said  that this government is not doing enough for the public hospital system, while disbelieving the evidence of his own eyes, because that is all you can do in relation to the figures in the budget. They are true, and the offer to the states has been increased by 15 per cent over five years. The figures are in the budget papers. I invite Senator Forshaw to have a look at them. If he disbelieves the evidence of his own eyes, he is just caught up in the hypocrisy that he produced for us just now. The Commonwealth's offer is a very generous one.
—Your figures are shonky.
—It provides an additional $2.9 billion for hospital funding over the next five years, with real growth over the five years of 14.9 per cent. It is in the budget figures. Senator Forshaw ignores them.
—The states reckon the figures are crook.
—The states are persisting in their claims. I have the Crowley file here. Would you like the Crowley file?
—I have the Dean Brown file, I have the Peter McKay file—these are state health ministers.
—I will drag out the Crowley file for you soon. I have not got it, because I do not like quoting people who are still here, but the fact is that she consistently said that the states are always bleeding for more funds because it is their responsibility.
Senator Forshaw's argument falls down because the Queensland government has accepted the Medicare agreement. That blows him out of the water. There is a state that has accepted the Commonwealth government's 
 offer. The ACT government were first cab off the rank and have accepted it already. So two of them have already accepted it. The reality is that even if they do not accept it we have guaranteed that they will get the funding that we have offered to them. If they do not sign up, as you know, they will not get the additional funding which has been offered to them to help with waiting lists—
—It is a bribe.
—They will still get the funding. Does Senator Forshaw really think that the states are going to say, `We don't want any more money'? Senator Forshaw, they have done it forever. They have always done that. Of course, they always say that they could have better health care provision from the public hospital system. They are persisting in their claim that they need an additional $1.1 billion a year. That means an increase in Commonwealth funding of 20 per cent. Have you ever heard of an ambit claim, Senator Forshaw? I am sure he has, Madam Acting Deputy President, as he comes from the union movement. They are ambit claims. Of course we recognise that. That is what it is all about. In view of the form of the Labor Party over a 13-year period, what Senator Forshaw is saying is the essence of hypocrisy.
Senator Forshaw suggested that they are dodgy figures. I point out that the states' own submission to the Senate inquiry into the agreement legislation included a graph showing data from a range of sources on relative Commonwealth and state spending over the life of the present agreements. I am happy to table that. It gives the lie to what he just said. This graph shows up the hypocrisy of the so-called dodgy figures, because the states' own graph confirms the Commonwealth figures. It clearly demonstrates that the states reduced their funding in 1993-94 and in 1994-95 while Commonwealth funding increased sharply.
—I acknowledge that.
—Senator Forshaw says graciously that they acknowledge that. But I am pointing out that he does not believe them. He does not believe the states' own graph, because that was the essence of his argument before. The graph clearly demon 
 strates the difference between the Commonwealth's record of continuously increasing spending and the states' record of ripping money out of health. Senator Forshaw's suggestion that the Commonwealth had dropped its plan for a one per cent annual cut or efficiency dividend on palliative care and mental health funding is completely untrue. There never was such a plan.
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I know that this might be ruled as a debating point, but I never said a word about a one per cent efficiency dividend in the entire speech. Senator Herron is actually getting today confused with the Hansard  from last week's hearing.
—There is no point of order. It is a debating point.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, he said that within the Hansard . I accept his statement on that. I did not know—
—I didn't say anything about it today at all—not a word.
—I accept that. I was not here at the beginning of Senator Forshaw's speech, and I apologise for—
—You are thinking of last week's Hansard  from a different hearing, you goat.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I ask him to withdraw that .
—Senator, would you please withdraw that.
—I withdraw the word `goat'.
—Senator Forshaw has acknowledged that in another hearing he made that assertion.
—I think you had better check the record completely, Senator Herron, before you start making accusations.
—I can understand Senator Forshaw getting a bit touchy, because after all he has not got a feather to fly with. After 13 years of the Labor Party putting the public hospital system into the state that it is now in, he is making these assertions when 
 the agreement had nothing to do with us over the last two years, because it is the Labor Party's five-year agreement which is being renegotiated now—and Senator Forshaw should be aware that the Medicare agreements last for five years. We are offering a 15 per cent increase. So he uses this motion to say that they are dodgy figures. I am pointing out that there are no dodgy figures. On the states' own admission they cut their spending in the past. Now they are trying to make up the difference by getting it from the Commonwealth. There is nothing new.
So I come back to the original point that it was the Labor Party—for example, by taking out the bed day subsidy—that produced the major crisis in private hospital funding. And with the ageing population, the increase in technology, the increasing cost of running a public hospital system, there is no magic wand. It will take us years to fix the system, but we are taking the right steps. We are subsidising private health insurance, so if we can get back to that magic figure of 50 per cent of people going to private hospitals—it is only 20 per cent now and the rest are dependent on the public hospital system—then we will have a system that will work in this country. People accept that Medicare is essential. We believe it is too. We believe that people have a right to access Medicare, but to try to lump onto the present government the problems of the public hospital system is just blatant hypocrisy, and it is time that Senator Forshaw took his medicine, realised that his own government produced this effect and withdrew his motion.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-05-13,"—It was most interesting to listen to the minister. I will not accuse him of using rubbery figures, but I will accuse him of using selective figures because he likes to completely ignore the cuts that were made to health over the past two years; indeed, these cuts are forecast to go through for five years. As he seems to have misplaced them, I would like to read them onto the record. Public hospitals were cut by this government in 1997-98 by $76.8 million; in 1998-99, there will be $78.9 
 million in cuts to the public hospitals; for 1999-2000, the projected cuts are $82.6; the next year, $85.5; and in 2001-2002, $88.5 million.
Then you have to look at all the other cuts to health—dental services, $112.8 million this year going on through to $120.6 million by the year 2001-2002. The actual cuts to Medicare—that includes the cuts to GPs—are $375.9 million in 1997-98; in 1998-99, $247.9 million; 1999-2000, $276 million and so it goes on up to $321.2 million. In PBS and other cuts, $136.0 million last year and $247.9 million this year.
It does not stop there, because they also cut the grants to the states. If you look at what percentage of their total grants the states spend on health, you can get a calculation that for 1997-98 the cut to health was $213 million and $100 million this year. That gives us a figure of approximately $1 billion this year, and it grows, so that we have a total of $6 billion in cuts to health.
Then we can talk about the small increase we got this year, but effectively what that means is that the government is putting back about $345 million. In other words, they have cut $1 billion and they have put back about 34c in the dollar. And the minister comes into this place and says, `We should be happy with that; we should be jumping up and down like some of the newspaper headlines are,' suggesting that the health budget is wonderful. I suggest that the minister and some of those journalists go and visit hospitals as I have been doing over the last few weeks.
I want to make some comments—and this has been reported in the Advertiser—as to the state of some of the hospitals in South Australia. Flinders Medical Centre is facing a $2 million budget blow-out after patient admissions went up by 2,000 on their average admissions. The only thing I think I can agree with Senator Herron on is that the budget cuts in health began under the Labor government. As Senator Herron said, it is the current Medicare agreement that has partly got us to this crisis. But, as a result of previous cuts, staff numbers at Flinders have been cut by 250, or 10 per cent, since 1994-95.
It is suspected—we have not seen the final figures—that the Women and Children's Hospital in Adelaide will be slightly over its $113 million budget because of extra demand. Funding has been cut by $20 million in the past five years. For the Royal Adelaide Hospital, staff have been cut from 3½ thousand to 2½ thousand over the last 10 years due to the cutbacks. While staff are said to be just coping they would certainly be able to do more if funding were available. With Whyalla Hospital and Health Service, the budget has blown out by $1.3 million. Staff, however, are already down from 430 five years ago to 287 now. And so it goes on.
I visit hospitals in rural South Australia and in rural Victoria and talk to the CEOs and every single one of them is running a hospital on the limit—on the absolute knife edge. They are in a situation where there is absolutely nothing to spare and nothing to cut. They have contracted out everything they can possibly contract out, in many cases finding they have saved very little money at all. All the contracting out has done is further demoralise an already pressured staff.
So we come back to the basic conclusions that the health ministers have come to, that they put very eloquently before the Senate committee last week. It is the Commonwealth which holds the purse strings; it is the states that have to run the hospital system; and the states have no other major revenue raising source. They are already stretching gambling to the limit, which this government has now admitted is a problem and is going to look into. There is no other place for the money that is needed to run our hospitals to come from but from the Commonwealth government.
What the Democrats asked for in this budget, as we had a $3 billion deficit that really was not there—the black hole was a lot smaller than this government had led us to believe; in other words, $3 billion worth of cuts should never have been made—was that the first port of call was to put the $1 billion back into health. That was the absolute minimum that the health ministers themselves asked for. In other words, basically to help them fund their hospitals and to fund all those 
 other health services that will help keep people out of hospital. If you put pressure on dental services; if you put pressure on community health services; if you put pressure on doctors so they stop bulk-billing; where do people end up? They end up in accident and emergency at all hours of the night.
So you find, as I found when my youngest daughter had to go into Accident and Emergency in a large Sydney hospital, a wait of hours. As she needed acute care, she was able to jump the queue but the queue was four or five hours long. She then needed a bed, only to find that there weren't any. So, after being resuscitated, she was left lying in Accident and Emergency for many, many hours. This is the story no matter which public hospital you visit.
I suggest that Senator Herron in this place and the minister in the other place spend some time visiting a couple of dozen public hospitals and talking to staff, talking to nurses in particular, talking to the CEOs, having a chat to the interns and the registrars and talking to the specialists to get a proper picture of what is actually happening. If they do not believe they should fund it, then they must suggest to the states where the states are going to get the money from to fund our public hospital system. As any state will tell you—and I must suggest here that probably Tasmania is in a slightly worse position than even South Australia—they are running to the limit and it cannot go on.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-13,"—The Greens (WA) agree that the funding of hospitals is hopelessly inadequate, but I also agree with Senator Lees that it is not only the funding of hospitals, but also the priorities in relation to the funding of health care that are hopelessly inadequate. You cannot continue to leave provision of health to the pointy end—to the emergency end—of medicine and assume that you will be able to cope with inadequate levels of funding.
The longer term prospects of health must include preventative health. The longer term concept of health must include adequate funding of community-based health services so that those people who are prospective victims of strokes, heart problems, asthma and 
 so on do not continually end up at the most expensive pointy end of medicine—that is, in hospitals rather than in prevention.
It is quite clear that Dr Wooldridge's miserly offer under the Australian health care agreement has been rejected by the majority of the states. The states have been forced to accept more responsibility for health programs, without adequate financial compensation. The inadequacy of funding is a testimony to this government's attitude towards its role in providing essential services to improve the quality of life of all Australians.
We know that the issue of competition policy comes into this as well. We have a situation where there is no specific exemption for health under competition policy on a national basis; that is, in the end, where they can be, all health services will be outsourced. Under competition policy, so much will have to be written into the contracts that, before we know it, not just the current staffing that is being outsourced—the catering and all those things which make it more and more difficult for patients and patient outcomes—but health outcomes in many more ways as well will be subject to the bottom line dollar, which we all know is not the way we would choose for best patient outcomes.
The benchmarks of efficiency and productivity do not factor into quality of patient care as hospitals are already understaffed and increasingly subject to financial strain. It undermines and lessens our grip and focus on quality of health. So the issues are not just about funding, they are about policies which impact on the proper decision making of hospitals.
In the absence of guarantees or details of exemptions, we also have to look at the possible impact on health funding of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. The future adequacy of health funding must be seen in terms of potential international obligations under the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. International investors may be able to require access to health service provision and government funding.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-05-13,"—I think the people on the other side—the members of the Labor Party, and also 
 Senator Margetts and Senator Lees—are suffering from retrospective hindsight blindness. This is obvious if you look at the Labor Party's record on health. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) very adequately went through Labor's record in the House in March last year.
When the Medicare agreements were being set up last time there was an argy-bargy. The then Labor minister for health was having an argument with what were then mostly Labor states about the fact there was not enough funding. It went on and on and they were not going to sign. This happens every time we have Medicare agreements: the states and the Commonwealth pull to and fro about funding.
We had a system of public hospitals under Labor whereby the Commonwealth had put in more money in the last Medicare agreement but had no capacity whatsoever to have control over the states just taking the money out. The government knew this. When the Minister for Health and Family Services was speaking in the House last year, he said:
The Leader of the Opposition when Minister for Finance walked around the country, wailed and bleated and said how awful it was, but what have they done? Nothing.
The Labor government's agreement with the states was such that it had very little control over it. In the budget last night, the government's commitment is to pay in full the offer made to the states on the Australian health care agreements at the 20 March Premiers Conference, and it includes a total of almost $2.2 billion additional funding over the next five years.
The Commonwealth has also decided to meet the full costs of public hospital services provided to entitled veterans, giving the states access to an additional $750 million over the next five years—that is, the gold card for eligible veterans who have served in the Australian armed forces, who are over 70 years, and who have faced hostile forces. They are entitled to a gold card which, for those veterans who may be listening, is not only for their hospital costs but means that they do not have to pay the Medicare levy if they are currently paying it. It also gives them 
 access to services such as dental, physiotherapy, podiatry, chiropractic, et cetera.
Not only does the gold card give those veterans access to private hospitals, but it also takes many of those veterans out of the public health system and thus opens up more beds and more opportunities for people who are not veterans—so it has a double effect. There is $750 million for that alone over the next five years. These amounts are additional to the forward estimates based on the costs of existing agreements. In total, the Commonwealth will be funding the states with $30.2 billion over the next five years to assist them in providing health services.
As well as increasing base funding, the Commonwealth offer includes a continuation of the mental health and palliative care programs which were due to end in 1997-98; funding for improving the quality of services; and $500  million for a national development fund to support projects and programs to reform the acute health system. So there is $500 million for a national development fund to support projects and programs to reform the acute health system. In addition to the funding set out in the budget, the Commonwealth proposal would provide states with an additional $83 million to compensate for each percentage point drop in the private health insurance participation rate should that occur.
When Labor was in government the number of doctors in rural areas declined. Labor bleated about it, but what did it do? Nothing. Our minister for health has put in place training programs and incentives to get young doctors to think about going into rural areas. He has brought in a lot of innovation to encourage medical practitioners to move into rural areas. But under Labor there was no particular focus, no training focus, to meet the needs of people in rural areas. Under Labor, private health insurance was bleeding without stopping. During the election campaign in 1993, then Labor minister Graham Richardson said:
Unfortunately, again, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem,  by the way, that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are, a much faster rate than anyone in the Government's been predicting and it just goes on and on. 

Did they do anything about it? Did they try to encourage  people to go into private health insurance? No. Carmen Lawrence, the then minister for health, and the Prime Minister did not have private health insurance. They did not set an example, nor would they agree to a surcharge for high income earners. After the budget in 1996, Graham Richardson said:
When I left—
the Labor Party—
as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance . . . 
That really sums up everything. He goes on to say:
One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for high-income earners who refused to take out private insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals.
Senator Crowley, when she was representing the minister for health in this chamber, used to say, `Oh, no, it is only young people that are leaving private health insurance. They don't actually add to the hospital queues.' But then we had Graham Richardson saying, `Yes, they did.'
So Labor did nothing about that. We have brought in incentives for people on low incomes to take out private health insurance—a carrot—and we have a stick for those on high incomes who fail to take out private health insurance.
—How well is it working?
—The question is: is it working?  When the Labor Party was in government, there was a haemorrhaging out of private health insurance to the point where it was not going to be viable. We have stemmed that haemorrhaging. Just wait until after the taxation returns go in and people on high incomes realise that they will have to pay an increased Medicare levy, because you will find that some of them will revert to taking out private health insurance.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I want to hear from Labor what they are going to do about it. They can bleat all they like about it, but it 
 has had no effect until they do something about it and have some sort of policy. The opposition have no policies at all—it is a policy free zone opposite—and, when they do have a policy, they have a policy for 24 hours and then change their minds.
The major focus of this year's budget in health has been on improving access to health services for rural and regional Australia, including the establishment of a rural multipurpose health and family services network, costing $24 million over four years; and on more support for older people to stay in their homes through the `staying at home' initiative, costing $269 million over four years. That is important for people in small rural areas where it is not necessarily viable to have an aged care facility or where people—or families—choose to stay at home but need assistance.
We have announced essential investment in preventive health measures including a focus on environmental health, injury prevention, cancer control, anti-smoking initiatives, men's health and funding for special vaccination programs for elderly Australians. There is a saving because every person over 65 will be given the opportunity to have a flu vaccination, as was recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council and taken up by the minister.
The budget also contains enhancement of health infrastructure in the indigenous communities. What happened when Senator Graham Richardson went out to indigenous communities and tried to turn the tap on?  `Oh dear,' he said, `This is terrible.' And what happened? Nothing. What have we seen Senator Herron do?  We have seen the army brought in to establish some of that infrastructure, and we have seen 35 new Aboriginal health services develop.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-13,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance to put aside what the government is saying, because this is not about ambit claims argy-bargy. One only has to look at the submission that was made by the state and territory governments—that is, the states except Queensland and the territories except the ACT—to the recent Senate Community 
 Affairs Legislation Committee hearing on the issue of health care agreements. In the executive summary of the submission put forward by the states—they are holding out against the federal government because of the general meanness of the federal government—they say this:
Basically,  there are two broad areas of fundamental concern. Firstly, the Commonwealth's funding offer falls well below that considered necessary to cover required service levels.
So that is the first thing that concerns the states that are holding out against the federal government and their miserable approach—the offer does not cover required service levels. They go on:
Secondly, the legislation and draft agreements do not address the structural reforms required for the health system.
Then we get to the question of: what is really an issue here?  The states and Northern Territory are seeking an additional $1.1 billion per year to the base; whereas the Commonwealth responded with an extra $2.9 billion over the five years of the new agreement. The difference between that is not an ambit claim. If you have been in negotiations and if you know the difference, it is certainly not about argy-bargy and it is certainly not about ambit claims—it is a substantial difference indeed. This is highlighted further in their submission, when they say:
Based on these figures, and given the complexities of health funding, a very conservative estimate is that the Commonwealth's offer is more in the vicinity of an additional $69 million over five years on a national basis.
So it is not what the coalition is painting it to be at all:  it is not a matter of argy-bargy and it is not a matter of ambit. They go on:
This breakdown of the Commonwealth's funding offer demonstrates the magnitude of the funding shortfall when compared to the States' and Northern Territory's claim for an additional $1.1 billion in the base. Similarly, the Commonwealth's claim of a real 15.4% increase over five years is significantly overstated, with the real amount being about 1.1%.
They are the words of the state governments and the Northern Territory government who are still at odds with the Commonwealth government over the funding of the health 
 system. Clearly, from what they were saying in their submission to the Senate legislation committee, there are insufficient funds. But there are two noticeable absentees from that particular statement that was made on behalf of the states and the territories—the ACT government and the state government in Queensland. One would have to ask: why are they absent?  They are absent for the same reason in both instances—for purely venal political reasons. The ACT capitulated early because it suited their electoral purposes, and then the Queensland government, facing an election just around the corner, felt it was very comfortable to capitulate as well.
Let us look at the history of what unfolded which will show how the other states and territory governments are not being unreasonable. Let us just look at the Queensland attitude tracking back through a few clippings. In the Courier-Mail on 12 March, an article headed `State threat to renege on federal funding deal' states:
The Borbidge Government will argue that this final instalment in a three-year plan to help financial recovery is not necessary because the Howard Government's Budget is probably now in surplus.
It goes on to say:
His defiant approach—
that being the Premier of Queensland—
is the latest shot in the lead-up to next week's Premiers' Conference, which is likely to be a heated affair because of ill-feeling over health funding.
We have the build-up. Whilst one might say there is a certain amount of argy-bargy there, it is more than just staking an ambit claim. We then go on to an article in the Financial Review  of 20 March which states:
Queensland Premier Mr Rob Borbidge was scathing about the health funding offer saying it was even less than an offer made late last year, which he said was ""a dud"".
The article goes on to say:
The most recent offer was the ""son of a dud"", he said. Mr Howard yesterday described Mr Borbidge's comments as ""unhelpful"".
We went from `a dud' to the `son of a dud'. What they ultimately accepted is indescribable in normal terms in this parliament. Then we move on to 26 March. What do we find on 
 that date? We find the headline `States back call for health fund inquiry'. Mr Borbidge is seen in a bit of a conciliatory light there. The article stated:
A spokesman for the Queensland Premier indicated that Mr Borbidge saw merit in a funding review.
It was not capitulation at that stage; it was merit in a funding review that was ultimately undertaken.
Then we turn to the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Kennett was reported as speaking strongly against the federal government. His support was echoed by the Queensland Minister for Health, Mr Mike Horan. It is report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 April that Queensland had capitulated. We found that Queensland had capitulated because there was an election around the corner.
The government can claim no victories here. What they have are two very peripheral victories at best—that is, signing up the ACT government who faced an election and signing up the Queensland government who are similarly facing an election. This is not about redressing the health situation. In Queensland alone the extra minimal funding will do nothing to put a dent in the fact that 12,000 Queenslanders are waiting longer than is medically acceptable for elective surgery. Nothing that came down in the budget last night will do anything to redress that situation either.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-05-13,"—I find this debate put forward by the Labor Party yet again to be absolutely and utterly amazing. The Labor Party ran a failed health system. Instead of coming in here and trumpeting what they now think should and should not be done they should in fact be hanging their heads in shame for what they did to the health system over 13 years in government.
When the Labor Party came into office in December 1983 some 64 per cent of Australians were privately insured. When they left office there were 34 per cent of Australians privately insured. That is nothing short of disgraceful. During that time, the Labor Party government did not compensate the states one cent for the reduction in private health insur 
 ance and therefore an increase in the utilisation of public hospitals. Yet they have the gall to come into this chamber day after day grizzling about health care funding. They should be hanging their heads in shame. They are the ones who created the problem. The difference is that the coalition government is the one that is taking the responsibility to solve the problem created by them.
Prior to the Labor Party devastating the health system, one who was privately insured was able to go into hospital and pay absolutely nothing because the health fund picked up the tab. Equally, if you were not privately insured you were able to walk into a public hospital and get the treatment that you needed without waiting and without charge. Who picked up the tab for that? The taxpayer. What the Labor did was wreck a perfectly good system where those who were in genuine need were looked after and those who could pay for their own private health insurance did so. Yet they are the ones complaining about the situation today.
We have the responsibility to try to turn this around. That is no mean feat. The fact remains that the Commonwealth is trying to do this in consultation with the states. Coming from Western Australia, I am the first to admit that the Commonwealth is not providing everything that the states want. But I think there are many people who are equally prepared to admit that the Commonwealth is trying to make ends meet. The budget that we saw presented last night is a responsible budget. That comes in on top of not only the devastation that the Labor Party left us with in terms of health funding but also the $10 billion deficit they left for every man, woman and child in Australia. We have turned that around in two short years and those in the Labor Party still come in here and complain.
The Commonwealth's proposals for health care funding have tried to accommodate the main principles and directions that were agreed to by the health ministers in Cairns in May 1997. They may not meet every single solitary red cent that the states want. I do not blame the state for seeking more. The states were duded very seriously by the previous Labor government. They were unfunded in 
 the previous five-year Medicare agreement. Understandably now they are turning around and saying that they want more money.
The fact remains that those principles that were laid down at the health ministers meeting in Cairns in May last year have been listened to and compromises have been reached with the Commonwealth. The first principle was that funding be based more clearly on identified outputs and outcomes, including quality, rather than inputs. The Commonwealth's proposal very much reflects those sentiments.
The second principle was that information across the health system be based on patients rather than providers both for improved policy analysis and management and for individual case planning. This is reflected in the Commonwealth's proposal both for reporting and for a national development fund to assist investment in the information systems. Separately, the Commonwealth changes to the Health Insurance Commission offer the opportunity for the states to consider linkages with that infrastructure to support improved care and policy analysis.
The third principle was an improved capacity to manage the health system as a whole, including in particular across the boundaries between primary and acute care. The Commonwealth proposal addresses those in a number of different ways. The fourth principle of investment options to facilitate structural change to reduce cost pressures on acute care and allow better step down care and day surgery is reflected in particular in the proposed national development fund.
One of the problems that we have had to confront is that the Labor Party has refused to fund various things such as the veterans. We have taken the veterans out of the equation by giving veterans the gold card which, in effect, gives the states $150 million extra each year. At the moment the states subsidise the cost of veterans in public hospitals by $150 million a year or $750 million over five years. We have removed that from the equation.
Additionally, it is hard to believe that the Labor Party can come in here bleating about costing when on mental health and palliative care the previous government cared so little 
 about either that they did not include funding in the forward estimates for the 1998-99 years as part of the 1995-96 budget. That budget was brought down by the then Treasurer and the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-05-13,"—There is one clear thing about last night's budget—that is, it will not create one additional hospital bed or employ one extra nurse as a result of its announcements. As the health ministers in all states, except Queensland and the Northern Territory, said last night in their response to the budget, it did not contain one extra dollar for the nation's hospitals. They have identified, like most objective observers, that the $2.5 billion of new funding this government claims it is putting into the public health system over the next five years is a sham.
The budget contains a raft of previously committed projects and funding and in reality only adds up to $69 million of new funding over five years or only a 1.1 per cent increase. As the ministers noted, it is not enough money to run the nation's hospitals for a day, let alone the whole term of the Medicare agreement. In their press conference they said, `This budget will barely help us keep up with the growing demand for heart surgery alone.' This, I might add, came from a majority of conservative premiers.
Regrettably, my home state of Queensland has sold out to the public health interests of its citizens and signed a new Medicare agreement several weeks ago in order to finalise the matter before the upcoming Queensland election. In effect, the Borbidge government and its health minister, Mike Horan, have accepted a package which in the words of the federal Minister for Health and Family Services, Mr Wooldridge, is no different to the offer put to the Queensland government at the premiers conference in March.
This is a deal which Premier Borbidge said at the time of the conference was not as good for Queensland as it was for other states and that there was no support for the Medicare offer from any government. This is the same premier who orchestrated the walkout at the premiers conference when he said, `If there is no agreement in terms of a better deal, there 
 is no agreement on anything else. We will be going home early.' Premier Borbidge also called the offer at the time `mean-spirited' and an `insult'. A person would be entitled to ask: what has changed the mind of the Queensland government when the offer it accepted late last month is the same one it rejected at the premiers conference? The answer is not hard to find.
Could it be that Queensland received an extra $65 million out of the $120 million one-off funding aimed at inducing state and territories to sign the new agreements before the end of June, $25 million of which would have been shared amongst the other states had they signed? An unkind person may see this as nothing more than a bribe. I probably would not, but an unkind person would. Or is it simply that Queensland has sold out to put the issue to rest before the state election, which has been widely tipped in early June?
Unfortunately, there will be no rest for the patients and employees of the state's public hospital system. They will be forced to endure a hospital system which is on the brink of collapse. Today's Courier-Mail highlights a case where a mother had to give birth on the path outside the Bundaberg Hospital as nobody was answering the night bell. The child had to be covered with gravel from the path in order to keep it warm. It is not as if Bundaberg is a small rural community; it is a major provincial city in Queensland. The hospital was locked. There was nobody there. Fortunately the mother did not have complications, otherwise it could have been a dire situation for the whole family.
The Queensland government has accepted an offer which has done nothing to address the effect the decline in private health insurance is having on the public system. It has not tackled the statistic which sees Queensland as a state which has a lower number of people in private health cover than the national rate of 32 per cent. It does not address the shortfall of health programs which see Queensland as one of the most under serviced states in terms of health and community service funding. It does nothing to ease the plight of more than 12,000 Queenslanders already waiting longer than medically advis 
 able for surgery. It does nothing to ease the problems of the state's biggest hospital, the Royal Brisbane, which has a severe budgetary crisis according to a Queensland health report.
Queensland's public health system will pay the penalty for Premier Borbidge's weakness and inability to stand firm with the other states and negotiate hard for what they are rightfully entitled to receive from the Commonwealth. Queenslanders and indeed all Australians expect their governments both state and federal to provide the essential requirements for their basic health care needs.
The Howard government and now the Borbidge government have made a farce of the public health system, amongst other things. They have eroded the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by introducing the manifestly unfair and medically dangerous therapeutic group premium and treated the Medicare system as a farce.

The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON URANIUM MINING AND MILLING IN AUSTRALIA
Conclusion/Recommendation 1
.	 On the basis of available evidence, the uranium mining and milling industry will be sufficiently viable financially to be able to meet its environmental, health and safety, and security responsibilities fully.
Response
The Government notes this conclusion.
Conclusion/Recommendation 2
.	 The Committee supports the cautious approach which was favoured by the Fox Report and the need for continuing, dedicated research into all aspects of uranium mining and utilisation.
Response
The Government notes this recommendation, and comments that there is a range of Australian and international agencies with appropriate expertise. In particular, attention is drawn to Commonwealth and State legislation relating to environmental protection and nuclear and radiation safety, and nuclear safeguards. Australia is at the forefront of minimising the environmental impacts of uranium mining.
Conclusion/Recommendation 3
.	 Although there is little evidence of unnecessary overlap or duplication between Commonwealth and relevant state/territory authorities, it believes that there is scope for improvement in handling of proposals to mine uranium, and in subsequent evaluation of achievement of environmental goals.
Response
The Government notes the recommendation. The Government will continue to work with State/Territory authorities to ensure the cooperative approaches to environmental protection are continued and enhanced as appropriate. The Government is currently in the process of developing a more effective framework for inter-governmental relations on the environment.
Conclusion/Recommendation 4
.	 Uranium mining, where it is permitted, should only occur under the strictest conditions for the protection of the environment.
Response
The Government accepts this recommendation and notes projects may only operate under best practicable technology. Consistent with its policy commitment, the Government considers proposals for the development of new uranium mines. Projects need to satisfy stringent assessments of their potential environmental and heritage impacts including full consultations with Aboriginal interests involved to ensure their views are taken into account and their legal rights are not diminished. The Government recognises the States and Northern Territory have the prime role in the regulation of uranium mining to protect the environment, and notes the Commonwealth has a key role in assessing the environmental impacts of new proposals.
The Government also considers that the Commonwealth has a responsibility and interest in relation to the assessment and approval of uranium mining and milling operations as they involve matters of national environmental significance. The Government is currently considering, with State and Territory Governments, processes for handling Commonwealth responsibility and interest in relation to matters of national environmental significance.
Conclusion/Recommendation 5
.	 The concept of the social impact study could offer a viable framework within which a number of the issues arising in the context of major development projects (such as mining) can be identified, analysed and discussed.
Response
The Government notes the conclusion. Consideration of social issues is a normal part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process, and as such these issues are addressed by the project proponent in documentation for public review such as Environmental Impact Statements. However, the Government also recognises that special circumstances existed in the context of development in the Kakadu Region. It initiated the Kakadu Region Social Impact Study (KRSIS) as a separate study which investigated the effects of development, such as tourism and mining, on Aboriginal communities in the region. Reports flowing from the KRSIS are currently under consideration by stakeholders. The KRSIS process could form the framework for future consideration of the regional social impact of development, particularly where indigenous people are concerned.
Conclusion/Recommendation 6
.	 There should be a full public evaluation of rehabilitation and remedial work at Radium Hill and the former tailings dam at Port Pirie, with periodical reappraisal.
Response
Management of the former Radium Hill uranium mine site and former tailings dam site at Port Pirie in South Australia is the responsibility of the South Australian Government. The Government notes the South Australian Government's advice that it regularly inspects these sites and minor repair and remedial work is carried out if required. The Government notes that the South Australian Government is of the view that these measures are adequate and that a full public evaluation with periodical reappraisal is not warranted.
Conclusion/Recommendation 7
.	 Tailings management is among the most serious challenges facing the uranium mining industry, industry regulators and their scientific advisers.
Response
The Government notes Australia is at the forefront of applying best practicable technology for tailings management at uranium mines appropriate to the environment in which the mine is situated. Management of tailings is a key issue which is considered on a case-by-case basis in development of new mines as environmental impacts are considered. The application of ""best practicable technology"" requires regular review in line with improvements in knowledge.
Conclusion/Recommendation 8
.	 Research is integral to constructive regulation of mining and to minimising the impact of mining activity upon the environment.
Response
The Government notes the conclusion and refers to its response to recommendation 2. The site specific nature of any mine and its receiving environment need to be understood in order to optimise environmental management; it is not always sufficient to apply generic information, or information from other minesites.
Conclusion/Recommendation 9
.	 The high level of scrutiny which the uranium industry receives is warranted in that it responds to the sensitivity associated with uranium mining and has contributed materially to minimising adverse effects on the environment.
Response
The Government accepts that there are special considerations in relation to uranium mining.
Conclusion/Recommendation 10
.	 The regulatory structure should ensure that the results of research are promptly reflected in enhanced standards.
Response
The Government agrees regulatory standards should be kept under constant review and amended as appropriate to reflect the results of research. The Government subscribes to the ""precautionary principle"" in this regard and in its Inter-governmental Agreement on the Environment. The Government also refers to its response to Recommendation 18 concerning the adoption of international standards.
Conclusion/Recommendation 11
.	 New administrative arrangements are necessary to ensure high levels of performance, full utilisation of Australia's experience in uranium mining since the 1970s, rapid adoption of world best practice and vigorous public accountability nationally and locally.
Response
The Government notes this recommendation for new arrangements. While existing administrative arrangements have contributed to high levels of environmental protection, as evidenced by uranium mines developed and operated under current arrangements, the Government is prepared to consider improvements where this leads to greater effectiveness and efficiency. In this regard note the Government's response to Recommendations 3 and 4.
Existing arrangements already contribute to a high level of public accountability. The Government notes the level of public scrutiny in the Alligator 
 Rivers Region, due to the environmental sensitivity of the region and this scrutiny is continually enhanced. The Government believes consultative arrangements at mines in other regions are a matter to be considered on a case-by-case basis. For example in the case of Olympic Dam in South Australia, periodic environmental audits are being conducted, with the results to be publicly available, and the Government has facilitated the establishment of a Community Consultative Forum which will maintain a regular flow of information to the public about the environmental performance at Olympic Dam.
Conclusion/Recommendation 12
.	 A new Commonwealth Uranium Authority (CUA) should be established without delay with responsibility for—
-	 approvals to mine;
-	 direction of environmental impact studies;
-	 supervision of plans and programs to ensure impact of mines on the environment is minimised;
-	 triennial audits of environmental performance at mines (or at such shorter intervals as may be necessary);
-	 review, audit and evaluation of health and safety measures at the mines and other locations where nuclear materials are stored.
Response
The Government does not accept this recommendation. The States and Northern Territory have the prime responsibility for regulation of mining as well as health and safety, and this is the appropriate level of Government to administer these responsibilities. Existing environmental impact assessment procedures already deal with approvals to mine, direction of impact studies and supervision of plans and programs requiring minimisation of environmental impacts. Uranium mine developments are subject to joint State/Commonwealth assessment. In addition, environmental and health and safety audits are already provided for under existing arrangements (industry/state governments and Northern Territory/Commonwealth). The Government does not believe the proposed CUA offers any advantage over current arrangements. Note also the response to Recommendation 3.
Conclusion/Recommendation 13
.	 The CUA, providing its high standards are met, may delegate tasks to State and Territory government authorities.
Response
The Government rejects the need for a CUA for reasons already covered, but accepts the key role of State and Territory authorities towards attainment of high environmental standards. 

Conclusion/Recommendation 14
.	 National coordination provided by the CUA should be complemented at each mine by a consultative committee composed of representatives of proprietors, governments, unions, conservation and local interests.
Response
While rejecting the need for the CUA, the Government notes the recommendation regarding consultative arrangements. The Government considers, as stated under the response to Recommendation 11, that consultative arrangements between mine operators and the local community are desirable such as those already in place in the Alligator Rivers Region and being established at Olympic Dam.
Conclusion/Recommendation 15
.	 Government Senators, on the basis that the Committee's inquiry found that present federal arrangements have proven to be satisfactory and suitable, are unconvinced that a new national authority is either a necessary or effective mechanism for achievement of the goals for whose accomplishment it is being created. They believe, however, that the proposed consultative committees have merit in their own right and will furnish the additional scrutiny of uranium mining which in part motivates the proposal for the new Authority. In terms of consequential recommendations about collaboration between the proposed CUA and the Supervising Scientist, they do not see any reason for an enlarged role for the Supervising Scientist but they agree that the expertise of the organisation should be more generally available on a fee-for-service basis.
Response
The Government agrees with the conclusion/recommendation and considers that consultative committees are appropriate and must include representation by indigenous claimants and titleholders. The Government considers that the principles of contestability should apply in accessing appropriate expertise and that any services provided by the Supervising Scientist should be as appropriate on a fee-for-service basis.
Conclusion/Recommendation 16
.	 The Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region is an essential component of the framework which has materially contributed to minimising the effects of mining on an environmentally important part of Australia. The value of its research role is indisputable.
The Supervising Scientist should be encouraged to develop, in response to demand, a broad expertise in environmental aspects of uranium mining and milling. It is of positive value for Australia to have a scientific body with a com 
 prehensive expertise in the environmental impacts of uranium mining and milling, and a body where such skills and expertise may be acquired, fostered and developed.
Response
The Government notes that the Supervising Scientist has had an important role in contributing to the protection of the environment in relation to the operation of the Ranger and Nabarlek uranium mines and recognises that this should continue in respect of proposals for Jabiluka and any other proposed mines in the region.
In relation to the development of expertise, the Government points to its response to Recommendation 15. An extensive body of expertise exists in relation to uranium mining issues, and the principles of contestability should apply in accessing appropriate expertise from government, academic and private sector providers.
Conclusion/Recommendation 17
.	 The proposed CUA and the Supervising Scientist should collaborate constructively in ensuring that the good practice which now prevails is maintained and improved; that world best practice standards are, as a matter of course, promptly applied in all uranium mines in Australia; and that through public accountability mechanisms the Australian public are informed about the quality of the environmental performance at uranium mines.
Response
As considered earlier, the Government does not see the need for a new Commonwealth Uranium Authority and considers current administrative arrangements adequately provide for best practice.
Conclusion/Recommendation 18
.	 The results of verified research on health and safety of employees must be applied without delay. The Select Committee is especially critical of the long, drawn-out delay in adoption of the latest international standards concerning radiation exposure. Present practices whilst satisfactory must be seen as minimum standards.
Response
In September 1997, the Government announced the formation of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). ARPANSA will provide advice on all matters concerned with the safety of radiation and nuclear activities and will promote the development of uniform national regulatory approaches to the control of radiation-related activities.
It should be noted that radiation protection activities in uranium mining and milling lie almost entirely in the domain of State and Territory jurisdiction. The Commonwealth role through 
 ARPANSA is mostly to assist the States and Territories towards the application of common standards and requirements. This is achieved by way of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978  which provides for the joint development of regulatory codes with supporting guideline material which ultimately become mandatory requirements under the appropriate State or Territory laws.
National regulatory codes have been developed to cover the radiation protection of workers and the public during the operation of mines and mills.
Australia has always been one of the first countries to adopt the latest international standards. The National Health and Medical Research Council and the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission adopted the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended dose limits in 1995, making Australia one of the first countries to do so (see also Recommendations 20 and 22).
Conclusion/Recommendation 19
.	 As a basis for ensuring employee health and safety, data collection and analysis needs to be standardised on a national basis in the development of the National Radiation Dose Register.
Response
The Government supports a common means of reporting the dose results to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency which will be responsible for developing and maintaining the National Radiation Dose Register.
However, the Government disagrees with the standardisation of methods for data collection and analysis throughout Australia. Different monitoring methods are not only beneficial but essential for the current and proposed uranium facilities and other worksites (eg health care which involves production of radiation) in Australia. For example, in the case of uranium mines the monitoring approach for radon progeny in an underground mine will be different from the approach required for an open cut operation (due to the different magnitude of results, different unattached fraction, etc). The key issue is that all data collection and analysis is undertaken in compliance with the latest recommendations of the applicable peak bodies.
Also, standardisation would stifle research into more advanced monitoring approaches and would then delay the implementation of any improvements in radiation monitoring.
Conclusion/Recommendation 20
.	 Determination of appropriate career dose limits should be a research priority for government health authorities and mining companies.
Response
The Government believes the protection of workers from the health effects of radiation is of paramount importance.
The Government draws attention to the research carried out into the effects of radiation by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These are based on extensive studies of exposed human populations, by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.
The ICRP reached the judgement that dose limits should be set such that the total occupational dose received during a full working life would not exceed about 1 Sievert, received moderately uniformly year by year (but tempered by the principle that doses should be as low as reasonably achievable). This translates to an average annual dose of 20 mSv per year. For practical purposes ICRP expressed this limit as 100 mSv over 5 consecutive years with a maximum of 50 mSv in any one year, rather than specifying a career dose limit. The averaging period is a compromise between requiring employers to maintain exposure records over many years and insisting that doses are kept below 20 mSv in any year.
Conclusion/Recommendation 21
.	 Employees in uranium mines and mills should be fully briefed personally on radiation and related hazards. Mining companies should meet the costs of briefings.
Response
The Government notes that under existing State and Territory legislation it is a requirement for companies to fully brief their workforce on radiation-related hazards associated with mining and milling of uranium.
The Government also recognises that there is a case for special culturally appropriate interpretation and translation of information concerning potential hazards for any indigenous or other employees from non-English speaking backgrounds, proposing to become part of the uranium mining or milling workforce.
Conclusion/Recommendation 22
.	 Current health and safety standards (especially as exemplified at Ranger) should be regarded as minimum standards.
Response
The Government believes that the health and safety standards which should be regarded as a minimum for radiological protection are those which have been recommended and adopted by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the National Occupation and Health Safety Commission. These standards were developed in parallel and with full knowledge of the ICRP's recommendations (see response to Recommendation 20). 

The Government notes that existing mines are operating within these minimum standards and it is expected that any future mines would have to also operate within these standards.
The Government recognises that there is a specific need to consider assessment criteria based on ICRP for indigenous people's exposure given that they live on the land, drink the water and are specifically exposed to possible contaminants for longer periods. The critical pathways for their exposure to contaminants should be determined on the basis of indigenous lifestyle in consultation with local indigenous people.
Conclusion/Recommendation 23
.	 Mining companies and regulatory authorities should actively pursue the ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) principle in radiation matters and report on the extent that they succeed in operating well below prescribed levels.
Response
The Government's view is that the principle of ALARA is an essential part of dose optimisation and it supports mining companies and regulators actively pursuing this objective and reporting on the extent to which they meet this objective in line with advances in best practicable technology available. The Government also notes that radiation is just one of many potential occupational hazards.
Conclusion/Recommendation 24
.	 A uniform method of measuring, calculating and recording dose limits should be adopted and applied.
Response
The Government supports a common means of reporting the dose results to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency which will be responsible for developing and maintaining the National Radiation Dose Register.
However, the Government refers back to its position stated in responses to Recommendation 19, that it disagrees with the standardisation of methods for measuring and calculating doses throughout Australia. The Government also refers to its response to Recommendation 20 which recognises the thorough deliberation given by the International Commission on Radiological Protection in relation to career dose limits, and the incorporation of this research into Australian standards.
Conclusion/Recommendation 25
.	 The matter of career dosage has not been examined sufficiently thoroughly by scientific and medical authorities. The Australian Radiation Laboratory should take the lead in consultation with mining companies and unions.
Health authorities should examine a means of compensation for employees who exceed a career 
 dose limit (when determined) prior to retirement age.
Response
The Government refers to its response to Recommendation 20 regarding career dose limits. As stated earlier, both ICRP and Australian authorities express the dose limits of average annual doses accumulated over a specified period. Australian recommendations do allow the regulator to permit an extension of the averaging period to a maximum of ten years in exceptional circumstances. This should ensure that the annual average of 20 mSv will not be exceeded over the long term and the Government believes that the question of compensation will not therefore arise.
Conclusion/Recommendation 26
.	 All mines should consult the Environmental Research Institute of the Supervising Scientist (ERISS) on methodologies and technologies for identifying and monitoring background radiation at mine sites and in the region where the mine is located.
Response
The Government notes the contribution ERISS has made to research in the Alligator Rivers Region, and agrees that ERISS is one of a number of bodies at the Commonwealth and State level with expertise on background radiation which could be consulted by mines. Importantly, the Government considers that the principles of contestability should apply when mines access appropriate expertise in this area.
Conclusion/Recommendation 27
.	 Governments, mining companies and Aboriginal organisations should consider negotiation of comprehensive statements of agreement within which partnerships can develop to consolidate economic and social benefits within a context of respect for indigenous culture, customs and ways of life.
Response
The Government's policy is that where Aboriginal interests are involved, the Government is committed to ensuring full and appropriate consultation with affected Aboriginal communities with their views being taken into account in accordance with applicable law. Aboriginal and cultural issues are considered in the Environmental Impact Statement process for new projects. The Government believes these matters are most appropriately considered on a case-by-case basis by relevant stakeholders.
Conclusion/Recommendation 28
.	 The Committee is concerned that resources assigned for safeguards programs and developments are not keeping pace with developments in the nuclear industry. 

Response
The Government disagrees that the resources assigned for safeguards are not keeping pace with developments in the nuclear industry. Maintenance and development of the nuclear safeguards system at multilateral and bilateral levels is central to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.
The Government will continue to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure resources are available to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system. The Government does not accept that there is a simple arithmetical relationship between the quantities of nuclear material in the international nuclear fuel cycle and the costs of safeguards activities.
Equally, the Government is fully aware of the need to ensure that Australia can monitor and evaluate developments in the international nuclear industry and assess the implications of those developments for national non-proliferation and safeguards policy approaches. The Government will continue to ensure the availability of sufficient resources for these purposes, including for the Australian Safeguards Office.
Conclusion/Recommendation 29
.	 The safeguards system needs constant attention to work. Australia has a long record of contributing to the vitality of safeguards, international and national. It is a record which should be maintained.
Response
The Government accepts this recommendation and supports a continuing Australian commitment to the long term maintenance and development of the international and national nuclear safeguards system.
Australia has a long record of contributing to the development of the nuclear safeguards system, reflecting the dual objectives of enhancing Australia's security by limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increasing Australia's prosperity through support for international and bilateral nuclear safeguards which provide the indispensable basis for uranium exports.
In recent years Australia has been a prominent advocate of measures, recently agreed in the IAEA, to strengthen international safeguards in the light of the discovery after the Gulf War of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program.
Separately, through the Australian Safeguards Office, Australia has for many years operated a supplementary safeguards support program covering research and development projects, regional training programs and other activities, such as participation in international experts' meetings and advisory groups, in support of IAEA safeguards. 

Conclusion/Recommendation 30
.	 The Senate Procedure Committee should examine the implications of globalisation for parliamentary scrutiny of government, administration and public policy.
Response
The Government notes the conclusion/recommendation.
Conclusion/Recommendation 31
.	 Safeguards practices must continue to develop, and such development should continue in a calm and rational manner. The risks which nuclear power involves are less likely to engender unjustified apprehension or insecurity if addressed calmly, cautiously, deliberately and expeditiously.
Response
The Government endorses this finding. Because nuclear energy has both peaceful and military uses it is subject to far higher standards of scrutiny, safeguards and safety than any other industry. The Government has traditionally taken a cautious approach to the formulation of policy in this area and, for example, has pioneered strict non-proliferation approaches to questions of nuclear supply in ways which enhanced the international regime.
The Government provides many sources of information on these issues, for example through the Australian Safeguards Office's Annual Report, inquiries into the nuclear industry and information regularly provided by officers from relevant Government agencies, as a contribution to balanced and informed public debate.
Dissenting Report
In preparing its response to the Senate Select Committee Report the Government has taken into account the dissenting report by Senators Lees and Margetts. The Government recognises the concerns that motivate these Senators in regard to their position on uranium mining and the nuclear fuel cycle.
The dissenting report's main recommendation follows:
"". . . this minority report recommends against the expansion of the uranium industry, opposes all new uranium mining proposals in Australia and recommends the cancellation of all export licenses for uranium mining and the refusal of any new export licenses for further uranium mines in Australia.""(pp. 43-44)
The Government considers that the dissenting report's call to close down the industry ignores both the economic benefits of the industry to Australia, the sound environmental record of existing uranium mining projects in Australia and the stringent environmental, heritage, safety and safeguards arrangements in place. It also ignores 
 the likelihood of taxpayers needing to pay substantial compensation to mining companies for on-payment to investors in the event of the Government cancelling existing export approvals.
The minority report also concludes:
""Should the Government decide to continue permitting the export of Australian uranium, then the other recommendations contained in this minority report should be implemented to minimise the adverse effects of Australia's uranium mining.""(p.44)
The Government considers that the recommendations do not take adequate account of the stringent environmental, heritage, safety and safeguards arrangements in place.
The Government firmly believes it is possible to have a safe and environmentally responsible uranium mining industry in Australia and considers that its responses to the recommendations of the majority report justify this.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Uranium Mining and Milling Committee</title>,Committees,24,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-13,"—As the deputy chair, I was obviously very much involved with the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling. I found it an extremely difficult time. I would hope that many of the committees I work on in future are not as difficult in terms of the working relationships and the walls of opposition that tended to exist within that committee structure. But, given that I was on that committee, I would like to suggest that the response is quite interesting, though hardly surprising. Much of what was written in the majority report was in fact saying what a fine job is being done already, world's best practice, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, and how everything is being done almost as well as it can be done.
 Many of the recommendations are similar. There was one very strange recommendation. Recommendation 1 states:
On the basis of available evidence, the uranium mining and milling industry will be sufficiently viable financially to be able to meet its environmental, health and safety, and security responsibilities fully.
The response was:
The government notes this conclusion.
Terrific! Most of it is about how, as I say, the roles of government are being adequately 
 dealt with so far. The fact that there are processes means that those processes must be adequately handled and therefore the so-called world's best practice is being maintained. We talk about Australia being in the forefront of applying best practice technology for tailings management at uranium mines appropriate to the environment in which the mine is situated. That is basically saying that Australia is best at operating mines in Australia. Terrific! Very useful information.
 The one thing I thought was particularly useful was recommendation No. 12. This was interesting because this appears to be the big win that the Labor Party seemed to have negotiated in relation to this inquiry. Remember that a lot of people within the ALP over time have had great concerns in relation to uranium mining and milling, great concerns about what the future will be for uranium mining and milling. The big trade-off in relation to this report was that there was to be a recommendation for a new Commonwealth uranium authority. As recommendation No. 12 states:
A new Commonwealth Uranium Authority (CUA) should be established without delay with responsibility for—
-	 approvals to mine;
-	 direction of environmental impact studies;
-	 supervision of plans and programs to ensure impact of mines on the environment is minimised;
-	 triennial audits of environmental performance at mines (or at such shorter intervals as may be necessary);
-	 review, audit and evaluation of health and safety measures at the mines and other locations where nuclear materials are stored.
Surprise, surprise! Response:
The government does not accept this recommendation.
Obviously the states and the Northern Territory are doing such a wonderful job that it is really not necessary. Any other recommendations that involved any potential Commonwealth uranium authority got the same kind of response.
One thing I did find interesting was that, under recommendation No. 15, there was a desire by the Commonwealth government not 
 to be involved with any expansion of the role of the Supervising Scientist, but:
. . . they do not see any reason for an enlarged role for the Supervising Scientist but they agree that the expertise of the organisation should be more generally available on a fee-for-service basis.
You do not enlarge the role, but you allow the Office of the Supervising Scientist to tout for business. What does this mean? You do not enlarge them and they are allowed to find some of their own funding—what a surprise! What does that mean in the longer term? If I were to gaze into a crystal ball, I would say that in the longer term there will be a lot of pressure put on the government so that the industry no longer will have to pay for their own supervision, no longer will have to pay for that tiny level of assurance that the community expect from the government on their behalf to be required of industry. Keep your eyes on the ball because within a very short time we will see that kind of pressure.
If the OSS do get extra contracts, they will have to do it within their resources, I imagine, because they do not want an expanded role. Over time, the government will say, `See, you've got enough funding so we'll start reducing or removing the levy associated with industry.' I just think that is a potential, a crystal ball gaze.
We have some other very interesting recommendations in the majority report. Under recommendation 20, it says:
.	 Determination of appropriate career dose limits should be a research priority for government health authorities and mining companies.
I would think the public would think this is the very least that government should do. It should make sure that in the information that is provided, the assurances that are given by companies, by private corporations and by proponents, about the safety of radiation doses and uranium doses—and that includes issues like the proposed Jabiluka mine—that the underground miners will be aware that they will be, we believe, experiencing unsafe levels of radiation from very high rate on-sources and aware of the inability of companies to actually reduce those to any levels that are considered in any way safe.
The committee is saying that there needs to be a determination of appropriate career dose limits, a research priority. At the moment, the companies themselves can come up with what they think is a safe level, and that has been the problem in a number of the reports, whether it is about Roxby Downs or other places. It is the company that has been saying what it thinks is safe, and there have been disagreements between the company and organisations like the Australian Radiation Laboratories which are set up to manage and comment on these things. Under the response to recommendation 20, we see that:
The Government believes the protection of workers from the health effects of radiation is of paramount importance.
Motherhood and apple pie. It continues:
The Government draws attention to the research carried out into the effects of radiation by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These are based on extensive studies of exposed human populations . . . 
. . .              . . .             . . .
This translates to an average annual dose of 20 mSv per year. For practical purposes ICRP expressed this limit as 100 Msv over 5 consecutive years with a maximum of 50 Msv in any one year, rather than specifying a career dose limit.
What does that mean for workers and their feeling of safety over time? We are saying that we will take whatever seems to be easier, and we as a government are not going to take the responsibility of making sure that these doses are in fact reasonable, not safe, under the career limits. We are moving around people so that we have an average situation. I do not think that is particularly safe anyway. If they have been exposed to high levels of radiation, that is a bad thing in itself and we should be making sure that every exposure to workers is as low as can be made possible, and that is not what is happening at the moment. I think that is a great pity.
It is hardly surprising that the government did not accept my minority report. It says:
The Government considers that the dissenting report's call to close down the industry ignores both the economic benefits of the industry to Australia,—
those benefits were never proved—
the sound environmental record of existing uranium mining projects in Australia—
remember we were saying that the fact these processes exist means that they must obviously be done well—
and the stringent environmental, heritage, safety and safeguards arrangements in place—
despite the quite clear evidence that was given on a number of occasions that many of these standards were not being adhered to and that, when there were problems, it took a long time to find out information and even longer to get action in these cases. I think it is a concern. I think we have a head in the sand attitude to uranium mining—and I did not mean that as a pun. I really do think that, if Australia wishes to continue to mine and mill uranium, this kind of response simply is not good enough.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Uranium Mining and Milling Committee</title>,Committees,24,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1998-05-13,"—It is not surprising that Senator Margetts would reject the response of the government and the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling because, of course, she had a minority report, a dissenting report, to the majority report of that committee when that report was tabled. The interesting thing about the minority report was that it really was a facade in that it sought to create a lot of differences and raise a lot of issues of significance that really were not significant when you thoroughly examined those issues.
The differences between Senator Margetts and Senator Lees and the rest of the committee really were not what I would call significant differences on a number of the substantive issues that were investigated. The real difference was that Senator Margetts and Senator Lees came with a predetermined position of blanket opposition to uranium mining. With that predetermined position, they then sought to create issues where issues really did not exist in terms of the committee's investigation and the committee's report.
In contrast to Senator Margetts, I strongly welcome the government's response to our report. It ought to be emphasised that the report was undertaken on the basis of signifi 
 cant and conscientious work by those members of the committee who regularly participated in the work of the committee in the true spirit of inquiry and investigation. The basis of the work of the committee was attendance at the hearings, investigations and on-site visits, detailed reading of the evidence presented in submissions and careful examination of the evidence presented at our public hearings. The majority of the committee addressed real problems, not hypothetical problems, and we looked for constructive answers. That certainly has been recognised in the government's response to our report which was tabled today, in which the government, by and large, accepted the majority of the committee's recommendations and findings.
The report and the consequent government response represent a significant failure for the anti-uranium lobby, and that was reflected right through the conduct of this inquiry. They were complacent and they failed to provide rigorous analysis of the evidence, and that was because they were significantly out of date. The anti-uranium lobby that participated—both as members of this committee and as those who presented their submissions to this committee—were locked in the arguments of the 1970s. They had not updated their information and they had not updated their knowledge. That has been reflected in the minority report and, quite properly, it has been reflected in the response the government has provided to the report which was handed down by the majority of the committee.
The perspective of those who were engaged in opposing uranium mining was essentially a political perspective. They looked for evidence that supported their arguments, rather than assessing the evidence on the broad base of the information that was provided. Indeed, they did not look at all at what was reasonable and supportable in the evidence; they only looked for evidence which supported their side of the case.
Another aspect of the minority in this inquiry was that their interest was always limited to looking for the bad news. As I said, they did not look at the broad evidence that was provided to the committee; they only looked for the limited news that was bad and 
 that suited their particular case—and that was when they bothered to turn up. I have to exclude Senator Margetts from that criticism because Senator Margetts generally did attend our public hearings and inspections, although she did miss a number of the private meetings of the committee. Her colleague in the minority report was notable by her absence for most of that inquiry. As I said, those who opposed uranium mining were very limited in their application.
What I would argue is that policy decisions that governments have to take cannot be governed by one side of the story. You have to take into account all of the evidence that is presented and then reach a balanced conclusion based on that evidence and make a choice between the options that are presented.
The positive thing about uranium mining in Australia over the last 20 years of its operation is that it has built up a very favourable credit ledger, and that was clearly shown in the evidence presented to the committee. It has built up a favourable credit ledger with regard to economic gains for Australia and with regard to the fact that mining and milling have been conducted with minimal impact on the environment. That was particularly attested to by the evidence of the Supervising Scientist with regard to mining in the Kakadu region.
Uranium mining has also built up a very strong credit balance with regard to the high and increasingly stricter health and safety standards in the conduct of mining, and the similarly strict standards in ensuring that Australian uranium is used for civil purposes alone and is not diverted for military use. That is a substantial achievement on the part of the Australian uranium mining industry, and it was that creditable record that led the committee to come down with the recommendations we have put to government. Those recommendations were supported by five of the seven committee members, including the members of the major opposition, the Labor Party. Again, that is why we have seen the government respond to those recommendations in the favourable way it has.
In contrast to that, the dissenting report—which the government has quite correctly 
 rejected in its response to our report today—really represents the tombstone of the anti-uranium industry because, as I said, it was based on a limited analysis of the evidence that was put before the committee and a predetermined view which looked only for evidence supporting that case and ignored the broad range of evidence presented to us. The balanced evidence presented to us from across the range of protagonists certainly indicated all of the positive aspects of uranium mining, to which I have referred. That evidence, on balance, led the committee to conclude there was no reason why uranium mining should not continue or expand in Australia.
I would say that the anti-uranium campaign in this country is certainly dead and remains only to be buried. It is not only that the numbers are not there in the community to support the anti-uranium position; the main point is that the evidence is not there to support their position. There is no evidence to support the arguments they put. In the light of modern experience, the facts simply do not stand up and say that we should oppose uranium mining in this country. There have been, as I said, 20 years of uranium mining in this country and a significant credit balance has been built up over that period by the industry. In contrast, the doomsayers of the industry simply do not have evidence to support their case on the basis of that 20 years experience. The 20 years experience has been a positive vindication for the decision that was taken back in the 1970s to allow uranium mining to proceed based on the findings of the then Fox inquiry.
One of the key conclusions which the select committee reached was that the findings of the Fox inquiry had been vindicated by the evidence of that 20 years experience of mining. Indeed, to the extent that there had been any impact from uranium mining on Australia, the expectations of the Fox inquiry had not been realised, in terms of any potential damage caused to the Australian environment.
The Fox inquiry overstated the possibility of damage to the Australian environment as a result of uranium mining. All the evidence that has built up over the 20 years since that 
 inquiry, and since uranium mining has been actively undertaken in this country, shows that even the fairly minimal damage that was expected by the findings of the Fox inquiry had not been fulfilled and there had been no long-term damage to the Australian environment at all as a result of this activity being undertaken.
I welcome the government's response to this report. It vindicates the findings of the report. It vindicates the positive nature of this industry for Australia, provided that all the safeguards are retained, which the committee recommended and which have always operated to the very highest standards in this country, and which the government has indicated in its response that it will be maintaining.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Uranium Mining and Milling Committee</title>,Committees,24,1

The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON URANIUM MINING AND MILLING IN AUSTRALIA
Conclusion/Recommendation 1
.	 On the basis of available evidence, the uranium mining and milling industry will be sufficiently viable financially to be able to meet its environmental, health and safety, and security responsibilities fully.
Response
The Government notes this conclusion.
Conclusion/Recommendation 2
.	 The Committee supports the cautious approach which was favoured by the Fox Report and the need for continuing, dedicated research into all aspects of uranium mining and utilisation.
Response
The Government notes this recommendation, and comments that there is a range of Australian and international agencies with appropriate expertise. In particular, attention is drawn to Commonwealth and State legislation relating to environmental protection and nuclear and radiation safety, and nuclear safeguards. Australia is at the forefront of minimising the environmental impacts of uranium mining.
Conclusion/Recommendation 3
.	 Although there is little evidence of unnecessary overlap or duplication between Commonwealth and relevant state/territory authorities, it believes that there is scope for improvement in handling of proposals to mine uranium, and in subsequent evaluation of achievement of environmental goals.
Response
The Government notes the recommendation. The Government will continue to work with State/Territory authorities to ensure the cooperative approaches to environmental protection are continued and enhanced as appropriate. The Government is currently in the process of developing a more effective framework for inter-governmental relations on the environment.
Conclusion/Recommendation 4
.	 Uranium mining, where it is permitted, should only occur under the strictest conditions for the protection of the environment.
Response
The Government accepts this recommendation and notes projects may only operate under best practicable technology. Consistent with its policy commitment, the Government considers proposals for the development of new uranium mines. Projects need to satisfy stringent assessments of their potential environmental and heritage impacts including full consultations with Aboriginal interests involved to ensure their views are taken into account and their legal rights are not diminished. The Government recognises the States and Northern Territory have the prime role in the regulation of uranium mining to protect the environment, and notes the Commonwealth has a key role in assessing the environmental impacts of new proposals.
The Government also considers that the Commonwealth has a responsibility and interest in relation to the assessment and approval of uranium mining and milling operations as they involve matters of national environmental significance. The Government is currently considering, with State and Territory Governments, processes for handling Commonwealth responsibility and interest in relation to matters of national environmental significance.
Conclusion/Recommendation 5
.	 The concept of the social impact study could offer a viable framework within which a number of the issues arising in the context of major development projects (such as mining) can be identified, analysed and discussed.
Response
The Government notes the conclusion. Consideration of social issues is a normal part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process, and as such these issues are addressed by the project proponent in documentation for public review such as Environmental Impact Statements. However, the Government also recognises that special circumstances existed in the context of development in the Kakadu Region. It initiated the Kakadu Region Social Impact Study (KRSIS) as a separate study which investigated the effects of development, such as tourism and mining, on Aboriginal communities in the region. Reports flowing from the KRSIS are currently under consideration by stakeholders. The KRSIS process could form the framework for future consideration of the regional social impact of development, particularly where indigenous people are concerned.
Conclusion/Recommendation 6
.	 There should be a full public evaluation of rehabilitation and remedial work at Radium Hill and the former tailings dam at Port Pirie, with periodical reappraisal.
Response
Management of the former Radium Hill uranium mine site and former tailings dam site at Port Pirie in South Australia is the responsibility of the South Australian Government. The Government notes the South Australian Government's advice that it regularly inspects these sites and minor repair and remedial work is carried out if required. The Government notes that the South Australian Government is of the view that these measures are adequate and that a full public evaluation with periodical reappraisal is not warranted.
Conclusion/Recommendation 7
.	 Tailings management is among the most serious challenges facing the uranium mining industry, industry regulators and their scientific advisers.
Response
The Government notes Australia is at the forefront of applying best practicable technology for tailings management at uranium mines appropriate to the environment in which the mine is situated. Management of tailings is a key issue which is considered on a case-by-case basis in development of new mines as environmental impacts are considered. The application of ""best practicable technology"" requires regular review in line with improvements in knowledge.
Conclusion/Recommendation 8
.	 Research is integral to constructive regulation of mining and to minimising the impact of mining activity upon the environment.
Response
The Government notes the conclusion and refers to its response to recommendation 2. The site specific nature of any mine and its receiving environment need to be understood in order to optimise environmental management; it is not always sufficient to apply generic information, or information from other minesites.
Conclusion/Recommendation 9
.	 The high level of scrutiny which the uranium industry receives is warranted in that it responds to the sensitivity associated with uranium mining and has contributed materially to minimising adverse effects on the environment.
Response
The Government accepts that there are special considerations in relation to uranium mining.
Conclusion/Recommendation 10
.	 The regulatory structure should ensure that the results of research are promptly reflected in enhanced standards.
Response
The Government agrees regulatory standards should be kept under constant review and amended as appropriate to reflect the results of research. The Government subscribes to the ""precautionary principle"" in this regard and in its Inter-governmental Agreement on the Environment. The Government also refers to its response to Recommendation 18 concerning the adoption of international standards.
Conclusion/Recommendation 11
.	 New administrative arrangements are necessary to ensure high levels of performance, full utilisation of Australia's experience in uranium mining since the 1970s, rapid adoption of world best practice and vigorous public accountability nationally and locally.
Response
The Government notes this recommendation for new arrangements. While existing administrative arrangements have contributed to high levels of environmental protection, as evidenced by uranium mines developed and operated under current arrangements, the Government is prepared to consider improvements where this leads to greater effectiveness and efficiency. In this regard note the Government's response to Recommendations 3 and 4.
Existing arrangements already contribute to a high level of public accountability. The Government notes the level of public scrutiny in the Alligator 
 Rivers Region, due to the environmental sensitivity of the region and this scrutiny is continually enhanced. The Government believes consultative arrangements at mines in other regions are a matter to be considered on a case-by-case basis. For example in the case of Olympic Dam in South Australia, periodic environmental audits are being conducted, with the results to be publicly available, and the Government has facilitated the establishment of a Community Consultative Forum which will maintain a regular flow of information to the public about the environmental performance at Olympic Dam.
Conclusion/Recommendation 12
.	 A new Commonwealth Uranium Authority (CUA) should be established without delay with responsibility for—
-	 approvals to mine;
-	 direction of environmental impact studies;
-	 supervision of plans and programs to ensure impact of mines on the environment is minimised;
-	 triennial audits of environmental performance at mines (or at such shorter intervals as may be necessary);
-	 review, audit and evaluation of health and safety measures at the mines and other locations where nuclear materials are stored.
Response
The Government does not accept this recommendation. The States and Northern Territory have the prime responsibility for regulation of mining as well as health and safety, and this is the appropriate level of Government to administer these responsibilities. Existing environmental impact assessment procedures already deal with approvals to mine, direction of impact studies and supervision of plans and programs requiring minimisation of environmental impacts. Uranium mine developments are subject to joint State/Commonwealth assessment. In addition, environmental and health and safety audits are already provided for under existing arrangements (industry/state governments and Northern Territory/Commonwealth). The Government does not believe the proposed CUA offers any advantage over current arrangements. Note also the response to Recommendation 3.
Conclusion/Recommendation 13
.	 The CUA, providing its high standards are met, may delegate tasks to State and Territory government authorities.
Response
The Government rejects the need for a CUA for reasons already covered, but accepts the key role of State and Territory authorities towards attainment of high environmental standards. 

Conclusion/Recommendation 14
.	 National coordination provided by the CUA should be complemented at each mine by a consultative committee composed of representatives of proprietors, governments, unions, conservation and local interests.
Response
While rejecting the need for the CUA, the Government notes the recommendation regarding consultative arrangements. The Government considers, as stated under the response to Recommendation 11, that consultative arrangements between mine operators and the local community are desirable such as those already in place in the Alligator Rivers Region and being established at Olympic Dam.
Conclusion/Recommendation 15
.	 Government Senators, on the basis that the Committee's inquiry found that present federal arrangements have proven to be satisfactory and suitable, are unconvinced that a new national authority is either a necessary or effective mechanism for achievement of the goals for whose accomplishment it is being created. They believe, however, that the proposed consultative committees have merit in their own right and will furnish the additional scrutiny of uranium mining which in part motivates the proposal for the new Authority. In terms of consequential recommendations about collaboration between the proposed CUA and the Supervising Scientist, they do not see any reason for an enlarged role for the Supervising Scientist but they agree that the expertise of the organisation should be more generally available on a fee-for-service basis.
Response
The Government agrees with the conclusion/recommendation and considers that consultative committees are appropriate and must include representation by indigenous claimants and titleholders. The Government considers that the principles of contestability should apply in accessing appropriate expertise and that any services provided by the Supervising Scientist should be as appropriate on a fee-for-service basis.
Conclusion/Recommendation 16
.	 The Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region is an essential component of the framework which has materially contributed to minimising the effects of mining on an environmentally important part of Australia. The value of its research role is indisputable.
The Supervising Scientist should be encouraged to develop, in response to demand, a broad expertise in environmental aspects of uranium mining and milling. It is of positive value for Australia to have a scientific body with a com 
 prehensive expertise in the environmental impacts of uranium mining and milling, and a body where such skills and expertise may be acquired, fostered and developed.
Response
The Government notes that the Supervising Scientist has had an important role in contributing to the protection of the environment in relation to the operation of the Ranger and Nabarlek uranium mines and recognises that this should continue in respect of proposals for Jabiluka and any other proposed mines in the region.
In relation to the development of expertise, the Government points to its response to Recommendation 15. An extensive body of expertise exists in relation to uranium mining issues, and the principles of contestability should apply in accessing appropriate expertise from government, academic and private sector providers.
Conclusion/Recommendation 17
.	 The proposed CUA and the Supervising Scientist should collaborate constructively in ensuring that the good practice which now prevails is maintained and improved; that world best practice standards are, as a matter of course, promptly applied in all uranium mines in Australia; and that through public accountability mechanisms the Australian public are informed about the quality of the environmental performance at uranium mines.
Response
As considered earlier, the Government does not see the need for a new Commonwealth Uranium Authority and considers current administrative arrangements adequately provide for best practice.
Conclusion/Recommendation 18
.	 The results of verified research on health and safety of employees must be applied without delay. The Select Committee is especially critical of the long, drawn-out delay in adoption of the latest international standards concerning radiation exposure. Present practices whilst satisfactory must be seen as minimum standards.
Response
In September 1997, the Government announced the formation of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). ARPANSA will provide advice on all matters concerned with the safety of radiation and nuclear activities and will promote the development of uniform national regulatory approaches to the control of radiation-related activities.
It should be noted that radiation protection activities in uranium mining and milling lie almost entirely in the domain of State and Territory jurisdiction. The Commonwealth role through 
 ARPANSA is mostly to assist the States and Territories towards the application of common standards and requirements. This is achieved by way of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978  which provides for the joint development of regulatory codes with supporting guideline material which ultimately become mandatory requirements under the appropriate State or Territory laws.
National regulatory codes have been developed to cover the radiation protection of workers and the public during the operation of mines and mills.
Australia has always been one of the first countries to adopt the latest international standards. The National Health and Medical Research Council and the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission adopted the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended dose limits in 1995, making Australia one of the first countries to do so (see also Recommendations 20 and 22).
Conclusion/Recommendation 19
.	 As a basis for ensuring employee health and safety, data collection and analysis needs to be standardised on a national basis in the development of the National Radiation Dose Register.
Response
The Government supports a common means of reporting the dose results to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency which will be responsible for developing and maintaining the National Radiation Dose Register.
However, the Government disagrees with the standardisation of methods for data collection and analysis throughout Australia. Different monitoring methods are not only beneficial but essential for the current and proposed uranium facilities and other worksites (eg health care which involves production of radiation) in Australia. For example, in the case of uranium mines the monitoring approach for radon progeny in an underground mine will be different from the approach required for an open cut operation (due to the different magnitude of results, different unattached fraction, etc). The key issue is that all data collection and analysis is undertaken in compliance with the latest recommendations of the applicable peak bodies.
Also, standardisation would stifle research into more advanced monitoring approaches and would then delay the implementation of any improvements in radiation monitoring.
Conclusion/Recommendation 20
.	 Determination of appropriate career dose limits should be a research priority for government health authorities and mining companies.
Response
The Government believes the protection of workers from the health effects of radiation is of paramount importance.
The Government draws attention to the research carried out into the effects of radiation by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These are based on extensive studies of exposed human populations, by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.
The ICRP reached the judgement that dose limits should be set such that the total occupational dose received during a full working life would not exceed about 1 Sievert, received moderately uniformly year by year (but tempered by the principle that doses should be as low as reasonably achievable). This translates to an average annual dose of 20 mSv per year. For practical purposes ICRP expressed this limit as 100 mSv over 5 consecutive years with a maximum of 50 mSv in any one year, rather than specifying a career dose limit. The averaging period is a compromise between requiring employers to maintain exposure records over many years and insisting that doses are kept below 20 mSv in any year.
Conclusion/Recommendation 21
.	 Employees in uranium mines and mills should be fully briefed personally on radiation and related hazards. Mining companies should meet the costs of briefings.
Response
The Government notes that under existing State and Territory legislation it is a requirement for companies to fully brief their workforce on radiation-related hazards associated with mining and milling of uranium.
The Government also recognises that there is a case for special culturally appropriate interpretation and translation of information concerning potential hazards for any indigenous or other employees from non-English speaking backgrounds, proposing to become part of the uranium mining or milling workforce.
Conclusion/Recommendation 22
.	 Current health and safety standards (especially as exemplified at Ranger) should be regarded as minimum standards.
Response
The Government believes that the health and safety standards which should be regarded as a minimum for radiological protection are those which have been recommended and adopted by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the National Occupation and Health Safety Commission. These standards were developed in parallel and with full knowledge of the ICRP's recommendations (see response to Recommendation 20). 

The Government notes that existing mines are operating within these minimum standards and it is expected that any future mines would have to also operate within these standards.
The Government recognises that there is a specific need to consider assessment criteria based on ICRP for indigenous people's exposure given that they live on the land, drink the water and are specifically exposed to possible contaminants for longer periods. The critical pathways for their exposure to contaminants should be determined on the basis of indigenous lifestyle in consultation with local indigenous people.
Conclusion/Recommendation 23
.	 Mining companies and regulatory authorities should actively pursue the ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) principle in radiation matters and report on the extent that they succeed in operating well below prescribed levels.
Response
The Government's view is that the principle of ALARA is an essential part of dose optimisation and it supports mining companies and regulators actively pursuing this objective and reporting on the extent to which they meet this objective in line with advances in best practicable technology available. The Government also notes that radiation is just one of many potential occupational hazards.
Conclusion/Recommendation 24
.	 A uniform method of measuring, calculating and recording dose limits should be adopted and applied.
Response
The Government supports a common means of reporting the dose results to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency which will be responsible for developing and maintaining the National Radiation Dose Register.
However, the Government refers back to its position stated in responses to Recommendation 19, that it disagrees with the standardisation of methods for measuring and calculating doses throughout Australia. The Government also refers to its response to Recommendation 20 which recognises the thorough deliberation given by the International Commission on Radiological Protection in relation to career dose limits, and the incorporation of this research into Australian standards.
Conclusion/Recommendation 25
.	 The matter of career dosage has not been examined sufficiently thoroughly by scientific and medical authorities. The Australian Radiation Laboratory should take the lead in consultation with mining companies and unions.
Health authorities should examine a means of compensation for employees who exceed a career 
 dose limit (when determined) prior to retirement age.
Response
The Government refers to its response to Recommendation 20 regarding career dose limits. As stated earlier, both ICRP and Australian authorities express the dose limits of average annual doses accumulated over a specified period. Australian recommendations do allow the regulator to permit an extension of the averaging period to a maximum of ten years in exceptional circumstances. This should ensure that the annual average of 20 mSv will not be exceeded over the long term and the Government believes that the question of compensation will not therefore arise.
Conclusion/Recommendation 26
.	 All mines should consult the Environmental Research Institute of the Supervising Scientist (ERISS) on methodologies and technologies for identifying and monitoring background radiation at mine sites and in the region where the mine is located.
Response
The Government notes the contribution ERISS has made to research in the Alligator Rivers Region, and agrees that ERISS is one of a number of bodies at the Commonwealth and State level with expertise on background radiation which could be consulted by mines. Importantly, the Government considers that the principles of contestability should apply when mines access appropriate expertise in this area.
Conclusion/Recommendation 27
.	 Governments, mining companies and Aboriginal organisations should consider negotiation of comprehensive statements of agreement within which partnerships can develop to consolidate economic and social benefits within a context of respect for indigenous culture, customs and ways of life.
Response
The Government's policy is that where Aboriginal interests are involved, the Government is committed to ensuring full and appropriate consultation with affected Aboriginal communities with their views being taken into account in accordance with applicable law. Aboriginal and cultural issues are considered in the Environmental Impact Statement process for new projects. The Government believes these matters are most appropriately considered on a case-by-case basis by relevant stakeholders.
Conclusion/Recommendation 28
.	 The Committee is concerned that resources assigned for safeguards programs and developments are not keeping pace with developments in the nuclear industry. 

Response
The Government disagrees that the resources assigned for safeguards are not keeping pace with developments in the nuclear industry. Maintenance and development of the nuclear safeguards system at multilateral and bilateral levels is central to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.
The Government will continue to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure resources are available to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system. The Government does not accept that there is a simple arithmetical relationship between the quantities of nuclear material in the international nuclear fuel cycle and the costs of safeguards activities.
Equally, the Government is fully aware of the need to ensure that Australia can monitor and evaluate developments in the international nuclear industry and assess the implications of those developments for national non-proliferation and safeguards policy approaches. The Government will continue to ensure the availability of sufficient resources for these purposes, including for the Australian Safeguards Office.
Conclusion/Recommendation 29
.	 The safeguards system needs constant attention to work. Australia has a long record of contributing to the vitality of safeguards, international and national. It is a record which should be maintained.
Response
The Government accepts this recommendation and supports a continuing Australian commitment to the long term maintenance and development of the international and national nuclear safeguards system.
Australia has a long record of contributing to the development of the nuclear safeguards system, reflecting the dual objectives of enhancing Australia's security by limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increasing Australia's prosperity through support for international and bilateral nuclear safeguards which provide the indispensable basis for uranium exports.
In recent years Australia has been a prominent advocate of measures, recently agreed in the IAEA, to strengthen international safeguards in the light of the discovery after the Gulf War of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program.
Separately, through the Australian Safeguards Office, Australia has for many years operated a supplementary safeguards support program covering research and development projects, regional training programs and other activities, such as participation in international experts' meetings and advisory groups, in support of IAEA safeguards. 

Conclusion/Recommendation 30
.	 The Senate Procedure Committee should examine the implications of globalisation for parliamentary scrutiny of government, administration and public policy.
Response
The Government notes the conclusion/recommendation.
Conclusion/Recommendation 31
.	 Safeguards practices must continue to develop, and such development should continue in a calm and rational manner. The risks which nuclear power involves are less likely to engender unjustified apprehension or insecurity if addressed calmly, cautiously, deliberately and expeditiously.
Response
The Government endorses this finding. Because nuclear energy has both peaceful and military uses it is subject to far higher standards of scrutiny, safeguards and safety than any other industry. The Government has traditionally taken a cautious approach to the formulation of policy in this area and, for example, has pioneered strict non-proliferation approaches to questions of nuclear supply in ways which enhanced the international regime.
The Government provides many sources of information on these issues, for example through the Australian Safeguards Office's Annual Report, inquiries into the nuclear industry and information regularly provided by officers from relevant Government agencies, as a contribution to balanced and informed public debate.
Dissenting Report
In preparing its response to the Senate Select Committee Report the Government has taken into account the dissenting report by Senators Lees and Margetts. The Government recognises the concerns that motivate these Senators in regard to their position on uranium mining and the nuclear fuel cycle.
The dissenting report's main recommendation follows:
"". . . this minority report recommends against the expansion of the uranium industry, opposes all new uranium mining proposals in Australia and recommends the cancellation of all export licenses for uranium mining and the refusal of any new export licenses for further uranium mines in Australia.""(pp. 43-44)
The Government considers that the dissenting report's call to close down the industry ignores both the economic benefits of the industry to Australia, the sound environmental record of existing uranium mining projects in Australia and the stringent environmental, heritage, safety and safeguards arrangements in place. It also ignores 
 the likelihood of taxpayers needing to pay substantial compensation to mining companies for on-payment to investors in the event of the Government cancelling existing export approvals.
The minority report also concludes:
""Should the Government decide to continue permitting the export of Australian uranium, then the other recommendations contained in this minority report should be implemented to minimise the adverse effects of Australia's uranium mining.""(p.44)
The Government considers that the recommendations do not take adequate account of the stringent environmental, heritage, safety and safeguards arrangements in place.
The Government firmly believes it is possible to have a safe and environmentally responsible uranium mining industry in Australia and considers that its responses to the recommendations of the majority report justify this.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,24,2
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-13,"—As the deputy chair, I was obviously very much involved with the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling. I found it an extremely difficult time. I would hope that many of the committees I work on in future are not as difficult in terms of the working relationships and the walls of opposition that tended to exist within that committee structure. But, given that I was on that committee, I would like to suggest that the response is quite interesting, though hardly surprising. Much of what was written in the majority report was in fact saying what a fine job is being done already, world's best practice, rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, and how everything is being done almost as well as it can be done.
 Many of the recommendations are similar. There was one very strange recommendation. Recommendation 1 states:
On the basis of available evidence, the uranium mining and milling industry will be sufficiently viable financially to be able to meet its environmental, health and safety, and security responsibilities fully.
The response was:
The government notes this conclusion.
Terrific! Most of it is about how, as I say, the roles of government are being adequately 
 dealt with so far. The fact that there are processes means that those processes must be adequately handled and therefore the so-called world's best practice is being maintained. We talk about Australia being in the forefront of applying best practice technology for tailings management at uranium mines appropriate to the environment in which the mine is situated. That is basically saying that Australia is best at operating mines in Australia. Terrific! Very useful information.
 The one thing I thought was particularly useful was recommendation No. 12. This was interesting because this appears to be the big win that the Labor Party seemed to have negotiated in relation to this inquiry. Remember that a lot of people within the ALP over time have had great concerns in relation to uranium mining and milling, great concerns about what the future will be for uranium mining and milling. The big trade-off in relation to this report was that there was to be a recommendation for a new Commonwealth uranium authority. As recommendation No. 12 states:
A new Commonwealth Uranium Authority (CUA) should be established without delay with responsibility for—
-	 approvals to mine;

Surprise, surprise! Response:
The government does not accept this recommendation.
Obviously the states and the Northern Territory are doing such a wonderful job that it is really not necessary. Any other recommendations that involved any potential Commonwealth uranium authority got the same kind of response.
One thing I did find interesting was that, under recommendation No. 15, there was a desire by the Commonwealth government not 
 to be involved with any expansion of the role of the Supervising Scientist, but:
. . . they do not see any reason for an enlarged role for the Supervising Scientist but they agree that the expertise of the organisation should be more generally available on a fee-for-service basis.
You do not enlarge the role, but you allow the Office of the Supervising Scientist to tout for business. What does this mean? You do not enlarge them and they are allowed to find some of their own funding—what a surprise! What does that mean in the longer term? If I were to gaze into a crystal ball, I would say that in the longer term there will be a lot of pressure put on the government so that the industry no longer will have to pay for their own supervision, no longer will have to pay for that tiny level of assurance that the community expect from the government on their behalf to be required of industry. Keep your eyes on the ball because within a very short time we will see that kind of pressure.
If the OSS do get extra contracts, they will have to do it within their resources, I imagine, because they do not want an expanded role. Over time, the government will say, `See, you've got enough funding so we'll start reducing or removing the levy associated with industry.' I just think that is a potential, a crystal ball gaze.
We have some other very interesting recommendations in the majority report. Under recommendation 20, it says:
.	 Determination of appropriate career dose limits should be a research priority for government health authorities and mining companies.
I would think the public would think this is the very least that government should do. It should make sure that in the information that is provided, the assurances that are given by companies, by private corporations and by proponents, about the safety of radiation doses and uranium doses—and that includes issues like the proposed Jabiluka mine—that the underground miners will be aware that they will be, we believe, experiencing unsafe levels of radiation from very high rate on-sources and aware of the inability of companies to actually reduce those to any levels that are considered in any way safe.
The committee is saying that there needs to be a determination of appropriate career dose limits, a research priority. At the moment, the companies themselves can come up with what they think is a safe level, and that has been the problem in a number of the reports, whether it is about Roxby Downs or other places. It is the company that has been saying what it thinks is safe, and there have been disagreements between the company and organisations like the Australian Radiation Laboratories which are set up to manage and comment on these things. Under the response to recommendation 20, we see that:
The Government believes the protection of workers from the health effects of radiation is of paramount importance.
Motherhood and apple pie. It continues:
The Government draws attention to the research carried out into the effects of radiation by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These are based on extensive studies of exposed human populations . . . 
. . .              . . .             . . .
This translates to an average annual dose of 20 mSv per year. For practical purposes ICRP expressed this limit as 100 Msv over 5 consecutive years with a maximum of 50 Msv in any one year, rather than specifying a career dose limit.
What does that mean for workers and their feeling of safety over time? We are saying that we will take whatever seems to be easier, and we as a government are not going to take the responsibility of making sure that these doses are in fact reasonable, not safe, under the career limits. We are moving around people so that we have an average situation. I do not think that is particularly safe anyway. If they have been exposed to high levels of radiation, that is a bad thing in itself and we should be making sure that every exposure to workers is as low as can be made possible, and that is not what is happening at the moment. I think that is a great pity.
It is hardly surprising that the government did not accept my minority report. It says:
The Government considers that the dissenting report's call to close down the industry ignores both the economic benefits of the industry to Australia,—
those benefits were never proved—
the sound environmental record of existing uranium mining projects in Australia—
remember we were saying that the fact these processes exist means that they must obviously be done well—
and the stringent environmental, heritage, safety and safeguards arrangements in place—
despite the quite clear evidence that was given on a number of occasions that many of these standards were not being adhered to and that, when there were problems, it took a long time to find out information and even longer to get action in these cases. I think it is a concern. I think we have a head in the sand attitude to uranium mining—and I did not mean that as a pun. I really do think that, if Australia wishes to continue to mine and mill uranium, this kind of response simply is not good enough.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,24,2
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1998-05-13,"—It is not surprising that Senator Margetts would reject the response of the government and the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling because, of course, she had a minority report, a dissenting report, to the majority report of that committee when that report was tabled. The interesting thing about the minority report was that it really was a facade in that it sought to create a lot of differences and raise a lot of issues of significance that really were not significant when you thoroughly examined those issues.
The differences between Senator Margetts and Senator Lees and the rest of the committee really were not what I would call significant differences on a number of the substantive issues that were investigated. The real difference was that Senator Margetts and Senator Lees came with a predetermined position of blanket opposition to uranium mining. With that predetermined position, they then sought to create issues where issues really did not exist in terms of the committee's investigation and the committee's report.
In contrast to Senator Margetts, I strongly welcome the government's response to our report. It ought to be emphasised that the report was undertaken on the basis of signifi 
 cant and conscientious work by those members of the committee who regularly participated in the work of the committee in the true spirit of inquiry and investigation. The basis of the work of the committee was attendance at the hearings, investigations and on-site visits, detailed reading of the evidence presented in submissions and careful examination of the evidence presented at our public hearings. The majority of the committee addressed real problems, not hypothetical problems, and we looked for constructive answers. That certainly has been recognised in the government's response to our report which was tabled today, in which the government, by and large, accepted the majority of the committee's recommendations and findings.
The report and the consequent government response represent a significant failure for the anti-uranium lobby, and that was reflected right through the conduct of this inquiry. They were complacent and they failed to provide rigorous analysis of the evidence, and that was because they were significantly out of date. The anti-uranium lobby that participated—both as members of this committee and as those who presented their submissions to this committee—were locked in the arguments of the 1970s. They had not updated their information and they had not updated their knowledge. That has been reflected in the minority report and, quite properly, it has been reflected in the response the government has provided to the report which was handed down by the majority of the committee.
The perspective of those who were engaged in opposing uranium mining was essentially a political perspective. They looked for evidence that supported their arguments, rather than assessing the evidence on the broad base of the information that was provided. Indeed, they did not look at all at what was reasonable and supportable in the evidence; they only looked for evidence which supported their side of the case.
Another aspect of the minority in this inquiry was that their interest was always limited to looking for the bad news. As I said, they did not look at the broad evidence that was provided to the committee; they only looked for the limited news that was bad and 
 that suited their particular case—and that was when they bothered to turn up. I have to exclude Senator Margetts from that criticism because Senator Margetts generally did attend our public hearings and inspections, although she did miss a number of the private meetings of the committee. Her colleague in the minority report was notable by her absence for most of that inquiry. As I said, those who opposed uranium mining were very limited in their application.
What I would argue is that policy decisions that governments have to take cannot be governed by one side of the story. You have to take into account all of the evidence that is presented and then reach a balanced conclusion based on that evidence and make a choice between the options that are presented.
The positive thing about uranium mining in Australia over the last 20 years of its operation is that it has built up a very favourable credit ledger, and that was clearly shown in the evidence presented to the committee. It has built up a favourable credit ledger with regard to economic gains for Australia and with regard to the fact that mining and milling have been conducted with minimal impact on the environment. That was particularly attested to by the evidence of the Supervising Scientist with regard to mining in the Kakadu region.
Uranium mining has also built up a very strong credit balance with regard to the high and increasingly stricter health and safety standards in the conduct of mining, and the similarly strict standards in ensuring that Australian uranium is used for civil purposes alone and is not diverted for military use. That is a substantial achievement on the part of the Australian uranium mining industry, and it was that creditable record that led the committee to come down with the recommendations we have put to government. Those recommendations were supported by five of the seven committee members, including the members of the major opposition, the Labor Party. Again, that is why we have seen the government respond to those recommendations in the favourable way it has.
In contrast to that, the dissenting report—which the government has quite correctly 
 rejected in its response to our report today—really represents the tombstone of the anti-uranium industry because, as I said, it was based on a limited analysis of the evidence that was put before the committee and a predetermined view which looked only for evidence supporting that case and ignored the broad range of evidence presented to us. The balanced evidence presented to us from across the range of protagonists certainly indicated all of the positive aspects of uranium mining, to which I have referred. That evidence, on balance, led the committee to conclude there was no reason why uranium mining should not continue or expand in Australia.
I would say that the anti-uranium campaign in this country is certainly dead and remains only to be buried. It is not only that the numbers are not there in the community to support the anti-uranium position; the main point is that the evidence is not there to support their position. There is no evidence to support the arguments they put. In the light of modern experience, the facts simply do not stand up and say that we should oppose uranium mining in this country. There have been, as I said, 20 years of uranium mining in this country and a significant credit balance has been built up over that period by the industry. In contrast, the doomsayers of the industry simply do not have evidence to support their case on the basis of that 20 years experience. The 20 years experience has been a positive vindication for the decision that was taken back in the 1970s to allow uranium mining to proceed based on the findings of the then Fox inquiry.
One of the key conclusions which the select committee reached was that the findings of the Fox inquiry had been vindicated by the evidence of that 20 years experience of mining. Indeed, to the extent that there had been any impact from uranium mining on Australia, the expectations of the Fox inquiry had not been realised, in terms of any potential damage caused to the Australian environment.
The Fox inquiry overstated the possibility of damage to the Australian environment as a result of uranium mining. All the evidence that has built up over the 20 years since that 
 inquiry, and since uranium mining has been actively undertaken in this country, shows that even the fairly minimal damage that was expected by the findings of the Fox inquiry had not been fulfilled and there had been no long-term damage to the Australian environment at all as a result of this activity being undertaken.
I welcome the government's response to this report. It vindicates the findings of the report. It vindicates the positive nature of this industry for Australia, provided that all the safeguards are retained, which the committee recommended and which have always operated to the very highest standards in this country, and which the government has indicated in its response that it will be maintaining.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,24,2

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-05-13,"—Government amendments Nos 1 and 2 relate to the exemp 
 tion for youth allowance recipients aged under 18 from the requirement to be in full-time education or training. Under an amendment the opposition successfully moved in the debate on the main youth allowance bill, the Social Security Act would grant the exemption if a person `is in case management approved by the secretary or, where no case management place is available to the person, is suitable for and agrees to undertake case management'.
The problem with this amendment is that case management is defined in the Employment Services Act 1994 which ceased to have effect from 1 May 1998. Rather, a new and different service known as intensive assistance is being provided to job seekers under the employment services market reforms.
To deal with this problem, our proposal is to seek to vary the opposition's amendment by extending the exemption to young people receiving or approved for Commonwealth-funded intensive assistance for job seekers. This amendment does not change the intention of the opposition's amendment; rather, it simply changes it to reflect the new realities in the employment services market.

Such a student in exactly the same circumstances but who does not live at home has a maximum rate of $265.50 per fortnight. The effect of our request for removing paragraph (a) of proposed point 1067L-B2, which refers to a student living at home, removes the lesser level of payment. Essentially, the effect of our request would be to allow that person over the age of 25 years living at home to receive the same maximum payment as a person living away from home.

While I agree with the ALP's position and will be supporting it, I think it was interesting that he noted that it was a retrospective view. The government was not necessarily harking back to an earlier era—be it the 1950s, the 1960s or even the 1970s—but I believe that the change was actually instituted in the 1990s by the former government.

In the end, we might have a situation where we have discrimination on the basis of star signs—with Sagittarians not getting assistance and Capricorns getting assistance. Perhaps we will have 
 equal opportunity cases based on unfair discrimination based on star signs, with one month or one day making all the difference between one person and another.
The reality is not particularly good. The debate will define itself a little later on but, in effect, quite a lot of people will miss out. A number of people in our society will continue to say that the deals that have been reached as a result of this legislation were unfair in the main, however, we will agree to this particular amendment.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-13,"—We have not withdrawn or moved our amendments, so I can still speak to them.
—That is correct.
—The Greens requests Nos 1 and 2 on sheet 979 attempted to remove the distinction between living at home and living away from home for the purposes of determining the maximum rate of payment for a person over the age of 25. Later amendments sought to achieve this for the new 25-and-over Austudy payment. Currently, about 1,000 students aged over 25 live with their parents.
The current Austudy system, quite sensibly, makes no demarcation between over-25s living away home and those remaining at home. The current maximum rate for these students—providing they are not long-term income support students, in which case they receive more—is $265.39. However, under the provisions of this consequential bill, from 1 July their payment will be reduced to $174.80 literally overnight. Most of these people have no idea that such a change is coming. In fact, no-one apart from a few people in the Department of Social Security knew this themselves until March this year. A lot of people, obviously tightly budgeting 
 on their existing meagre payments, would find themselves kicked in the teeth as a result of that $90 per fortnight reduction, which would cause confusion, anxiety and real financial hardship.
 But this government itself obviously recognises that those aged over 25 years are financially independent from their parents. The Greens (WA) argued vigorously during the debate on the youth allowance bill that people should be considered independent at 18 for the purpose of student assistance, as they are under just about every other law in society. Nevertheless, even using the government's definition of `independence at the age of 25', the logic of applying a different rate of payment to those who happen to live at home is entirely inconsistent.
Let us look at whom we are considering whacking with this reduction in payment. For many of those people their parents may be elderly. They might be on an age pension or living on superannuation payments. Perhaps they can put their hands in their pockets—I do not think so. What sense is there in reducing the amount they can contribute to the family home? We might have a situation where they will have to go cap in hand to elderly parents as of 1 July. We would like to amend this bill to remove the artificial distinction between over-25s living at home and those living away from home as well as amending the `yet to be proclaimed' youth allowance bill. It might well be the case that we do not have to move our `break glass in case of emergency' grandfathering amendments. We  will look carefully at the outcomes of this bill to see whether that is going to be necessary.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,38,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-05-13,"—On that point I might ask the minister what rationale the government puts forward for making the distinction to which Senator Margetts just referred—the notion that people over 25 would somehow not be eligible and those under 25 would be in relation to access to the living allowance. I am wondering if there is information that the government can show to the chamber that somehow a single adult over 
 the age of 25 is not deserving of a living allowance. Why is there that distinction in the ages?
—Senator Stott Despoja, would you care to move Democrat amendment No. 1? I think the minister might respond to queries at the end of the process.
—That is fine. I am happy to move amendment No. 1 on sheet 982. I move:

You then asked me to move my amendment, which does relate to a different issue, and I just moved that.

That the Senate take note of the document.
Looking through this document, I see it is a report prepared by Justice Peter Gray and is his last report as Aboriginal Land Commissioner. I note in correspondence at the back of this report that the manner of His Honour's sending off from his work as a commissioner was not as gracious as it may have been. There was a difference between him and the government about the interpretation of a particular section of the relevant act. That is a pity because Justice Gray is a person of great legal ability—he is a great judge—and of undoubted integrity. It is a pity that there was that hiccup, if you like, in his final days as Aboriginal Land Commissioner.
Mr Justice Gray was respected highly when he was a barrister at the Melbourne bar. I know he was highly respected as a judge. I commend him on the work he did in the Office of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner.
I note that this report was produced by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. That body has not fared as well out of the budget as it might. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was established on the initiative of the Hon. Gerry Hand when he was minister for Aboriginal affairs.
The concept he had of ATSIC was that it should take the initiative as far as possible—and consistent with the constitution and the sort of nation we are—in developing Aboriginal policy. This body is less than 10 years old. I would suggest that it still needs time to take on board all that needs to be taken on board to make it a near perfect body. To start to take certain powers away from it at this stage I think is poor policy. It is not the sort of policy that this body deserves to have applied to it. In any event, that is what has happened. 
There are two concerns that this report raised. The first is that Mr Justice Gray was sent away—I am not saying that his commission was in any way cut off—perhaps less  graciously than he might have been. The second is that we must give the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission the full support that it deserves and the time it needs to mature into the sort of body it is going to become if it is not stymied in its efforts.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-13,"—I rise tonight on a topic which is of longstanding interest to me, and that is the area of information technology. Tonight I intend to continue a series of speeches on a theme that I started in the last session. We are indeed at the start of the information revolution, a revolution as important to change in the economy and in society as the Industrial Revolution was 170 years ago. One of the large emerging factors in this revolution that is coming about at a breathtaking pace at the moment is the whole world of e-commerce.
E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is the selling of goods and services over the Internet. World wide this is expected to boom from $6 billion, which is the most recent figure in the international economy, to more than $300 billion in the year 2002. What is driving this electronic commerce is the incredibly rapid development of the Internet which, in terms of e-commerce usage, is doubling every 100 days world wide. People on the Internet who will have access to this electronic commerce are expected to increase by tenfold—that is, from 100 million people to 
 one billion people—by 2005. That is roughly 20 per cent of the world's population.
 The rate of the expansion of this new technology and the commerce that it will drive is phenomenal. Just four years ago e-commerce usage of the Internet in the United States was being debated as they tried to work out what sorts of protocols and procedures could be used to trade in goods and services over the Internet. At that time the whole thing was a relatively new concept. How things have changed in just a very short time. Australia is really trying to catch up with this very rapidly developing global phenomenon.
Recently in Canberra was the E-commerce Summit, organised by Minister Alston's Office of the Information Economy. It was held here several weeks ago in Parliament House and it drew a very impressive group of people from business, government and consumer groups, industrial leaders and people concerned with the regulation of industry. The summit was a very important step to get Australian business ready for e-commerce, ready to compete in this new information economy. Australia cannot afford, given its rapid development, to take a wait and see approach. We need to be gearing up very rapidly for this new economic revolution that is now flowing over the whole world.
We can look to the US for the very broad effect of the information revolution, and it already points the way to Australia's economic future. In the US, the Internet accounts for one-third of real growth in their economy. Information technology industries have grown from four per cent to eight per cent of the US economy in the last decade. It has created seven million jobs in information technology and related industry.
The interesting thing is that it is creating high wage jobs. The average wage, for example, in the United States is $28,000. In the information technology industry, the average wage is $44,000. So there is some very good news in the type of economy that is developing at this time. Some 45 per cent of business investment in the United States at the moment is in information technology, and it is up from three per cent just 15 years ago. The US 
 believes the importance of this will tend to accelerate.
At the E-commerce Summit, we had Mr Ira Magaziner, who is the special adviser to President Clinton on e-commerce. He had some very interesting things to tell us about the way in which this is developing in the United States currently. It is believed that business to business electronic commerce will grow from $6 billion per annum to $300 billion per annum by the year 2002. Retailing is one of the big areas that will be subject to rapid change in the immediate future.
Already sales of things like books, clothing and real estate are gaining very rapid acceptance in this e-commerce world, but there will be a rapidly expanding range of products and services developed and delivered digitally from this point on. Things like software, music, movies, video games, insurance policies, banking, consulting services, education, medical diagnostic services and news services are just some of the things that will be transported digitally in this new world of electronic commerce. Significantly, Ira Magaziner said that he believed that this will drive world economic growth for the next 25 years. If he is right, the e-commerce revolution will create the largest and longest boom in world economic history.
Magaziner said that the United States had five principles it used when setting its policy in examining the information economy. These are principles which Australians should consider very carefully and should be debating very vigorously at this point in time. Some of these principles, if put into place, would certainly have some very big upsides economically, but socially, for some of the groups in our economy, there could be some fairly significant downsides. We are moving into a totally new world, and we are moving into it very rapidly. So this debate, in terms of these principles, should occur right now.
I want to outline the five principles that he said were driving Internet policy in the United States. The first principle is that the private sector should lead Internet growth. They have found that government structures in this new world where change is so rapid often get in the way and do not have the flexibility to 
 respond to the changes that are needed to let this e-commerce sector grow at a pace at which it is capable of growing.
The second principle is that the whole area should be market driven. It should not be a regulated area. Regulation is hard obviously not only because of its international dimensions but also because of the convergence of the technologies involved in e-commerce and the way in which our structures currently tend to segment different markets which in the e-commerce world will all merge into one. Other things in the technology area are changing as well. Where there were certain limits, particularly created by bandwidth on the Internet, new technology means that all these barriers will come down as well. His claim is that government, in its regulations, can get in the way.
The third principle is that any government intervention that does exist should be minimal. The fourth principle is the need to take heed of the medium that we are dealing with. We are not dealing just with big businesses often in this e-commerce world. We are dealing with a whole range of smaller organisations in a very decentralised structure. So, to have this whole market work properly, you need as much flexibility to allow smaller players in a wide range of sites to be able to develop their businesses with as little hindrance as possible.
His final principle relating to e-commerce was related to its global nature and the need to remove, particularly between countries, not only tariff but also non-tariff trade barriers. He sees that the Internet and its trade should be free of any customs duties—and he advocates world trade organisations making electronic transmissions free of customs duty—that any taxation should be tax neutral and that no discriminatory tax should be placed against the Internet.
What I have outlined to date indicates a number of things about e-commerce which should raise questions in people's minds. Seeing I am nearly out of time, I will continue the discussion of those principles tomorrow. These are things that should not necessarily be just accepted. In this new information 
 age, we need to respond in an appropriate way. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Information Technology</title>,Adjournment,40,1
