"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I rise to speak on the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006. This is an omnibus bill which contains a variety of measures. I will briefly take the opportunity to outline the contents of the bill and, in particular, Labor’s analysis of the bill. Schedule 1 of the bill looks to address a gap in the current law. Presently, Customs may dispose of certain perishable items seized under appropriate circumstances; however, it does not have a similar power for explosive materials and certain hazardous chemicals and biological agents, even in cases where it lacks the capacity for safe storage. The bill remedies that inadequacy to allow the disposal, including destruction where necessary, of such goods where their retention would constitute a danger to public health or safety. This is a sensible measure that reduces the risk that Customs officers and members of the travelling public could unnecessarily be exposed to. As such, Labor supports it.
I will look at schedules 2 and 4 of the bill together, as both cover the government’s security identification regimes. Schedule 2 seeks to close gaps in our existing security regime regarding access to designated areas. Examples of these include areas used for the examination of baggage or the questioning of aircraft passengers. The ability of Customs to control access to designated areas is at present overly restricted. In particular, persons who hold either an aviation security identification card or a visitor identification card can have, in effect, unfettered access to these areas even where it is not required for the performance of their duties.
It is really incredible to think that the government is still fiddling around with this basic level of security more than five years after the September 11 attacks. The changes proposed in schedule 2 will enable Customs to issue a written notice to the holder of a security identification card directing restricted access to such areas. I might say, though, while Labor support this amendment, we are interested in ensuring that the actual implementation of this change works as intended.
Schedule 4 also relates to identification cards and aims to make it easier for Customs to keep its database up to date. Following commencement, the authorities that issue cards would be obliged to notify Customs inside seven days when a card expires or has been revoked. Customs will also be able to request relevant information from the issuing authority.
There are important steps in tightening security at airports and related facilities, so on that basis Labor supports them as stopgap measures. However, more broadly we do wonder if the system could not be more pre-emptive in some cases. Where issuing authorities know that a particular card is about to expire on a certain date, they should become a little bit more proactively engaged and not have to wait for the card to expire first before notifying Customs. It seems to me that the card management regime would allow you to know when a card is about to expire so that you can take intended action to ensure that it is renewed or cancelled as the case may be.
The third schedule makes minor and technical amendments to ensure that the act is compliant with the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. For example, the schedule includes a change to the definition of persons of the United States so that it is no longer confined to natural persons and a change so that the distinction between US-originating and non-US-originating goods accurately reflects the agreement. Labor supports these amendments as Australia is simply fulfilling its obligations under international agreements and treaties.
Schedule 5—and I might spend a little bit more time on this—activates the long-awaited Accredited Client Program provisions first introduced as part of the international trade modernisation amendment act in 2001. The program is supposed to provide accredited importers with a simplified system for processing consignments. The anticipated benefits for participants in the system, for Customs and for the country as a whole have changed significantly from the original proposals, though. Although they were delayed by the inability of the Minister for Justice and Customs to deliver the Customs cargo management re-engineering project on time, Labor can say it is pleased to now see the government finally dragging itself to some action. But we do have a number of criticisms of the government’s approach in this area, which I will go to shortly.
Schedule 6, in finalising the schedules themselves, will provide Customs officers with necessary protections from a number of drug related offences. The changes will mean that officers who possess or facilitate the trade of narcotic goods under approved circumstances—I should underline ‘under approved circumstances’—will be protected from criminal responsibility. This will ensure that Customs officers and their delegates can assist the Australian Federal Police with investigations and operations relating to the importation of illegal drugs. Labor supports those amendments.
Turning to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry and report, I note the report provides a brief overview of the bill and its six schedules. I will move specifically to the committee’s report on the bill itself. In examining the bill, the committee received submissions and testimony from the Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia, the Australian Customs Service, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders and the Australian Federal Police. A recurring theme in relation to Customs legislation is the lack of adequate consultation. This bill is no exception. The committee had the following to say about the process and outcome. It said the committee ‘is not satisfied’ that the consultation period ‘has encompassed all interested parties’. It said ‘in more recent times the process appears to have become fractured’.
The report cited ‘the divergence of opinion between some of the industry bodies’ as evidence of this and suggested that anticipated benefits to participants in the Accredited Client Program—the ACP, for short—were based on those that would flow to a single section of the importing community, namely ‘a select group of larger companies’ that formed part of the business partner group, and, as such, alternative models for the ACP that might deliver benefits to a wider cross-section of the diverse importing community had been overlooked.
This was not all, though. There were a variety of other circumstances of concern that the committee raised over the proposed legislation. I will deal briefly with three of those, as time does not permit me to deal with all of them, and then return to them shortly. Firstly, the committee was concerned that the bill did not contain any provisions relating to disputed payments under the ACP. It said the absence of such provisions could easily lead to unnecessary uncertainty for participating companies in the event that such a dispute arose, simply because there were no provisions available for that eventuality. Secondly, the committee noted the absence of security standards. It particularly noted that no criteria were prescribed in the Customs Act or associated regulations against which assessment and compliance could be measured. Thirdly, with regard to the removal of full monthly duty deferral from the ACP model, the committee said that new costings and valuations should be performed to fully elucidate the advantages of the ACP. I flag this issue as I intend to return to it in a moment.
Finally, after considering the bill, the committee made two main recommendations. One was to amend the changes to the unauthorised entry regime in the schedule to limit the issuance of written notice, directing a security card holder not to enter a restricted Customs area, to circumstances where an immediate criminal or security threat or emergency is present. The second was that an independent cost-benefit analysis of the Accredited Client Program be undertaken ‘which takes into account the removal of the duty deferral mechanism’.
In addition to the committee report, Labor senators expressed strong concern that changes to the Accredited Client Program represented a broken promise to industry and a missed opportunity to link enhanced security to facilitated trade. Labor’s chief concern with the bill, then, is the changes to the Accredited Client Program. That should come as no surprise to the government. This program was originally promised years ago, but the endless delays and botched implementation of the Customs cargo management re-engineering system have meant that the government has until now failed to progress the issue. In what can only be described as a half-hearted attempt to progress the Accredited Client Program, we now have this legislation before us.
This bill, insofar as it relates to the ACP, represents another broken promise by the Howard Liberal government. But, make no mistake, it is the means by which Senator Ellison will attempt to weasel his way out of a promise of a full duty deferral for participants in the program. Full duty deferral was supposed to create incentives to encourage importers to participate, primarily through two mechanisms. Firstly, it was meant to dramatically reduce the paperwork required of participating importers by bringing into place a single payment declaration, thereby reducing transaction costs for both the client and Customs. So there would be one transaction, one cost and one payment declaration. Secondly, it was meant to deliver a cash flow benefit by deferring related liabilities until the end of the month. As in any ordinary business, you could put the transaction in and defer related liabilities to the end of the month. Many businesses operate on that basis. Instead, the ACP that we have before us eliminates the cash flow benefit entirely—it has gone completely—and fails to significantly reduce the transaction costs. This is because it is a compromise model. What we found was that the government came back with a compromise model that requires payment for any given month on the 15th day of that month, which means that we now have a messy hybrid of deferred and advance payments. So liabilities incurred over the first 15 days will in effect be deferred, but those expected to be incurred for the second half of the month will be brought forward. If that sounds confusing, you should see how it is written.
When you look at how it will operate, you see it will mean that participants will have to estimate the likely value of what they expect to import. They will have to actually guess in advance what they are likely to import, then in the following month this estimate is reconciled with the actual, and any discrepancy is then settled. So every month you have a process of estimation, reconciliation and then a settlement one way or the other.
If listeners are confused, it is because of the gloss the government has put on the system. I apologise because the government is certainly not going to apologise for it. But at least I have saved listeners from the minister’s diagram. Standing orders prevent me from holding up their diagram about how it is supposed to work, but I encourage anyone to go to the EM and have a look at it, because it is confusing and it remains a very difficult process for those to operate within.
What is the effect of the withdrawal of these benefits? The effect is that only importers with incentive to participate will be left. Those which stood to profit from the alternative cost-recovery scheme—very large companies—may be the only ones. Yet again, the Howard government has failed small to medium sized businesses, while handing 20 or so big companies a trading advantage on a platter through Customs, the monopoly service provider. You have got to put it in context. Customs is a monopoly service provider in this area. There is no-one else. Businesses have to go through this process if they want to operate an importing/exporting business.
Some in industry are hoping against hope that the minister will come around. I think by now it is clear that it is too late. The government’s regulation taskforce made specific recommendations on broadening the appeal and benefits of the ACP in a report released in April last year. Yet again, however, Senator Ellison has failed to deliver. When the government finally responded to recommendation 5.54, all they did was promise to consider the matter further down the track. So here we are with the government going to implement this mishmash of a system and they have promised that they will have a look at it further down the track.
Small businesses in the trade community deserve better than this. The community deserves better than this, because the community was to enjoy the corresponding cost savings resulting from simplified process arrangements. But they too now will not be lower for Customs, which will have to provide guidance to importers in predicting their expected imports for the second half of each month. The biggest benefits behind the ACP were to flow from having trustworthy importers securing their supply chain, thereby both freeing up Customs resources and enabling it to better target the use of them. Although importers already have an incentive to do this out of their own self-interest, the purpose of the duty deferral and simplified clearance process was to provide a reward to those that complied with the higher security standards set by the government. All this is absent in the current legislation. The legislation brings not one security bonus to the community, despite the emerging international best practice of tying trade facilitation to enhanced security. What we have here is simply second rate.
Should anyone have any doubt that this represents another broken promise to the Australian trade community, they should look no further than the explanatory memorandum to the original provisions which lie dormant in the back of the Customs Act 1901. That EM promised full duty deferral. And now we have this dud. Flawed outcomes such as this are quite often the direct result of a flawed process. After all, the abandonment of duty deferral was desired by neither Customs nor the minister, who was keen to pass the buck and point out to the committee during budget estimates hearings on 25 May 2006 that the policy was in the hands not of his own department but of the Treasury. We saw the minister passing the buck to Treasury. So in a sense the only real difference between the minister and Labor on this issue is that only Labor is willing to do the hard work of fighting for the best outcome. The minister has already raised the white flag.
This minister took the original proposal, which included full duty deferral, to Treasury for costings as part of the 2004 budget process. In the absence of the full response from the government—and let me share with the Senate what we learnt about that—according to the national manager of the compliance branch of the Australian Customs Service, Treasury rejected this proposal based on their concerns about the financial impact of the program on the budget bottom line. The size of this impact was calculated to be $89 million over four years. It was explained that this cost was the result of duty payable in the month of June being deferred until July, which of course is in the subsequent financial year. Because of accounting conventions, this movement of payment from one year to the next showed up as a loss in the given year in which the liabilities were incurred. The approximate value of duty pushed from one budget to the next was roughly $20 million, or an expected $89 million over four years. A sensible and practical policy was junked because of, it seems, an estimated accounting loss—not a real loss, mind you, but a paper accounting loss, it appears. In its place Senator Ellison has accepted a more complex scheme that would have, without doubt, added to the administrative costs of both Customs and, more importantly, business.
Governments must have strict and consistent accounting practices. They cannot pick and choose which accounting conventions to abide by. When it comes to setting policy, it is patently absurd to destroy economic value and create unnecessary red tape because of the idiosyncrasies that are inevitable under any accounting regime. There is another dilemma with all of this and it can only be put to rest with the release of the Treasury’s costings, which I have been trying to get for some time but to no avail. If the information is placed in the public arena then we will all be able to look at what Treasury have had to say about it, but it appears as though there are a number of holes in the details of the costings the government have revealed to date. It is incumbent upon the government—not the opposition but the government—to fill in the puzzle and provide the detail. I am happy to extend the opportunity to government to lay all the facts on the table today but, quite frankly, I do not think they will.
Labor wholeheartedly support schedules 1, 4 and 6. The only real issue we have with this bill is schedule 5, which attempts to dud small business in the Australian trade community. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BORDER COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-06,"—The Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006 amends the Customs Act 1901 to allow the chief executive officer or a regional director for a state or territory to dispose of goods seized by Customs if the CEO or regional director is satisfied that the retention of the goods would constitute a danger to public health or safety. The bill allows a Customs officer to restrict access by holders of a security identification card to section 234AA places, ships, aircraft and wharves. The bill makes minor technical amendments to provisions implementing the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement and it allows authorised officers of Customs to request from issuing authorities updated required identity information in relation to security identification cards issued by the issuing authorities.
The bill requires issuing authorities to notify Customs when a SIC issued by the issuing authorities has expired or has been revoked. It implements an Accredited Client Program that would enable importers meeting the accreditation requirements to utilise a streamlined entry, reporting and duty payment procedure for the importation of goods. The bill confers protection from criminal responsibility for the possession, conveyance and facilitation of the conveyance of prohibited imports, prohibited exports and smuggled goods, including narcotics, on officers of Customs who engage in those acts in the course of duty and on persons who engage in those acts on instructions from officers of Customs acting in the course of duty, and it fixes a misdescribed amendment to the Customs Act.
It is unclear to me why the two customs bills which are on the legislative list for this week are not being dealt with at least consecutively and perhaps even cognately. As has been pointed out by several of those who made submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, there have been ongoing piecemeal amendments to the Customs Act, and this does little for clarity or certainty for those involved in trade. I note that this bill is now quite old and has taken a long time to come before us.
I noted the comments of the opposition shadow spokesman on the bill and the criticisms he made with respect to the government and the minister’s handling of these issues. I will be interested to hear what the minister’s response is to those criticisms in his speech in the second reading debate. For my part, I will restrict my comments on this bill to the sections which impact on the civil liberties of people entering Australia as returning citizens, tourists or migrants.
Schedule 2 raises, in its unauthorised entry coverage, civil liberties issues which are of some concern. A Customs officer, on delegation from the Collector of Customs, can exclude people from prescribed areas without providing reasons, and there is no limit to the time a person can be excluded. So if an airline has concerns about a baggage handler, although he may have a valid security identification card, which can be issued by Customs or another agency, there is the opportunity provided by this amendment to exclude him from his place of work by order of Customs, and there is no legislative provision requiring Customs to supply him with reasons. If a baggage handler is so excluded even though they have a valid SIC then it is obviously impossible for them to do their job, and if they are not given reasons for the exclusion it is impossible for them to appeal the decision. Whilst I recognise that there are circumstances when baggage handlers should be excluded, and that is quite proper in the interests of security, the inability to appeal the decision or have it reviewed should be regarded as a denial of natural justice. We should be aware, of course, that these actions can affect somebody’s ability to get a job in another place.
Another example would be where a person was found to be carrying unauthorised goods and asked for access to a lawyer or translator to assist them with the challenge with respect to those goods—perhaps a lawyer to determine what their rights and defences were or a translator to understand the charge against them. You can see that, if the amendment passes, Customs could override the valid SIC and exclude any lawyer or translator from the area. Also a lawyer who does not have a SIC could be excluded from areas by order of Customs. Those sorts of issues are not covered in the legislation or the EM and it should not be a discretionary matter for Customs officials to make decisions on these matters which are not reviewable. So I agree with the discretion; I disagree with the lack of review.
As the Bills Digest points out, under current law a variety of agencies can issue SICs to employees and visitors. The proposed amendment will tighten the exemption in section 234A(1A) and will give the Customs authorities a stronger influence over who can access certain security sensitive areas. The second layer of control proposed in this amendment is that the discretion given to the Customs officer to issue a written notice directing a person not to be in a particular area is unfettered. Unfettered discretions are discretions to be wary of.
This bill does not restrict the grounds upon which such a notice may be issued nor does it specify limits against whom such a direction may be issued. Therefore, according to the assessment in the Bills Digest, it is at least feasible that a person who ought to have access to places in which persons are held for the purpose of questioning or examination could be subject to such notices—that is, they could be excluded from the area by a Customs official, upon whom there is no requirement to provide reasons for the exclusion.
In reply to questions taken on notice, Customs argued that section 234AA areas are designated sterile areas, only to be accessed by certain people. Where the assistance of union officials or doctors was needed, such persons would be granted temporary escorted access to the area. Such an assurance may apply where you have a person who uses their discretion wisely but could be hollow in certain circumstances because it gives each and every Customs officer discretion as to whether or not they will allow someone into a designated area. It does not require them, obviously, to let the person into the area, and there is no obligation in the legislation requiring them to provide access or to provide reasons for refusing access. Either they are required by law to provide access or they are not. Discretion can be abused in such circumstances. I think that, if Customs are going to take this route, they need to monitor the application of these rules carefully over a period of time to ascertain whether in fact they work effectively and whether people are being treated unfairly in the circumstances.
I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that proposed section 234A(1B) of the bill be amended to limit the exercise of the power of the Collector of Customs to issue a written notice directing the holder of a SIC not to enter or be in or on a section 234AA place or other relevant place to circumstances where an immediate criminal or security threat or emergency is present in the section 234AA or other relevant place. In other words, they are trying to raise the discretion bar. The committee has said that, where a Customs officer perceives or fears there to be an immediate criminal or security threat or emergency, it is appropriate to exercise that discretion. Otherwise discretion should be constrained. I thought that a sound recommendation—it is one which I have included in the amendments to this legislation which I will move at the in committee stage. I hope that the committee will consider these amendments on those grounds.
There is also an argument that proposed section 234(1B) does not require the decision maker to provide reasons for their decision, nor is there a guaranteed right to be heard granted to the person who is subject to the notice. This would appear on the face of it to be an abuse of natural justice, and again I cannot agree to legislation which sets up a situation which excludes the concept of natural justice.
I have noted that Customs argued that these are decisions made ‘in real time’—that is, it is not appropriate that people be provided with reasons on the spot. Given that these provisions enable search and seizure of goods, there does need to be some reasonable natural justice mechanism and occasion for judicial review built into the legislation. Anyone who exercises real-time decisions has to give reasons. A police officer automatically gives reasons when a warrant is presented or when they have to act with regard to somebody.
Schedule 5 relates to the Accredited Client Program. It is designed, according to the Bills Digest, to simplify reporting requirements for Australian importers and exporters to improve the supply chain and to allocate more resources away from known reliable traders or low-risk cargo towards ‘areas of high risk’. The ACP has been identified as essential to secure international trade against the threat of terrorism. This is obviously a laudable and supportable aim and one which I fully support, as does my party. However, we must be very careful and wary of any unintended effects on civil liberties. This particular schedule does not impact on civil liberties; however, there are different sections of the industry, advisers to the industry and government departments that have disagreed about the consultation period and the application of the amendments. Those matters were addressed by the shadow minister.
The Business Partner Group have obviously been involved in a long consultation with government and stated as much in their submission to the inquiry. However, the Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia indicate that they have been left out in the cold somewhat. They were, therefore, surprised when these amendments were brought in. The area of concern for the Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia was deferral payments. The CBFCA submitted to the committee:
The program as foreshadowed ... is unrealistic in efficiency or effectiveness for importers in general, and service providers in particular. From the CBFCA’s perspective, consultation on key issues of the Bill with the CBFCA has been non-existent and ... the programme ... gives little, if any, benefit to the majority of importers and little cognisance of benefits to service providers.
The issues for importers which flow from a regime based on estimates and subsequent account reconciliation will include: the proposed regime does not appear to be based on a true deferral regime; the advance payment of the estimate will affect importers’ cash flow; and importers must put into place mechanisms which allow them to provide accurate estimates. Estimates are likely to be statements to Customs for the purposes of sections 243U and 243T of the Customs Act, which are strict liability offences for making false or misleading statements to Customs, which may or may not lead to a loss of duty.
The proposed regime allows importers and their delegates to join the ACP, and there is a question as to whether this is a sufficient implementation of Australia’s obligations under the World Customs Organisation framework. The Law Council of Australia submission to the committee pointed out:
... the Framework is intended [to] afford benefits to all interested parties in the supply chain (known as Authorised Economic Operators). This would extend to transport companies, customs brokers and freight forwarders. However—
under this proposed amendment—
the ACP is only limited to importers. The benefits of the ACP should be extended to all other interested parties in the supply chain who would otherwise be entitled to preferential or advantageous treatment under the frameworks.
The Law Council also noted that the ACP in its current form appears to have no security element, as is required under the WCO framework, so what the government was trying to achieve with this amendment—that is, to make international trade more secure from the threat of terrorism—does not seem to be actually achieved.
We have concerns on two fronts: firstly, the unbalanced consultation with interested parties; and, secondly, the fact that the amendment does not appear to achieve the objectives required by the WCO framework. The Democrats note that the legal and constitutional committee recommended that an independent cost-benefit analysis of the ACP be undertaken which takes into account the removal of the duty deferral mechanism from the proposed ACP. I suggest that, if that recommendation were taken up, it would be a good opportunity to consult further with interested parties and to ensure that the WCO framework objectives are achieved. I look forward to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BORDER COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-02-06,"—I want to very briefly indicate my support for the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006, and I will save the time of the Senate by not indicating the contents of the bill. They are already set out in the minister’s second reading speech, and both previous speakers have broadly indicated the purpose of this bill. I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Customs, who has been very proactive in his administration of customs legislation and particularly border compliance and other measures for this country. Senator Ellison has, over a number of years, demonstrated his very keen understanding of all of the issues and of what needs to be done. I notice Senator Murray indicated that this seemed to be a piecemeal approach to customs legislation and that there were various bills around. I simply point out that this minister has been very proactive and has dealt with issues as they have arrived. Obviously in the fluid situation that our customs arrangements are in at the moment, particularly with heightened terrorism and increasing drug trafficking, improvements are always needed, and it is a credit to the minister and to the government that as these needs are identified they are immediately addressed by legislation as required. My congratulations to the minister on bringing this bill forward and for the other work he does in the customs area, particularly in relation to border compliance.
The provisions of the bill relating to giving protection from criminal responsibility to Customs officers handling narcotic goods in the course of duty is, I think, a very important one. I chair a committee that has just been very closely looking at amphetamines and other synthetic drugs, and the evidence received by that committee presents a very frightening indictment of drug trafficking throughout the world, and of course Australia is no exception to the scourge of drug trafficking. We need to ensure that our Customs officers, who do an absolutely mighty job, are given every resource possible to help them in the fight against the importation of narcotics.
Regrettably, we in Australia, as in many other cases around the world, are losing the fight. As much as we do not like to concede it, regrettably, as I say, each week there are more and more young people and not so young people becoming involved particularly in synthetic drugs. It is something that requires the absolute commitment of the authorities, and I know our Customs officers, our Federal Police and our Crime Commission do a fabulous job in helping wherever they can to address the importation and distribution of drugs in Australia. In this, of course, they are considerably helped by the state police forces, which are really at the front line of this, but it does require a massive effort. It gets massive resources from the federal government, and this provision in this bill, small though it is, will also assist in the ongoing fight against drug trafficking and drug importation into Australia.
In this sort of legislation, as Senator Murray mentioned, there is always some challenge between civil rights and the need for the enforcement authorities to have the powers to do what needs to be done. It is always going to be a difficult call; it is always a marginal call. I think in this instance the minister has the balance correct and, while some may say that there is interference with civil liberties, by and large the bill has the right balance between giving the powers that the officers need and the civil liberties that we all enjoy in this country.
In talking about a bill that deals with border compliance, I again indicate what a fantastic job our Customs officers do. Over the parliamentary break I have been overseas and, seeing the way our Customs officers operate and making comparison with Customs officers elsewhere in the world, we cannot help but be proud of and impressed by the work that the troops on the ground do. There are plenty of them, which is always pleasing to see to travellers entering Australia. They are very courteous and very efficient in the work they do. I suspect that those of us who travel overseas always appreciate Australian Customs officers, but perhaps we do not often enough indicate to them the admiration we have for the work they do. I wanted to take the opportunity this bill presented to put on record my appreciation of the work that those front-line troops do in protecting Australia’s borders.
On the same general area, I want to again congratulate the minister and his officers on the work they are doing in the area of border compliance, particularly the fight against illegal fishing in the north and north-west of our country. Every now and again you will hear the ALP—when they are in need of a cheap shot—making some comment with regard to this issue. Cheap shots from the ALP should always of course be judged against their record in office. I well recall that when the ALP were in government they paid very scant regard to the question of illegal fishing in the north. Illegal fishing was rife in the north back in the days of the Labor government, but there was little attention paid to it because the Labor government at that time did very little about it. In fact, it was a bit of a joke at the time. Illegal immigrants used to land in Darwin and get taxis into town to get their goods. Of course all that has stopped under this government, and the minister in particular has done a mighty job in the fight against illegal fishing in the north.
The Customs marine officers who man the Customs patrol boats are very efficient. They do a mighty job in difficult circumstances, and they deserve the full support of the parliament and the people of Australia. It is always very easy to criticise, as the ALP regularly do and as irresponsible newspapers like the West Australian and irresponsible reporters like Regina Titelius do—people and papers who really have little interest in Australia’s wellbeing. The reality is that these Customs marine officers, and the government generally, are doing a fantastic job in relation to the protection of our borders from all sorts of incursions, particularly the instance I mentioned of illegal fishing. It is an issue which will eventually be won. Enormous amounts of resources are being put into it.
Another great initiative is the one I euphemistically call the prison ship, which has just started work. It is an initiative that has been a long time in coming. I remember when Mr Wilson Tuckey was the minister and he first raised that issue. At that time he was laughed out of court; everyone told him he was crazy. But, at the time, Mr Tuckey thought it was a good idea, and of course events have shown that that idea was a good one. I am pleased to see that, after a long period of introduction, the measure is now in place. Good luck to those who will serve on it. I am sure and confident that that will make another positive difference in our fight against illegal fishing. I will not hold the Senate any longer. I think the bill is sensible. It does bring in some amendments that are needed, and they are being brought in in a timely fashion. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BORDER COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-02-06,"—It  is interesting that the government seems to be concentrating quite heavily on criticising the Labor Party and the media for our perceived shortcomings. It would perhaps be rather better engaged in getting its regulation and legislation right, and I think the Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006 that is before the Senate illustrates that particularly well. I refer to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the provisions of this bill, in particular the Accredited Client Program. The export business is obviously vital to Australia. Trade in our part of the world and for our small nation is vitally important, and it is important to get it right. It is clear from the report of the committee that there is some confusion and some debate about whether there was sufficient consultation with the businesses involved and whether the bill adequately allows for proper mechanisms to support the Accredited Client Program. Given that we want to encourage and facilitate trade while ensuring that there is proper monitoring of what comes into our country, it is very clear that we need much better consideration of the way this bill implements its supposed priorities and obligations. However, I think the shadow minister has canvassed this issue fairly comprehensively.
I move:

At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:

notes the:
delay in introducing the Accredited Client Program,
waste and cost blow-outs in the associated Cargo Management Re-engineering project,
broken promise to industry regarding the abandonment of duty-deferral, and
absence of any security enhancing measures in the Accredited Client Program and
calls on the Government to conduct and publish the results of a thorough cost-benefit analysis of the Accredited Client Program, examining both the original duty deferral payment scheme and the revised payment scheme”.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-02-06,"—The Customs Legislation Amendment (Border Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2006 has a number of aspects to it and previous speakers have outlined those. It has a number of schedules dealing with various areas such as the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, the Accredited Client Program, the tightening up of security in relation to Customs controlled areas and a number of other aspects which need attention. From time to time, Customs legislation is presented in this form and we find that different areas of Customs responsibility are being dealt with. That has happened over time and it will continue to happen.
We have two bills before the Senate—we have this one and one to be debated later in the week. To answer those queries as to the timing of the bills: a decision was made that this bill needed to go before the other customs bill because of the items covered in this bill. The citizenship bill which is to follow was regarded as an important one, and so a decision was made on order of priority, if you like. But I will take on board Senator Murray’s comments in relation to trying to deal with these bills as much as possible in a cognate fashion, and I have discussed this with Customs.
But I have to make this very clear to those listening: security is a work in progress. As Senator Ian Macdonald quite rightly pointed out, we would not be doing our job if we did not address issues as they arose from time to time. And in an area of operational activity like Customs—and you just have to see the Border Security series to realise the wide area of responsibilities that Customs does have—you are going to come up with matters that need addressing in legislative amendments and, as a responsible government, we have to deal with them. As these items arise, we try to package them in a bill and deal with them together.
I appreciate the Senate’s wish to deal with these bills as cognately as possible, and that is something that we are attempting to address. But I totally reject any notion that we are in some way wrong in dealing with these as we go along and that there is some sort of oversight. It is very much the scrutiny that we carry out that has resulted in this legislative amendment. And some of that is demonstrated very clearly in the Customs controlled areas. What we are doing there is giving Customs powers which, we have recognised, need to be given to Customs in this security environment. Senator Macdonald, quite rightly, mentioned the great work that the men and women of the Australian Customs Service are doing. They cannot carry out effective border control for this country unless we, as a responsible parliament, give them the authority to do just that. And so, with this one aspect of the bill which deals with the Customs controlled area—that is, the section 234AA place, as we call it, for want of a better description—we give Customs the ability to deal with situations where people who may be entitled to be in an area because of an aviation security identification card or a visitor identification card are overstepping that boundary.
I will, for the Senate’s benefit, run through that amendment, because it is an important one. This amendment will give Customs greater control over those people who access Customs controlled areas. It is as simple as that. When you go to a port or an airport you will often see a sign on a fence which says, ‘This is a Customs controlled area,’ and various security arrangements apply, and if you breach that you are subject to prosecution—and quite rightly so. This amendment will allow a Customs officer to restrict the access of aviation security identification card holders and visitor identification card holders to Customs controlled places, ships, aircraft and wharves. The Customs Act provides for Customs to define certain places as Customs controlled areas. The act sets out the purposes under which a person may enter these areas, including for the purposes of their employment.
A security identification card does not by itself designate the holder of the card as being entitled to be in the Customs controlled area. I think that is an important point to remember. It is not necessarily a carte blanche entree into that area. An ASIC card merely indicates to Customs that the person holding the card has undergone a security clearance. Questioning of ASIC holders to determine the reason for their presence in the area may be necessary to ensure sterility of the environment. It may well be that that card holder is there for other purposes, quite different from their employment. It could be out-of-hours access which is not appropriate. So this amendment is to give Customs that authority to deal with the controlled areas that I have mentioned.
The written direction is a real-time instrument to ensure the sterility of a Customs controlled area. It can only be issued for reasons stipulated in the Customs legislation, not for purposes of other government agencies present at the airport. The direction will be issued when the Customs officer cannot establish the bona fides of the party who is the subject of the direction, and when that party cannot show legitimate cause—that is, a reason linked to their employment—for their presence in the area. And that, after all, is really common sense.
The direction will be issued by the Collector of Customs as defined in the act—that is, the officer on duty at the time of the incident. In circumstances where a passenger or crew member who has been detained by Customs is in need of assistance that is not otherwise available from Customs staff, such as that of a doctor or translator, Customs requests the provision of such assistance and provides escorted access for that person to the controlled area so that they can carry out their essential task.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its first amendment dealt with this, and it proposed that the amendment be limited to circumstances where an immediate criminal or security threat or emergency is present in a Customs controlled place. This subsection is on the power of a Collector of Customs, as I say, to issue a written notice directing the holder of a security identification card not to enter into or be on a Customs controlled place. Customs responsibilities—at airports, for example—extend well beyond criminality and aviation security. By limiting the power to immediate circumstances of criminal or aviation security threats or emergencies, Customs’ ability to ensure the sterility of the Customs controlled area for purposes of processing, examining and questioning passengers would be directly affected. That is, we need a wider power for Customs. You cannot limit it to something which may be extreme or critical at the time. It may be for the good running of the airport and in an indirect way may well affect security. But to limit it to only something which is of a critical nature or of a present and clear danger is too narrow. Customs needs that ability.
For those reasons, the government is not persuaded by that first recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I want to thank that committee for the work it has done. It does a very good job in the Senate looking at government legislation, and not infrequently we adopt the recommendations of that committee, but in this case we cannot for those operational reasons that I have outlined.
The other aspect which was mentioned by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee is the Accredited Client Program. The recommendation of the committee was that an independent cost-benefit analysis of the Accredited Client Program be undertaken to take into account the removal of the duty deferral mechanism from the proposed program. Other senators have outlined the operation of that duty deferral aspect. The government has looked at this very carefully—I have spoken to stakeholders in industry about this over a period of time—and after careful consideration the government has announced its decision that duty deferral will not comprise part of the Accredited Client Program. The fact that the program will now be less attractive to industry is understood. It is considered a poor use of public money to fund a cost-benefit analysis of the revised Accredited Client Program when the outcome is already known and, on that basis, we reject the recommendation by the Senate legal and constitutional committee.
I will give some background to the Accredited Client Program because I think that in itself does offer benefits to industry. It is an initiative offering streamlined cargo reporting requirements for highly compliant importers and exporters, thereby recognising those that do the right thing and giving them a more streamlined approach in relation to importing and exporting goods. This bill amends the Customs Act to:
... implement an Accredited Client Program that would enable importers meeting the accreditation requirements to utilise a streamlined entry, reporting and duty payment procedure for the importation of goods ...
Provisions relating to the entry and reporting of imported goods under the Accredited Client Program are already in the Customs Act. This bill inserts the provisions relating to the payment of a duty estimate and import duty on imported goods entered and reported under the program. The amendments also align the payment of processing charges associated with the Accredited Client Program with the payment of import duty. There are a number of benefits to this and it remains an attractive program for industry, notwithstanding that duty deferral has not been included in that. It was a decision government took after careful consideration.
This bill, as I say, has a number of aspects to it. I have singled out those two in particular because they were the subject of recommendations by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. There are amendments to be addressed in the committee stage, and we will deal with those in turn, but I re-emphasise that security is a work in progress and anyone who says that the government should get it right in one piece of legislation, or that we should rule a line in the sand at a point in time and say, ‘We will do no more; that is enough,’ seriously misunderstands how you deal with risks and the security environment that we find ourselves in.
I dare say, and I say with confidence, that we will have further customs bills and further bills amending all sorts of things to do with security—and so we should. Human affairs never stand still, time does not stand still and, in the area of security, I can assure everyone here that the threats we face are ever present and changing. It is for that very reason that from time to time legislative amendments will be necessary, and the fact that they are is a fact of life. The fact that we respond to them demonstrates our responsibility as a government. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-02-06,—by leave—I announce that Senator Fiona Nash has been appointed as our Whip. I am sure she will do a great job.,SENATE,<title>THE NATIONALS</title>,<title>Leadership and Office Holders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I move:

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) and the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Evans) and Senators Wong and Lundy today relating to climate change.

Over the last few weeks and in question time today we have had yet more examples of the innate political opportunism of the Howard government. We are seeing a gradual conversion for political purposes from the government as climate change sceptics to the government as pretend environmentalists. We are seeing a pale green hue suddenly being cast across the treasury bench, not because the government actually believe that climate change is an issue to be addressed but because they understand that Australians believe that climate change is an issue that needs to be tackled and they reckon they had better get onboard in time for the election. That is what all the positioning and all the announcements we have seen over the last few weeks are about and that is what the answers given today by Senator Abetz and Senator Minchin demonstrate.
There is of course a bit of resistance because we know that on the government side there are people who are deeply against a great many issues that Labor and environmentalists have been raising for some time—and we saw Senator Abetz still not being able to help himself, frothing at the mouth and calling people extremists. We also know of course that Senator Minchin is concerned about the fact that policies have been plucked out of the air. We know—and in question time today he failed when given two opportunities to indicate this—that there are real questions about the extent to which the Department of Finance and Administration was even involved in the costings associated with the great water plan that the Prime Minister announced. The spending of $10 billion of taxpayers’ money is announced, and now it appears that the government cannot provide detailed costings.
The government has come up with a range of excuses. The most recent one prior to question time was the Treasurer saying, ‘We cannot provide the details till the states have signed up.’ This of course is a nonsense. If you provide the aggregate figure, you must have some indication of what the detailed figures making up that aggregate are. More importantly, that demonstrates that this is simply another political thought bubble. It is a political mechanism to make it look as if the government is actually serious about tackling our water crisis and serious about contributing to the global challenge of tackling climate change. The government is playing catch-up politics. It has suddenly realised that the electorate believes this is a major issue and it realises it has to play catch-up.
The previous position of the government, as we know, was that they were climate change sceptics. Senator Lundy, who may well refer to this again, pointed out that Senator Abetz has previously referred to climate change in terms of its challenge to biodiversity as being:
… [an] unclear challenge which climate change may or may not pose to our biodiversity in 100 years time.
That is a pretty equivocal statement. It is hardly an unequivocal indication that you understand the long-term threat to this nation’s security and this nation’s prosperity as a result of global warming and climate change. It is hardly an unequivocal statement, but he has to run the line because the government have worked out that they have to at least turn pale green and indicate to the electorate that they actually care about these issues and are prepared to do something about them.
We also all remember—last year I think it was—the then Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who I notice has not been participating in this debate much, saying in relation to the Al Gore movie, which was an important and significant international prompter of global consciousness around environmental issues and in particular climate change, that it was ‘good entertainment and nothing else’. That is really indicative of what lies at the heart of the thinking of those on the government benches. Many of them share these views; they simply know that they have to respond politically.
The Prime Minister is a very clever politician, and the water fund is a clever announcement, but it is not an announcement that has been well considered previously—nor have the costings been carefully considered. This is a political fix that the government has put in place. It may well be worthy, but the fact that the costings were ill prepared demonstrates that the government has come late to the party.
I also want to comment briefly, in the time remaining, on the Prime Minister now softening his position in relation to an emissions trading regime. We saw the Prime Minister yesterday say:
No, I think we have to examine carbon pricing.
It is a very great step from the harsh words that other government ministers have uttered previously—and, may I say, quite different from the position that Senator Minchin took today. The reality is that the Prime Minister is softening his position in relation to emissions trading, not because he believes in it but because he thinks he has to. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2007-02-06,"—Senator Wong is perpetuating the old ALP line that the government has been slow to respond to climate change, but that is not the case. It is obvious to us all, I think, that climate change is around us: there has been a great decrease in the rainfall in the south-west; we have heard that there are water restrictions in countries like the UK; and there was no snow in Europe, I am told, this winter, in places like Austria and Germany. But it is quite wrong to say that the government has not been aware that climate change is an issue. In fact, far from being laggard, this government has very much led the way. For example, it was the first government in the world to establish a greenhouse office, and that happened way back in 1996. So, Senator Wong, this government has been aware of and has been taking action on climate change for a very long time.
There is a question as to whether climate change is related to some cyclical phenomenon, such as a change in the earth’s orbit in relation to the sun. We are supposedly coming out of an ice age and perhaps that is the reason climate change seems to be occurring. There is a lot of evidence that this change in the earth’s temperature is something that has gone on over many thousands of years in a cyclical manner. But there was a United Nations report at the end of last week which suggests that climate change is caused by man. That is very interesting, but it does not mean that the Howard government’s policies are out of step with that, as Senator Wong suggests.
In fact, the Australian government are leading the way, in many ways, in dealing with climate change. We signed the Kyoto protocol but we have not ratified it for the simple reason that it does very little to address climate change problems because the big emitters of the world are not signatories to that treaty. But, as an alternative, the Australian government have led the way in seeking to set up what is known as the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This partnership brings together some key countries, including Australia, China, Korea, Japan and the United States, to explore ways to develop, deploy and transfer to cleaner and more efficient technologies which the world will need to make the required cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of this partnership is clear when you consider that between them these six partners account for almost half of the world’s population, GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
So, far from being laggard, the Australian government has been very much a leader, through setting up this Asia-Pacific partnership. Distinctive features of the partnership include the way it seeks to address climate change, air pollution, energy security and sustainable development in an integrated manner, and the way in which it fully engages business in developing and implementing solutions. Importantly, the partnership does not replace the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the Kyoto protocol, but will instead develop those programs by being more inclusive of some of the great greenhouse gas emitters of the world.
Senator Wong suggested that the $10 billion the Prime Minister has allocated to the water management proposal, including the Murray-Darling proposal, is a drop in the bucket, so to speak, and certainly does not represent any clear commitment on the government’s part to managing Australia’s water problems. I think that is a nonsensical comment for Senator Wong to have made. When you think about it, Australia is the driest continent on earth, and it is about time we had a national water management policy. The ALP, while it was in government for 13 years, did not establish such a national policy, and now we have the Howard government giving strong leadership to this country in establishing a national water management policy. The commitment of $10 billion, I think, is proof positive of the government’s absolute belief in that policy. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-02-06,"—The United Nations climate change report released on 3 February this year removes forever the option of denial of and inaction on climate change. The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has reaffirmed what the Howard government has known since 1996 and certainly has failed to act on—that is, climate change is real. It will hurt our economy, our environment and our children’s future. That is why we need to take urgent action now to drastically cut greenhouse gas pollution.
As I said, the alarm bells have been ringing for a very long time, but now they are clamouring, and what we have is a very clever politician of a Prime Minister thinking, ‘How can I give the impression that I’m going to do something about it?’ The 2007 IPCC report reinforces what Mr Howard has been told previously. All of the information that has come out—whether it is the 2005 Climate change: risk and vulnerability report, the 2006 Stern report, the 2003 report Climate change: an Australian guide to the science and potential impacts, two other IPCC reports in 1995 and 2001 or, of course, An Inconvenient Truth, the film by Al Gore—has brought a consciousness of climate change crashing through not only the Australian community but also, finally, the Howard government.
But in true form, because this is not a government with an eye to the future or with a vision or a plan, they are coming up with knee-jerk reactions. They cannot even sing from the same song sheet. We have had contradictions here today from the Prime Minister’s recorded statement alluding to the fact that they were going to move on emissions trading. To that there was almost a flat denial from Senator Minchin today, saying how damaging that would be to jobs and the economy et cetera. So not even the ducks are lined up on the government side. They cannot get their message straight or their costings in order. As usual they are relying on spin, smoke and mirrors to try to trick the Australian people once again into thinking that they have their eye on the future, when they do not and we all know that they do not. We have 10 years of evidence that they do not have their eye on the future.
I was amazed to hear Senator Abetz today, in response to a question that I asked, stand by his previous comments that in fact weeds did pose a greater threat to Australia’s biodiversity. I would like to table the speech that Senator Abetz referenced in his answer to me and the accompanying press release, which not only show that I did not verbal him but have those quotes that I referenced in black and white. I seek leave to table those documents.
Leave not granted.
—We know where to find those speeches, Mr Deputy President. It is pretty poor form on behalf of government senators, because I was quoting Senator Abetz in making those comments. That is the problem for this government. They have an inconsistent message. They have all the spin out there, with the Prime Minister talking the talk and announcing his big water initiative, but when push comes to shove they just do not believe it. They are sceptics to the core, and Australians will pay the price forever. People are fearful of the severe weather events that have been occurring, the horrific drought. Along the Great Barrier Reef—one of the earth’s greatest natural amazing icons—the bleaching event that occurred in 2005 was very serious. I know that in 2006 it was only averted by Cyclone Larry. What happens if that keeps occurring?
I note Senator Ian Macdonald laughs. That is not an appropriate response to the genuine concern out there about people’s day-to-day lives and the impact of climate change and the fact that water is part of that issue no matter how often the Howard government try to pretend that they can act on water and continue to ignore climate change. It is offensive that they keep throwing up nuclear energy as an option, as somehow an answer to the increase of greenhouse gases, when we know through the report that was released by the Howard government that in fact emissions will increase by 29 per cent if those 25 nuclear power plants are developed in accordance with the ideas that the Prime Minister is putting around. So there is hypocrisy, and misleading information going out there, and a concerted attempt by a very clever and tricky politician to con us. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-02-06,"—I suggest Senator Lundy, with all due respect, stick to the written script done for her by a staffer and not start adlibbing in these sorts of debates because she gets herself really tied up in contradictions and confusion when she starts—
—Don’t be so condescending, you rude man!
—I am sorry, Senator Lundy, but you are suggesting Cyclone Larry stopped the climate change in North Queensland.
—It stopped the bleaching event, as you know. You know that for a fact.
—No wonder I was laughing. I was laughing at you and your ridiculous propositions and not at the issue of climate change. Senator Lundy again misrepresents the answers to questions in the Senate today. It is quite clear that the coalition have not had any sort of conversion. As Senator Eggleston rightly pointed out, right back in 1996 we established the first greenhouse office in any government anywhere in the world. Labor did not have one when we took over. The coalition have been conscious of this issue and working towards addressing greenhouse gas emissions since our very first day in office under the direction of Senator Hill, quite a significant and very far-sighted environment minister at the time.
Over the 10½ years since, this government has taken a great number of initiatives to help address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change problems. No one single solution is available for the problem of climate change. Quite clearly, the major thing that has to happen in the world, Senator Lundy, is for the big emitters—that is, the United States, China and India—to come on board. So far they have not, although, as an initiative that Senator Ian Campbell was very much involved in, these big emitters are now very seriously engaged in the question of greenhouse gas emissions.
The solution of the Labor Party has been for several years now to simply sign the Kyoto agreement and that will fix climate change. It might be an easy solution for the Labor Party but it will have no impact at all on greenhouse gas emissions because the big emitters are not parties to the Kyoto agreement. Australia attended the initial conferences and agreed to do things, and we have met the targets that were given to us by Kyoto. But simply signing a piece of paper will not help greenhouse gas emissions. You have to get the big emitters involved—China, India and the United States—and our government has been attempting to do that. So there is not just one answer; there has to be a suite of answers. That is one of them: reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In relation to alternative energy that does not require fossil fuels, this government has spent enormous amounts of money. Just before Christmas the Treasurer, Peter Costello, launched an alternative power plant in Mildura with a huge contribution—$1 billion, I think it was, though I do not have the figure before me. It was a huge Commonwealth government contribution to that power plant. As well as that, we have had any number of initiatives to assist with wind power, solar power and hot rocks power.
And, of course, we are looking very seriously at uranium and nuclear energy. I am not quite sure what the position of the Labor Party is today. Some of the Labor Party bury their heads in the sand and say that this is no good and that we cannot have it. Other more sensible members of the Labor Party are looking at that a bit more seriously because they realise that nuclear not only is effective power but also has some greenhouse gas advantages. I always smile when the Labor Party raise issues like how good the UK and the European Union are with their greenhouse gas emissions. They should realise that in places like Russia 70 per cent of their power comes from nuclear energy. They do not have a lot of greenhouse gas emissions because most of their power comes from nuclear energy.
There are a number of other issues I would like to raise but time is going to beat me yet again. The Murray-Darling Basin was mentioned. Senator Lundy, if you had sat on the ministerial council of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission as I had and seen the fights between Queensland and New South Wales, between New South Wales and Victoria and between South Australia and everyone else then you would understand that trying to get the states to agree just does not work.

",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, in question time today. Senator Abetz is on record, as I believe most government members are, and certainly Senator Ian Macdonald has just reinforced this, denying the real challenges that face us on climate change. Senator Abetz proposes the:
... unclear challenge which climate change may or may not pose to our biodiversity in 100 years time.
Again in question time today he appeared confused and unclear. Senator Abetz needs to learn a new step: the Prime Minister has now changed his rhetoric from strident sceptic of the effects and challenges of climate change following the release of the report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in which the environmental threats are well documented. It is clear to all that climate change is an environmental challenge—it is an economic challenge. This report follows the release in December 2006 of the State of the environment report for 2006, which confirms that under this government Australia’s greenhouse emissions continue to rise and our vital waterways are deteriorating. The report confirmed climate change is hurting Australia and that greenhouse pollution continues to soar under the Howard government. We have also had the 2005 report of the Australian Greenhouse Office, Climate change: risks and vulnerability. Labor’s concerns were further borne out by the Stern report, which urges governments to act decisively. Many other reports produce the same evidence.
The Prime Minister dropped the ball on climate change—indeed, he never really picked it up until now when all the available evidence cannot be disputed by simple dismissive rhetoric. And this government still has no answers and no plan. National leadership is needed here. It is critical to Australia’s future prosperity, and all we have seen from this government has been 10 long years of delaying tactics, 10 long years of no action on greenhouse emissions, 10 long years of denying the challenges we need to address.
In 2004 we saw firsthand the lack of government commitment to a climate change strategy when it again failed to act. Of course, I am speaking about the federal mandatory renewable energy target, MRET, which was a small target and the government refused to extend it. On that occasion we saw the failure of Tasmanian Liberal senators to stand up for what was a critical decision for Tasmania—support for the Tasmanian renewable energy sector. At that time it was predicted the failure of the Howard government to act could lead to loss of the Vestas Narcelle wind turbine blade plant in north-west Tasmania. The federal government failed to enhance the MRET, despite its own review panel recommending an increase. Unfortunately, this lack of government support for renewable energy saw Vestas, as predicted, close down with the loss of 100 Tasmanian jobs.
In Senator Abetz’s home state of Tasmania we have seen the state government, through Minister Llewellyn’s department, release Tasmania’s draft climate change strategy. It received more than 110 public submissions. Recent CSIRO projections for Tasmania indicate rises in minimum temperatures in particular, more westerly winds and reduced rainfall in eastern areas. Tasmania can also expect ongoing rises in sea levels. Minister Llewellyn acknowledged:
... the need to work hard to play our part in the international response to climate change ...
The state government has proposed that one part of the climate change strategy will be to maintain Tasmania’s already low greenhouse gas emissions, based largely on renewable and clean energy from hydro and wind, which supply virtually all Tasmania’s energy needs. The minister has said:
... a major greenhouse response is being left undone: that is a change of policy and attitude by the Federal Government to encourage renewable energy across the nation.
Tasmanians see climate change as a major challenge for Tasmania. It is unfortunate that Tasmania’s only federal minister does not seem to.
Federal Labor have positive policies needed to secure Australia’s economic and social long-term future. A Labor government will address climate change by immediately ratifying the Kyoto protocol, cutting Australia’s greenhouse pollution by 60 per cent by 2050, setting up a national emissions trading scheme and substantially increasing the mandatory renewable energy target. Federal Labor are serious about climate change. That is why we will also convene a national climate change summit. The challenge on climate change is one for all of us; however, that challenge can be met only by providing strong and committed leadership at the federal level, and this government is not up to the task.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2007-02-06,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the deaths of two former ministers: (a) on 25 December 2006, of the Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton, a senator for the state of New South Wales from 1965 to 1978; and (b) on 12 January 2007, of the Hon. Sir Denis James Killen AC, KCMG, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Moreton, Queensland, from 1955 to 1983. I call the Leader of the Government in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, AO</title>",Condolences,8,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2007-02-06,"—by leave—I move:

That the Senate records its deep regret at the death of the Honourable Sir Robert Carrington Cotton, KCMG, AO, former federal minister, senator for New South Wales and Ambassador to the United States of America, and of the Honourable Sir Denis James Killen, AC, KCMG, former federal minister and member for Moreton, Queensland, and places on record its appreciation of their long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement.

Robert Cotton was born on 29 November 1915 at Broken Hill, the eldest of six children. He was educated at St Peter’s College in Adelaide—where my oldest son was educated—and went on to qualify as an accountant before entering into business with his father. In 1937 he married his childhood sweetheart, Eve, who remained his constant companion until her passing in 2000. During World War II, Bob Cotton trained as an RAAF bomber pilot. He was later seconded to the Department of Supply, first in Melbourne and then in Oberon in New South Wales. His family built successful regional business interests and established the pastoral property Carrington Park.
Robert Cotton was a foundation member of the Liberal Party and, in the first chapter of his political life, he ran against the then Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, in the seat of Macquarie in 1947 and again in 1951. He later held a range of senior positions in the Liberal Party, including federal vice-president. Between 1947 and 1950 he also served as a councillor and president of the Oberon Shire Council. He was a strong and influential member of our great party, the Liberal Party.
After filling the vacancy created by the legendary Sir William Spooner, Bob Cotton entered the Senate. He was the first senator to receive more than one million votes. Bob Cotton was appointed as a senator for New South Wales in 1966 and held that position until 1978. He served in the shadow ministry and then as a minister under three Liberal prime ministers. He was appointed Minister for Civil Aviation in the Gorton and McMahon governments and, in the Fraser government, he served as Minister for Manufacturing Industries, Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs and Minister for Industry and Commerce. He was the Government Whip in the Senate in 1968 and 1969 and Deputy Leader of the Government between 1976 and 1978, when he left the Senate. He also served on a number of Senate committees. He was a very active participant in the work of the Senate. He once said: ‘I don’t believe in government by vested interests. You exist to serve the public interest of the greatest number of people.’ Fine sentiments, indeed.
Personally, I had great respect for Sir Robert Cotton. We shared a number of common interests, particularly across the industry portfolio, and leadership positions in this chamber, and of course there was our active involvement in the Liberal Party organisation. Indeed, when I was the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, I did consult him from time to time on industry matters. He was a very senior Liberal whom I personally greatly admired. I think his political views were uniquely shaped by his upbringing in Broken Hill, and it is remarkable how many great Australians were brought up in Broken Hill. His knowledge and experience were well suited to the industry portfolio. He also had a very keen interest in the economy generally and in the important relationship that it has to industry productivity. He was a pretty popular senator. I am advised that he once moved a motion on the national significance of the lamington, and I am sure he did it in all great seriousness.
On retirement from representative political life in 1978, he was made a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. As Senator Evans and I were remarking, those were the good old days when those things happened. He was properly recognised with a knighthood for his long service to public life in this country. That year he was appointed consul general to New York, where another good friend of mine, John Olsen, is currently serving so well, and with his business background and enthusiasm Sir Robert helped to boost Australia’s profile among financial and investment houses in the United States.
When he came back from working in New York, he served as a director on the Reserve Bank of Australia board and then, because of his success in New York, he was appointed in 1982 to the very significant position of our ambassador to the United States. I think it is noteworthy that, although obviously he was appointed by the Fraser government, the Hawke government quite properly kept him on as ambassador. There was a bipartisan view that Sir Robert was a very good ambassador for Australia in probably our most significant post, that of ambassador to the US. In 1993 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his service to international relations.
In later life Sir Robert married again, to Betty Krummel, and pursued photography, holding exhibitions in the US and Australia, including a joint exhibition in Sydney in 2005 with his daughter Judy, who is a painter and writer. He took a real hands-on approach to life. He was a strong advocate of the role that government can play in developing stronger communities. Bob was a very great Liberal and a great Australian, so on behalf of the government I offer condolences to his wife, Lady Cotton, his children, his stepchildren and his extended family.
Mr Deputy President, your fellow Queenslander James Killen was born on 23 November 1925 in Dalby, Queensland. He left school at an early age to become a jackaroo. In 1943, at the age of 18, he joined the RAAF, reaching the rank of flight sergeant air gunner. After the war he completed a diploma course and became a wool classer. In 1949 he married Joy, a union that lasted until her passing in 2000—coincidentally, the same year as Sir Robert Cotton’s wife passed away. After joining the Liberal Party in 1946, just after its founding, Jim Killen became the Foundation President of the Young Liberal Movement of Queensland, an important development for the party in Queensland that was to shape the political careers of future ministers. He was also a member of the state executive of the Liberal Party, and from 1953 to 1956 he served as Vice-President of the Queensland Liberal Party.
Jim was first elected to federal parliament in 1955, at the age of 29, as the member for Moreton in Queensland. He represented that electorate for 28 years until his resignation in August of 1983. He served as Minister for the Navy in the Gorton government, from 1969 to 1971; Minister for Defence for virtually the whole of the Fraser government’s term, from 1975 to 1982; and Vice-President of the Executive Council—a position I now occupy—and Leader of the House, between 1982 and 1983. He was Government Whip in the House of Representatives in 1967 and served on a number of House and joint committees. In 1982 he was also made a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George for his services to the Parliament of Australia. In 2004 Sir James was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Australia for distinguished contributions to public life as a federal parliamentarian, barrister, author, orator and advocate for social justice and the rights of underprivileged members of the community.
Few members of this place have enjoyed such affection from both sides of political life. It was because of his larger than life approach, his wit, his warmth, his no-nonsense approach and his great oratory. He was of course a renowned raconteur and storyteller. He was a quite remarkable Australian figure.
He also married again in later life, to Benise Atherton, and continued to have many interests in life, particularly his love of horse racing, and he and Andrew Peacock shared many times together at the horses. He was never happier, I am advised, than at Eagle Farm, laying a bet and watching his horses run. On behalf of the government, I do offer sincere condolences to his wife, Lady Killen, his daughters, Diana and Heather, his grandchildren, Dana and Amanda, and his extended family.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-02-06,"—On behalf of the Labor opposition, I would like to support the motion of condolence moved by Senator Minchin following the recent deaths of Sir Robert Cotton and Sir James Killen. On behalf of all Labor senators, I would like to recognise the distinguished public service of both Sir Robert and Sir James and to send our sincere condolences to their families and friends.
Robert Cotton was born in Broken Hill in November 1915 and educated at St Peter’s College in Adelaide. He went into business with his father during the Depression and qualified as an accountant. During the Second World War he trained as a bomber pilot with the RAAF before being seconded to the Department of Supply in Melbourne. He was sent with his family to establish a timber firm in New South Wales that was charged with the supply of timber to the mines of Broken Hill. He continued his work after the war, developing the business into a significant regional enterprise. At the same time he and his wife, the late Lady Cotton, established a mixed farming business.
As Senator Minchin pointed out, Sir Robert was a foundation member of the Liberal Party of Australia and was very active inside the party organisation. He ran for the New South Wales seat of Macquarie against the then Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley. I am happy to say that he lost on that occasion. In August 1965 Sir Robert went one better than winning a seat of the House of Representatives and was chosen under section 15 of the Constitution to fill a casual vacancy following the resignation of the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, Sir William Spooner. Sir Robert was to remain in the Senate until his resignation in 1978.
Even in his early days in the Senate he enjoyed considerable influence in the Liberal-Country Party government. Following the death of Prime Minister Holt he was instrumental in defeating internal moves to have Jack McEwen remain as Prime Minister and amalgamate the Liberal and Country parties—a proposition that did not go well in Queensland again recently. They do not seem to learn from history.
His considerable ability was reflected in the range of ministerial, party and parliamentary positions he held during his 13 years in parliament. He had a good grounding as Senate Government Whip in early 1968, and his ministerial career began in November of 1969 when he became Minister for Civil Aviation, a position he held for a little over three years, until the fall of the McMahon government.
In opposition from 1972 until 1974 he served as the opposition spokesperson on the Postmaster-General’s Department, and on work, services and property. In June 1974 he took on responsibility as shadow minister for the manufacturing industry, a portfolio which later included industrial development. During the period of the Fraser caretaker ministry, Sir Robert served as Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs and from December 1975 he was Minister for Industry and Commerce. He also served as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate.
Sir Robert Cotton served on a number of Senate committees. He was a member and later Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Offshore Petroleum Resources, which was an influential committee at a time when the Senate was asserting itself and defining its role through its committee activities. These inquiries helped lay the groundwork for the establishment of the formal standing committee system of today.
Sir Robert resigned from the Senate in July 1978 and took up the first of two significant diplomatic postings as consul general in New York. In his three years as Australia’s representative in New York he worked to promote Australian interests and business with the financial and investment community and developed strong US links. In 1981 he returned to Australia and was appointed to the board of the Reserve Bank. A year later, in 1982, he and Lady Cotton returned to the US, where Sir Robert took up the position of Australian ambassador in Washington. The respect he enjoyed across party lines was reflected in the fact that he remained in that key diplomatic post for the first two years of the Hawke Labor government. He and Lady Cotton returned to Australia in 1985.
In 1992 Sir Robert became Chairman of the Australian Photonics Cooperative Research Centre. In addition, he was deeply involved in the establishment of the Australian Centre for American Studies at the University of Sydney and was for 10 years Chairman of the Australian Political Exchange Council. He also served as Chair of the National Gallery Foundation Board. Sir Robert was knighted in 1978 and was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1993. He received an honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Sydney in 1995.
In retirement he continued to pursue his love of photography and held a joint exhibition with his daughter, Judy, in Sydney in 2005. Sir Robert’s first wife, Eve, passed away in 2000 and in 2003 he married Betty Krummel. Sir Robert passed away on Christmas Eve last year. On behalf of all opposition senators I send our sincere condolences to Sir Robert’s wife and family. He was clearly a very significant political figure in Australia’s history, a very significant Liberal, and someone who enjoyed wide respect on both sides of the parliament.
I would also like to make some remarks about the sad death of Sir James Killen, probably one of the most famous political figures in Australian public life. Sir James Killen was born in Dalby in Queensland in 1925. As a teenager he worked as a jackaroo on Portland Downs station and in 1943, at the age of 18, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force. He was discharged from the Air Force in October 1945 at the rank of flight sergeant air gunner. I suspect his irreverent nature made rising higher in the Air Force a bit problematic, if his later career is anything to go by.

Senator Minchin interjecting—

—Yes, as Senator Minchin points out, he then became Minister for Defence, so I am not sure how that would have gone down. After the war he returned to the bush and completed a Diploma of Sheep and Wool. In 1949 he married Joyce Buley.
James Killen was involved with the Liberal Party from a very early age. He was Foundation President of the Young Liberal Movement of Queensland in 1949—so he does have a bit to answer for!—and was also a member of his party’s state executive. From 1953 until 1956 he was Vice-President of the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party. In 1955, at the very tender age of 29, he was elected to the seat of Moreton, beating his ALP opponent by a little over 2,000 votes. He then retained his seat at 11 subsequent elections, famously winning by just 130 votes in 1961.
Sir James was known as a strident anticommunist. In his first speech to the parliament in 1956 he addressed his considerable rhetorical skill to a scathing critique of the then Soviet Union. During his time in parliament Sir James also worked to complete a degree in law. However, it was some years before he gained his first ministerial position. Sir James was made Minister for the Navy by Prime Minister Gorton in November 1969 and held the post until William McMahon became Prime Minister in 1971.
In opposition between 1972 and 1975 he served first as shadow minister for education and later held the shadow Defence portfolio. It is probably for his time as Minister for Defence in the Fraser government that Sir James is best known. He held that position for nearly seven years, which made him one of Australia’s longest serving defence ministers. In his time as minister he oversaw much of the work to establish the Australian Defence Force Academy as well as the development of the joint operational doctrine. Sir James moved from the Defence portfolio in 1982 and for the last 10 months of the Fraser government served as Leader of the House and Vice-President of the Executive Council. He resigned from parliament in August 1983.
In addition to his long service as Minister for Defence, Sir James was well known for his distinctive personal style. He was formidable in debate and his famous wit and rhetorical skill helped him to thrive in the environment of parliament and to leave such an enduring impression on Australian public life. Sir James was a committed conservative, but his beliefs did not isolate him from those who did not share his political views. He is fondly remembered by many from across the political spectrum. He had close friends from all sides of politics.
The guests at his 80th birthday celebration in 2005 included Barry Jones and the late Don Chipp, with whom he had served as a minister before Chipp left the Liberal Party to lead the Australian Democrats. He was also very close to Fred Daly and Gough Whitlam. I think it is fair to say that all of the political figures I have mentioned could not be described as ‘white bread politicians’, as some of us are so unfairly described these days; all of them are characters. His friendship with Gough Whitlam continued, and I understand they spoke on the phone on nearly a weekly basis. When in parliament, the two were known to pass to each other across the chamber notes peppered with classical references.
At the request of the Killen family, Gough Whitlam read the eulogy at Sir James’s state funeral service on 19 January in Brisbane. Whitlam spoke of Sir James’s love of the parliament, saying:
In his career, parliament was as significant as the ministerial offices he held with distinction. His influence, his abiding interest in the great affairs of our country, his fascination with the intricate interplay of the political machinery, his knowledge of and respect for the Constitution all came from his love of parliament.
Outside parliament, Sir James was passionate about horse racing. He made the headlines in 1981 when he argued for the Queensland Turf Club to relax its restrictions on female members, saying that the club’s refusal to do so would amount to ‘an exquisite form of absurdity’.
He had a great love of words, literature and reading. His distinctive rhetorical style was said to have been influenced by Sheridan and Edmund Burke. Sir James was knighted in 1982 and made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2004. He continued to practise law during his retirement in Brisbane. Sir James’s first wife, Lady Joy, passed away in 2000 and Sir James himself passed away on 12 January this year. He is survived by his second wife, Lady Benise Killen, his daughters, Diana and Heather, and his grandchildren. On behalf of all Labor senators, I would like to offer to Lady Killen and his family our most sincere condolences on the loss of a most remarkable Australian—someone who provided great service to this country and to Australian public life. Labor senators all regret his passing.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, AO</title>",Condolences,8,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-02-06,"—I join Senator Minchin and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in supporting the condolence motion for Sir Robert Cotton and Sir James Killen. I never knew Sir Robert Cotton, but I did know Sir James Killen very well as a former minister in the Fraser government and the conservative governments before that. He was a member of the Tattersalls Club and was seen at the racecourse. He was very up-front around Queensland. We have lost a great political character in Sir James Killen.
He was 29 when he was first elected to parliament as the Liberal member for Moreton in 1955. He was a great speaker, a great debater and a great practical joker. In 1961, one of his most famous quotes was that former Prime Minister Menzies sent him a telegram saying that he was ‘magnificent’ to hold the government at the time. His particular seat, which he won by 130 votes or so in 1961, held the government together by a very slim majority of one. During the 1950s and 1960s, Sir James Killen spoke frequently in the House and was well known for his wit and his oratory. While a member of the House of Representatives, he studied for his law degree and graduated in 1964, and immediately started building a criminal law practice. He actually continued that practice while he was a member of parliament.
Sir James Killen was commissioned as Minister for the Navy in 1969 and took a strong interest in the conditions of ordinary sailors. He was noted as saying that his years as Minister for Defence were an honour but a heavy burden. He was appointed shadow minister for defence in 1975. One of his more famous quotes was: ‘We would not be able to protect Botany Bay against the enemy on a hot Sunday afternoon.’ Sir James Killen got the opportunity to do something about it when he was commissioned as Minister for Defence in the Fraser government, in November. He prepared Australia’s white paper on defence and was the minister responsible for buying the FA18s. He was also responsible for setting up the Australian Defence Force Academy after a long argument with Public Works. These are all important achievements, but Sir James will be remembered above all as a great parliamentarian with a larrikin streak. Today I would also like to offer, on behalf of my colleagues in the National Party, our sincere condolences to the widow, family and friends of Sir Robert Cotton.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, AO</title>",Condolences,8,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-02-06,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I would like to support the condolence motion on the death of Sir James Killen on 12 January this year. On behalf of the Democrats, I would also like to express our sincere sympathy to his family and in particular to his wife, Benise, surviving children, Diana and Heather, and grandchildren, Dana and Amanda. I did not know Sir James personally, but I did hear him speak on numerous occasions—on the radio mostly. It is clear from the recollections of the many people who did know him that he was a man of some talent who is remembered for his sense of humour, fair play and, of course, skill as a public speaker.
I am sure all present would agree that Sir James’s parliamentary career was a long and distinguished one. He came from a tough childhood in Queensland and was well prepared to take on all comers in the political arena—and by all accounts that is just what he did. As many will know, Sir James entered federal parliament in 1955. During his 28 years in the parliament he spoke passionately on the issues he felt strongly about and, indeed, crossed the floor to vote with the opposition on a number of occasions.
Sir James served as Minister for the Navy from 1969 to 1971 and as Minister for Defence from 1975 to 1982. As one of Australia’s longest serving defence ministers, he oversaw the first defence white paper, but he is perhaps best remembered by the public for his comment, which Senator Boswell just mentioned, that the military forces were so run down they would have trouble defending Bondi Beach on a hot Sunday afternoon. As a solution to this, Sir James set up the Australian Defence Force Academy—one of his lasting achievements. But it was during his time as a federal backbencher back in the fifties that Sir James witnessed a series of nuclear tests at Maralinga in South Australia and subsequently became a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons and nuclear conflict. As recently as 2003, Sir James called for all political leaders to avoid nuclear war at all costs.
Although Sir James retired from parliament in 1983, he retained a very strong interest in politics and even attempted a political comeback in 1998—reportedly to try to topple Pauline Hanson. However, he lost preselection, so we will never know how Sir James, who has been described as one of Australia’s most colourful politicians, would have slotted into the modern Liberal Party.
It is a mark of the contribution that Sir James made to this country that he was knighted in 1982 and in 2004 was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia, in part for his advocacy for the rights of the underprivileged. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja had a number of enjoyable dealings with Sir Jim Killen, including at the Constitutional Convention in 1998 and, she says, more light-hearted ones on Good News Week on the ABC. Sir James will long be remembered in the parliament and at large for his very many contributions to public life.
On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I would also like to support the condolence motion on the death of Sir Robert Cotton on 25 December 2006. I place on record our acknowledgement of his long and meritorious public service and express our most sincere sympathy to his family. As many will know, Sir Robert was a foundation member of the Liberal Party and held many party positions before he entered the Senate in 1966.
From all accounts Sir Robert’s experiences during the Depression and World War II shaped his political beliefs and commitment to bettering the nation. He once said: ‘I don’t believe in government by vested interest. You exist to serve the public interest of the greatest number of people.’ He reportedly strongly supported the view that from time to time governments have to intervene, as market forces alone cannot be relied on to deliver individual and social justice. Sir Robert also believed that federal-state relations were unfinished business. Indeed, that is still so today, as disputes on water, greenhouse emissions, education and health demonstrate.
Sir Robert served as Minister for Civil Aviation from 1969 to 1972 and Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1975 to 1977, retiring from parliament in 1978. Sir Robert’s love of meat pies was well known, as was his great respect for the national significance of the lamington. Following his retirement from parliament Sir Robert continued to contribute to public life. He was appointed consul general to New York for several years, and served on the Reserve Bank board before being appointed Australian ambassador in Washington in 1982. Sir Robert’s ability to work with those on both sides of politics was demonstrated by the fact that, although he was appointed ambassador by the Fraser government, he was kept on by the Hawke government when they won office in 1983.
During his time in the United States, Sir Robert was influential in persuading the US to abstain from the 1984 vote on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty rather than vote against it. Upon his return to Australia, Sir Robert pursued photography and held exhibitions in the United States and Australia. He also undertook several board positions and chaired an inquiry into the Australian Medical Association. His contribution to government and his country were marked by his knighthood and subsequent receipt of the Order of Australia in 1993. Again, on behalf of the Democrats I extend my sympathy and condolences to his family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-02-06,"—I join in this motion of condolence in relation to the recent deaths of the Hon. Sir Denis James Killen AC, KCMG and the Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, AO. In particular, I wish to make some personal remarks in relation to Sir Robert Cotton, who was most aptly described by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin, at the conclusion of his remarks as a ‘very great Liberal and a great Australian’. He was indeed both of those.
Sir Robert served as a senator for New South Wales from 1966 to 1978, and it is fair to say that those of us in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party who benefited from Sir Robert’s influence had a great deal to learn from him. He was a man for whom I had enormous respect and great admiration. As—then, at least, if not now—a younger member of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party and a very active member of its Young Liberal Movement, and even later in my current role as a senator for New South Wales, I was and will always be grateful for his mentorship and his support, which he went out of his way to give young people in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, for his interest and even for his very valued attendance at functions and events. It may be that that attendance had more to do with the meat pies and lamingtons to which Senator Allison referred than I had previously realised, but it was very much valued at the time for his company and his wisdom and support.
I speak not just for myself—and I think it is important to note that. I know many of my friends and colleagues who have come through the New South Wales division in the same way, most particularly my very good friend John Brogden, were beneficiaries of Sir Robert’s guidance. They would wish to join with me in this motion of condolence.
In his capacity as a member of the Australian Political Exchange Committee for a decade, I believe, he also played a very great role in the development of Australia’s political relations between parliaments and political parties, most particularly in the region and with the United States of course, given his experience. He regarded the work of the Australian Political Exchange Committee as a very important part of the work of political parties in this country and more broadly and he made a very significant mark in that regard.
I remember very many years ago being taken by my late father to Oberon to visit the Cotton family business. I met Sir Robert’s brother, Monty, and learnt a great deal more about that particular side of their business activities in New South Wales, which gave me another insight into the experiences and contribution to this nation of the Cotton family.
For those of us who developed important personal relationships with Sir Robert during our time in the political process and who benefited enormously from his experience, wisdom and guidance, it is a very sad day but a very important day on which to note that, as Senator Minchin said, he was a very great Liberal and a great Australian.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-02-06,"—I want to convey my condolences to Lady Benise Killen. Unfortunately I had an international flight to catch after the funeral and I was not able to extend my condolences personally at the time, but I do so now and to Sir James’s children as well.
‘Killen, you’re magnificent’ are almost immortal words alleged to have been said by Menzies on Killen’s retention of his electorate of Moreton on communist preferences and are an appropriate description of Jim Killen to all who knew him. Those words—and there is some conjecture about whether Menzies ever did say them, but certainly they were on the front page of the Courier-Mail the day after the election was declared—are some of the very significant political words spoken in Australian history. It was quite ironic that Killen was elected on communist preferences, because Jim Killen had been a well-known and aggressive opponent of communism right throughout his life.
As has been said, Jim Killen was the inaugural Young Liberal president in Queensland and, as such, I owe him a lot. I started my political career in the Young Liberals as a vice-president, and I note that there are two subsequent presidents of the Young Liberal Movement in Queensland also here to speak about Sir James. He established the Young Liberals well in those very early days and always maintained very active and enthusiastic involvement in and support for the Young Liberal Movement in Queensland.
He was a great Liberal. Some would say he was conservative; he was certainly a royalist. I like to think that he was more liberal than conservative in the Liberal Party. He hated humbug and hypocrisy and liked things to be talked about as they really were. The number of current and past Liberals who were at his funeral service is an indication of how highly he was regarded in the Liberal Party right throughout Australia. It was interesting that almost every living member of the cabinet in which Jim Killen last served would have been at the funeral. Every person who has in any way been involved with the Liberal Party in Queensland in the time that I have been involved seemed to be sitting in St John’s at the funeral service.
It was interesting to me that Gough Whitlam was invited to give the eulogy on behalf of the family. I have never been a great fan of Gough Whitlam, I have to say, but I very much warmed to him on hearing his eulogy. I thought Whitlam’s speech was quite magnificent and caring and showed a relationship between Whitlam and Killen that I was unaware of, although quite obviously many others were not. Whitlam indicated that every Sunday, usually after Killen had returned from church, they would speak to each other on the phone, and this association continued up until just a few weeks before Jim Killen’s death. I thought Whitlam’s eulogy was very apt and appropriate. The Prime Minister also spoke at the funeral and, as usual, delivered an address that was appropriate, correct and in keeping with the high regard in which Jim Killen was held.
I think it was Whitlam who described Killen as a statesman and a larrikin and indicated that if you could be both a statesman or a gentleman and a larrikin then that was all any Australian should ever aspire to. But that was certainly Jim Killen. He always had an eye for the ladies in an appropriate way. If he said it to my wife once, he said it a dozen times; when Jim Killen approached me and my wife he would always say to me, ‘Isn’t it lovely that you have brought your daughter along to this function.’ Every time he said it my wife knew he was going to say it, but nevertheless she was flattered and charmed every time, as were most of the women with whom Sir James came in contact.
Sir Jim Killen campaigned quite a lot in North Queensland. Even after his retirement he helped us out in a couple of elections where few others wanted to make the effort to save a hopeless cause, but Jim Killen was always there. The last I remember him campaigning was standing on the back of a truck, in the old style of campaigning, in the main street of Ayr during one state election campaign when he came along to lend a hand.
What I liked about Jim Killen was that he was bushie, a jackaroo, a self-made man—a man who I think epitomised what the early Liberal Party was all about. He got in there, did the hard work and, through his own initiative, enthusiasm and enterprise, achieved the highest office in the land in a political sense. Indeed, I think we can all say, and certainly I and my wife will always say, ‘Killen, you were magnificent.’",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-02-06,"—It was my great good fortune to know Sir James Killen. Although I would not claim an intimate association with him, I knew him well enough to come to appreciate the measure of the man and to be enchanted by his very distinctive personality. I last saw Sir James Killen some four months ago, on 30 September last year, at the opening of the new Moreton electorate office, which he performed with his customary poise and aplomb. I remember my conversation with him. I was much exercised at the time—and you might remember this, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman—with the question of sedition laws and the laws concerning the threat of terrorism. As well as being a distinguished parliamentarian, Sir James was a notable barrister. He engaged me for some time about the importance of the rule of law and how liberals and conservatives—because in the different senses of those many-hued words he was both—should never lose sight of the paramountcy of the rule of law and rights of the individual citizen, even in necessitous times.
Prior to that, I had attended a luncheon with Sir James in November 2005. It was a most touching occasion. It was the 50th anniversary of the Upper Cavendish Road branch of the Liberal Party at the Pacific Golf Club. As all of us in political parties know, those whom we value most are the true believers who stay with their party through thick and thin, who seek no political rewards for themselves but only seek to serve the cause and values they believe in. We can all think of such people in our lives. I will never forget that day because there were there, along with Sir James Killen, four of the foundation members of the Upper Cavendish Road branch of the Liberal Party: Ailsa Scurr, Ruth Lines, Peg Organ and Oliver Cowley—all of whom had worked on Sir James’s first campaign in 1955 when he was elected as the member for Moreton. Indeed, the Upper Cavendish Road branch was formed, as I understand it, for the purpose of assisting Sir James to win the seat of Moreton at the 1955 election. Also there was one of Sir James Killen’s great companions in arms, Mr Bill Hewitt—later a distinguished member of the Queensland parliament to whom I will return in a moment.
Others have observed—and one cannot speak of Sir James Killen without making the observation—that he brought to this parliament, as he brought to his daily life, a very distinctive, in many ways anachronistic, but very memorable air. The period of history with which he identified was the great period of English parliamentarianism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries—the days of Edmund Burke, Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the other parliamentarians of the Fox-North-Burke period, and beyond the Napoleonic Wars into the days of the Regency. He seemed to be a displaced essence from that period who walked among us. He adopted its airs and he adopted its generous, formal, courtly and elegant language. He brought to everything he did the qualities which we associate with that period—chivalry, eloquence and a somewhat Rabelaisian approach to life. It was the period appropriately ordained by that rather lush English historian, Sir Arthur Bryant, as The Age of Elegance. It was that age of elegance which Sir James embodied in our more prosaic times.
He loved quoting Edmund Burke and, as we heard from Mr Whitlam in his eulogy to Sir James at St John’s Cathedral two weeks ago, he conceived the idea—how empirically supported I am not sure—that he was a descendant of Richard Brinsley Sheridan on his mother’s side. Although political scientists might say that he was not a deep scholar of Burke in an academic sense, nevertheless he understood the point of Burke’s view of life. Burke was never a Tory; he was a Whig. He always sat with the Whig party. Sir James Killen, like Burke, was sometimes mischaracterised as a conservative but was really a Whig—to the extent to which that antique term has meaning in today’s politics. He was always on the progressive side, always on the side of the individual. Nevertheless, like a true Whig, he maintained a deep reverence for established institutions. He understood that age, he understood its values and he evoked its spirit. Never more so did he do that than in his Alfred Deakin Lecture of 1975 when he spoke of parliament—the role of parliament, the uniqueness of parliament, the spirit of parliament, the changeable moods of parliament. His rhapsody to the parliamentary institution is something which will never be forgotten by those who happened to hear a broadcast of it, as I was fortunate to do, or who have since read the text of it.
Sir James Killen was the subject of many anecdotes—some, it must be said, of his own creation; he certainly was somebody who was fain to nurture his own anecdotes. We have heard the famous story of the apocryphal Menzies telegram after the 1961 election. But there is another anecdote about Sir James Killen, widely believed at the University of Queensland Law School—at least it was while I was a student—which I would like to contribute to the record.
It was widely believed that Sir James, or Jim Killen as he then was, when an external law student was having a bit of trouble with a constitutional law paper which, it was said, he asked the then Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick, to assist him in completing at a parliamentary function. As the legend has it, the then Dr Kevin Ryan, later the sainted professor and Justice Kevin Ryan, who marked the constitutional law paper, was as little impressed by Sir Garfield Barwick’s contribution as he was by Jim Killen’s. Nevertheless, Jim Killen did get his pass in constitutional law and subsequently graduated LLB in the same graduating class as the present Governor of Queensland, Quentin Bryce.
It is also said about Sir James Killen, and rightly so, that he was a person who spanned all walks of life. Never was that more memorably illustrated to me than at a dinner that was held to commemorate his 70th birthday in 1995—appropriately, at the Guineas Room at Eagle Farm Racecourse. There was, as is customary on such occasions, a series of tributes from all manner of people. And there were some who, by reason of distance or by reason of illness, were not able to be present that evening, so they recorded their tributes on videotape which was broadcast to the room.
One of the tributes was by former President George Bush, whom Jim Killen had encountered when George Bush was a Vice-President in the Reagan administration and Sir James Killen was the Minister for Defence in Australia, and with whom he had maintained a correspondence and, obviously, a warm friendship. So we had this tribute from the former President of the United States of America, and then the next video to appear was by a man well known in legal circles in Brisbane as ‘Tom the barber’. Tom the barber cut Sir James’s hair for decades, as he cut the hair of most of the judges and most of the barristers—in fact, he used to cut my hair. Tom the barber was a real character among the legal community—and the racing community, indeed—of Brisbane. The juxtaposition of a message from the former President of the United States and the much-loved Tom the barber to me summed up Sir James’s capacity to embrace people from all walks of life. The funny thing was that they both, George Bush and Tom, evoked almost precisely the same qualities.
As Senator Ian Macdonald has pointed out and as Senator Santoro, who I understand will speak in a moment, will no doubt also advert to, Sir James was the inaugural president of the Young Liberal Movement in Queensland, an office in which both Senator Santoro and I had, many years later, the honour to follow him. I have been provided by Bill Hewitt, whom I mentioned before, who was the fourth president of the Young Liberal Movement, with a document which Sir James authorised and which was published in about 1950, entitled A Manifesto to the Youth of Queensland. This was the foundation document of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia, Queensland Division. It followed the style of that other famous Liberal Party foundational document or testament of beliefs, We Believe. But rather than the rather modest dozen or so declarations of principle in the We Believe document, which became the Liberal Party’s most famous statement of doctrine, Sir James Killen’s ‘We believe’ document contains dozens of affirmations of Liberal faith, which he wrote when he was a very young man. Some of them sound a little antique today, such as:
WE BELIEVE in loyalty to our Queen and Throne, as we believe the institution of Monarchy to be indispensable to the British way of life.
But there are others that sound as contemporary as if they had been written yesterday:
WE BELIEVE that government interference with the lives and liberties of people is not desirable in itself, and should only arise when national and international circumstances demand, and we further believe that the full circumstances should be made quite clear to the people—
the very point he made to me only some four months ago when I last spoke with him. This document, which obviously bears his authorship, says:
WE BELIEVE that the entry of people into Parliament for any other reason than service of the nation is to be deplored, as we also believe that all those who enter Parliament should receive political training before their entry—
one of the principal reasons, of course, why the Young Liberal Movement was founded. The document also says:
WE BELIEVE it right to condemn the fall in the prestige of Parliament, as we believe it right to regard Parliamentary service as a high and noble form of service to one’s fellow men.
WE BELIEVE in a strong and independent judiciary, as we believe in our system of Law which makes all equal before the Law.
And so it goes on. But the document with which I have been furnished by Bill Hewitt is not just a manifesto to the youth of Queensland, not only the original inspiration of Young Liberals in the 1950s, but very much a testament of Jim Killen’s political faith—to which he maintained fidelity through good times and bad, with impressive consistency throughout 28 years in parliament and in the years before and after his parliamentary career.
I want to finish by putting on the public record some reflections about Sir James Killen which I asked Bill Hewitt to write when I heard of Sir James’s death. I asked for some recollections of the times when the Young Liberal Movement was founded, and also of the famous 1961 campaign when the government of Australia hung by a thread and in which Sir James was successful. Bill Hewitt was his campaign director on that memorable occasion. If I may detain the Senate for just a moment, I will read onto the record Bill Hewitt’s reflections on Sir James Killen:
Jim Killen became the Young Liberals’ Foundation President in 1949. I met him when I joined in early 1952. He presided over the Metropolitan Zone that met each Thursday in Edward Street, the City. We marvelled at his depth of knowledge, his oratory skills and his tireless energy. The times were exciting—‘An Iron Curtain has descended over Europe,’ Churchill had said—and Jim attracted to him a galaxy of talent in the young members, many destined to enjoy political or legal careers. Guest speakers from a variety of professions and interests submitted to questions and challenges from members, often led by Jim himself. Debates, sometimes Debating Union fixtures, more often Young Liberal clashes against supporters of opposing causes, were always stimulating. Killen himself often participated in a one on one discussion—memorable among those is the night he debated and comprehensively defeated the President of the Fabian Society.
Even before his election in 1955, succeeding army minister Jos Francis in Moreton, Jim was a regular contributor to the Bulletin and an eager participant in election campaigns. Outside the Alliance Hotel in Spring Hill or the Wharfies’ Tally Room were not places to hold street corner meetings for timorous Liberals. Not Jim! The sites were always prominent on the list and he took the fight to anyone who wanted to take him on.
Jim’s great contribution to the Young Liberals was the organisation of the Young Liberal Winter School of Political Science held annually at Montville on the Queen’s Birthday weekend for most of the 1950s. Barwick, Casey, Latham, Chester Wilmot and many other distinguished persons gave us a greater understanding of current issues. They were wonderful days! Under Jim’s presidency, a manifesto to the Youth of Queensland was printed. These many years later, the principles stated stand firm.
In 1961, as Area Chairman for Moreton, past Young Liberal President and long-time Killen friend and supporter, I accepted the role of Campaign Director in Moreton for the forthcoming federal election. The impact of the 1960 mini-budget had been prolonged and severe. There were fears of some impact on the election results, although overall a feeling of optimism prevailed. Nevertheless, we campaigned hard in Moreton. Street meetings in the early evenings and Saturday mornings, distributions, booth manning, appeals and section voting filled the last three hectic weeks. Voting concluded at 8.00 pm and booth workers proceeded to the Killen Ekibin residence to enjoy a backyard barbecue and follow results. The heavens opened and we retreated into the house. At midnight it was pouring rain. The carpets were ruined and we were 2000 votes behind. As the week progressed and seats around the nation, including seven in Queensland, had fallen, the fate of the government depended on Moreton. The ensuing ten days were tortuous, but with a disciplined flow of QLP preferences and a small leakage of Communist preferences—the ultimate irony—Jim held the seat by 110 votes and he went on to reach impressive heights.
Our friendship prevailed, albeit in different spheres of government. It was my great privilege to propose his Life Membership of the Liberal Party in 1994. I likened his career to the life story of David Lloyd George, Tempestuous Journey. Happily Jim returned to tranquil waters and spent his twilight years in quiet contemplation.
Vale Sir James Killen: a great Liberal, a great Australian, a great Queenslander; a person whose values, standards and beliefs we would do well to emulate.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, AO</title>",Condolences,8,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2007-02-06,"—I was greatly saddened when I learned, on 12 January this year, of the death of the Hon. Sir James Killen AC, KCMG. Sir James, as others during this condolence motion have amply and very well said, was a longstanding and distinguished member of the Queensland Liberal Party. He made an outstanding contribution to Australian politics and government as the federal member for Moreton between 1955 and 1983, and as a minister in the portfolios of Navy, from 1969 to 1971, and defence, from 1975 to 1982.
As Senator Brandis said and as the Hon. Bill Hewitt said through Senator Brandis’s contribution, Sir James Killen was the Foundation President of the Young Liberal Movement in Queensland in 1949. Like Senator Brandis, I was proud to follow in his footsteps in this position many years later. He continued to support the Young Liberal Movement through his entire political life, which included in the early 1980s his giving permission for the establishment of the Sir James Killen Young Liberal Foundation, which has placed the Queensland Young Liberal Movement on a very sound long-term financial footing.
Senator Brandis mentioned the publication of a manifesto which Sir James wrote in his very early days and I would like to place on the record the fact that Sir James, in the early 1980s, relaunched that manifesto when under the Young Liberal presidency of Allan Pidgeon—if my memory serves me correctly—that document was revived. It was updated, approved by Sir James and republished, which gives a very clear indication of his long-term commitment to the Young Liberal Movement, the Queensland Liberal Party and, indeed, the Australian Liberal Party.
Often when people leave politics, particularly after they have scaled the great political heights that Sir James did, they dissociate themselves from the great profession that they participated in and often move away from the political party that spawned and, indeed, nurtured them. Sir James Killen was certainly not one of those people. He continued to support the Young Liberal Movement, the Queensland Liberal Party and the Australian Liberal Party with great gusto and vigour. His legacy to the Queensland Young Liberals continues to be as strong as ever. Only last Saturday, the Queensland Young Liberal Movement, with the approval of Lady Killen, named the public-speaking competition that the Young Liberal Movement hosts every year the Sir James Killen Young Liberal Speaking Competition. I think that is one of the most significant and thoughtful tributes that the Liberal Party, particularly the youth wing of the Liberal Party in Queensland, could pay to its founding president, a life member and arguably its most distinguished member.
Sir James was also vice-president of the party’s Queensland division between 1953 and 1956. They were tumultuous times, and he served with distinction and with a clear sense of the direction that the Liberal Party had to take at that time. Invariably, his views and his counsel prevailed.
Most of all, as others have said in their contributions to this condolence motion, he was a tremendous orator whose ready wit and extraordinary intellect ensured that he was able to shine in any speaking performance or political debate. Again, Senator Brandis gave strong anecdotal evidence of that. Sir James was also an inspiration to generations of younger members of the Liberal Party, including me. He showed us all that it was possible to engage in serious and meaningful political debate without surrendering dignity, good manners and respect for others.
So much was he revered that, in his later years, it seems to me that everyone wanted to celebrate his life and his legacy. I know of at least three major testimonial dinners that were organised just in the last three or four years alone, and all of those dinners were sell-outs. People came from all over Australia—Liberal Party members, National Party members, Labor Party members and indeed members of other political parties and movements—to celebrate his life and his achievements and, whilst he was alive, to clearly give him a sense of the great appreciation that people had for him. People like me who continue with great pleasure, great pride and a great sense of privilege in the great and noble profession of politics often lament that we only say the great things about great political practitioners and great Australians like Sir James Killen at a funeral or memorial service. But it must have been so very satisfying for Sir James and his family to be able to go to dinner after dinner—and they were not small affairs; they were significant occasions—where his contribution was eulogised, with great appreciation expressed.
Sir James Killen will be sorely missed by thousands of Liberal Party members across Australia who strive to emulate his genuine political achievements and his dignified, intellectual and very witty contribution to public life. The Liberal Party has lost a great hero, and Australia has lost a fine servant and citizen. I extend my most sincere sympathies to Lady Killen and his daughters, Heather and Diana, and their extended family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-02-06,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished Liberal Senator for NSW who played a crucial role in representing the interests of both his constituents and his Party.
Sir Robert entered the Senate in 1966 filling the casual vacancy that arose following the retirement of Sir William Spooner, another faithful servant of the people of New South Wales.
He served as a Senator, a Minister in many portfolios and was highly respected as President of the NSW Liberal Party.
Sir Robert was a firm advocate for the importance of the Australian Senate in the Australian political system. In his maiden speech Sir Robert defended this chamber by quoting Sir George Pearce:
‘The Senate was constituted as it is after long fighting, prolonged discussions, many compromises and many concessions on the part of the various shades of political thought throughout the Commonwealth and it stands therefore, in the Constitution in a position that has no equal in any Legislature throughout the world’.
Sir Robert often thought that the Senate chamber was not sufficiently well appreciated in Australia and made it his life’s work to change that perception.
Born in Broken Hill in 1915 to Les and Muriel Cotton, Sir Robert was the eldest son of six children. The family’s rural existence ensured that Sir Robert was brought up with a strong sense of community and a love of the land. He attended St Peter’s College in Adelaide and went to work with his father soon after leaving school due to the pressures of the Depression years.
In 1937, Sir Robert married Eve McDougal. Eve was a constant in Sir Robert’s life. They were childhood sweethearts and remained together until Eve’s passing in 2000.
Like many of his time, Sir Robert felt compelled to serve his country during World War II. He trained as a Royal Australian Air Force bomber pilot in 1941 and was seconded to the Department of Supply in Melbourne.
As a sign of the Cotton family’s tight bond Sir Robert, together with his brothers Monty and John, worked tirelessly to establish Timber Industries Pty Ltd to supply wood products to coal mines in Broken Hill during the war years.
Sir Robert was a foundation member of the Liberal Party. In his first foray into political life, Sir Robert was a candidate at the 1949 Federal election, standing against former Prime Minister Ben Chifley (PM 13 July 1945 -19 December 1949) in the seat of Macquarie. Sir Robert, not satisfied with his first tilt at political life, was again the Liberal candidate in the 1951 by-election for the seat of Macquarie after former Prime Minister Ben Chifley’s death.
The New South Wales Liberal Party has been served by many impressive State Presidents and Sir Robert definitely fits that bill. I believe Prime Minister John Howard remarked that it was Sir Robert’s calm authority and immense personal charm that provided strong leadership to the Party organisation’. Sir Robert went on to serve in the Gorton, McMahon and Fraser Coalition Governments. In 1969, Sir Robert was appointed Minister for Civil Aviation.
In 1975, he was appointed Minister for Manufacturing Industry, then Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs and finally Minister for Industry and Commerce, which he held until 1977.
Upon his retirement from Federal politics in 1978, Sir Robert was knighted as a Commander of St Michael and St George for services to government. He was appointed as Consul-General to New York in August of that year, where he remained until 1980.
In 1981, Sir Robert again answered the call and served the Australian people as a member of the Reserve Bank Board.
In 1982 he was appointed Australian Ambassador to the United States, replacing Sir Nicholas Parkinson. He served both the Fraser and Hawke Governments in this position and remained Ambassador in Washington for two years after the change of Government, a sign of the respect both sides of politics held for Sir Robert.
On his return to Australia in 1985, Sir Robert served on a number of boards and pursued his interest in photography. On several occasions Sir Robert exhibited his photographs in Sydney and he held an exhibition in Washington in 1986. In 2005 Sir Robert held a joint exhibition with his daughter Judy Cotton, a painter.
I had the pleasure of meeting Sir Robert while I was in Washington, working as an attorney in 1986. I found him to be an intelligent man, he was extremely engaging, he had a great wealth of knowledge, and as the saying goes he was switched on to all the issues of the day. Sir Robert spoke glowingly of Australia as the place of opportunity, untapped beauty and untold potential. He advocated strongly for Australia at every chance and was highly respected as an Ambassador.
In our conversations, Sir Robert spoke of his love for Broken Hill and the spirit and perseverance of the people that have made Broken Hill the place it is today. His other great love was Carrington Park, a large pastoral property that he built from scratch, showing the ingenuity that was a trade mark of his belief in the Australian spirit.
Sir Robert is survived by his second wife and her three daughters, by his two daughters, his son, seven grandchildren and four great grandchildren.
On behalf of the Australian Government, the Senate and the New South Wales Liberal Party, I extend my deepest sympathies to Sir Robert’s family on their sad loss.
Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon. Sir Robert Carrington Cotton KCMG, AO</title>",Condolences,8,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-02-06,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
that Australian citizen David Hicks will be subject to a Military Commission process that, among its flaws, allows conviction on evidence obtained through coercion and on hearsay, and strips away habeas corpus; and
further, that Mr Hicks’ mental and physical health has deteriorated in recent months, particularly after 11 months in solitary confinement, and he should be repatriated immediately.
I welcome my colleagues back to this first day of the parliamentary session for this year and indicate that the pressing case of Mr David Hicks, a South Australian citizen who has languished for more than five years in Guantanamo Bay, the detention facility set up and run by the United States, is a matter of urgency.
Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, today you will have seen many people converge on the nation’s capital outside Parliament House as a public show of support for not just this motion but the broader issue of repatriating Mr David Hicks. You saw a broad coalition of support expressed today and, indeed, a number of people indicated their concern with the lack of action taken by the Australian federal government in relation to this man’s case. You would have seen a lot of people speaking, expressing their outrage at and condemnation of a military commission process that has previously been deemed illegal but, after the new Military Commissions Act being passed in September last year in America, is still seriously flawed.
Today this motion is to ensure that senators in this place indicate whether or not they are still comfortable despite the expose of the facility at Guantanamo Bay, despite the increasing stories of the debilitating effects on the physical and mental health of Mr David Hicks, despite the fact the military commission process is flawed, despite the fact that this has gone on for more than five years of this man’s life and despite the fact that we are committed in this country to the rule of law and more broadly that we believe in, support and uphold the principles of international humanitarian law. It is time for senators to show where they stand. I think it was Senator Chuck Hagel who said recently, ‘If you want an easy job, go sell shoes.’ Today is the day that we will see how senators in this place stand on this issue, an issue of increasing alarm and urgency for a number of reasons, most of them contained within the urgency motion before us.
Last week the US military announced new charges that may be brought against Mr David Hicks, including attempted murder and offering support for terrorism. While the charges are yet to be approved by the Pentagon, this government is still a cheerleader for and still a supporter of a process that defies the rule of law and contravenes international humanitarian law. Let us get this clear. There are a couple of aspects of that military commission process, aspects which have been brought to the attention of the Senate previously: detainees can still be convicted on the basis of evidence that is obtained through coercion and still will not have the right to challenge that evidence. There are a couple of vital principles here—the right to cross-examine witnesses, for example, who have given evidence against the detainee. There are some pretty basic principles. This debate today is not about individual David Hicks, albeit he is an Australian citizen and a South Australian citizen and therefore a constituent of some of us in this chamber; it is about these broader principles.
I believe Australians are increasingly disappointed by or frustrated with the government. Some are very angry with the government’s seeming inability to seek a dignified and fair outcome for this process. In recent times we have heard stories of Mr Hicks’s health. They are not stories generally; I am talking about specific reports from people who know, such as David McLeod, his Adelaide based lawyer, and his military commission defence team, about the fact that this man is not in a good way. We have heard from David Hicks, in his own written hand, that he is not well. But I am not going to make those assessments. It is a bit like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, said: he is not a doctor. Neither am I, and that is why it is time that there was an independent medical assessment of this man, Mr Hicks. A psychiatrist who is independent of the defence counsel’s approval should be allowed into Guantanamo Bay to assess his condition.
On the matter of accessing Guantanamo Bay, isn’t it time that we emulated some of our colleagues in the US, the UK or the European Union and sent a delegation to Guantanamo Bay—maybe a cross-parliamentary delegation or, indeed, a delegation of ministers of the Crown? Isn’t it time that we decided as a nation, after inspection first hand, whether the facilities and the reports of those facilities are true and whether the conditions are appropriate? I don’t think that solitary confinement since March is appropriate. I don’t think 22-hour-a-day lighting is appropriate. I certainly don’t think rationed toilet paper is appropriate. I think a reading room that does not have access to books or legal materials is a farce.
I think the whole process is now being exposed as inhumane. But I would not mind ministers of the Crown and others visiting that facility and telling us first hand what they see and what they hear. I would like to see if they have got the intestinal fortitude to look that man, David Hicks, in the eyes and say that they are doing everything possible for him within the context of the rule of law.
This is not about excusing anyone. This is not about letting people go off scot-free. This is about ensuring that a man is either charged and detained or set free. But if you charge a person then they are entitled to a fair process, a fair trial. Does anyone seriously believe that the military commission process will enable that to take place? I acknowledge that the Labor Party have an amendment, to which I am happy to agree, about whether or not David Hicks could get a fair trial in Australia. I will let the Labor Party speak to their amendment but it is entirely acceptable to me.
In terms of the charges that may be applied, we have heard a couple of the charges that may be levelled against him. We know that attempted murder and offering material support are two of the charges that may be approved by the Pentagon and that this is what David Hicks may be charged with. While material support for terrorism, one of the proposed charges, was an existing offence in US law—I acknowledge that; I have been listening and I understand what is going on—it was in the jurisdiction of the federal court applying to US citizens. The charges against Mr David Hicks in this regard represent, for the first time, the material support offence being applied to a non-US-citizen for actions in a non-US-territory before a military tribunal that has lesser standards of evidence.
Our government has maintained that Mr David Hicks could not be charged in Australia because anti-terror laws were not in place at the time of his arrest and could not be used retrospectively. I know that many senators in this place across party boundaries have an issue with retrospectivity in law, for very good reason. But it is a double standard. This is a government that says retrospective law cannot be applied in the case of a citizen in Australia, cannot be introduced into the legal system in this country, yet seems to be a cheerleader for and applauder of the United States when they introduce it to prosecute an Australian citizen.
Why is it that we are accepting that double standard? Perhaps those honourable senators from the government side who are participating in this debate today could explain this. And good on you, Senator Kemp; I see you are up next. You are first in the batting, and a former minister. Maybe you will explain to me and to the people of Australia why such retrospectivity is acceptable. Why is it that we are accepting lesser standards in a military tribunal yet theoretically applying an offence that exists in the civil courts?
The injustice of five years of detention without charge or trial, and then the possibility of there being no fair trial, is hitting home. Australian citizens are concerned about this. Australians are angry about this. I know that in many respects the government just want a political solution. But that political solution is not a matter of letting this man be charged and jettisoning him, sacrificing him, to a process that is unfair and, indeed, previously deemed illegal. That is not good enough. I really feel that a broader issue is at stake here: if we accept that this process is appropriate, humane and acceptable then we are all tainted by it. And after more than five years, it is no longer acceptable. It is time to bring David Hicks home. The government had better have a very good reason today why they are not doing that. The Prime Minister’s counterparts in many countries across the world, including the United Kingdom—another ally in this so-called war on terror—have been able to pick up the phone, exercise diplomacy, go through relevant channels and get their citizens home. Why is it good enough for them but it is not good enough for us? Why is it good enough for an Australian citizen to face this process but not good enough for a United States citizen? Why do we have this discrepancy and this hypocrisy? The government should answer me that. (Time expired)

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2007-02-06,"—I listened, as I always do, with great care to what Senator Stott Despoja said. In this case I have to say, Senator, that you have not managed to convince me one iota. Look at her use of the word ‘so called’ in the ‘so-called’ war on terror. Is there a war on terror or is there not? Is the Western world faced with a threat from terror? Are not our soldiers fighting in various lands? Have not our citizens been killed? Yet Senator Stott Despoja referred to the ‘so-called’ war on terror. Get real, Senator Stott Despoja. We should strip away the inaccuracies in the senator’s motion and get to the truth of the matter. Should David Hicks be repatriated and set free or should he face trial on the very serious allegations against him? Those are the two choices that are before this chamber.
As the Attorney-General reminded us just last week, ‘The advice from the independent Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is that Mr Hicks could not be prosecuted in Australia.’ In essence, in seeking the return of David Hicks, Senator Stott Despoja is arguing for him to be set free to avoid prosecution. That is essentially what the senator is arguing for. We should not mince words; that is precisely her position. I do not accept that, and I do not believe that the government does either.
What are these serious allegations against David Hicks? How quickly Senator Stott Despoja tried to dismiss them as so-called charges in a so-called war on terror. What are they? Charges have been sworn against him that whilst overseas he attempted murder in violation of the law of war and provided material support for terrorism. Let us step back from the emotion of the senator’s speech and examine the facts. It is alleged that David Hicks joined Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is listed as a terrorist body by the United Nations and proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australian law. More importantly, it is alleged that David Hicks had trained with the terrorist body al-Qaeda and that he travelled to Afghanistan with a view to fighting against the United States and other coalition forces. Al-Qaeda is well known around the world for its appalling atrocities against all types of innocent people and, of course, for the dreadful and tragic events of 11 September 2001.
Let us not mince words, Senator Stott Despoja. It is alleged that David Hicks joined forces with those who have the declared aim of killing coalition soldiers. These allegations against David Hicks are very serious, but I agree that they are untested. I welcome the fact that charges have been sworn and that Mr David Hicks is now one step further towards a trial. The US military commission system contains a number of safeguards which the US believes will facilitate a full and fair trial. Senator Stott Despoja asserts in this chamber that the process is flawed because it allows the use of hearsay evidence. In this case, Senator Stott Despoja, if you care to listen to a response to your debate, I am advised that the rules of evidence are similar to those adopted and accepted in international criminal tribunals. I am advised that hearsay evidence may be admitted where it has probative value, but it must be excluded where the evidence is proved to be unreliable.
Senator Stott Despoja also asserts that detainees may be convicted on evidence obtained by coercion. Again, the senator ignores the fact that such evidence may only be used where it has probative value and may not be used where it may cause unfair prejudice to the defendant. The military judge has the discretion to decide whether this evidence can be used. These are complex legal issues that are not to be dismissed in the cavalier way in which the senator has tried to do it. It is a serious case. It is a matter for lawyers to look very closely at these issues. The issue is that Senator Stott Despoja wishes to bring back David Hicks—
—Five years—a very complex five years.
—The position of the Labor Party is clear. They believe that, despite the allegations and charges that have been sworn against him, David Hicks should be brought home. They do not believe that he should face those charges. I agree that the Australian community has a variety of views on this but, to my mind, when the Australian community learns more fully the nature of the charges that have been sworn against David Hicks I am not sure that Senator Carr will be speaking with the majority voice.
All of us agree that this matter has taken too long. The Prime Minister, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, have made it clear on a number of occasions that these delays are of great concern to the government. The Prime Minister said at the end of last year:
I am not happy about how long it has taken and we will be putting increasing pressure on the Americans to stick to the timetable they have given us.
Let me stress that the government is concerned about the delay and will continue to press for a resolution of the allegations against Mr Hicks. Indeed, on 23 January this year the PM said:
The decision was taken to formally convey to the Americans our view that he ought to be charged by the middle of February.
As the Attorney-General said on Saturday:
The swearing of charges is a timely development that meets the Prime Minister’s recent call to charge Mr Hicks before mid February. However, the Government remains anxious to ensure that his case is dealt with expeditiously and fairly, and will continue to press the United States.
The Prime Minister reiterated only last night that the government will continue to press the Americans to conclude the matter quickly.
In contrast to what Senator Stott Despoja said, the idea that the government has ignored the health and wellbeing of Mr Hicks is quite wrong. The government has provided consular assistance to Mr Hicks to monitor his welfare, and Australian officials have visited him on 18 separate occasions. I understand that he refused to speak with our consul general during the last two visits; however, the consul general remains available to assist him. I believe it is unfortunate that Mr Hicks has refused to speak to the consul general.
—Rubbish!
—I am interested in the new face of Labor. I am not sure that Senator Marshall is entirely on message with what Mr Rudd is putting out. To allege that these statements are rubbish is complete nonsense and Senator Marshall knows it. Let me state this very clearly: the Australian government treats any allegation about the abuse of any Australian detainee overseas with the utmost seriousness. The Australian government has pursued the allegations referred to by Senator Stott Despoja of mistreatment of Mr Hicks and, at the government’s request, there have been two US investigations into the allegations. Neither revealed any evidence of abuse.
The United States government has consistently maintained that it is treating the detainees humanely and in a manner consistent with its international obligations under the principles of the Geneva convention. The Australian government has also provided over $300,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund Australian legal consultants to assist in Mr Hicks’s defence.
Senator Stott Despoja and I are in agreement that action must be taken in relation to David Hicks. However, while the senator would see him returned in a circumstance where he cannot face trial in Australia, I and the government would instead see the allegations against him tested. I believe this is a very serious matter. I believe that the government has expressed its frustration about the time this has taken.
—Frustration!
—It is frustrating. All of us would have preferred to see this matter concluded in a far more efficient fashion, but that is not the case. So we are faced with the facts as they now stand—that Senator Stott Despoja and those who support her motion would rather see Mr David Hicks returned to Australia without having to face the charges which have been sworn against him. They are serious charges. This country is involved in very serious matters in relation to terror. Therefore, I cannot support the motion moved by Senator Stott Despoja. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-06,"—Labor will not support either the Democrats’ motion or the Greens’ motion on David Hicks for the simple reason that the motions do not include the words ‘to face justice in Australia’. It is my understanding that the shadow Attorney-General contacted both the Greens and the Democrats in order to rectify this deficiency but our offer to improve their motions was declined. That is a disappointment. Let us consider what we do know about this matter.
There is a great deal of serious legal commentary to the effect that if David Hicks is guilty of things which have been alleged against him by the United States authority then he is guilty of a number of breaches of Australian law. Advice given to me by the shadow Attorney-General is that there is no legal impediment preventing Mr Hicks’s trial in Australia under the existing laws of the land and without retrospective effect. However, there may or may not be an evidential impediment. The question is left open.
The Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, contends that the problem is not a matter of insufficient law but instead a matter of insufficient evidence. This is truly a curious conclusion from the first law officer of the land because Labor understands that neither the Attorney-General’s Department nor the Director of Public Prosecutions, Damian Bugg AM QC, have seen the evidence against Mr Hicks. Yet the Attorney is so bold as to pre-empt it. Given expert legal commentary maintains that the allegations against David Hicks can be considered under Australian criminal law, it is curious that the first law officer of the land would make so simple an error as to assess a case before seeing the evidence. For the benefit of the Attorney, that is what lawyers usually like to call ‘prejudice’. The Attorney claims his pre-emption is based on advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions. If this is so, let him release it because five years have now passed. If the Attorney-General has that advice, it is really now incumbent upon him to ensure that there is clarity.
We are now at that point where even the usual caveats that surround legal advice should be swept aside and it should be provided. That is the challenge that the Attorney-General should meet. It is the case that this government have, in other instances, found the need to provide the legal advice and have sought to table it themselves. So it is not a case that there is a hard and fast rule that stops them completely in their tracks. They can do it if they are so minded. They have done it in the past.
This is not the Attorney-General’s only failing. Claims by David Hicks’s lawyers that he is in poor shape and showing symptoms of mental deterioration require a proper response from the Attorney-General. Mr Ruddock cannot continue to sit on his hands while evidence of David Hicks’s improper treatment and deteriorating physical and mental condition continue to mount. The Attorney-General continues to claim that David Hicks’s situation is different from that of the British citizens who were returned to Britain from Guantanamo Bay. Both David Hicks and the British citizens were mentioned as eligible to be charged in the same US presidential decree. The British government then took up the issue with the US authorities, leading to its citizens’ return to Britain. However, the Australian government took no such action.
Finally, let us address the issue of whether the US law under which Mr Hicks is to be tried is retrospective. The law, the Attorney-General insists, is not retrospective. The Attorney-General—I think and Labor thinks—is poorly advised. Mr Hicks is not to be tried under an offence as it was known before it was codified, despite the fact that the codification occurred after his alleged offence. What the Attorney has obviously failed to grasp is that by the very act of codification the law is different from that which may have previously existed as an offence through the criminal branch of the common law in that land.
It is manifestly absurd to suggest that a codified offence is identical to one that is uncodified. The mere act of codification changes how judges may apply the law. I would have thought that is, one could say, law 101 for the Attorney-General to understand. The Attorney-General’s ineptitude in this matter is only matched by the bumbling buffoonery of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister’s latest embarrassment concerned his comment that Mr Hicks’s mental health was nothing to worry about, later revealed to have been based on a five-minute viewing by US dignitaries. In these circumstances, it is usually wise to advise a minister to stick to what they know. However, I have observed the minister’s answers in relation to the Australian Wheat Board and, given the futility of that advice, in this instance I will restrict myself instead to observing that a five-minute viewing does not constitute an independent psychiatric assessment. That is clear. Rather than compounding his errors with more useless assurances, the minister should be seeking permission for Melbourne psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen, who visited David Hicks in February 2005, to make a follow-up assessment.
Mr Hicks is entitled to a fair trial and fair treatment, not more and not less. That is the point that is at stake here. It was the case and it is noteworthy that the US congress was not prepared to allow US military commissions to try American citizens. The United States military commission rules as announced are not fair. They lack essential guarantees of independence and impartiality. For the benefit of senators, here are the rules. They provide for the jury to be comprised of military officers. They do not permit the accused or their defence counsel to be privy to all the evidence. They do not recognise habeas corpus—that is, no imprisonment without a trial. They do not exclude hearsay evidence, which denies the accused the opportunity to confront his accusers and cross-examine, and this is a breach of the Australian Criminal Code in itself. They do not exclude evidence obtained by coercion—practices amounting to coercion have been officially sanctioned for use in Guantanamo Bay. Coercion techniques breach the Geneva conventions.
Labor welcomes the comments of Ms Jodeen Carney, the leader of the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, who today rightfully condemned the Howard government for its neglect of Mr Hicks. We hope that Ms Carney’s comments will encourage her colleagues in the federal Liberal and National parties also to speak out. However, the motion before us as articulated seems to demand unconditional freedom. Justice is apparently all that Mr Hicks’s father, Terry Hicks, has ever asked for. The motion before us goes further than that. That is not Labor’s position. We can agree with the sentiment that has been articulated. We can agree with the basics that have been put but the words do not reflect Labor’s position. My understanding was that it was put to you to change the wording so that we could get a unanimous position from both the opposition and the minor parties to show up the real villains in this—that is, the Liberal-National coalition government. We want Australian law applied because the rule of law as we know it is, in this country, not being applied through these military commissions. Labor does not seek to pre-empt the rule of law as the Howard government does in practice, nor as the Greens and Democrats seem to do in their motion. We are therefore, as I have said, opposed to the motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mr David Hicks</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-02-06,"—Earlier today I joined a demonstration out the front of the parliament calling for David Hicks to be returned home. The view represented there was the majority view of Australians—increasingly the view of people not just on this side of the chamber but on the other side of the chamber as well—that is, to support the rights of the Australian citizen David Hicks who has been abandoned by the Howard government that refuses to stand up to the White House.
It is fantastic to see the shift in public opinion in favour of the human rights of David Hicks over the five long years that he has been held in detention. I remember October 2003 when President Bush came to visit and I and my colleague Senator Bob Brown spoke out about the failure of this government to speak up for the two Australian citizens then held in Guantanamo Bay. For doing so, there were attempts to remove us from the parliament. I am really pleased that we are operating in a different climate now where a whole lot of other people have come on board to support the rights of that one Australian citizen who is held there.
In Australian law there still exists a recognition of the US military commissions that were recognised as illegal by the US Supreme Court. They were put into Australian law in March 2004 by the government and the opposition and are still recognised in our law. I have brought forward a private member’s bill on behalf of the Australian Greens to remove that recognition in our law of US military commissions that have been found to be illegal in the US Supreme Court. So it is pleasing that we are seeing some changes in attitudes around this particular issue. I welcome them from wherever in politics they come because these are fundamental human rights that those of us who speak out are trying to protect in the case of David Hicks and other Australian citizens as well.
The Prime Minister and others in the government are making different noises to those we have heard—not to the extent of actually doing anything about getting David Hicks brought home but because there is recognition that people in the electorate are angry about five years in detention, the mistreatment and the reports of torture of Australian citizen David Hicks. The government have been scrambling to find ways to deflect this anger, so we saw the government last week spinning the story that, now that David Hicks has been charged, it is all fine and all that concern can go away. It is not the case, the charges have not been formally laid yet and all we have been told is what the prosecutors have asked to charge him with. The government seem to think that is enough to let them off the hook but I do not think it is. I do not think the Australian people will be satisfied until David Hicks is treated fairly. What is being proposed in this new US military commission is not fair.
—Like an American citizen, how about the same standard as that?
—As other senators say, it is not the way that citizens from other countries have been treated. Britain, the US and, just last week, Yemen, I think, insisted that their citizens be brought back to their countries and tried in their courts of law. There is no other country that has said: ‘Sure—go and create a kangaroo court and try our citizens. We do not care if it is not fair or representative under international law.’ All of the other countries have asked for and got their citizens returned to be tried in their courts. John Howard and this government stand out alone in that particular regard.
There is a widespread understanding that Guantanamo Bay is an appalling violation of human rights and that the legal process that David Hicks is being subjected to is a sham. I moved a motion today in the Senate highlighting the fact that as of today David Hicks has been detained for 1,889 days. Tomorrow I will move a similar motion. The day after I will move one again. Every day until David Hicks is returned to Australia, I intend to ensure that this parliament spends at least five minutes acknowledging that this man has now spent five long years in detention—and he is there because of the inaction on the part of this government—to ensure that he receives a fair trial or is brought back to Australia. Other countries have managed to achieve this for their citizens. The Australian government should be doing likewise.
This is an issue that the Greens will continue to speak out on. We are pleased to see that more and more groups within the community are joining us in calling for justice for David Hicks—the justice that he is not receiving and the justice that the Australian government currently is not standing up for him to receive.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-02-06,"—I want to commence my comments on this motion by looking at the context that Mr Hicks finds himself in. As we all know, on 11 September 2001 the World Trade Centre in New York was attacked and 2,752 innocent lives were taken. They were not lost; they were taken. They were murdered by terrorists. The Pentagon was attacked and 189 innocent people were murdered by terrorists. A plane was hijacked and crashed in a field in Philadelphia and a further 44 people were murdered by terrorists. Those terrorists were al-Qaeda terrorists based in Afghanistan. So 2,985 innocent American lives were taken by al-Qaeda on 11 September.
David Hicks was arrested in Afghanistan in the immediately following December—in Afghanistan, which is the home, the base and the state of, and the sovereignty giving succour to, al-Qaeda. On the United States side, they allege that Hicks has attended an advanced al-Qaeda training course. In other words, he was becoming a specialist in weapons, tactics, explosives and the deployment of those instruments in accord with the level of attacks we saw in New York and elsewhere in the United States on 11 September. He was an al-Qaeda operative, the Americans allege, who took orders from Osama bin Laden.
This is an organisation that has carried out significant and substantial terrorist attacks in Spain, with the Madrid bombing in March of 2004, and on the USS Cole, where 17 sailors were killed. The Beslan school siege is linked to them. There were the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Yemen in 1992, Somalia in 1993, Operation Bojinka, and Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996—the list goes on. This is one of the most dastardly, callous and murderous organisations that the world has ever seen. David Hicks was found or caught in amongst them. That is the American side. It is also alleged that Hicks conducted surveillance on United States embassies. Let us not forget that the United States is our best and most significant strategic ally, and we have an Australian citizen on the ground in Afghanistan being arrested in December 2001.
Let us look at the Hicks story. That was the American side. The Hicks story was set out on 9 December 2006 in Victoria Square at a rally that featured Kay Danes, Brian Deegan, Mem Fox, Terry Hicks—and I take it that is Terry Hicks, the father of David Hicks—Professor Leon Lack, Charles Southwood, Katie Wood et al. Their story is that David Hicks did the following. Worried by the reported massacres in Kosovo in 1999, David travelled to Yugoslavia but arrived after the fighting was over. He then went to Pakistan to study at various theological colleges. He travelled to Afghanistan and after some months decided to return to Australia. At the Pakistan border he realised he had left his passport behind and returned in a taxi to retrieve it. The taxidriver had a cousin connected with the Northern Alliance and David was captured by them as he left the taxi. A few weeks later the Northern Alliance sold David to the Americans, who had just invaded Afghanistan.
These are two stories that could not be further apart. One story is that he is a murderous terrorist and the other is that he is a theological tourist. What are the Americans or the Australians or any decent sovereign nation to do with two stories like that?
—Try him!
—The answer is: try him. Do not let him go. Do not release him on bail to report daily to the local cop shop. Try him—incarcerate him until the veracity of those stories is determined. The Military Commissions Act says:
Any person subject to this chapter who provides material support or resources, knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, an act of terrorism ... or who intentionally provides material support or resources to an international terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the United States, knowing that such organization has engaged or engages in terrorism ... shall be punished as a military commission under this chapter may direct.
 ‘Material support’ is defined as:
... any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials ...
He is charged with aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation, to put it in more Australian terminology.
—Is he charged or was there a press release?
—He has been charged with attempted murder and he has been charged with providing material support. It just goes to show how senators are paying attention to this. He has been charged with providing material support to the Taliban, material support and resources to a terrorist organisation. They are the charges. These are very serious charges. Senator Stott Despoja says that this is retrospective. She then criticises members of the government for being judge and jury. Let me say this: if these charges are retrospective, the point is one for preliminary determination by the commission, as it properly should be. We may have a different legal position in this country, but that is not the point. The legislation has been transitioned over a long period. Indeed, the offence with which Hicks is apparently charged has been on the statute books in the United States for much longer than September 2001.
—Since 1994.
—Since 1994. Accordingly, justice should take its course. The process is: we have the swearing of the charges. Following the charges being sworn, there is a referral from the legal adviser to the convening authority. The convening authority is actually Judge Susan Crawford, a former judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. (Time expired)

I can now say that it seems the opposition and the minor parties have all lined up against the government. I am not going to say any more than that. It is appropriate that we do put a united front forward because the government are in disarray on this, and they should really straighten it out.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I rise this afternoon to speak in favour of the amended motion before us. Those of us from South Australia have for some time been appalled by the detention of David Hicks, which has now been for a period in excess of five years. I can tell the Senate that in South Australia there is an increasing groundswell of members of the community who regard his ongoing detention as a grave abrogation of the rule of law. In simple terms, really, he is just an Australian citizen not getting a fair go and who is being treated as a second-class citizen when compared to the treatment that has been afforded to US citizens by the US government. I would have thought that most people in the Australian community would agree with that and see this as a pretty fundamental matter—but not the people on the other side; not the members of the Howard government. It appears that there is no-one in the Howard government who is prepared to acknowledge this indisputable fact.
The ALP, and our new leader Kevin Rudd, have said that we believe that David Hicks should be repatriated to Australia with the utmost speed and that he should be subjected to the force of Australian law. That is the reason we are now able to agree with this amended motion of Senator Stott Despoja’s, which provides in the last line that he be ‘repatriated immediately for trial in Australia’.
I must congratulate Senator Stott Despoja on the motion that she has prepared today and on the work she has done on this issue. In fact, she and I have worked together. We have put aside political differences to work together as South Australian senators, in Adelaide in our home state of South Australia, to advance this matter and to attempt to get justice for our constituent David Hicks. In fact just last month in January she and I called on the Howard government to facilitate a cross-party delegation of MPs to visit Guantanamo Bay. The purpose of our visit would be to provide support to Mr Hicks and also to inspect the conditions of his detention and to report back to the parliament. What response did we receive from the government? Absolutely none.
I have previously applied to visit my constituent David Hicks in Guantanamo Bay. In fact it was 18 months ago. Not surprisingly, I received a response from the US Department of Defense in July 2005 informing me that, with only a few exceptions, non-US nationals are not permitted to visit Guantanamo Bay and parliamentarians from third countries have not been permitted to visit the facility. I was disappointed by this response because, at that point, many members of the US congress, including their staff and members of the press, had gone to Guantanamo Bay.
—It’s an American facility, for God’s sake, Linda!
—Senator Ferguson points out that that is because it is a US facility. He may be interested to learn that, subsequently, in May last year a delegation from the European parliament visited and a delegation from the UK parliament—in fact, the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee—visited the facility in September last year.
—And never spoke to a prisoner.
—Senator Ferguson says they did not speak to a prisoner, which is true. However, we would still like to—
—All the Britons have been taken back to England.
—That is true. Senator Carr indicates that it is because the British have been returned to their own country. Our government has not been prepared to insist that our citizen David Hicks be returned, yet the UK members of parliament visited the facility, got a briefing about it and had a good chance to look around. We also would like to be able to do this, especially as we still have one of our own citizens in Guantanamo Bay.
Anyway, as Senator Stott Despoja’s motion alludes to, there are really two issues that are particularly pertinent at the moment, and I will deal with the second of them first. Senator Stott Despoja says in her motion that Mr Hicks’s mental and physical health has deteriorated in recent months, particularly after 11 months in solitary confinement, and he should be repatriated immediately for trial in Australia. I want to deal with the second aspect of Senator Stott Despoja’s motion—that is, the mental health of David Hicks. Many South Australians are very concerned about the mental health of Mr Hicks. Of course, most concerned would be Terry Hicks, with whom we are all familiar, and the other members of his family. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, recently conceded that his recent statement that David was ‘fit and well’ was made on a five-minute assessment of David that was made by a US embassy staff member without any medical training.
—That’s rubbish! It was 25 minutes.
—Maybe it was 25 minutes. That is not what I understand to be the case, but, even if that is so, this person does not have any medical training, so how could they possibly form an opinion?
—She is a psychiatrist.
—This is all news to me. In relation to Mr Hicks’s welfare, the Australian people want to see an independent medical opinion, not that of somebody from the US embassy. This government should be demanding that an independent psychiatrist go into the facility and assess the mental health of one of Australia’s citizens, David Hicks.
In the time I have available I also want to briefly address the first part of Senator Stott Despoja’s motion, which goes to the nature of the military commission process and how flawed it is. In her motion Senator Stott Despoja referred to the fact that the military commission process allows convictions to take place on the basis of evidence obtained by coercion and hearsay and strips away habeas corpus. The Military Commissions Act 2006, passed by the US congress last year, is the second attempt by that legislature to put in place a military commission system that will meet constitutional standards. Of course, the first attempt was found to be unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in Hamdan v Rumsfeld.
All this act effectively does is replace the illegal military commission system that existed before with a system that simply fails to comply with the standards set down by the Supreme Court. What does it do? It attempts to remove the application of the Geneva conventions, which, the Supreme Court found, the old system violated. It bars aliens held as enemy combatants from filing a suit by the writ of habeas corpus to challenge the legality of their detention or to raise claims of torture and other mistreatment. This provision covers all noncitizens and even applies after the detainees are released. As a result, detainees who have been tortured or otherwise mistreated are forever barred from going to a court to seek redress and have heard what happened to them whilst they were in detention.
There are many other problems with the Military Commissions Act. As I mentioned, it allows military judges to admit coerced statements. It creates a national security privilege, which allows the government to keep classified information secret from military defence counsel. It permits a military commission judge to admit hearsay evidence that would not be admissible in a court martial. Finally, but certainly not least, the act gives the Secretary of Defense unprecedented power to prescribe military commission procedures, rules and regulations for the manner in which the military judges are selected.
The Military Commissions Act 2006 has been criticised in the United States and elsewhere as unconstitutional. Besides authorising substandard military trials for suspected terrorists, the new laws bar detainees from asserting their rights to habeas corpus and they attempt to render the Geneva conventions unenforceable in court. I, like many South Australians, am extremely angry that this government believes Mr Hicks will be given a fair trial under this system. All Australians have the right to know that, if they get into trouble with the law overseas, the Australian government will stand up for their right to be tried through a fair process. In this case, the Howard government has failed this basic test.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mr David Hicks</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2007-02-06,"—I think Senator Ludwig has made the statement of the year, already, when he said that the government is in total disarray over this issue. Senator Stott Despoja came into the chamber with an urgency motion and gave a very confused speech to start with. Senator Nettle then spoke in support of the motion. Senator Ludwig then came in and said the opposition could not support the motion because it did not suit their particular needs. We had Senator Carr interjecting incessantly—and we know he hates America and all things American—and then the boss must have sent a message for Senator Ludwig. The boss is very right wing and purports to love everything American. And you say we are in disarray!
I cannot believe you, Senator Ludwig; I just cannot believe you. We are ‘in disarray’ yet you have a motion before the chair which you will not support and then, after a little bit of argy-bargy, you come back with a motion that you can all now support—and we did not hear either Senator Ludwig or Senator Kirk speak to the additional words—with the words ‘to face justice in Australia’. What I want to know is: how can David Hicks face justice in Australia? He has committed no crime in Australia that I know of, no crime whatsoever in Australia, so what justice is David Hicks going to face in Australia? It is just impossible. You have not thought this through. You have made your policy on the run.

Senator Carr interjecting—

—You have put this down here: ‘to face justice in Australia’. Madam Acting Deputy President, I think that we gave Senator Ludwig a pretty fair run. If Senator Carr could keep his mouth shut, the rest of us might be able to too. Senators opposite—Senator Kirk in particular—talked about a delegation to Guantanamo Bay. The Americans decide who will go to Guantanamo Bay; we don’t as it is their facility. The UK foreign affairs committee that went there saw the facility—nobody knows how far they got into the facility—spoke to no prisoner and then came back and passed their judgement. If you care to read their report, you will find that it was not very critical of Guantanamo Bay at all.
Senator Stott Despoja said that senators on this side must state clearly where they stand on this issue. We intend to, Senator Stott Despoja; we intend to state quite clearly where we stand on this issue. When it comes to visiting other prisons around the world, I presume that Senator Kirk would like to go overseas to every other prison where the at least 180-odd Australians are held in custody and see what conditions they live in as well—but, no, it is just David Hicks, the martyr of the day; that is the one that you are going to put all your effort and concentration into. I never hear you complaining about the conditions that the Bali nine are facing up in Indonesia. All we hear about is what might be happening to David Hicks.
Senator Marshall wants to bring him home and try him. Under what law do you want to try him, Senator Marshall? Under what charge and under what law do you want to try David Hicks in Australia? There is simply no provision to charge David Hicks in Australia. Australian law applies to Australian jurisdiction. I have always been of the view that when you leave Australia’s shore you are subject to the law of whichever sovereign country you are visiting. In the case of David Hicks, he entered what was a theatre of war. He is a prisoner of war—that is all he is.
—No, he’s not.
—Yes, he is.
—No, he’s not. He’s not a prisoner of war—that’s the point.
 (Senator Crossin)—Order! Senator Carr!
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I think I should be allowed to speak so that I can at least hear myself.
—Senator Ferguson, you have the call.
—The Australian government has made no assumption in relation to Mr Hicks’s guilt or innocence. It has made no assumptions whatsoever.

Senator Carr interjecting—

—Senator Carr, the Australian government has made no assumptions in relation to his guilt or innocence. We say that the process that has been put in place must be allowed to go on because it is important. It is the only way that David Hicks can be put before a court. He is in America because he is their prisoner, not ours. We in the Australian government—and the Prime Minister has repeated this—have been concerned all along at the delays in progressing the case. But we need to remember that the first charges were laid after he had been held for two years, Hicks’s lawyers then appealed, the Supreme Court upheld their appeal and so they started again. David Hicks has no need to be in detention. If he had not been in Afghanistan in the first place, he would not be in detention.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—He would not be there if he had not been in Afghanistan in the first place. So when he goes to another country and is captured—

Senator Carr interjecting—

—It is not against the law to be in Afghanistan. Under our law now it is illegal to train with a terrorist organisation. As for you people who would be prepared to defend David Hicks, those of you who want him to go scot-free—that is your real intention; you want him to go scot-free—
—That’s not true, and you know it.
—It is. That is your intention, because you know—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—If you do not want him to go scot-free, you tell us what you are going to charge him under if you bring him back to Australia—and that is what you want; you want him repatriated to Australia to face justice in Australia. Tell us under what law and on what crime he has committed he can be brought to justice in Australia. Not one of you can answer that question. It is all to do with the process where you feel some public sympathy, and a lot of Australians feel some sympathy for someone who has not undergone a trial after this period of time. But I tell you this: not one of you who have added this—‘to face justice in Australia’—can say under what law he will be charged. How can he face a court in Australia when there is no charge to answer in Australia? Can you please tell us what you want to charge him under.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—If you want him to come back to face justice, you have got to be able to tell us what crime he has committed and what part of Australian law would allow him to face justice in Australia. I will be opposing this motion and I hope so will be all of my colleagues. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This inquiry was referred to the committee on 21 October 2002. It received 78 submissions and held 11 hearings, in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Darwin, Kununurra, Griffith, Moree, St George and Berri. The inquiry dealt with the important topic of the state of rural industry based water resource usage and options for optimising water resource usage for sustainable agriculture—an issue that I note we are talking about yet again. The report addresses the issue of water access entitlements, environmental management needs, water trading arrangements, structural adjustment assistance, unintended consequences of water trade and the recovery of overallocated water. Does this sound familiar to anybody? These are all clearly important and outstanding issues.
The committee report was tabled in August 2004, but it was January 2007 before the government response was tabled out of session, which leads me to question whether the government was truly interested in water before the issue became a political hot potato in the polls. Does this seem like the actions of a government that had its eye on the ball and, until very recently, had been taking the issue of water resources seriously?
—Yeah.
—It has taken 2½ years to respond, and this is all of a sudden an issue, is it? So it was not an issue until it became a poll issue. Looking at the response to the committee’s recommendations, it strikes me that the government have not been engaging with the substantive issues. There is an air of defensiveness and reference to a number of recent initiatives that do not directly address the committee’s concerns. In fact, they list a range of initiatives that have not been fully implemented, or implemented at all, such as returning any environmental flows to the Murray. Not one drop has yet been returned. They have not even found the 500 gigalitres they are supposed to find.
It is worth noting that the committee raised the issue of speculation and profiteering in water markets. The government response denies there is an issue and that it is likely to be a problem. I very strongly suggest that they revisit this response, given their announcement of $3 billion being made available for buying back water entitlements and the comments that there will be a need for a strategy to deal with this so that profiteering does not occur. I strongly suggest that they need to rethink this.
Around the time that this inquiry commenced in 2002, another Senate inquiry into another aspect of water concluded. The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee inquiry report into urban water management was entitled The value of water. That report dealt with the management and resource security of water supplies for our cities, including projected population growth and consumption, sustainable water use and demand resource strategies, urban stormwater management, improving water quality, water recycling initiatives and the effectiveness of market mechanisms for achieving efficiency gains. Again, these are all outstanding and important issues. What was the government’s response to this inquiry? How much did they value it? The answer is: I do not know, because four years later they have still not responded to it.
What about the 2004 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry entitled Getting water right(s)—the future of rural Australia? This report dealt with important issues of water policy, frameworks, water rights, water trading et cetera. This has still not been responded to. Can we conclude from these remarks that the government has not been taking the issue of water in Australia seriously—and, as an aside, the role of the Senate committee seriously? But the ultimate outcome is that the government has still not seriously come to grips with the issue of water resource management. It has only jumped on the bandwagon lately when it has been under so much pressure that it can no longer ignore the issue.
If you take the time to look through the issues covered and the recommendations made by this series of parliamentary inquiries—and it appears that the government has failed to do so—it becomes clear that many people have been giving consideration to the water resource issues of this country for a long time, but the government has consistently failed to deal with the oncoming water crisis. It has not just appeared all of a sudden; it has been growing for years. The response—and we saw it again today—was: ‘Let’s just blame the states. Let’s blame the states, focus on them, and not actually acknowledge that the Commonwealth had a role to play as well.’
Last year we again saw an increase in the number of people raising the issue. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission repeatedly told the government that our storages were getting to dangerously low levels. They reported very frequently. In October, Wendy Craik from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission told the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport that, if the situation continues, it looks as though we will be effectively emptying our storages by the end of the irrigation year—that is, by April-May this year, which is three months away, by the way. Did the government respond to this? No, they did not respond to anything until the beginning of November when they called a water summit for three hours on Melbourne Cup Day—where, by the way, one of the solutions canvassed by the Prime Minister was that we could drain wetlands. That is in the face of the fact that 90 per cent of the wetlands of the Murray-Darling system have been degraded. I believe they are likely beyond repair. This is again policy on the run.
The report that came out in January does not at all canvass the government’s new policy initiatives announced on 25 January, committing $10 billion to an uncosted plan. There was no consultation with either the states or, as it now turns out, major government departments who could (a) provide advice and (b) do the costings. We have not been told how much water is going to be returned to the Murray. The Prime Minister’s 10-point plan makes no comments about commitments to how much water will be returned to the Murray. Five hundred gigalitres is the very minimum, the lowest common denominator, that all the states and the Commonwealth could agree to. The Commonwealth was a party to that. It did not stand by like Pontius Pilate and wash its hands and say to the states, ‘You make up your mind.’ It was part of the process of deciding on 500 gigalitres.
But the Prime Minister’s plan does not commit to a target for returning any further water to the Murray. The panel of scientific experts recommended that 3,500 gigalitres of water was needed to give the Murray a good chance of recovery. The Prime Minister’s statement makes no comment on how much water is going to be returned to the Murray. The government want to take control of the states, presumably to try to manage the situation better. But they had a chance in December when the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was being amended through the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006. A number of proposed amendments to that bill related to giving the government a trigger for matters of environmental significance. But did they want this trigger? No, they did not. Under legislation they could have had that trigger, with no fighting with the states about whether it is constitutional or not. They did not have to fight with the states; they could have simply added a trigger to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to give them the power to make assessments and get involved in water management. On 7 December we were debating that very thing in this chamber. The government did not want controls then, but on 25 January they wanted controls. Now they are going to be embroiled in a long fight with the states.
Yesterday the Treasurer made it quite clear that no money will be delivered to this water plan unless the states agree. No money will flow—pardon the pun—until the states agree. By the way, very little money has flowed to the Murray to date. None of the $2 billion has been spent; not one drop of water has been returned to the Murray. Now we have yet another promise of $10 billion for the Murray that is uncosted, with no evaluation yet given on how much water we are going to return to the Murray. We are spending $6 billion on water efficiency, with half of that saving going back to the agriculturalist and the farmer. So we are spending $6 billion to only get back half of the water that is saved in efficiencies. Why aren’t we getting all that water back for environmental flows? We are only getting half of it back—$6 billion for half of the water that is saved.
There is no timetable; in fact, already Minister McGauran is backing away from buying water entitlements. Two days after the Prime Minister made his statement, Minister McGauran was already backing away from the question of how they are going to implement this plan and how they are going to buy back water allocations. No commitment has been given to the urgency of returning environmental flows to areas in crisis, such as the Macquarie lakes and the Gwydir wetlands. There is no timetable set. (Time expired)

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2007-02-06,"—Thanks very much for this unexpected pleasure. Senator Siewert, thank you for your contribution. I am sure that you believe what you say, but I do not. I think it is an absolute disgrace that somehow there would be a view around that water and climate change is a Greens issue. It is not a Greens issue at all; it is our issue. It is every Australian’s issue. You do not have to be green to believe. As to some of the things that you dated back to 2002 that suggest there has been some sort of knee-jerk reaction, I think most people know that I have been on this case since the first day I stood up in this parliament in December 1996. These things do not happen overnight, and I am very proud of the fact that the government has made a $10 billion gesture to sort out the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin has been completely mismanaged over many years by governments of all persuasions—and nothing the Greens, the Democrats or any other plaited armpit party that came along could do would do anything about it.
The government are doing something about it. There is no use in any rhetoric that returning 3½ thousand gigalitres to the Murray is going to fix the Murray when Mother Nature is going to take another 3,000 gigalitres out of the catchment of the Murray-Darling Basin. You are talking about returning 6½ thousand gigalitres to have any consequence for the environmental outflows and the long-term outlook for Mother Earth in the Murray-Darling Basin. I have to say that the states do not have the capacity to do that. They simply do not have the capacity, and people like Craig Knowles have acknowledged that to me over the years. There are a lot of people genuinely concerned. Senator Siewert is genuinely concerned. We are genuinely concerned, but we do not have to be green to be concerned.
These are issues that will not be fixed by more speeches in this place. They will only be fixed by addressing some of the things that have to be done. As Senator Campbell said to me today, the Barmah Choke could have been fixed ages ago but the Victorian government could not come up with the engineering plan to do it, or they might have funded it.
There are smart alec politics in all of this for everyone, and I hope you all have a wonderful time, but the fact remains that the government has put its money where its mouth is. It is the first government to do that, and hopefully we will fix things like the evaporation of the Menindee Lakes. The Menindee Lakes evaporate two or three times, they tell me—though I always say that for every litre they pump up the river a litre evaporates, so the water evaporates more. Everyone knows my view on the disgusting water plan of the Lower Balonne, and I was pleased to see Peter Beattie today put the kibosh on the auction of that water on the Warrego. I think he has shown some leadership on things like recycling. Certainly, I know what the federal government’s view is on the Lower Balonne—it ought to be sorted out.
I have a very strong view, as you know, on overland water harvesting: I think the system cannot stand it. I am aware and you are aware of our ‘latest’ water hearing, as you referred to it, in 2002. I have been on three of these water hearings since 2002, so to say that we have not done some homework would be a misrepresentation of the facts. I am aware that there are certainly a lot of things that we can do to improve the system. I am aware that, if we do not remove some activity from the Murray-Darling Basin, the sums are never going to add up. I am aware that climate change is going to have a detrimental effect on the rainfall and run-off of southern Australia. I am aware that there are great opportunities in the north. So I hope that you and everyone else in Australia will get behind the federal government’s determination to sort out Australia’s water issues. I had a discussion with Senator Colbeck today about the potential of Tasmania’s water. I am also aware that they do not have any idea about water trading or any other damn thing down there—but, anyhow, they have made great strides in Tassie with laser surgery.
Things like water and climate change, Senator Siewert—I was compelled to get up—are our issues. They are not the preserve of some green party or some other group; they are every Australian’s issues. All Australians ought to be informed that we are not the global culprits in climate change. Someone ought to take a camera and go to the Amazon and see what is happening in the top end of Brazil, go to China and see what they are doing there or go to India. The most telling thing of the report out of London the other day, which I do not see getting a run anywhere, is that within 50 years half of the world’s population is going to be water poor. I keep saying that 600 million people in northern China are going to run out of water not because of anything to do with climate change; they are actually mining the aquifer, which means they are mining their future food resource. These are all our issues if we are going to have a planet we can still live on.
With great respect to you, Senator Siewert, the government has shown a lot of leadership in this, and I am pleased that some of the premiers are coming on board. Perhaps Premier Rann in South Australia spent too much time dreaming with his former boss, Dunstan. Premier Rann can be a big winner out of this, and it will not be the preserve of any political party to hijack the process. It is an issue for all Australians. It is important that we all get together as a team and resolve these issues. I am sorry to have to say, Senator Siewert, that we do have the courage to put the money where our mouth is and to spend it wisely. I just hope that you are part of the solution and not part of the problem.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I rise to speak to the government’s response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee’s report. I want to start by briefly responding to a couple of things Senator Heffernan said. I hope he was not speaking of former Premier Dunstan in disrespectful terms. He was a Premier much loved by many South Australians, whose legacy in social justice and reform across a range of areas led the nation. One thing that was interesting about the contribution of Senator Heffernan was that he did not defend the response to the report. The reason he could not defend the response to the report is that the response is outdated.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—You have not read it, Senator? I will take that interjection. He says he has not read it, and fair enough. The point is that the response is outdated. It reflects government policy as it was just over a month ago but apparently does not reflect government policy anymore. That is the issue I want to speak on, because I am sure my colleagues may want to speak more directly on the issue of water. Certainly Senator O’Brien has had some involvement in these issues. The point I want to make is: we are currently debating a response to a report—and I think Senator Siewert indicated the incredibly delayed time line associated with this response—received in December and tabled I think out of session, which is now completely out of date. Despite the fact that as at December 2006 the government had one position, now all of a sudden magically as at January we have another position.
—Not magically; it took a lot of hard work.
—Senator Heffernan says it was not magical, and so I ask this: when the response was signed off, was someone lying? Was someone misleading the Senate? If it is the case that you were already planning to do your big $10 billion initiative, which you say was not cobbled together very quickly, how is it the case that the parliamentary secretary agreed to have a response to a report tabled that did not reflect the government’s position? I suggest that the reason is that that was your position then but your position, after a significant period of public debate and public discussion about the water crisis that is affecting so much particularly of southern Australia—
—More by me than anyone else.
—You can take that view if you want, but I might make my contribution to the Senate, because Labor has actually been talking about the Murray-Darling Basin for some time. I recall that at the last election we went with a commitment to restore 1,500 gigalitres to the river. As a South Australian, I am keenly aware of the need to restore the Murray to health. Those of us in Adelaide have a very direct understanding of the importance of that river system’s health to our families, to our homes and to the state economy, obviously.
This government has belatedly become aware of the importance of doing something major on water. We know that it announced on 25 January this $10 billion package. That is a good step. We are glad that the government wants to do something in relation to water, but it is indicated by the response to this report that as at December you were still saying that it was essentially business as usual. We can see this if we look at the preamble. We have a statement such as:
The Australian Government is committed to the efficient and effective management of Australia’s water resources, as its role in developing the National Water Initiative (NWI) and the Murray Darling Basin Agreement attests.
Implementation of the NWI will be overseen by the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council in line with detailed implementation plans to be developed by each State and Territory and the Australian Government and accredited by the National Water Commission.
Page 4 of the response goes on to say:
Under the NWI, State and Territory governments have agreed to planning frameworks that, once initiated, will be characterised by planning processes in which there is adequate opportunity for productive, environmental and other public benefit considerations to be identified ...
That is completely not the position now. Your announcement of 25 January completely superseded that, and that may well be appropriate. But we want to know, if you are saying that this has been in the pipeline for ages, why it is that Senator Minchin is unable to confirm when the costings were provided to his department. Why is it that in your announcement you cannot provide detailed costings, including the time line of the expenditure? Why is it that when the Treasurer is asked why he cannot provide detailed costings he comes up with—may I suggest an extremely lame excuse—‘We don’t know how much it will cost until the states sign up’?
The problem with that argument is that—as Senator Sherry interjected in question time today—if you know what the aggregate cost is, surely you know the bits that make up the aggregate. If you know that it is going to cost $10 billion, surely you know a bit about what makes up the $10 billion. But, no, the government just comes up with a figure; it is not able to say where it is going to be spent and how it is going to be spent nor the time line. We have the minister for finance unable to say when the Department of Finance and Administration actually obtained the costings and we have a report in December which is completely contrary—
—You want us to go to your climate change summit to help you work it out.
—Senator Heffernan, you actually had your opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. As I understand it, I have the call at the moment.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Wong.
—Thank you. We had the government in December saying, ‘It is essentially business as usual’—the framework that has been in place for a number of years—and then on 25 January we had a completely different approach. The government want us to believe that this has been properly costed, properly considered and properly thought through, and they want us to believe that this is nothing to do with politics. It is a very difficult position for the government to take and, as I said, I did not see or hear Senator Heffernan defending the government’s response, which is usually what happens in the context of government responses to reports. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary will do so. Perhaps Senator Joyce will do so. We will wait and see. What we have is yet another indication that the 25 January Murray-Darling Basin plan was hastily prepared for political reasons. We on this side of the chamber have real concerns that it has not been properly planned and properly costed. We know, for example, that at the 7 November meeting the Prime Minister said:
We’ve agreed that we have to collaborate and have a basin wide approach to the problem. We’ve quite specifically asked a group of officials to be convened by my Department to report by the 15th of December to us on contingency planning to secure urban and other water supplies during the water year 2007-08 ... We’ve also agreed to accelerate the implementation of proposals under the National Water Initiative ...
What is extraordinary is that just over a month ago the formal response to a government report on rural water usage stated that the way forward on water was business as usual. In November last year—just a short time ago—we had the Prime Minister articulating the same view, saying that we are going to work through this collaboratively. Then we had a 25 January announcement. All this evidence suggests that until at least mid-December 2006 it was clear the Commonwealth was not planning to take over the Murray-Darling Basin. If the government did envisage the direction of the January statement then you would have to ask why the response to the Senate committee report was prepared and tabled in the terms that it was.
We do not want policy on the run on these important issues. Yet we have a Howard government that is very politically clever—very clever at making the announcement when it thinks that there is sufficient public pressure to do so and when the politics are right. What we do not have, with due respect, Senator Heffernan, is a government that thinks long term about the long-term sustainability challenges facing this country. The government is interested in short-term political solutions and that is why we have comments from climate change sceptics such as Minister Macfarlane last year when he dismissed the Al Gore film as entertainment. We now have a government that is trying to portray itself as being serious about issues such as water and climate change. I think people will become increasingly aware of the way in which the government seeks to respond with a political fix rather than with a long-term policy position in the long-term interests of the nation to address long-term challenges into the future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I will not detain the Senate for an inordinate period of time, and I understand I may have a limited amount. I also want to draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport has a reference before it in relation to Murray-Darling Basin legislation. The matter was referred to the committee on 7 December, and it proposes changes to the legislation which are completely inconsistent with the government’s announced approach of taking over control of the Murray-Darling Basin.
Senator Wong has just very clearly indicated the absolute contradiction in the government’s response to the longstanding Senate committee report on rural water usage, which was, as I understand it, prepared and lodged in December and published in January. But on 7 December, the government introduced legislation into the House of Representatives which also confirms that the government’s position in early December was completely inconsistent with the position that the Prime Minister announced in relation to the takeover of the Murray-Darling Basin. When the government gets it wrong, when the government breaks the rules in relation to the time it takes to respond to reports, as it did with this response, and when it produces the response out of session, it is ironic that the production of that response, and indeed the legislation that I refer to, proves absolutely that this government throughout December did not consider its proposal to take over the Murray-Darling Basin and that it has lately come to that view.
Frankly, it is about time that the Prime Minister came clean and admitted that this is an election year plan—a plan to announce spending which they have not properly considered nor properly costed because it gives a good media burst. Frankly, it is not good enough for a government that has been in power for approaching 11 years to now say, ‘We have a solution.’ It is about spending money some way. We are going to explore that. The solution is the important thing. We are also aware that this is a very politically clever Prime Minister and this is a politically clever ploy. It is not in the interests of the Murray-Darling Basin at all; it is in the interests of the Liberal Party. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

In fact, they list a range of initiatives that have not been fully implemented, or implemented at all, such as returning any environmental flows to the Murray. Not one drop has yet been returned. They have not even found the 500 gigalitres they are supposed to find.
It is worth noting that the committee raised the issue of speculation and profiteering in water markets. The government response denies there is an issue and that it is likely to be a problem. I very strongly suggest that they revisit this response, given their announcement of $3 billion being made available for buying back water entitlements and the comments that there will be a need for a strategy to deal with this so that profiteering does not occur. I strongly suggest that they need to rethink this.
Around the time that this inquiry commenced in 2002, another Senate inquiry into another aspect of water concluded. The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee inquiry report into urban water management was entitled The value of water. That report dealt with the management and resource security of water supplies for our cities, including projected population growth and consumption, sustainable water use and demand resource strategies, urban stormwater management, improving water quality, water recycling initiatives and the effectiveness of market mechanisms for achieving efficiency gains. Again, these are all outstanding and important issues. What was the government’s response to this inquiry? How much did they value it? The answer is: I do not know, because four years later they have still not responded to it.
What about the 2004 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry entitled Getting water right(s)—the future of rural Australia? This report dealt with important issues of water policy, frameworks, water rights, water trading et cetera. This has still not been responded to. Can we conclude from these remarks that the government has not been taking the issue of water in Australia seriously—and, as an aside, the role of the Senate committee seriously? But the ultimate outcome is that the government has still not seriously come to grips with the issue of water resource management. It has only jumped on the bandwagon lately when it has been under so much pressure that it can no longer ignore the issue.
If you take the time to look through the issues covered and the recommendations made by this series of parliamentary inquiries—and it appears that the government has failed to do so—it becomes clear that many people have been giving consideration to the water resource issues of this country for a long time, but the government has consistently failed to deal with the oncoming water crisis. It has not just appeared all of a sudden; it has been growing for years. The response—and we saw it again today—was: ‘Let’s just blame the states. Let’s blame the states, focus on them, and not actually acknowledge that the Commonwealth had a role to play as well.’
Last year we again saw an increase in the number of people raising the issue. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission repeatedly told the government that our storages were getting to dangerously low levels. They reported very frequently. In October, Wendy Craik from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission told the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport that, if the situation continues, it looks as though we will be effectively emptying our storages by the end of the irrigation year—that is, by April-May this year, which is three months away, by the way. Did the government respond to this? No, they did not respond to anything until the beginning of November when they called a water summit for three hours on Melbourne Cup Day—where, by the way, one of the solutions canvassed by the Prime Minister was that we could drain wetlands. That is in the face of the fact that 90 per cent of the wetlands of the Murray-Darling system have been degraded. I believe they are likely beyond repair. This is again policy on the run.
The report that came out in January does not at all canvass the government’s new policy initiatives announced on 25 January, committing $10 billion to an uncosted plan. There was no consultation with either the states or, as it now turns out, major government departments who could (a) provide advice and (b) do the costings. We have not been told how much water is going to be returned to the Murray. The Prime Minister’s 10-point plan makes no comments about commitments to how much water will be returned to the Murray. Five hundred gigalitres is the very minimum, the lowest common denominator, that all the states and the Commonwealth could agree to. The Commonwealth was a party to that. It did not stand by like Pontius Pilate and wash its hands and say to the states, ‘You make up your mind.’ It was part of the process of deciding on 500 gigalitres.
But the Prime Minister’s plan does not commit to a target for returning any further water to the Murray. The panel of scientific experts recommended that 3,500 gigalitres of water was needed to give the Murray a good chance of recovery. The Prime Minister’s statement makes no comment on how much water is going to be returned to the Murray. The government want to take control of the states, presumably to try to manage the situation better. But they had a chance in December when the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was being amended through the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006. A number of proposed amendments to that bill related to giving the government a trigger for matters of environmental significance. But did they want this trigger? No, they did not. Under legislation they could have had that trigger, with no fighting with the states about whether it is constitutional or not. They did not have to fight with the states; they could have simply added a trigger to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to give them the power to make assessments and get involved in water management. On 7 December we were debating that very thing in this chamber. The government did not want controls then, but on 25 January they wanted controls. Now they are going to be embroiled in a long fight with the states.
Yesterday the Treasurer made it quite clear that no money will be delivered to this water plan unless the states agree. No money will flow—pardon the pun—until the states agree. By the way, very little money has flowed to the Murray to date. None of the $2 billion has been spent; not one drop of water has been returned to the Murray. Now we have yet another promise of $10 billion for the Murray that is uncosted, with no evaluation yet given on how much water we are going to return to the Murray. We are spending $6 billion on water efficiency, with half of that saving going back to the agriculturalist and the farmer. So we are spending $6 billion to only get back half of the water that is saved in efficiencies. Why aren’t we getting all that water back for environmental flows? We are only getting half of it back—$6 billion for half of the water that is saved.
There is no timetable; in fact, already Minister McGauran is backing away from buying water entitlements. Two days after the Prime Minister made his statement, Minister McGauran was already backing away from the question of how they are going to implement this plan and how they are going to buy back water allocations. No commitment has been given to the urgency of returning environmental flows to areas in crisis, such as the Macquarie lakes and the Gwydir wetlands. There is no timetable set. (Time expired)

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2007-02-06,"—Thanks very much for this unexpected pleasure. Senator Siewert, thank you for your contribution. I am sure that you believe what you say, but I do not. I think it is an absolute disgrace that somehow there would be a view around that water and climate change is a Greens issue. It is not a Greens issue at all; it is our issue. It is every Australian’s issue. You do not have to be green to believe. As to some of the things that you dated back to 2002 that suggest there has been some sort of knee-jerk reaction, I think most people know that I have been on this case since the first day I stood up in this parliament in December 1996. These things do not happen overnight, and I am very proud of the fact that the government has made a $10 billion gesture to sort out the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin has been completely mismanaged over many years by governments of all persuasions—and nothing the Greens, the Democrats or any other plaited armpit party that came along could do would do anything about it.
The government are doing something about it. There is no use in any rhetoric that returning 3½ thousand gigalitres to the Murray is going to fix the Murray when Mother Nature is going to take another 3,000 gigalitres out of the catchment of the Murray-Darling Basin. You are talking about returning 6½ thousand gigalitres to have any consequence for the environmental outflows and the long-term outlook for Mother Earth in the Murray-Darling Basin. I have to say that the states do not have the capacity to do that. They simply do not have the capacity, and people like Craig Knowles have acknowledged that to me over the years. There are a lot of people genuinely concerned. Senator Siewert is genuinely concerned. We are genuinely concerned, but we do not have to be green to be concerned.
These are issues that will not be fixed by more speeches in this place. They will only be fixed by addressing some of the things that have to be done. As Senator Campbell said to me today, the Barmah Choke could have been fixed ages ago but the Victorian government could not come up with the engineering plan to do it, or they might have funded it.
There are smart alec politics in all of this for everyone, and I hope you all have a wonderful time, but the fact remains that the government has put its money where its mouth is. It is the first government to do that, and hopefully we will fix things like the evaporation of the Menindee Lakes. The Menindee Lakes evaporate two or three times, they tell me—though I always say that for every litre they pump up the river a litre evaporates, so the water evaporates more. Everyone knows my view on the disgusting water plan of the Lower Balonne, and I was pleased to see Peter Beattie today put the kibosh on the auction of that water on the Warrego. I think he has shown some leadership on things like recycling. Certainly, I know what the federal government’s view is on the Lower Balonne—it ought to be sorted out.
I have a very strong view, as you know, on overland water harvesting: I think the system cannot stand it. I am aware and you are aware of our ‘latest’ water hearing, as you referred to it, in 2002. I have been on three of these water hearings since 2002, so to say that we have not done some homework would be a misrepresentation of the facts. I am aware that there are certainly a lot of things that we can do to improve the system. I am aware that, if we do not remove some activity from the Murray-Darling Basin, the sums are never going to add up. I am aware that climate change is going to have a detrimental effect on the rainfall and run-off of southern Australia. I am aware that there are great opportunities in the north. So I hope that you and everyone else in Australia will get behind the federal government’s determination to sort out Australia’s water issues. I had a discussion with Senator Colbeck today about the potential of Tasmania’s water. I am also aware that they do not have any idea about water trading or any other damn thing down there—but, anyhow, they have made great strides in Tassie with laser surgery.
Things like water and climate change, Senator Siewert—I was compelled to get up—are our issues. They are not the preserve of some green party or some other group; they are every Australian’s issues. All Australians ought to be informed that we are not the global culprits in climate change. Someone ought to take a camera and go to the Amazon and see what is happening in the top end of Brazil, go to China and see what they are doing there or go to India. The most telling thing of the report out of London the other day, which I do not see getting a run anywhere, is that within 50 years half of the world’s population is going to be water poor. I keep saying that 600 million people in northern China are going to run out of water not because of anything to do with climate change; they are actually mining the aquifer, which means they are mining their future food resource. These are all our issues if we are going to have a planet we can still live on.
With great respect to you, Senator Siewert, the government has shown a lot of leadership in this, and I am pleased that some of the premiers are coming on board. Perhaps Premier Rann in South Australia spent too much time dreaming with his former boss, Dunstan. Premier Rann can be a big winner out of this, and it will not be the preserve of any political party to hijack the process. It is an issue for all Australians. It is important that we all get together as a team and resolve these issues. I am sorry to have to say, Senator Siewert, that we do have the courage to put the money where our mouth is and to spend it wisely. I just hope that you are part of the solution and not part of the problem.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,15,2
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I rise to speak to the government’s response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee’s report. I want to start by briefly responding to a couple of things Senator Heffernan said. I hope he was not speaking of former Premier Dunstan in disrespectful terms. He was a Premier much loved by many South Australians, whose legacy in social justice and reform across a range of areas led the nation. One thing that was interesting about the contribution of Senator Heffernan was that he did not defend the response to the report. The reason he could not defend the response to the report is that the response is outdated.

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—You have not read it, Senator? I will take that interjection. He says he has not read it, and fair enough. The point is that the response is outdated. It reflects government policy as it was just over a month ago but apparently does not reflect government policy anymore. That is the issue I want to speak on, because I am sure my colleagues may want to speak more directly on the issue of water. Certainly Senator O’Brien has had some involvement in these issues. The point I want to make is: we are currently debating a response to a report—and I think Senator Siewert indicated the incredibly delayed time line associated with this response—received in December and tabled I think out of session, which is now completely out of date. Despite the fact that as at December 2006 the government had one position, now all of a sudden magically as at January we have another position.
—Not magically; it took a lot of hard work.
—Senator Heffernan says it was not magical, and so I ask this: when the response was signed off, was someone lying? Was someone misleading the Senate? If it is the case that you were already planning to do your big $10 billion initiative, which you say was not cobbled together very quickly, how is it the case that the parliamentary secretary agreed to have a response to a report tabled that did not reflect the government’s position? I suggest that the reason is that that was your position then but your position, after a significant period of public debate and public discussion about the water crisis that is affecting so much particularly of southern Australia—
—More by me than anyone else.
—You can take that view if you want, but I might make my contribution to the Senate, because Labor has actually been talking about the Murray-Darling Basin for some time. I recall that at the last election we went with a commitment to restore 1,500 gigalitres to the river. As a South Australian, I am keenly aware of the need to restore the Murray to health. Those of us in Adelaide have a very direct understanding of the importance of that river system’s health to our families, to our homes and to the state economy, obviously.
This government has belatedly become aware of the importance of doing something major on water. We know that it announced on 25 January this $10 billion package. That is a good step. We are glad that the government wants to do something in relation to water, but it is indicated by the response to this report that as at December you were still saying that it was essentially business as usual. We can see this if we look at the preamble. We have a statement such as:
The Australian Government is committed to the efficient and effective management of Australia’s water resources, as its role in developing the National Water Initiative (NWI) and the Murray Darling Basin Agreement attests.
Implementation of the NWI will be overseen by the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council in line with detailed implementation plans to be developed by each State and Territory and the Australian Government and accredited by the National Water Commission.
Page 4 of the response goes on to say:
Under the NWI, State and Territory governments have agreed to planning frameworks that, once initiated, will be characterised by planning processes in which there is adequate opportunity for productive, environmental and other public benefit considerations to be identified ...
That is completely not the position now. Your announcement of 25 January completely superseded that, and that may well be appropriate. But we want to know, if you are saying that this has been in the pipeline for ages, why it is that Senator Minchin is unable to confirm when the costings were provided to his department. Why is it that in your announcement you cannot provide detailed costings, including the time line of the expenditure? Why is it that when the Treasurer is asked why he cannot provide detailed costings he comes up with—may I suggest an extremely lame excuse—‘We don’t know how much it will cost until the states sign up’?
The problem with that argument is that—as Senator Sherry interjected in question time today—if you know what the aggregate cost is, surely you know the bits that make up the aggregate. If you know that it is going to cost $10 billion, surely you know a bit about what makes up the $10 billion. But, no, the government just comes up with a figure; it is not able to say where it is going to be spent and how it is going to be spent nor the time line. We have the minister for finance unable to say when the Department of Finance and Administration actually obtained the costings and we have a report in December which is completely contrary—
—You want us to go to your climate change summit to help you work it out.
—Senator Heffernan, you actually had your opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. As I understand it, I have the call at the moment.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Wong.
—Thank you. We had the government in December saying, ‘It is essentially business as usual’—the framework that has been in place for a number of years—and then on 25 January we had a completely different approach. The government want us to believe that this has been properly costed, properly considered and properly thought through, and they want us to believe that this is nothing to do with politics. It is a very difficult position for the government to take and, as I said, I did not see or hear Senator Heffernan defending the government’s response, which is usually what happens in the context of government responses to reports. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary will do so. Perhaps Senator Joyce will do so. We will wait and see. What we have is yet another indication that the 25 January Murray-Darling Basin plan was hastily prepared for political reasons. We on this side of the chamber have real concerns that it has not been properly planned and properly costed. We know, for example, that at the 7 November meeting the Prime Minister said:
We’ve agreed that we have to collaborate and have a basin wide approach to the problem. We’ve quite specifically asked a group of officials to be convened by my Department to report by the 15th of December to us on contingency planning to secure urban and other water supplies during the water year 2007-08 ... We’ve also agreed to accelerate the implementation of proposals under the National Water Initiative ...
What is extraordinary is that just over a month ago the formal response to a government report on rural water usage stated that the way forward on water was business as usual. In November last year—just a short time ago—we had the Prime Minister articulating the same view, saying that we are going to work through this collaboratively. Then we had a 25 January announcement. All this evidence suggests that until at least mid-December 2006 it was clear the Commonwealth was not planning to take over the Murray-Darling Basin. If the government did envisage the direction of the January statement then you would have to ask why the response to the Senate committee report was prepared and tabled in the terms that it was.
We do not want policy on the run on these important issues. Yet we have a Howard government that is very politically clever—very clever at making the announcement when it thinks that there is sufficient public pressure to do so and when the politics are right. What we do not have, with due respect, Senator Heffernan, is a government that thinks long term about the long-term sustainability challenges facing this country. The government is interested in short-term political solutions and that is why we have comments from climate change sceptics such as Minister Macfarlane last year when he dismissed the Al Gore film as entertainment. We now have a government that is trying to portray itself as being serious about issues such as water and climate change. I think people will become increasingly aware of the way in which the government seeks to respond with a political fix rather than with a long-term policy position in the long-term interests of the nation to address long-term challenges into the future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,15,2
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-02-06,"—I will not detain the Senate for an inordinate period of time, and I understand I may have a limited amount. I also want to draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport has a reference before it in relation to Murray-Darling Basin legislation. The matter was referred to the committee on 7 December, and it proposes changes to the legislation which are completely inconsistent with the government’s announced approach of taking over control of the Murray-Darling Basin.
Senator Wong has just very clearly indicated the absolute contradiction in the government’s response to the longstanding Senate committee report on rural water usage, which was, as I understand it, prepared and lodged in December and published in January. But on 7 December, the government introduced legislation into the House of Representatives which also confirms that the government’s position in early December was completely inconsistent with the position that the Prime Minister announced in relation to the takeover of the Murray-Darling Basin. When the government gets it wrong, when the government breaks the rules in relation to the time it takes to respond to reports, as it did with this response, and when it produces the response out of session, it is ironic that the production of that response, and indeed the legislation that I refer to, proves absolutely that this government throughout December did not consider its proposal to take over the Murray-Darling Basin and that it has lately come to that view.
Frankly, it is about time that the Prime Minister came clean and admitted that this is an election year plan—a plan to announce spending which they have not properly considered nor properly costed because it gives a good media burst. Frankly, it is not good enough for a government that has been in power for approaching 11 years to now say, ‘We have a solution.’ It is about spending money some way. We are going to explore that. The solution is the important thing. We are also aware that this is a very politically clever Prime Minister and this is a politically clever ploy. It is not in the interests of the Murray-Darling Basin at all; it is in the interests of the Liberal Party. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-02-06,"—I move:
That the 2006/07 SBT Australian National Catch Allocation Determination, made under subclause 17(2) of the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan 1995, be disallowed.
This motion for disallowance relates to the southern bluefin tuna quota and I seek to disallow this quota. Last October the Australian Fisheries Management Authority announced that the Australian fishing industry was to be allocated a 5,265-tonne quota for southern bluefin tuna. We are now taking a larger catch of this species than any other country. I seek to disallow this quota and I would like to make plain my reasons for doing this.
My case rests on both the survival of this species and the survival of the industry that depends on it. By all accepted measures this species is now in danger of being fished to extinction. The global catch peaked in the early 1960s, and warnings have been issued repeatedly since the 1980s. Most recently, the government’s own Bureau of Rural Sciences published a 10-page update on the southern bluefin tuna in its 2005 Fisheries status report. The status report reads like an obituary for this species. The southern bluefin tuna, commonly known as SBT, is declared to be:
Overfished, and overfishing is occurring; spawning stock severely depleted and current catches severely limit likelihood of rebuilding.
It also notes:
the most recent assessments suggest that the spawning stock is likely to decline further if the global catch remains at recent levels...
Further it states:
The scientists estimated that if catches continue at recent levels ... there is a 50% chance that the spawning stock will be half its 2004 size by 2022.
The Bureau of Rural Sciences, BRS, has classified southern bluefin tuna as overfished every year since it began compiling these reports in 1992. The 2005 report recommended an immediate 5,000 tonne reduction in the assumed global catch, or a 7,160 tonne reduction if governments delayed action until 2007. I appreciate that marine ecology is not an exact science and that uncertainties remain, but the BRS report states:
… data collection and stock assessment procedures for SBT are among the most comprehensive in the world for highly migratory species.
So this time there is no hiding behind gaps in the data or scientific uncertainty—we know.
This report also touched on the unacceptable levels of bycatch, in particular albatross and other seabirds which are hooked when diving on baits. At least one species, the Macquarie Island population of wandering albatross, was listed under the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, with longline tuna fishing listed as a key threatening process.
The BRS report was written before the real extent of Japanese piracy had been made public. I refer of course to the incidents reported in the media in the latter half of last year about illegal catches. Japan has been taking between 12,000 and 20,000 tonnes a year against an average quota of around 6,000 tonnes. Australia, in a sense, has been no different. We have been earnest in our pursuit of pirate operators and illegal fishing but have avoided taking the harsh measures ourselves, which now leaves Australia in the shocking position of having the world’s largest take of a critically endangered species.
For a long time the Greens have pushed for staged reductions in quotas in exchange for a long-term future of the fishery. Now we face the prospect of the complete collapse of this species, with unknown consequences for the food chains and wider ecosystems of which these creatures are a part. The World Conservation Union, or IUCN as it is commonly known, lists the bluefin tuna as critically endangered. Governments in all the countries who fish this species have been incredibly reluctant to stand up to pressure from fishing interests. I am dumbfounded at the prospect that this government is willing to hammer this species into extinction and throw hundreds of people out of work in the process, all the while accusing conservationists of being anti jobs.
This was certainly the case with the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, who somehow came to the conclusion that listing the species as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act would hamper conservation efforts. I raise this today because we have a new minister for the environment who will, hopefully, take a science based approach to this issue and take action before this fishery is permanently closed because there are just no fish.
There is some evidence that the Japanese government are beginning to make changes in response to the revelations last year. They accepted a roughly 50 per cent cut, to around 3,000 tonnes per year, in their quota. The decision by AFMA to allocate 5,265 tonnes of this fish to the Australian industry this year is a triumph of politics over science and conservation—and, may I say, rationality. It is time the government stood up to the fishing industry in order to ensure that there is an industry in 10 years time. It is nonsensical to keep fishing for this fish at this quota level.
In Kobe recently, at the gathering of the regional fisheries management organisations with responsibility for managing tuna stocks, there was acknowledgement for the first time that the current system of management is failing. But, unfortunately, that was about all that was achieved at that meeting—‘Yes, so the system is failing, but let’s delay even longer before we do anything.’ Very halting steps were taken, including the issuing of certificates of origin, to prevent illegal fishing and greater transparency in the setting of regional fishing quotas. However, anyone waiting for a comprehensive plan of action or sharp reductions in the quota was severely disappointed. No concrete actions were agreed as a result of this meeting. There was an agreement to further talks in 2009, but we need to do much more than talk. At the very least, we need to talk much more urgently.
There are three concrete actions that the new minister could take. Firstly, he could list the species as ‘conservation dependent’ under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The Threatened Species Scientific Advisory Committee advised the minister to take this step in September 2005, and things have certainly taken a turn for the worse since then. I do not accept the tortured logic that doing this would reduce our influence within the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. In December 2006 the Humane Society International again submitted to have the southern bluefin tuna listed as ‘conservation dependent’. In their application, they note the following: ‘In 2003 it was found that an entire generation appeared to be missing from SBT stocks off Western Australia’—

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The document lists the tax expenditures for 2006 and was released just before Christmas Day. It seems a long time ago now, but people may recall that in the lead-up to last year’s budget there was quite a lot of public debate about the need for significant tax reform. A lot of people put forward a range of different ideas for major improvements to our taxation system, to improve its fairness and efficiency. There were indeed contributors from the government’s backbench as well, and for a while there the member for Wentworth, Mr Turnbull—prior to becoming a parliamentary secretary—was also floating some ideas on taxation and ways to improve the system which, from memory, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was rather dismissive of.
But it is probably timely, on the first sitting day of this year and with the budget coming up in three months time—of course, a pre-election budget—to once again start ensuring that there is some decent community debate about some of the continuing flaws in our taxation system and to look at different ideas that will increase its fairness and its efficiency. The complexity of the whole system is certainly something that still needs addressing.
The tax expenditures document that I am speaking to here is but one part and, in many ways, a small part of the whole taxation system, but it is not a small document; it is a very large document. It gives an idea of the burgeoning nature of tax expenditures. Without launching into a detailed examination of all of them now, not least because I do not have the time, I do think that the time is right to look at the huge range of tax expenditures that are now in place. They are in effect revenue forgone. They tend to be a range of different things, many of which seem like a good idea at the time but can develop a life of their own and operate in ways that have an impact on unexpected matters and interact unexpectedly with other aspects of the tax system—or the market, for that matter. I think, given the huge size of the tax expenditures statement these days, it is certainly time to re-examine some of these.
One area that I have pointed to a number of times in the past, and I single it out in part because it is topical for other reasons, is negative gearing—forgone revenue, if you like. That is now up to over $2 billion a year, a significant part of which is in effect a taxpayer funded subsidy for people who are investing in the property market. I am certainly not suggesting that people should not invest in the property market, but it is no secret that there are enormous problems in many parts of Australia at the moment with housing affordability, both renting and purchasing. There are a range of reasons for that; I do not seek to point to negative gearing as the only factor. But I do not think there is much doubt it is significant. Indeed, the Productivity Commission itself, when it did a report for the Treasurer some years back, pointed to the effect of negative gearing, particularly in conjunction with another, separate change that was made—to introduce a discounted rate for capital gains tax. Those two measures acting together clearly played a role in pushing up the price of housing, due to the flood of investors who moved in.
If we are going to give support and assistance to people in the housing market, I think we should give it to people who are simply trying to buy a home to live in ahead of people who are speculating. So that is one example. In singling out negative gearing, I am not saying it should be scrapped, but I would say, as the Productivity Commission said in a recommendation that was comprehensively ignored by the Treasurer, that it should be examined along with other measures.
In my view, there is scope for reform here. There is scope for potentially reducing some of the tax expenditures, broadening the base, that would generate more revenue that could be available for perhaps a reduction in overall rates of income tax or changing some of the thresholds. Those are the main things that I think we need to have a debate about. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2007-02-06,"—Just before Christmas, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence I visited the Solomon Islands to thank our Australian members of the Combined Joint Task Force 635 serving as part of Operation Anode on three-month rotations. I was accompanied by Major General Ian Flawith, the Commander of the 2nd Division, our Army Reserve division, and the Chief of Training Command, Major General Dick Wilson. My purpose was to thank them and all Australian members of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands for their contribution to RAMSI, particularly at Christmas time. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands is a partnership between the government and the people of the Solomon Islands and 15 contributing countries of the Pacific region.
RAMSI came to the Solomon Islands in July 2003 following a request from the Solomon Islands government. RAMSI works in the following three broad sectors: firstly, in law and justice with police courts and prisons; secondly, in economic governance, government finance and economic reforms; and, thirdly, in the building of the machinery of government, public service, accountability institutions, electoral commissions and parliament. The contribution Australia will make to RAMSI over the four years 2005-06 to 2008-09 will be about $840 million—a very considerable sum of money. Comprised in that are a number of bilateral projects that AusAID and other aid agencies run.
I was pleased to meet the RAMSI principals: Special Coordinator Mr Tim George, whom I previously met as Ambassador to Israel; Deputy Special Coordinator Mr Paul Ash, who is a New Zealander; Developments Coordinator Mr Blair Exell from AusAID; the commander of the participating police force, Deputy Commissioner Will Jamieson; and the Combined Joint Task Force 635 commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Quirk. The combined task force is the ADF’s contribution to RAMSI and falls under the law and justice sector. The operation’s name is Anode and comprises five nations, namely, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. While Australia and New Zealand provide the bulk of the deployed force, the three Pacific island contingents contribute a platoon of 33 soldiers on a three-monthly rotational basis as well. The combined task force strength is approximately 210, 140 of which are Australians.
Two RAMSI personnel have died while serving in the Solomon Islands: Constable Adam Dunning was ambushed and shot in December 2004 and Private Jamie Clark, of the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, fell down a mineshaft on Guadalcanal in March 2005. The combined task force is in the process of constructing a memorial to both individuals, which I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to see.
The combined task force strength has varied considerably since July 2003. Before the April riots last year the force had approximately 60 personnel. This figure swelled to 550 in the six weeks following April last year. The government’s biannual review of RAMSI ratifies Defence’s ongoing commitment. I understand the next review is this month. Defence anticipates maintaining current personnel levels until next year. The combined task force is comprised of an integrated headquarters component, a rifle company and two platoons—New Zealand and the Pacific participating countries—and in effect comprises five platoons.
The combined task force mission is to provide military security to the participating police force in order to reinforce the maintenance of law and order in the Solomon Islands. In achieving this the combined task force conducts the following four specified tasks: static security to Rove Prison; patrol support in and around the Honiara area; patrol support in the provincial areas—I was lucky to visit a platoon on Small Malaita; and it also has what is called a TF3 response task, which is a graduated response to an emerging threat situation where the military is called out to provide higher level assistance to police, usually in the form of a cordon. Where possible the military patrols with both participating police force and Solomon Islands police force assets. All planning is conducted in a joint environment and all military patrols are forecast. Patrol reports are fed into the participating police force control joint intelligence group, which is the principal custodian for information maintenance and the pattern analysis in the Solomon Islands.
The 140 Australian members of the joint task force are full-time ADF personnel. These personnel support the AFP by accompanying them on patrols and coordinating the multinational military effort with the participating police force. Of particular relevance to my visit and the reason why Major-General Flawith accompanied me was that the next rotation of the Australian soldiers will be that of Army reservists. The ADF Reserve consists of around 21,000 active reservists who are utilised in various employment categories both in Australia and overseas and are fundamental to our ongoing military success. This next rotation will be a unique opportunity for Australian Army reservists to be deployed doing identical tasks as regular ADF and returning to civilian employment having done a good job. They will be able to be deployed again in the future. It really is a unique opportunity. There are opportunities for them to be deployed overseas with Rifle Company Butterworth each year, but this is an ongoing commitment because the rotations take place every three months.
I would like particularly to thank the commanding officer of the Combined Joint Task Force 635, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Quirk, for making my visit so worth while. I consider him, along with so many others in the ADF, an outstanding person. He shows leadership, inspiration and enthusiasm for the tasks that are set, and I wish him well in his military career. I was particularly impressed with his ideas for running joint operations between the ADF, police and other agencies. This is an area of activity that will require considerable intellectual horsepower in the future, particularly for Australia in view of our geographic position with responsibility for much of the security in our region and the increasing importance of joint operations generally.
I would also like to make my appreciation known of Lieutenant Andrew Cullen, the platoon leader on Small Malaita, where I visited. His professionalism and the leadership of his platoon of diggers appeared outstanding. Finally, I would like to congratulate all the officers and enlisted ranks of Combined Joint Task Force 635. I was delighted to present a number of Australian service medals as well as a soldiers medallion. Australians are proud of our ADF doing those jobs that need to be done for the security of Australia, the security of our region and the security of the world. The members of Combined Joint Task Force 635 did an outstanding job, particularly well led by their CO, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Quirk. I would like to thank them and their families for allowing them and other members of the ADF to serve abroad, and to serve in very difficult situations.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,,Adjournment,25,1
