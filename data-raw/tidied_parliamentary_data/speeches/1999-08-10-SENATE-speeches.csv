"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-08-10,"—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Minister for Trade. How does the Howard government explain why, since taking office in 1996, net foreign debt has increased from $192 billion to $242 billion—an increase of $50 billion, or 26 per cent? How does the government justify highlighting foreign debt as a major national issue in the 1996 campaign, then sitting on its hands in government and simply letting the problem grow? Hasn't the Howard government absolutely failed in its commitment to reduce foreign debt, and isn't it a fact that the government has no strategy whatsoever to reduce the $12,500 worth of debt that now hangs over the head of every Australian?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Debt: Level</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-08-10,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, what targets has the government set to reduce foreign debt? By how much will it be reduced and over what time period does the government expect to reach these targets?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Debt: Level</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-08-10,"—I think Senator Campbell is sitting in the wrong seat, because that question was asked at the end of the last session by Senator Cook. So perhaps this is a pre-emptive strike on the first day back—the new shadow minister for trade. Perhaps it is not such a bad idea because, when you look along that frontbench, Madam President—Senator Cook, Senator Bolkus, Senator Schacht—they are part of the failed old guard, and it is about time, in an ALP with no new ideas, that somebody else is given a chance. The ministers of the previously failed Hawke and Keating governments should stand aside and let the new blood have a chance.
—Senator Hill—
—Senator Campbell has sent a message. Senator Campbell has said that he wants to have a go.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. My point of order is this: I just wondered if you felt it was significant that Senator Hill was not answering the 
 question about foreign debt that was asked by Senator Campbell.
—I was just drawing his attention to it when he switched to Senator Campbell, and I hope that he will stay on Senator Campbell.
—What I will do for Senator Campbell is give the answer that I gave to Senator Cook at the end of the last session. He could find that answer by reading the Hansard  but, having taken the opportunity to present himself as an alternative trade spokesman, he now deserves an answer. The answer, unfortunately, Senator Campbell—and you may not know it, but it might help you—is that there has been a serious economic decline in Australia's markets within the region. Senator Campbell might have missed the fact that there has been an economic crisis within the Asian region. So, whilst the Australian economy has remained strong, our markets have become weak, and that has had the consequence of a deteriorating trade deficit position—something that is beyond the competence of Australia to solve on its own initiative.
In other words, what we should do in such circumstances is ensure that the domestic economy remains sound, that the fundamentals are sound—that is, lower interest rates, keeping taxation down, keeping inflation down, and the like—so that Australian business then has the best opportunity to take full advantage of recovery when it occurs. That recovery is starting to occur, and the benefits will flow in due course in terms of the international debt figure. The contrast is that the economy can fundamentally sustain that debt figure now because the Howard government got the fundamentals right. That is a contrast with the alarming debt figures that occurred under the previous Labor governments that led from time to time to economic crises within Australia itself.
Senator Campbell should be aware that the Australian economy now has the capacity to sustain this international position, which is beyond its capacity to mend at the moment, because the Howard government got the fundamentals right. We will continue to get those fundamentals right, and the benefit in 
 the international and trade accounts will be evident in due course.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Debt: Level</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-08-10,"—This has not been a government of targets. Again, you see, it was the Hawke and the Keating governments that constantly kept setting targets that they were unable to achieve. So what then happened was that targets got changed. In other words, a target in itself does not achieve a better outcome at all. Senator Campbell should be aware that, if you get the fundamentals right, you have got the best chance of achieving a good economic outcome. And if there has ever been a government that can demonstrate proudly and confidently a good economic outcome, it is the Howard government. So do not worry about targets; get the fundamentals right and the benefits will flow.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Debt: Level</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-08-10,"—Earlier this afternoon I was asked a question by Senator Bartlett and I undertook to provide any further information that the minister had. I can add to the previous answer that I gave. The Minister for 
 Health and Aged Care is aware of the statements made by Dr Trevor Doust of the National Registration Authority expecting tough new regulations to track and control the use of antibiotics in Australia and is also aware of the emergence of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms as a public health issue of growing national and international concern.
In April 1998 the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was the minister appointed to the Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance to examine the use of antibiotics and food producing animals. The committee has examined the scientific evidence of a link between the use of antibiotics and food producing animals and the emergence and selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their spread to humans. Their final report is expected to be presented to either Minister Truss or Minister Wooldridge at the end of August this year. He will not be making any policy decisions on the run. The government will consider the report and will base any necessary policy changes on the best available scientific evidence.
Obviously, as I mentioned previously, the government is concerned about this issue, and Dr Wooldridge has already implemented within his portfolio the Quality Use of Medicines Program to ensure more appropriate prescribing of antibiotics. As a result, use of antibiotics has declined in recent times.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Antibiotics: Resistance</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-10,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, and for related purposes. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement of reasons read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1999 SPRING SITTINGS
ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999 
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act1989  (the ATSIC Act) was amended in 1996 to provide that the ATSIC zone Commissioners elect one of their number to the position of Chairperson (the Act originally provided for the Chairperson to be appointed by the Minister). This amendment will come into effect following the next ATSIC Regional Council elections on 9 October 1999.
The purpose of this Bill is to amend the ATSIC Act to provide that where a person elected to be the Commissioner to represent a zone is subsequently elected as Commission Chairperson, the person should cease to hold office as the Commissioner representing the zone and as a Regional Councillor, with these offices to be refilled through the normal ATSIC electoral processes.
Urgent passage of the Bill is sought so that its provisions may be in place before the election of a Chairperson, which will follow the elections of Regional Councillors and zone Commissioners.
If the Bill is not passed before the election of the Chairperson, there will be no provision to fill the vacancy left in an ATSIC zone and region by the election of a zone Commissioner as ATSIC Chair.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs)
Senator Brown to move, on 23 August 1999:

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-10,"—I think it fitting that I rise immediately following two Queensland senators making their first speeches and that I continue on the theme of a Queenslander speaking about the important issue of giving the people of Australia, including the people of Queensland, the opportunity to decide whether they wish to move towards a republic. Let me be the first to congratulate the two new senators, Senator Ludwig and Senator McLucas, on their first speeches.
As a representative of the people of Queensland, I know it is often suggested that Queensland is a conservative state and one that is perhaps amongst those least likely to vote in favour of moving to a republic. I share the optimism of Senator McLucas that Queenslanders are quite likely to embrace a move to a republic. That will be a decision for them, but I certainly do not agree with the common myth that Queenslanders are exceptionally more conservative. I think Queenslanders are independent thinkers; they make up their own minds. We will see, come the referendum in November, whether or not they wish to move to a republic under the model that is put forward in this piece of legislation.
The legislation comes out of the Constitutional Convention. Speaking personally, I would probably describe myself as being amongst those who are loosely called the `yes' and `more' grouping, people that support Australia becoming a republic, as most Democrats do and have done for many years, but who believe that there are many issues in the future of our nation, as we move into the 21st century, that are much more important 
 than whether or not we remove the Queen as our head of state. I do hope that those fundamental issues are also examined by the Australian community as well as the Australian parliament in coming years. I think it is unfortunate that the Constitutional Convention we had was so narrow and did not consider a number of these issues.
One of the things that I hope will occur—and there has been commitment and certainly a recommendation from the last convention for it—is that a further Constitutional Convention be held in a few years time to examine some of those more fundamental issues and to look at what extra changes would be beneficial to the future development of Australia as a nation. Of course, to get to that next step, not only do we need to pass this legislation in some form or other but the public need to pass the referendum in November to move to a republic. Once that first step is out of the way, we will be able to examine some of the more fundamental and more important issues. For that reason amongst others, I personally certainly hope that people give strong consideration to voting yes to move towards a republic, so that we can as soon as possible get on with examining some of those other important issues.
There are many other important issues that do need consideration. It is often presented, on this issue of a republic, that Australia became a federation in 1901 and that it would be nice and neat if it became a republic in 2001 as another step. That fairly simple sort of time line tends to ignore the continuing evolution of Australia as a nation since 1901. It has been a gradual process of Australia developing its own independence, sometimes with the assistance of specific pieces of legislation, sometimes more through just the development of convention and legal understandings.
There have been a number of steps along the path. We have just recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a legal definition of an Australian citizen. It is often a surprise to people to realise that the concept of an Australian citizen was not actually something that came automatically into being in 1901 and that it was only 
 halfway through our life as a federated nation that we actually got a citizenship act. There have been other measures, such as the Australia Act, removing the Privy Council, and various other steps along the way that have been part of a gradual evolution. Naturally enough, many people see establishing a republic and removing the Queen as the head of state as another step in that evolution.
I hope that it is a strongly held desire amongst the Australian people that this evolution continues to examine some of the other more crucial, in my view, issues such as the overall role of respecting and ensuring the protection of the environment at a national level and the need to have stronger guarantees for fairer democratic electoral systems, particularly the importance of establishing proportional representation systems wherever possible. The issue that has been on and off the agenda for many years of a Bill of Rights is one that needs further examination.
Even such issues as state boundaries—which, in many ways, are accidents of history and a consequence of our British colonial origins—could be re-examined. We have a number of areas where population centres overlap states and cause significant problems. Coolangatta and Tweed Heads on the border of Queensland and New South Wales in the Gold Coast region have some problems which eventuate from time to time—not the least of which being daylight saving when it appears in one state and not in the other each year. A re-examination of the boundaries there is something worth examining, although I realise that it would be politically extremely difficult. Those are the sorts of issues that could be looked at. We could even examine whether to realign boundaries around catchment areas rather than simply keep the old colonial boundaries that were put there as accidents of history.
Senator McLucas, in her first speech, which she made just prior to mine, highlighted the role of Torres Strait Islanders and their desire to move towards greater autonomy. That is an important issue for Queensland, in particular—not to mention the role of North Queensland as a region, a role that I am sure Senator McLucas has an interest in as a person from 
 that part of my state—as is the role of local government and even the recognition of the role of control and protection of the seas and the oceans. There is a lot of talk, in relation to the republic and some of the issues surrounding the preamble, about the role of the land. That is obviously important, but we often forget how vast Australia's ocean territories are and that is something that we could consider more in our conceptualisation of a nation.
Of course, more broadly, there are many indigenous issues that I could outline that need to be redressed. If we are not able to redress those as a nation in the near future then, frankly, whether we have got the Queen as our head of state or an Australian President is fairly minor by comparison. It is crucial that we do move forward to examine those issues and not see this as simply a one-off debate. I hope that, if we get a yes vote in November, the proposal of having a further convention to consider some of these issues will be followed through and that the Australian public will be given a strong opportunity to participate.
The Democrats had a representative on the joint parliamentary committee that examined this legislation. Senator Stott Despoja, our deputy leader, will expand further on some of the more technical aspects of the legislation, as she has a better understanding of them than I have. From my perspective, I see it as important for the development and future of Australia that we move towards a republic.
The component of this legislation that is most unsatisfactory is the absence of any role for the Senate in the dismissal process—no less unsatisfactory, of course, than the current system under which there is a lack of any role at all for the parliament in the dismissal process of the Governor-General. That is clearly a shortcoming of the legislation, and I do urge senators to consider the amendments that will be put forward on that issue.
The Democrats have for many years been a pro-republic party, and it is pleasing to finally see some advancement in the debate on this issue in the parliamentary arena. The Democrats, as many members of this chamber and the public would know, are a party that 
 has a strong degree of member input in the development of party policy. Our policy is of course to support moving to a republic with an Australian head of state. Our members have also adopted a policy to support a method of parliamentary appointment. The model that is put forward obviously has a number of components that are consistent with the Democrats policy in that regard.
My own view is, in many respects, not so much to get hung up on the model of parliamentary appointment versus direct election but to stress the need to continue Australia's evolution and to see this as a step in the right direction, providing a much greater opportunity to examine how the system will work, to see whether moving to a different model of appointment or election would work down the track. In many ways, keeping that debate alive once we became a republic would also assist in keeping alive some of the other issues that are important to the future of Australia, as I have just outlined in my contribution.
In conclusion, I am certainly pleased to see the bill here in the Senate. I hope that senators give consideration to ensuring that we get the best possible bill for the parliament that we can. Most importantly, I hope that we provide an opportunity for the parliamentarians to move out of the way to some extent and for the debate to be moved to the people, where it should be, so that they can debate this issue over the coming months and, come November, decide for themselves our nation's future.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-10,"—Australians want an Australian as their head of the state, and that is, I think, indisputable. It is the clear result of the voting of delegates to the Constitutional Convention, as well as the consistent view expressed in published public opinion polls. As recently as yesterday, the Herald  Nielsen poll showed that 54 per cent of Australians agree with the simple proposition that Australia should become a republic. The responsibility of politicians on this issue is to give expression 
 to the will of the Australian people to give them a free and a fair chance to express their views, and that is what the Labor Party has done all along.
We did not support the process that led to last year's Constitutional Convention. We believe that process was flawed. The Prime Minister's control of appointments to the convention and the voluntary voting and postal balloting method for the election of candidates to the convention inevitably undermined and skewed the ballot results. Hence the convention, in the view of the Labor Party, did not adequately represent the views of ordinary Australians about constitutional reform. There is no doubt, in our view, that an indicative plebiscite on whether Australia should become a republic should have been held first and then, and only then, a convention held to determine the most appropriate model. Such a model would have had a great deal more legitimacy, whatever its form, but legitimacy is one thing that the Prime Minister has constantly and consistently sought to deny to the republican cause. The Prime Minister's objective in having the convention first was to ensure that the dead hand of that elitist institution of the monarchy, and those who support it, was able to prevent a true debate on the republic evolving. The tactic was only eventually defeated by the goodwill and the hard work and the compromise of the majority of delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Despite these prime ministerial hurdles, the Labor Party and fellow republicans have pressed on. You might ask why. We hoped, perhaps against hope, that John Howard would honour his word and allow the Australian people to determine a position on this issue without his interference. That has not happened. In the last few days, the Prime Minister has confirmed that he will be an active campaigner against the republic. That is something that he promised the Australian people that he would not do.
I accept that being a monarchist is at the core of John Howard. He is very proud of being a monarchist. It seems to have coloured everything that he has done. It will perhaps colour everything that he does between 
 tonight and the referendum on 6 November. The Prime Minister has for some time been acting as, if you like, a covert saboteur of an Australian republic. But it seems to me that in recent days he has outed himself. He has been starkly revealed now not just as a staunch anti-republican but as a very proactive anti-republican. What is more, he has revealed the depths to which he is prepared to go to defeat the will of the Australian people. We know that the Prime Minister has spent a lot of time with opinion pollsters and spin doctors like his former chief of staff, Mr Graham Morris, and the Liberal Party failure and has-been, Mark Textor, and one thing that these pollsters have taught him is that, in any poll, manipulating the question is the surest way of manipulating the final result. In short, a loaded question gets the desired vote. You have only got to ask Senator Minchin, one of the Prime Minister's strongest monarchists and political supporters. Last year, he said on the Four Corners program:
I've, as you know, been involved in the professional side of the Liberal Party for 14 years. I did a lot of polling myself. I'd have to say I know all the tricks of the trade, and I know you can get any result you like depending on the way you ask the question.
All of Senator Minchin's tricks of the trade are on display here: the manipulation of the question to manipulate the end result.
Maybe the Prime Minister does not want to be seen to be directly opposing the will of the people on this important issue. I think he probably does have some understanding of how out of step he is on this issue with the Australian people. He knows, obviously, that the republican issue is one that has caused deep divisions within his own party, the Liberal Party, and deep divisions within the coalition. It seems to me that that is one of the reasons why, every step of the way, he has sought to complicate and frustrate the path to a republic. It is why he has been actively encouraging many coalition members to advocate differing and contradictory models of the republic or to publicly run the monarchist line.
Those who support the monarchy have joined hand in hand with the Prime Minister 
 to defeat the republic at all costs. But, of course, like him, very few if any of them are prepared to explain why they do not think that an Australian is good enough to be our President, why they do not think an Australian is good enough to be our head of state. There are the McGarvieites—I think Senator Abetz might be one of those—who profess to support having an Australian as a head of state but who want Australia to be ruled by some elitist and ageist council of elders and who would probably be happy if you could give the Queen an Australian passport.
But the most dishonourable of all are people like Mr Peter Reith, the referendum rogues who want to use popular support for direct democracy to deny all Australians an Australian head of state. I was delighted that Mr Reith's fundamental hypocrisy on this issue was really pinned by his Liberal colleague in the House of Representatives Mr Bob Charles, who said:
I talked to him personally last night, I said Reith, I said, I've known you for 13 bloody years . . . and I said, you've had more positions on the republic than the bloody Karma Sutra , mate.
We sometimes disagree with Mr Bob Charles, but Mr Bob Charles got this absolutely right in relation to Peter Reith. Peter Reith will take any position he likes, any position that suits him on the republic at all, as long as it serves Peter Reith's own political ends. What are they? It is not principle; no, Peter Reith is just a plain wrecker.
But the issue that we are debating in this chamber today—the question that will be put to the Australian people in November—is only the latest symptom of Mr Howard's insidious tactics. In the Senate today we can continue to accept and play this game or we can say to Mr Howard, the Australian Prime Minister, `Enough is enough. The Australian people are entitled to an Australian head of state on their terms, on fair terms, following a fair and open debate.' If we give in to the Prime Minister, then he will have won again in what is his basic desire to prop up the extraordinarily elitist institution of the monarchy.
In what I thought was an extraordinary act of bad faith yesterday, Mr Howard sought to 
 torpedo the model to be put to the Australian people by stating that he regarded the process of public consultation for the nomination of an Australian President as a facade—that was his view; it was a facade. Mr Howard knows that that particular aspect of the model was included at the Convention, adopted at the Convention, in a desire to ensure that the Australian people were genuinely involved in the selection process. A number of Constitutional Convention delegates would not have voted for the model if that feature had not been contained within it. It was one of the numerous and important compromises hammered out on the floor of the Constitutional Convention.
But in one of Mr Howard's most cynical moves yet he said that if he is Prime Minister he will either ignore it or manipulate the process to ensure that his nominee succeeds. You have to ask the Prime Minister of Australia a direct question: why isn't an Australian good enough to be our head of state? Why isn't an Australian good enough to be our President? Why doesn't the Prime Minister want to mention in the question that for the first time we will have a constitutional guarantee that our head of state will be an Australian citizen? Why is he happy to mention the involvement of politicians in the selection process but not the role of the people?
I suppose the answer to that is that the Prime Minister is an unquestioning royalist, through and through. He stands for an elitist, sexist, sectarian and fundamentally undemocratic institution—that is, the monarchy—which shares no values at all, has no values at all, in common with ordinary Australians. Hereditary succession is an anachronism. Preference for male heirs is absolutely absurd and ridiculous. Intolerance of a divorced monarch is an absolute farce, and insistence on the monarch—therefore, the Australian head of state—also being titular head of a particular religion and church is totally anathema to modern-day Australia.
The most curious point is why John Howard or any other monarchist is prepared to defend these anachronistic features of the English monarchy. We constantly hear the 
 assertion, or the question, `Why change something if it isn't broken?' Yet when we raise these characteristics so anathematic to modern and democratic Australia, there is no answer from the monarchists. Does John Howard have an answer to these questions? Why should we in today's Australia, one of the most tolerant nations on earth, continue into the next century with these elitist, sexist, sectarian, fundamentally antidemocratic relics of the distant past? Stony silence from Mr Howard and his cohorts.
Mr Howard also questions whether this issue is really important to the majority of Australians. We say it is, that it is fundamental to our view of ourselves, fundamental to our national identity. Why shouldn't our head of state, our first citizen, be one of us? Why shouldn't an Australian be able to aspire to be Australia's head of state—not a representative, but the real one. The Labor Party thinks Australians are good enough to aspire to this and, unlike most of those in the coalition, we will campaign for a reasonable republican model that allows us to express that point of view.
In fairness to the coalition, some on that side of the chamber share our support for a republic. There will be some in the coalition who will join us on the hustings. However, the reality is Australians are ready to face the 21st century with an Australian head of state but the coalition and the Prime Minister are not. It is the coalition that, in trying to paper over the cracks within its ranks, will try to delay the republic, perhaps forever.
The government's compromise on the long title is not acceptable. It is a self-confessed attempt to prevent the divisions within the coalition on the republic from bubbling to the surface. It has nothing to do with putting a fair question to the Australian people. The bipartisan joint select committee made a clear compromise recommendation on the long title that is fair to all. In my view, to compromise further is to give ground to the monarchists, to allow the Prime Minister to jump from one foxhole of deceit to another.
It is important to describe in the question the President as an Australian President. The Queen is not an Australian citizen and the 
 Governor-General need not be one. A fundamental feature of this model is it ensures for the first time that by force of our own Constitution, our most basic law, our head of state has to be one of us. The mention of the appointment process is also misleading. The bipartisan joint select committee said:
The Committee considers that the reference in the draft long title to the two-thirds majority of the Members of Parliament gives an incomplete picture of the essential feature of the nomination process which involves public consultation and a process for bipartisan nomination by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.
The Labor Party remains firmly of the view that the bipartisan and bicameral parliamentary committee did come up with the right compromise.
While there will obviously always be some who feel a different nuance may be better on such a fundamentally important issue, the committee's recommendation for the long title is the desirable outcome. We believe that these words accurately and comprehensively describe the intent of the referendum, and we will be supporting the recommendation in this place and in the broader Australian community. Kim Beazley said earlier today:
I am resigned, cheerfully, to fighting for an Australian Republic and modernising our Constitution. At the end of the day, the question will be important, but the critical thing is going to be to win the Australian's hearts and minds behind this very necessary change at the end of the century. And, frankly, this is all going to be out of the way in the course of the next couple of weeks, and then I'm going to be stuck right into the campaign.
We have noted that the Democrats' alternative proposal has been released late this afternoon by Senator Stott Despoja. I am pleased to see you are out of exile, Senator. That is good. Of course that is the proposal for a bald statement referring to a republic. That is also, I think, a product of the parliamentary committee. Our initial view is that that is positive and we are prepared to look at the merits of that alternative. But we remain fully in support of the committee's recommendation as the best means of achieving a positive vote in the November referendum.
If we drop the ball on this issue, we will have really let ourselves down. We will have 
 let the Australian people down by not giving them a fair vote on this referendum, which marks our entry into the 21st century as a truly independent and self-governing nation. Let's have an Australian Republic. What a great way it will be to finally symbolise this nation's coming of age. Why would anyone want to prevent this from happening?

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-10,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as their republic spokesperson, to address the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 . I am very proud to belong to a political party that is a pro-republican party. We have long recognised the need to update and modernise our Constitution. We have long supported broad constitutional change and the move to an Australian head of state is one of the most important changes that we believe we can make. As Australians, we are fortunate to be a part of one of longest continuous democracies in the world, but that does not mean that we should not seek to update our Constitution to reflect changing times or remove dated practices.
We now have the opportunity as a nation to move into the next century, the next millennium, with an Australian head of state: someone who is one of us—an Australian citizen. It is an opportunity for us to assert our independence, albeit as a nation within a friendly family of nations because no-one has suggested that we are no longer part of the Commonwealth. This provides us with the opportunity to consolidate what is a uniquely multicultural society. This move is not anti-British, as some pro-monarchists or anti-republicans may suggest; it is pro-Australian. It is a change that demonstrates that we are confident of our place in the world and that we are emerging as a mature and independent nation.
The process that we are pursuing through this chamber tonight began formally with last year's Constitutional Convention. Of course, the debate about Australia becoming a republic has been going on for a lot longer than that. Certainly, as a patron of the Australian Republican Movement in South Australia for a number of years now and as a republican all my life, having grown up in a republican household, I have longed for and looked forward to the day when we contemplate and make such a change. I was present at last year's Constitutional Convention as the Australian Democrats' federal delegate. I was joined by at least three other Democrats, two 
 of whom were on the republican side like myself. This is perhaps an example of the diversity of views within our party, like any other.
I should add for the record, however, that the Australian Democrats balloted, quite recently, the issue of the model and a majority of Democrats supporters have come out in favour of the model of a two-thirds majority approval by the parliament, although—and I will continue this point later—we have very strong views about the involvement of both houses in both the nomination and dismissal processes in relation to an Australian head of state. I echo Senator Faulkner's concerns—and my party did at the time—in relation to the Constitutional Convention, such as the voluntary voting method that was approved by this government and the fact that a number of delegates were appointed. But, by the same token, we saw the process and the event as quite invigorating and inspiring. I think the most exciting part of that process was the participation of the public through the Internet, the public gallery and the faxes and mail received by individual delegates.
The model that we are debating in the form of legislation was supported by a majority of delegates at the convention and is essentially contained within the legislation before us. To ensure that these bills accurately reflected the Constitutional Convention's communique, a joint select committee was recently established to examine and assess this aspect. I look forward to the prospect of the next Constitutional Convention. That is certainly a recommendation handed down in the advisory report and a commitment that I believe the Prime Minister has made in relation to this referendum campaign. If this referendum is successful, I look forward to a second Constitutional Convention.
As part of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, participants heard more than 200 submissions, visited a number of places around the country and listened to ideas and recommendations as to how the legislation could be improved. Overwhelmingly, Australians indicated their support for becoming a republic. In the same way that we have seen this reflected in research, polls and 
 surveys over the last couple of years, a majority of Australians have indicated their support. Certainly, the majority who appeared before the committee indicated support for the proposed model. However, there were areas of contention, some of which, I am glad to say, have been recognised in the recommendations that have come from the report—in the form of the report—and others which are not contained within the majority report.
While recognising and supporting a number of the recommendations made by the committee, the Australian Democrats still have some concerns with regard to the bills before us. We were very pleased to see that some of the concerns were taken on board, primarily in relation to the nomination process—that is, ensuring that the Prime Minister of the day and the parliament have to be conscious of ensuring diversity in relation to the nomination process and public input into that process. I am glad that recommendation has been made and I look forward to it being adopted. Foremost among our concerns is our long held concern about the inadequate protection afforded to the Australian President under the proposed legislation and the exclusion of the Senate from the dismissal process.
The President of an Australian republic will be placed in the invidious position of being able to be dismissed by the Prime Minister without stated cause. Much was made at the 1998 Constitutional Convention of the need to balance the powers of the Prime Minister and the President, but it is the view of the Australian Democrats, as it was the view of a number of prominent witnesses who appeared before the joint select committee, that the balance is actually tipped too far in favour of the Prime Minister, thus potentially undermining the powers and the role of the President. The Democrats recognise the safeguards which have been incorporated into the model and which the committee has sought to strengthen. We do not believe that the requirement that a Prime Minister who dismisses the President must seek the ratification of a majority of the House of Representatives within 30 days is an adequate protection against politically motivated or peremptory dismissal. 
 It is highly unlikely that any Prime Minister would not be able to command a majority in the House of Representatives, and it is the view of the Australian Democrats that the lower house alone would merely rubber-stamp the actions of the Prime Minister. The inclusion of the Senate in the process of ratifying the dismissal of a President by a Prime Minister through the requirement of a two-thirds majority approval at a joint sitting of federal parliament was a feature of the Republican Advisory Committee recommendations in 1994. It was also a feature of the original model proposed by former Prime Minister Paul Keating and the original Australian Republican Movement models.
 The Democrats believe the diversion of the Constitutional Convention from the models was unfortunate and undermines the status of this very chamber—a chamber that we believe is equally representative and a sovereign house of parliament—and undermines the security of tenure enjoyed by a President. Accordingly, on behalf of my party I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of this bill to incorporate a role for the Senate in the dismissal procedure. In doing so, I hope those amendments will enjoy the support of all senators in restoring the Senate to its rightful place in this process.
The other change which I will be seeking to make on behalf of the Democrats will be the inclusion of a stipulation that a President may only be dismissed on stated grounds, along the lines of the protection given to federal judges under section 72(ii) of the Constitution. Under this section, a federal judge may only be dismissed for proven incapacity or misbehaviour and with the support of a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of federal parliament. That will be the tone of our amendments.
The President of an Australian republic will be a unique figure, a constitutional umpire, and symbolic in his or her role as head of state. We believe the importance of such an office should not be underestimated nor should it be undermined. Our other constitutional umpires, our High Court judges, will enjoy far greater protection than our head of state under this model. Surely it is only fair 
 that the President of the Commonwealth of Australia should enjoy the same recourse to natural justice.
Beyond issues of natural justice, the Australian Democrats support the comments provided to the committee by witnesses such as Professor George Williams regarding the impact that uncertain tenure will have on the independence and the status of the President. The evidence argued that the independence and status of judges has evolved from their security of tenure, and the Australian Democrats are equally anxious that the independence and status of the President be fostered and protected as much as possible.
As foreshadowed in the Democrats minority report to the joint select committee, which was released this week, I will move an amendment to clause 62 of the constitution alteration bill to stipulate that a Prime Minister may only dismiss a President for proven incapacity or misbehaviour. Listening to some of the earlier contributions, I understand that Senator Brown is supportive of this course of action and I am glad of his support on this matter. I look forward to, hopefully, the support of other senators in protecting the status and independence of the head of state in an Australian republic. I tried on behalf of the Democrats at the Constitutional Convention last year to move amendments to address this matter, so this is not a new position on behalf of the Democrats. It is a balloted position that we all support and we will seek to rectify the bill.
 One aspect of this legislation that has been highlighted in recent days has been the unfortunate, inappropriate and inaccurate original title to this bill. As the previous speaker, Senator Faulkner, pointed out, the Prime Minister put forward a so-called compromise yesterday afternoon. On the one hand, it is an acknowledgment by the Prime Minister that the title needed changing but, on the other hand, it is still an inappropriate and inaccurate representation of the intent of the bill, specifically in relation to appointment by two-thirds of the parliament. We are aware that is a defect in his compromise and, for that reason, the Democrats have not supported that compromise.
Today, in an attempt to break what we see as a developing stalemate, we have put forward a form of words that is both accurate and simple. We hope that we will receive support from the parties in this chamber. I acknowledge Senator Faulkner's contribution and also today's comments from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, that the Labor Party is favourably disposed to our amendments. I hope that the support of the opposition and of members on the cross benches—if not the government—can be secured to ensure that a clear, straightforward and accurate question can be put to the people on 6 November.
 We believe that the simple, straightforward approach adopted by the Democrats in our proposed wording is in line with previous referenda. That is, you can seek to enshrine in the title and thus in the question the entire content or intent of the bill but, if you do, you must describe all the processes in relation to nomination, appointment and dismissal. You cannot point out only one aspect, as the Prime Minister has chosen to do so selectively—and inaccurately—of the so-called appointment process. For that reason, we do not support the compromise that he put forward yesterday. We have sought to put forward a title that will be simple when people enter the ballot box on 6 November. Our proposal at this stage is to shorten the original long title so that it reads: `A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic.' That is the Democrats' proposed wording. I defy anyone to find any signs of bias contained within that title.
 I hope that the Prime Minister will not insist that his compromise version is the one that is adopted in the lower house. It will certainly be a test of his willingness to put forward a question that is not rigged and not biased. It will be a test of his statesmanship if he is willing to take on board a new, simpler title.
 Also, the debate and the education of voters should not be taking place at the ballot box. People should not have to rely on the question in order to determine which way they are going to vote, because this would 
 require a comprehensive, wide-ranging educational campaign before voters get to the ballot box. The Australian Democrats are committed to ensuring that all Australians are fully informed of the issues before they vote on the referendum. The key to this campaign—and any successful referendum for that matter—is the education campaign. There is an onus on the government and the two committees, the yes and no committees, to provide a campaign that ensures voters can make an informed choice when they enter the ballot box on 6 November.
 The joint select committee heard evidence on the need to consider the needs of a range of Australians when implementing the education campaign. I am pleased to see that young people, Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds and those in remote areas all received mention in the committee's report as needing consideration. However, the committee also heard evidence from different communities, including indigenous representatives from, for example, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, claiming that greater efforts must be made than in the past to ensure that indigenous people in remote communities are adequately informed about the issues surrounding this referendum before 6 November.
With previous ballots, the first voters in many of these communities had heard of the referendum was when the mobile ballot box arrived on referendum day. This is unacceptable, and it clearly deserves attention. The multi-party committee, the joint select committee, was cognisant of those facts. I urge the government to take note of these requirements when implementing the education campaign.
I am quite concerned to learn today—we are waiting for our response from government—that, contrary to earlier indications, the government, as part of its general education campaign, will not be mailing information to households but will leave the onus on voters to visit public institutions and public places, such as libraries and post offices, to access this information. We look forward to hearing from the government whether that is exactly 
 the case in relation to the government's education campaign.
Support for these bills does not preclude further constitutional change. It does not prevent a new preamble or a more modernised Constitution in other respects. Part of this referendum is to ensure that we have a second Constitutional Convention and another opportunity to debate the merits of updating and constantly evolving our Constitution. It should be a living, breathing, modern document while containing elements of the past and the traditions and processes that we value so highly. It has served us well but that does not mean we cannot seek to continually update it in a way that suits our modern democracy and values.
As a member of the yes committee, I look forward to 6 November and seeing a successful referendum result. In the meantime, I hope that there will be much greater emphasis placed on the education campaigns and that voters feel excited by this process and well informed when they enter the ballot box on 6 November. The Democrats have sought to improve this legislation in a way that we feel is fit. In much the same way, we are moving today for a title that reflects in a simple but accurate way the intent of the referendum on 6 November.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-08-10,"—Australian citizens will be voting in a referendum in November this year. The outcome of this vote will determine whether as a nation, a federation of states, we become a republic. We are told as republicans that it is our duty to explain why change is needed in Australia. I argue that that change has already happened. It happened the moment we set foot outside England—when the colony was formed. We have become a nation in our own right through wars, depressions, cultural growth and ethical maturity. It is just that our Constitution does not reflect what we are. Our legal and political systems, whilst rooted in conventional models, are constantly evolving. We are asking that our present situation acknowledge and reflect this change.
During the Constitutional Convention and in the lead-up to the vote in November, we 
 have had a growing voice from many young people, the generations X and Y or however you might choose to categorise young people in this country. Like all generations in Australian society, their voices are not unanimous in their support of Australia's transition to a republic, but they have effectively made their voices heard in an articulate manner and with respect accorded to all members of our society, irrespective of their race, culture or personal opinion.
This vigour is encapsulated in the preamble to the Constitution suggested by the young people who attended the National Youth Roundtable:
We the people of Australia unite in our diversity. We uphold our representative democracy, respecting the rule of law and celebrating our common vision of freedom and equality. We assert the inherit equality of men and women and we recognise and value the custodianship of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We take pride in our unique natural environment and commit to its preservation for future generations. We participate in the global community in a spirit of cooperation and peace. With one voice, we affirm our belief in this Constitution and unite in an indissoluble federal Commonwealth.
The convolutions taking place at this moment as we move towards a republic are quite bewildering to many in our community. It is interesting to see that, along with the challenges of the vast range of views about the style of the republic, there are many who are completely apathetic or, worse, who see the republic debate as a distraction and something not worthy of debate either in this place or in the wider community.
Some of this cynicism that is reflected in so many political debates these days reflects upon the behaviour and tactics employed by many both in this place and in the wider community. They seek not to present a positive view regardless of which position they are speaking from but indeed resort to sneaky tactics of confusion and trickery to further complicate an issue that many people will have to decide upon as they cast their vote at the referendum in November.
Of all the convolutions that have taken place, one of the most remarkable features of the republic debate is the intrigue associated 
 with it. None was more fascinating than the event of the Constitutional Convention, where we saw an experiment constructed by essentially anti-republicans to scuttle the prospect of a referendum. I suppose that convention took on an electrifying life of its own. Ultimately, that convention delivered a clear majority view regarding a model for an Australian republic.
As a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, I can say that we were all swept up in the process. Even the Prime Minister acknowledged the responsibilities he walked away from Old Parliament House with. In the Prime Minister's closing address to the Constitutional Convention, he made great assertions of his respect for the Australian people's right to decide on their future as a nation. He said:
I have no doubt that Australia can conduct a referendum on this issue with vigour, with passion and with meaning and yet in a way that doesn't undermine or fracture the essential values of our society.
The Prime Minister then went on to say that he was very proud that the Liberal Party was mature enough and strong enough to allow people an open and free vote on this issue. One wonders what those words mean now in light of the recent negative and spoiling tactics of the Prime Minister with respect to this most important issue.
The great task of Australia deciding whether it will become a republic has been handed to a government which is characterised by its general support for the future of King Charles III being our Australian head of state, led of course by Mr Howard himself. Unfortunately for the citizens of this country, events of late have shown that Mr Howard has chosen not to conduct himself with impartiality. Instead, he has sought to override the prevailing view of the joint committee established specifically to advise impartially on this issue. At this point, it is easy to ascertain that there is a concerted spoiler campaign emanating from the monarchists in this place. Complicating the issues, including the complexity and length of the actual question to be asked at the referendum, is the strategy of these co-conspirators. 
Deliberately complicating the question is a case in point. We know from the science of surveys that different questions provoke different answers. The issue here is whether or not this shameful effort crosses the line of abusing the privilege that Mr Howard and his government have because he happens to be PM, they happen to be in government and he happens to be devoted to the British monarchy. The role this parliament was destined to play in our journey towards a republic was always going to be interesting. Maybe it was because, when Honest John stood up after the final ballot at the Constitutional Convention and committed himself to a referendum this year, we all knew his reputation—epitomised by the fact that his nickname is a deliberate ironic misnomer—ensured a process full of tricks and connivance designed specifically to scuttle it.
I would refer those who feel his conduct is merely worthy of parliamentary processes to the purpose and scope of the joint select committee and the series of recommendations tabled yesterday in this place. Having the government elect a head of state is not an attempt to cheat the Australian people of a head of state elected from the people by the people. It is an attempt to ensure that the election of a President would not evolve into an American style race for presidency available to those among us with wealth, charisma and movie style charm. It means that Australians would not be subjected to advertising campaigns, slogans and a cheap race to the top. Electing a President through a two-thirds majority of government allows for an impartial decision that goes hand in hand with the crucial community participation that it deserves. It allows for this without the obvious disadvantages of a directly elected model. The Australian President should be selected not on a brief but highly charged pre-election campaign, but on a lifetime of quiet achievement on humanitarian and social fronts. It would be nice to think our President could be someone respected and loved by everyone. It would be nice to think our President could humbly and with dignity represent us as a people without prejudice, overt political allegiances and corporate backing.
The Australian Labor Party want to make sure that we make the change to a republic for the start of the new millennium. We want to make sure we do this for the memories of those people who helped shape Australia, for those currently shaping Australia and for the future of our children—and we want to make sure we do it right. Another Constitutional Convention held three to five years after the introduction of a republic would allow us to take stock of ourselves and to consult widely on how we as a nation were settling into our republicanism. I would suggest it would allay the fears of those who seek to promulgate uncertainty about change.
Change in this case reflects a different need from the one we had a few hundred years ago and a practical modification which will help take us in the direction we want to take. I do not believe now is the time for faint-heartedness or dogged stubbornness. It is a time for innovation, independence and maturity. I believe being on the cusp of the new millennium is, in itself, a reason for change. It is like a catalyst occurring on many fronts, right across the public policy spectrum. Change is all around us. It is appropriate that we have the opportunity to make a decision, just over a month out from that remarkable date, that will see us enter the new century in a new form, not quite as a new nation but as a nation consolidated and brought together by our collective assertion that we are to go forward as one, recognising all of those who brought this country together.
The symbolism of a republic is about taking the power out of the Queen's hands and placing it within ourselves. This is not a selfish thing or an act of the people designed to offend. It is a process that is designed to embrace all. Another convention occurred just prior to the Constitutional Convention, and that was the Women's Constitutional Convention. One of the most fascinating stories told at that event was a reflection on our Federation and the drafting of our Constitution. The process that we have come through, both through the Women's Constitutional Convention and through the subsequent Constitutional Convention, means that we are in far better 
 shape now, all having had a say in how we take the next step forward.
To become an Australian republic is to embrace our multicultural society. It begs the question of what hope reconciliation has if we cannot at least recognise an Australian as a head of state who has relevance to us all. A yes vote for the republic is not one of hatred or vengeance; it is a recognition that we are not born from one country only but come from a host of nations and were stolen, brought, lured or enticed here by promises of a new start in the lucky country. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell so many of us that the country was already inhabited. We have struggled to come to terms with our past and bring a new future into this country. We will continue to do so in a stable constitutional frame and with dignity and strength. We are so utterly unique in our strength and in our sense of democracy and fairness that it is hard to compare us with any other.
It is true that many older generations of Australians may feel more of an attachment to the royal family but, to younger generations of Australians, they seem to resemble nearly that of a real life soap opera—tragic and, in many cases, unrelated to their lives. That does not mean that we do not celebrate what they have to offer and grieve at their misfortunes, but it does not mean that we should blindly accept their continuing role in representing Australia in any way.
Many Australians believe that we have bigger issues to solve before this one. I agree that there are many challenges that desperately need addressing. However, if we cannot as a community decide what we want in an Australian head of state, where do we stand on issues that deeply affect our community? Becoming a republic will not put food on our plates. It will not get our children off the streets, but it is nevertheless crucial in establishing ourselves in the eyes of the international community and further developing our sense of self. No matter how long we stand here debating the reasons behind voting for or against Australia becoming a republic, it does not change the fact that the reasons for voting for a republic are deeply personal ones. It is not a matter of taking sides with whichever 
 politician you find the most believable; it is really a matter of deciding what rings true for you. At the end of the day, with all the grandstanding and name-calling, it is a matter of self-respect.
It has been a fascinating process to date. I look forward to the continuing debate and to hearing the views of my colleagues in this place. Most of all, I remain optimistic. I think that, come November, Australians will gather round and realise that it is a profound opportunity, one that should not be lost and one that is in fact entrenched in a positive future. I look forward to the day following the referendum when we can all turn to each other and celebrate what will be a remarkable step in a progressive direction for this wonderful nation.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-08-10,"—This is an exciting moment in Australia's constitutional history. Unlike the previous speaker, I commend the Prime Minister for supporting this process which will give the opportunity to the Australian people to make a historic choice. Without the support of the Prime Minister in facilitating this referendum process, it would simply not have occurred. That is notwithstanding the fact that he might hold a different view to mine as to the preferred outcome. In fact, it is good to be a member of a party that tolerates different points of view.
One of the treasures housed within the walls of this Parliament House is an oil painting by one of Australia's most famous artists, Tom Roberts. The painting depicts in magnificent detail the opening of the first Australian parliament at the Melbourne Great Exhibition Hall on 9 May 1901. It was a moment of great significance in the birth of our nation. What is most striking about the painting is the way that it captures the dynamics and the symbolism of that historic event 98 years ago. On the stage stand the governors of the various states of the new federation, appointed representatives, of course, of a foreign monarch. Overlooking them is a large ornate crown, a symbol of the British monarchy. At the front of the stage the King's son, His Royal Highness the Duke of 
 Cornwall and York, later to become King George V, reads from a document. Below them at the foot of the stage, looking up at the gathered representatives of the British monarchy, stand the duly elected Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Edmund Barton, and the elected representatives of the Australian people.
Perhaps the symbolism of an infant nation standing respectfully at the foot of its former ruler was appropriate for 1901, but Australia has come a long way since then. We have endured the Great Depression. We have fought in two world wars and several regional military conflicts. We have been enriched by the great influx of migrants from many nations so that we are genuinely a multicultural society. We have welcomed the refugees of conflicts within our region and elsewhere. We have expanded our cities, developed our regions and grown our economy. We are seeking reconciliation with indigenous Australians in a way which better acknowledges their special relationship with the land.
It might be that the symbolism of the Tom Roberts painting accurately reflected the mood and attitudes of 1901 but, looked at through contemporary eyes, it seems comical. It demonstrates the extent to which Australia has changed over the last century. It is ironic that this famous painting, which is part of our nation's heritage and housed in our national parliament, is not owned by the Australian people but rather is on permanent loan from Her Majesty's royal collection.
In my speech to last year's Constitutional Convention, I argued that symbols are important to our nation and its people. Symbols unite us as a people and help define us as a nation. Symbols bind us together in times of adversity, inspire us to greater efforts and allow us to collectively share in the achievements of our nation. The symbol of a British monarch as the head of state of an Australia addressing the challenges and opportunities of the new millennium is no longer appropriate. We need contemporary symbols meaningful to the modern Australia.
What do we say about our pride in our own capacity as a people when we bar every Australian from holding the highest office in 
 the land? What image do we project when our head of state, entirely understandably, has as her first loyalty the interests of another nation, a head of state whose very appointment and line of succession is determined by the rules established by a foreign parliament rather than our own?
In adopting contemporary symbols and, in particular, the appointment of an Australian as a head of state, we do not want to undermine the substantial strengths of the existing Constitution. The symbols need to be changed, but I am the first to demand that any proposed constitutional amendment does not pose a threat to the stability and security of our current constitutional structure. I would suggest that the bill accurately reflects both goals. The Constitution enshrines as its enduring features the principles of representative democracy, separation of powers and federalism. These safeguards, the substance of our Constitution, are not affected by this proposed change.
The bill before us would establish an Australian republic based on the preferred model supported by the Constitutional Convention. It will give the Australian people an Australian head of state in place of the Queen and her representative, the Governor-General. The model involves the Australian people in the selection of that head of state through the Presidential Nominations Committee process. The committee will have community representation and will invite nominations from the general public. Ultimately, the final nomination will require the approval of a two-thirds majority of the elected representatives of the people. In practice, this modestly reduces the broad discretion of the Prime Minister, but it also enhances the responsibility of the parliament as a whole.
Under the proposed model, the powers of the President would be the same as the Governor-General, and the constitutional conventions that apply in the exercise of the Governor-General's powers would apply to the exercise of the President's powers. It is a cautious change. It is in fact a conservative option. It avoids the inherent dangers of the more radical republican models such as direct election, which would radically alter the 
 relationship between the Prime Minister and the head of state, bringing with it the risk of instability.
In relation to the removal of a President, it would be the responsibility of the Prime Minister but, after taking such an action, the Prime Minister must then, within 30 days, seek the approval of the House of Representatives. It has been suggested that this gives new powers to the Prime Minister. But, under the present arrangements, the Prime Minister can dismiss the Governor-General by advising the Queen to do so. Again, as I said at the Constitutional Convention, if the relationship between the Prime Minister and the head of state has to be slightly rejigged, it should be in favour of the Prime Minister. The need to seek the approval of the House of Representatives provides an additional check, which again enhances the role of the democratically elected parliament.
I firmly believe that the time has come for Australia to take the next logical step in an evolving constitutional structure and appoint an Australian as head of state. I believe it can be done by adopting this model without any threat to the inherent strengths of the existing Constitution. The symbols are outdated, but the substance remains. Unlike the Tom Roberts painting of which I spoke earlier, our Constitution was never intended to be a static representation of the prevailing attitudes of 1901.
We now stand independent and proud in so many ways. We have built a unique society on this island continent. It would seem odd indeed if we were to enter the next millennium still not yet ready to match our economic, social and cultural identity with constitutional symbols that are truly Australian. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-10,"—I listened in general agreement to what the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, had to say in this debate on the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 —that is, it is now time to take up our identity as Australians and go forth in our history on that basis. For many centuries, Australia's history in fact had nothing to do with the English Crown or with 
 England. It has been only in the last 200-odd years that the monarch of England has also been the monarch of Australia. That history has been very productive and it is a period in which both good and bad things have happened.
The first Governor-General of Australia was the 7th Earl of Hopetoun. The second one was the 2nd Baron Tennyson, who was the son of Lord Tennyson, who wrote a poem that I learned at school. It was a poem written in English, the language that we speak and will continue to speak, I take it, in the future.
I remember that poem from my childhood days. There were some lines in it which have kept coming back to me and which seem quite apt now. While putting King Arthur on the barge to float on the lake, Sir Bedivere, the last of all King Arthur's knights—you will remember this, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert—said, `This is awful. This is the end of the Round Table, this great symbol of justice and peace.' It is the reply that King Arthur gave him which I think is apt to quote now:
And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:
""The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
And God fulfils Himself in many ways,
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
That seems to be very apt in the context of this debate. The development of Australian history over the last 200 years has been under the British monarchy. Many good things have come from that, but there is a time when those good things which came from that period are to be set aside. Because a thing is good in the past does not mean to say it continues to be good.
This is what Tennyson was saying, the father of the second Governor-General of Australia: if you cling too long to a thing that started off as good, that good thing becomes bad. It is time to move on. Unless you do move on, that system that you benefited from will start to become corrupted, not in the criminal sense but in the sense of not performing the task that it should now be performing. Now is the time for Australia to move on, to thank the monarchy, to thank the British Isles for all they have contributed to 
 this country and to keep good relations with those countries, but it is time to move on as Australians. Unless we do, as King Arthur said to Sir Bedivere, one good custom may corrupt Australia. That is the issue.
The monarch has been a great symbol and is still a great symbol for England which fits in amongst the traditions of that land, amongst the countryside of that land and amongst the buildings of that land such as the great castles. You have been to Windsor Castle, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert. That is the Queen's context. But is the Queen's context Lake Macquarie, Zeehan, Queenstown or the great West Coast of Tasmania? Is the Queen's context the Great Ocean Road in Victoria or the Blue Mountains? Is she associated with that? What about the Daintree Forest, the Kimberley, Uluru and the Flinders Ranges? Are they the things that we associate with the Queen? Or do we associate her with London, Balmoral Castle and the things of England?
—What about the McGauran estate?
—And the McGauran estate, as Senator O'Brien says. We have to think in terms of what symbolises Australia. What this debate is saying is this: whoever symbolises Australia ought to be an Australian. Senator Eggleston comes from that great region in the north of Western Australia, the Pilbara. It is very Australian, but I would suggest that it is not the sort of place in which a monarch would live.
Ever since Cook came to Australia and ever since Arthur Phillip came here and established European settlement it has been inevitable in some way that Australia would become separated through the convict periods, through the mining periods, through the selection periods. Our forebears would remember all those times right through to the various wars of this century and the various developments that have taken place. There have been artists who have symbolised that, such as Marcus Clarke who wrote For the Term of His Natural Life.
—A wonderful story.
—It is a wonderful story, as Senator Lundy says. A lot of it was set against the background of Tasmania and Port Arthur. Then there is Adam Lindsay Gordon from Victoria. Those people have pictured the Australia that we have come to know and love. Dorothea Mackellar wrote those great lines: `I love a sunburnt country' and so on. They have set the symbol. Modern writers such as Patrick White, Les Murray and Bruce Dawe, who, in my view, is perhaps the greatest of Australian poets, have pictured Australia as it is. They have pictured it without feeling the necessity of introducing a monarch into that picture.
There has always been a move to become a separate country, and the movement towards a republic has been going on for a long time. It was in the 1880s that Louisa Lawson published the Republican. Senator Lundy would know that. Her son Henry wrote those great poems of his, Freedom on the Wallaby and A Song of the Republic, which really proclaimed the republican spirit. Another great Australian, a Tasmanian, Andrew Inglis Clark, helped draft the Constitution under which we now live. He much admired the American system and he was a republican and acknowledged as such. So there has been this background to a republic and here, over 100 years later, we are still wondering what we should do and what we should not do about it.
It is clear that the time has come—perhaps it should have come earlier—for us to take up the responsibility we have as Australians. As Senator Hill has just said, we are an amalgam of many people from many nations, and that is very important. When my forebears came here it was a country taken up predominantly—almost completely—by people from the British Isles. Things have moved on since then, and it would be wrong to cling to the past. I have a great attachment to those people who came in the 19th century, as no doubt you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, knowing your history, but it is time not to cling to that, not to be selfish. Our predecessors welcomed people from all over the world. The place that we now dwell in is now 
 different from that of our forebears. That is the first issue—the issue of a republic.
The issue of the Queen is different. On 28 April 1993 Michael Tate sent me a copy of an article which he had written entitled, `A head of state for Australia'. He made the sorts of points that Senator Faulkner was making before—that the monarch of England, because of the Act of Settlement in 1701, must be a non-Catholic; it was expressed as a non-papist. The succession must go to the son, rather than the daughter, and must be in terms of age, not in terms of merit. There is the understanding that the monarch will live in England, and that is correct. They are the sorts of values, as Senator Faulkner said, which we would not acknowledge as being significant now and which in fact would be injurious. They would be corrupting influences in a country where thankfully there is not that religious dispute that there was in England in the 17th century and which is still manifest in Northern Ireland, with the marches. That is not part of the character that we as Australians would like to manifest.
I now wish to say something about the model that the republic should take. Much has been made of the fact that the Prime Minister will be able to dismiss a President, but that is the situation now. The Prime Minister can dismiss the Governor-General, just as the Governor-General can dismiss the Prime Minister. That happened in 1975. In relation to executive power, schedule 1 of the bill says:
There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the President in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the President and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.
So the President can dismiss the government, just as the Governor-General can do. It is that idea that I think Mr Richard McGarvie had; it was that balance where the President can dismiss the Prime Minister and the government and the Prime Minister can dismiss the President. So you have a balance of terror, if you like. It is a bit like the old days of the Cold War, when the balance of forces was the big thing. That is a great guarantee. If the President is to be elected, then he is more 
 powerful than the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is not elected. The parliament is elected. If the Prime Minister were to lose the numbers in the House of Representatives, that would be the end of it.
If the people of Australia trust the parliament to elect a Prime Minister and an executive—the important people who govern the country—why wouldn't they trust two-thirds of the parliament to elect a President? It is an attractive idea to say, `Let the people elect the President.' You say to yourself, `What can be wrong with that?' Certainly, nobody is saying, `Let's elect a Prime Minister'—the most powerful person in Australia in that sense—`directly.' We are saying, `No. We elect the parliament, and the parliament can decide that issue.'
If you do have two people—the Prime Minister, in whom is placed the power, although it is not spelt out in the Constitution very much if you look at the chapter on executive government, and a President who is elected—you do have gridlock. You do have the people subjected to a possible dissension between two powerful figures—which cannot do a society much good. The people do have the power to elect a Prime Minister through the collegiate system of the parliament. In the same way, you have the power through the same system to elect a President and also, because of the mechanism I was talking about before, to dismiss a President.
It is time, I think—and not only do I think it but I will be rash enough to say that I know it—for us to become a nation unto ourselves with an Australian, one of our own, leading us. That is the central proposition of this debate. Then you come to the mechanism for how that is to be done. But the central question, and this has been said again and again in this debate and over the years, is: do we want an Australian? At the moment, under the Constitution as it is written, we have an unelected head of government. If you read the Constitution and look at the times in which it was written, that is the proposition: an unelected monarch whose whole purpose and culture is embedded in the traditional English system. 
We have developed to the point where we now want to move on, and this is the significant thing. Remember the words of Lord Tennyson, that if we stick to what has been a good thing for too long, the whole system ultimately becomes corrupted.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-08-10,"—Vox populi, vox dei: the voice of the people is the voice of God. And if the voice of the people on 6 November decides for a republic, then you will hear no more from me with respect to that subject. But I want to say something about that now before 6 November. At least one of the questions we must ask is what the best system of government is. No-one could deny that in the almost 100 years of federal politics and federal parliament in this country we have had one of the most enviable political systems in the world. There is no question about that.
We are in fact one of the four or five oldest continuous democracies in the world and yet we are one of the youngest, in terms of our country. Are we to give that away for a largely unknown system, a system that has not been proven, a system that is hybrid? At least the system that we sometimes refer to as the `Washminster' system that we have today—a cross between Washington and Westminster—has been proven to work. It has been proven to work because we were largely in those years a homogenous society. But we do not know whether the system that we may inherit in the future is going to work. I do not want to be part of the machinery of government that brings us into disrepute or brings insecurity or that changes that which we have that is secure, safe and proven in the country in which we live, one of the greatest countries on earth.
We are in effect a Crown republic. You hear Senator Cooney and others speak of a foreign head of state. We have had for some decades only an Australian as head of state. Yes, we do have a Queen of Australia, and that is unique. But there is nothing wrong in this world with having an unelected monarch as head, titular or absolute. Take our most significant trading partner, Japan: the United States and its allies in 1945 and 1946, under General McArthur, deemed the monarchical 
 system in Japan as the best possible system for Japan. And they are our biggest trading partner. Do we denigrate Japan because they do not have an elected titular head?
The same goes for Thailand, for the revolving monarchical system in Malaysia, for the absolute ruler of Brunei and for the important part that the sovereign of Jogjakarta plays in the most populous nation north of us. And the same goes for New Zealand and for other countries around the world. Are we in this parliament going to denigrate those people and those nations that have an unelected head of state? Even the Swedes still tolerate—and, in some cases, revere—their head of state, the King of Sweden, whose family was put there by Napoleon as part of a quid pro quo for not invading Sweden. And still today that system endures. Sweden, on the other side, was arguably one of those systems, one of those particular governments that they would have liked Australia to be, but I do not think it suits Australia. Notwithstanding that, if we are going to adopt the Keating-Turnbull system of government we must tread very carefully.
Are you aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if we adopt the model as proposed for the referendum there will be no fewer than 69 different constitutional changes? I am not going to spell out all those constitutional changes, but they are quite significant. There is no minimalist McGarvie model. There can be no minimalist McGarvie model. There can be no minimalist model. We are going to make a fundamental change to our lives. I hope that if this change does happen—God forbid—it does work.
The nominations are the flaws in the model. Half will be politicians. That is the Nominations Committee. All are to be appointed by a Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister has the power of veto. He can ignore the recommendation of the committee anyway. Why would you want to set up a committee when one person, in the very antithesis of a democracy, can deny the nomination of that committee? Good quality candidates will as a result, I believe, not promote themselves or put their names forward if a veto is so readily available to the recommendation of the committee. You need bipartisan support, as we always have 
 with referenda questions. If we do not get bipartisan support, or significantly so, it will fail, and I trust it will fail.
I do not want to pass on to my constituents or my children or my grandchildren a system that is flawed, particularly when that flawed system would replace a system that works well. Yes, you can go back to 1975, and say, `The system didn't work there.' I would argue that the system did. I would argue that only once before in the old British Empire, now the Commonwealth of Nations, has a Prime Minister been dismissed. Students of history may correct me, but I think it was Lord North that was sacked by George III for losing the American colonies. I would hate to see a Prime Minister of Australia sacked for losing Australia. That ought to be a salutary lesson for us. We are not established, as my dear friend and colleague Senator Robert Hill said, by a foreign parliament. We are established as a result of a progressive act of this parliament, assisted by the imperial parliament, to become totally independent. We are beholden to no-one. We are a proud, independent Crown republic—something unique in the world. We can join the ranks of the also-rans, but we are unique in the world.
I refer to those proposed slight amendments to the referendum question by the Prime Minister whereby we would mention both the Queen and the Governor-General being replaced with a President. Some would of course argue, as they have, that that is not enough, but it never is. When you give in, the one that makes the first offer always loses. Others want to take it a bit further. Others are saying that the present words should be replaced with `Australian President'. It is a tautology. I thought it was abundantly clear to everyone but the most stupid among us that it would be an Australian President. But if we say that, where does it stop? Do we then say that it should be the `Australian Queen'? That is what she is—she is Queen of Australia. Should `Queen of Australia' be replaced by `Australian President' or `Australian Governor-General'? Let us put `Australia' before `Governor-General'. Let us put `Australia' before `Queen'. The argument is completely fallacious. It is not a valid argument.
I thought the Prime Minister went more than halfway towards agreeing with some of those who were belly-aching because they could see the numbers on the wall. They are good at doing numbers. Senator Forshaw is good at numbers. They could see the numbers on the wall that it was not going to work. You were finding that your people were leaving you in droves because you want the model that allows a President to be elected by two-thirds of parliament and then allows that President to be dismissed by a Prime Minister at his whim; by the Prime Minister writing to the President, saying, `You are dismissed.' Full stop. Period. Nothing more. What an awful thing to replace one of the greatest systems in the world.
—Rubbish.
—Senator Forshaw said that Australia does not have one of the greatest systems in the world. I am surprised by that. Tertiary educated Senator Forshaw says `rubbish' to one of the great systems of Australia. I can tell you, Senator Forshaw, that in Northern Ireland they would like to have our system. In Northern Ireland they would like to have something like what we are proposing. Only the most bigoted Irish Catholics would not accept that, and only the most tormented of our Protestants would not accept that. That is why there is trouble there.
I want a system for my country, for my constituents, for my children and for my grandchildren that works. I do not want to experiment with their future. It is their future. Never before, except in time of war, will the young people of Australia have a more serious conundrum to answer: do they want to retain a system that works, that gives them security, that is the envy of the world, or do they want a system that cannot be demonstrated to be working anywhere else in the world? This is not the Swiss system—the cantonments there control the federal parliament of Switzerland. This is not the United States system we are proposing where the President is directly elected. This is not the German system. But I will tell you this: there are countries throughout the world that have replaced their monarch to their detriment, to 
 their sorrow, and where vast damage was done.
Some examples that spring to mind very quickly are Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, followed then perhaps by Tsar Nicholas of Russia and then Franco, who overthrew the Spanish monarch and then on his death restored the Spanish monarch. There are plenty of these examples that show you that, if transition is not smooth and if transition does not have bipartisan support, we are in for trouble. Senator Cooney mentioned Dorothea Mackellar, who wrote My Country:
I love a sunburnt country,
A land of sweeping plains,
Of rugged mountain ranges,
Of droughts and flooding plains.
I love her far horizons,
I love her jewel-sea,
Her beauty and her terror—
The wide brown land for me!
That is My Country . I do not want radical change. I do not want anything even coming close to revolution. I want the system that evolves to be that which is best for the people of Australia, that is best for my state of Western Australia and my children and my grandchildren. I do not want a system based on bigotry. I do not want a system that is based on old hatreds. I do not want a system except that which offers something better than the one we have. And no-one is prepared to tell me how much better any new system, any model you want to give me—a direct elected President; a President elected by two-thirds of parliament—is going to be; how much more bread it is going to put on the table, how much it is going to drop unemployment, how much it is going to bring in health terms to Aboriginal people, how much it is going to lower our national debt. No-one has told me these important things yet, and I will be waiting for those who speak opposite to tell me how much more benefit it is going to have for us.
I do not know whether there is that much more I can say. Even if Senator Forshaw has not got my message yet, I think that he could probably listen a bit longer. But there is one more important thing I want to say, and that 
 is: what is the role of the states? What happens constitutionally if the federal government chooses to go to a republic or the people of Australia choose a federal republic? Does that mean that the states automatically will be forced to go along? Does that mean that Western Australia, Queensland and some of the smaller states will be forced to follow? Does that mean we will have our Constitution overlooked in those states? Does it mean that the High Court in its omnipotence that has not been changed, where we at least had one last appellate court of appeal to the Privy Council, will deem in all its authority that, because the federal government went to a republic, all the states must go to a republic too? Does that mean that a republic and a monarchical system in one, two or more states is incompatible with the federal system?
These are questions—and they are serious questions—that we must ask. The path to a republic is not strewn with roses and flower petals; it is a serious question that we must all face. But it comes down to the people in this house, in this chamber, as to whether we decide on a republic or whether we decide to retain the present system. Because, if we do not have bipartisan support—if we do not have nearly bipartisan support—it will not be successful.
Some of the republicans have already said that they can smell defeat, and may that be so. But they have already said, `If it fails this time, we will whack it up again in a couple of years time.' I do not think that is on. I think one day we will have a republic. We are not ready for it yet, and we will not be ready for it for a long time to come. But I ask you in my closing words to consider what Premier Richard Court said at the Convention. He said:
The states' position on this issue of change to the Constitution is fundamental.
I remind the chamber that it was the states that created the Commonwealth, not the other way around. So far, I have heard no-one speak about the states' position. I have heard no argument put about the states. I have heard no-one in this house say that the states are fundamental to the massive change that we are about to question. At worst, the states not 
 wanting to become a republic could secede from the federation. At best, each state would have to re-write its own Constitution, have its own President and establish its own rules for nomination, appointment and dismissal processes. To facilitate a move to a republic, a state referendum would be required to amend provisions of the Constitution Act of Western Australia, including those relating to the Governor.
It is not a simple move. Please, I ask through the chamber to the people of Australia: think seriously about what you do on 6 November. It is not that far off in terms of our history. Ask seriously what you can do. There is no minimalist change. Do not give up something that has been tried and true and is the envy of the world for something of which we know not much about.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-10,"—I am glad that I am able to follow Senator Lightfoot. I hope he remains in the chamber, because I want to respond during my remarks to some of the quite fallacious arguments and distortions of history that he and many of his monarchist supporters have put forward in this debate, both in this parliament and publicly. But let me just state at the outset that I believe that the appropriate question that should be put before the people at the forthcoming referendum is that which was recommended by the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. I believe that this proposed question—on which I note that the Prime Minister has since put forward a revised view on behalf of the government—from the joint committee captures the essence of the fundamental issue. The proposed question, of course, was whether or not the people would support:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.
The proposal has been revised by the Prime Minister on behalf of the government to refer to the method of appointment of a President by a two-thirds majority of parliament. Whilst my preference is for that which was recommended by the joint select committee, the revised proposal is at least a better proposi 
 tion than that originally put forward by the Prime Minister. What is the fundamental issue that the people of Australia are going to be asked to vote on? The fundamental issue is whether Australia should have an Australian as its head of state, a person called the Australian President, or whether we should continue into the next century, the next millennium, with our current position.
What is our current position? Our current position, constitutionally, and in reality, is that the head of state of Australia is the monarch of the United Kingdom. At the present time—and this has been so for a number of years—it is the Queen of England, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Under our Constitution, Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors, whomever they may be, remain the head of state of Australia unless the people vote yes at the forthcoming referendum.
The Prime Minister's initial proposal and his revised proposal, which is an improvement, are loaded because they both put the emphasis of the question on the method of selection and not on the fundamental issue of whether we replace our existing head of state—namely, a foreign monarch—with an Australian head of state. I have read the minority report of Senator Abetz, who has just come into the chamber, and I have heard the arguments of Senator Lightfoot.
Whilst the Prime Minister has inserted into the revised proposal a reference to the method of selection requiring a two-thirds majority of the parliament, he has never put on the public record—he is not proposing to put it in the question—or reminded the people that under the current system the Prime Minister alone has the power to appoint the Governor-General. It is within the gift of the Prime Minister, solely, to select the Governor-General as the Queen's representative in this country and put that name forward to the Queen.
If the Prime Minister is going to talk about selection processes, why doesn't he come clean with the Australian people and remind them of the current position? The proposal whereby a committee would select a list of candidates to go forward to the Prime 
 Minister, which the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition can put before the parliament and get two-thirds, at least, in favour of such an appointment, is far better and far more democratic and involves a far greater say for the Australian people than the current position.
Let me turn to some of the arguments that have been advanced by those who oppose an Australian as our head of state. I will come back to arguments as to why I believe we should support the proposition. I want to dismantle and refute some of these arguments, these myths, that have been advanced by the likes of Senator Lightfoot, Senator Abetz, Mr Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister and so on. One of their arguments is that we have the best system in the world.
I agree we have the best system in that world, but the reason we have the best system is not because we are a constitutional monarchy. It is an insult to the intelligence and the character of the Australian people to suggest that the only reason we have had stable, democratic, secure and free government in this country all of this century is because we have a foreign monarch resident 20,000 kilometres away in Buckingham Palace. That is a fallacious argument; it is pure sophistry.
The reason Australia—unlike a number of other constitutional monarchies, including the United Kingdom itself—has remained a stable and peaceful country all of this century is, firstly, because of our geographic location. We have never had to worry about land wars with neighbours such as have bedevilled the European continent for many years. We are a young country that has not had to live with—as many countries have had to live with and still do—centuries of crossborder territorial disputes such as exist in the Middle East and in Europe. We have been free of all of that. Indeed, we have been the country that has welcomed refugees from countries around the world. Those people have come here and contributed to this great nation and have held the fabric—along with Australians born in this country—of democracy and freedom together.
It is because of the character of the Australian people, their belief in the rule of law and 
 their support for democracy that this country has one of the best systems in the world. To suggest that the whole fabric of our society hangs together on the basis of a constitutional monarch is an insult to the Australian people. Senator Lightfoot is saying that Australians are not ready to remove the foreign monarch as our head of state and put an Australian in place, and that we will not be ready to do that for a long time to come. What a disgraceful suggestion to make about the great character of the Australian people.
These are the people, as Senator Lightfoot has stood up in this parliament and said, who have gone and given their lives to defend this country. Yet you insult them by suggesting we do not have the intelligence, the wit or the understanding to stand up and proclaim to the world that we are big enough, independent enough, strong enough and free enough to have one of our own citizens as our head of state. You mentioned `Vox populi' at the start of your speech—the people have spoken. You even drew God into the reference, of course—
—Vox populi, vox dei.
—That is right. Well, even the College of Cardinals that elects God's representative on this earth has an election! They get the chance to appoint their own leader. But the British monarch gets there by virtue of hereditary descent. You have to have been a Hanover or a Hapsburg or married into the Battenbergs or you have to have been born into the House of Windsor in order to become the monarch of Britain and therefore the head of state of Australia.
While I am referring to the situation of the British monarch, what of this argument that somehow constitutional monarchies of themselves guarantee peace and stability? What a load of historical claptrap. Have a look at the history of the United Kingdom. You do not have to go back that far—you only have to go back to the greatest constitutional crisis that faced the English-speaking world in the British Commonwealth this century. What was that? It was when Prince Edward became the King of England in 1936. But what was the problem? He wanted to marry a divorced woman and that was contrary to the Act of Settlement of 1701. The British parliament 
 stood on the threshold of dismissing the King, as it has the power to do under the British constitution. It has done so on a number of occasions, for example in 1688 with the English Revolution or when Cromwell chopped off the head of Charles I in 1649 or when the nobles in 1215 forced King John to sign the Magna Carta.
That is a snapshot of the history of constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom. It has produced a monarchical system out of bloodshed, out of execution, out of revolution, out of war and out of religious bigotry. As you know, the Act of Settlement prevents any Catholic person from ascending to the throne of England. As I was saying a moment ago, the greatest constitutional crisis facing the United Kingdom this century was when Prince Edward rightfully succeeded to the throne as King Edward VIII, but had to abdicate because he was going to marry a divorced woman. That is how King George VI became the King of England, and of course it is Queen Elizabeth, his daughter, who is our current Queen.
The point that I am making to you, Senator Lightfoot, and all of your monarchist supporters is that, when you stand up and suggest that the system of constitutional monarchy is inherently stable, free and democratic, and holds the thread of Australian society together, it is not true. It is contrary to history. It brought the British parliament and the English Crown into direct competition. It was only through the abdication of the King that the conflict was resolved. So the system is not a perfect one. I have far greater faith in the wisdom, integrity and honesty of the Australian people and their commitment to democracy, the rule of law and respect for their fellow man than I do for the continuation of a system of constitutional monarchy and hereditary right of succession that designates a person to be our head of state.
It has been said that, if we move to an Australian head of state, we will destroy our Constitution. Again, that is a nonsensical argument. How can it destroy the Constitution? What sort of a Constitution do we have? What sort of a system of parliamentary democracy do we have in this country?
—We have one of the best in the world.
—That is right, we do. One must ask the question: if it is so strong and so robust, surely it can withstand the simple change whereby finally an Australian can be given the honour of being our head of state. If you think our constitutional system is so weak that a simple change like that will destroy it, then you argue completely against your own proposition. The Australian Constitution is strong. It is of course in need of reform—no constitution stands the test of time immutably. But we have been able to change the Constitution in this country on a number of occasions and crisis has not broken out. Indeed, the greatest constitutional crisis we faced in this country, in 1975, proves the point.
—The system endured.
—The system endured, I agree with you, Senator Lightfoot. But again I say to you that the reason why the system endured was not that the Queen was asleep 20,000 kilometres away in Buckingham Palace and Gough Whitlam, instead of getting on the telephone, went back to the Lodge and had a steak. That is not why the system endured. It was not because we had a constitutional monarch with a foreign head of state. It endured because the Australian people and, in particular, the Australian Labor Party and its leaders were prepared to support the principles of the rule of law and parliamentary democracy.
We did not like the decision; we believed that the decision to dismiss Mr Whitlam as Prime Minister was wrong. Many Australians did not agree with that decision. This country withstood its greatest constitutional crisis; we did not resort to anarchy or any civil disturbance. Why? It was because of the inherent character of the Australian people and their support for our democratic institutions. They are the real reasons why the fabric hangs together, not because of some potentate, monarch or royal family in another country who happens to be our head of state.
We then get the complete sophistry put forward by the likes of Tony Abbott and in particular the Australians for a Constitutional 
 Monarchy organisation that the Queen is not really our head of state and that it is the Governor-General.
—Of course he is.
—If that is the case, what is the problem? Why not turn the de facto situation into a de jure situation and make it abundantly clear forever and a day? Why not do that? I take the point made by Senator Marise Payne earlier that those people who continue to oppose the proposition and say that an Australian is not good enough to be the head of state do a disservice and attack our Constitution—the very thing that they claim to say they uphold.
I heard Tony Abbott say the other day that the republican cause is being promoted by the elites. What could be more elitist than the monarchy—a system of hereditary peerage, a system whereby the moment the current monarch of the United Kingdom dies her successor becomes our head of state? What could be more elitist than that? I do not mind if the British want that system—that is fine—but why do we have to have the system of another country? When you talk about elites, you are talking about one of the anarchic elitist systems in the world where you can only ever get to be the head of state of this country by virtue of birth and by making sure you are not a Catholic.
Following on from that point, it has even been suggested to me in some of the letters I have received that we will destroy our Christian tradition in Australia. As a Christian, I resent that. I also resent the fact that there are built-in prejudices within the current system because of the operation of the Act of Settlement of 1701.
I will deal with the suggestion made by Senator Boswell that we would lose our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations. Of the 50 members comprising the Commonwealth of Nations, only 21 of them are monarchies and 16 of them, including Australia, have a foreign monarch as their head of state—they are the ones who accept the Queen of England as their head of state. The majority of members of the Commonwealth of Nations do not have a foreigner as their head of state. Any suggestion that we 
 will somehow miss out on membership of the Commonwealth of Nations is another spurious argument.
I look forward to the day, hopefully soon, when an Australian head of state can visit the Queen or King of England and meet them on an equal footing—to be able to visit them not as their humble servant and their representative in the Commonwealth but as their equal. I look forward to the day when the leader of the United States is able to visit this country, attend a banquet in the Great Hall, and stand and propose a toast to our Australian head of state—not to some foreign monarch.
I hope the Australian people seize the opportunity offered by the referendum to enable a situation to occur where any Australian mother, father, son or daughter—be they boilermaker or barrister, labourer or lawyer, doctor or dishwasher—can rise to the honoured position of Australia's head of state. I urge Australians to vote not for king and country but for Australia, its people and its future.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-08-10,"—On 6 November I will be voting no to the proposed constitutional change. The reason is not that I am anti-republican. Indeed, four years ago I co-sponsored a motion at my party's state council to delete reference to the constitutional monarchy in my party's objectives. However, I do reject the Keating-Turnbull model before us. Having said that, I will be voting for the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  legislation that is before us because our Prime Minister and this government promised to the Australian people that the model that would emerge out of the Constitutional Convention would be put before the Australian people for them to determine its fate.
It should be recalled at this very early stage of consideration that the proposal that will be put before the Australian people failed to get a majority at that Constitutional Convention, albeit a substantial majority of those delegates were in favour of Australia becoming a republic, and I will return to that point later. Within this debate there is a substantial group of people who want to talk about a republic 
 but not about the model, because they know that if people knew what the model is that they will be voting on they would overwhelmingly reject it.
I will facilitate that vote by the Australian people by supporting this legislation to allow the question to move forward. But, having done so, I will work untiringly to achieve a no vote on 6 November. Why do I do that? Yes, I do support the symbolism of a republic and I do support having all our constitutional and legal arrangements within our boundaries. Can I just say as an aside that it is quite ironic that the rabid republicans within this nation who crave this so-called independence are the same people who seek to foist international treaties on this country willy-nilly and thus undermine our national sovereignty. There seems to be a big double standard in their rhetoric and in their considerations.
 The facts and the tests that I apply to this debate are fairly straightforward. I note the fact that the Australian Constitution has served the people well for nearly one whole century. I recognise that just because the system is good does not of itself militate against the understandable desire held by some, which I share as well, that Australia should become a republic. However, in acknowledging those facts, it sets a very high standard against which any proposed republican model must be judged. It was when making that comparison that I came down very firmly on the no side, because the proposal contained within this legislation is substantially flawed.
First of all, let me turn to the issue of the question or the long title of this legislation. With respect, a lot of nonsense has been spoken in this chamber about whether or not the Queen is the Queen of Australia. Allow me to quote:
If the constitution is not altered, Australia's head of state will, in due course, be Charles III by the grace of God King of Australia.
Who said that? No greater authority than the most rabid republican in this nation, the Hon. E.G. Whitlam AC, QC, in correspondence dated 28 July 1999. It is absolutely and fundamentally clear that, if we put in the question that the President we are voting for 
 be Australian, to be fair and reasonable we would have to acknowledge the truth Gough Whitlam acknowledges, which is that the Queen is in fact the Queen of Australia. 
—But she is not an Australian. There is a difference.
—Senator Forshaw is rejecting his icon, Gough Whitlam.
—The reality is that nobody out there listening believes the Queen is Australian, and you know that. Tell the truth.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, can you call Senator Forshaw to order. I want to get on with this and not listen to the hysteria of a rabid republican who knows that he is going to lose.
The question should put fairly and squarely before the Australian people what they are going to be voting for. What they will be voting for with this model is the replacement of the Queen and the Governor-General with a President. That is the way that the question ought to be worded. It could also be that the Queen of Australia and the Australian Governor-General be replaced by an Australian President. The descriptor words `Australia' or `Australian' are, quite frankly, superfluous because nobody in this debate would argue that in our constitutional arrangements Her Majesty is anything other than the Queen of Australia.
Are we truly to believe that the Governor-General is the New Zealand Governor-General or the Governor-General of some other country? If we were to vote for this proposal, are we to believe that the President we would be throwing up is the President of the United States, New Zealand or some other country? Of course not. Of course he would be the Australian President.
The committee report, in suggesting that we ought to describe the President as Australian, was an attempt to stack the question. I dissented from that recommendation because I think it is quite unconscionable to try to stack the question in favour of the republicans. In fact, a pathetic jingoistic sentiment was being relied on. I thought it was quite dishonest.
We also need to add to the question the type of republic that we are going to have. I support a republic in principle, but I do not support this republic. The Democrats and the Australian Labor Party, it seems, do not want the type of republic to be put before the Australian people. Why? I think it is fairly simple: they understand that if the Australian people were to understand the model, they would not vote for it. Indeed, people as diverse as the shadow Attorney-General, Rob McClelland, have acknowledged that the question would basically be sunk if the Australian people knew the President would be appointed by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. The shadow Attorney-General acknowledged that on the 7.30 Report last night in debate with me.
Another republican, Reverend Tim Costello, said about the question, `But it's still got the death sting in the tail.' What could be the death sting in the tail about telling the Australian people the type of republic? Why should that be the death sting to the question? Only because those supporting this model know that it is not favoured by the Australian people and that they will have a terrible job trying to sell it to the Australian people. 
For every republic in the world today, there is a different model. On top of that, there are a whole lot of academic models. Indeed, the one we are being asked to consider is one of those academic models. It is therefore fair and reasonable to put before the Australian people exactly what type of president they are going to vote for. Will they be voting for the type of presidency that allows Boris Yeltsin to sack the parliament or the Prime Minister whenever he wants, or do we want a President such as the one in Ireland or the one in the United States? Surely it is fair and reasonable to tell the Australian people about the type of republic.
The fact that the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats do not want to tell the Australian people about the type of republic is indicative of the sort of contempt with which the Sydney chardonnay set—the Turnbulls and the Keatings of this world—treat the ordinary people. It is absolute contempt. They want to treat them like mush 
 rooms, keeping them in the dark, feeding them a bit of stuff and then hoping that something grows out of it. There will be people like me who say to the Australian people, `I am a republican in principle, but I will not be supporting this model.'
The people of Australia would have become most confused by the fact that before the committee none other than Malcolm Turnbull requested that the term `President' be deleted from the question. He did not want the term `republic' in it either. He was running away from the fundamental issues. What was he the president of? The Australian Republican Movement. All of a sudden, he said that if you put the term `republic' in, the people might become confused. However, he had been the chairman of the Australian Republican Movement for quite some years. Indeed, they printed bumper stickers which said `A resident for president'. But now all of a sudden the term `President' could also adversely influence the people of Australia. It might somehow confuse them. What utter nonsense!
The research of the Australian Republican Movement had shown that certain words would turn off the electorate and that it would really turn off the electorate if the people understood they would be voting for a model which allowed the President to be chosen by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. Quite frankly, to try to keep that from the Australian people is dishonest, and that is why I support the compromise question that the Prime Minister has put forward to the people of Australia.
The model that is being proposed to us is typical of the Sydney chardonnay set: full of warm, fuzzy feeling but highly impractical. It will not work. The President needs to go through a number of steps. First of all, there is the nomination committee, all of whom are appointed. Next, there will be so-called public consultation. Next, there will be a secret short list given to the Prime Minister, and the most devastating thing of all is that the Prime Minister can completely and utterly ignore that short list and all that public consultation process. So why on earth was that put into the proposal? It was put in as a sop and a politi 
 cal sweetener to the direct election republicans. It was designed to try to get a few of the waverers across by saying, `We will allow public consultation.' The public consultation process was merely a sop to the direct election republicans designed to swing a few more in favour of the proposal, but the reality is it was simply window-dressing. Anybody who has a good idea as to who ought to be the next President or Governor-General of this country can write to the Prime Minister and put the nomination forward. It has always been thus, and it will continue to be thus. We do not need this silly nominations committee which was simply window-dressing and which will have no impact at all.
The real proposal requires moving by the Prime Minister, seconding by the Leader of the Opposition and then an appointment by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. The President is clothed only with the authority of being President by virtue of the fact of that two-thirds vote of the parliament. Without it, the person would never become President. As a result, that two-thirds vote of the parliament is the most fundamental thing in the process and, therefore, it is essential that that be part of the question put before the Australian people.
Earlier this evening, Senator Lundy and others suggested there was some conspiracy in relation to the question. There has been one conspiracy only, and that has been the attempted conspiracy of silence by the rabid republicans who do not want the Australian people to know the type of republic for which they are being asked to vote. I understand the Leader of the Opposition has promised the Australian people, `Vote for this republic, and then there'll be another referendum, and we might be able to fix up the job completely.' That is tantamount to admitting that the proposal that is being submitted to the Australian people is flawed before it is even implemented. I say to the Australian people: why would you bother voting for it? Why would you bother voting on a Beazley promise? Mr Beazley promised us that the budget was in surplus. When we came into government, there was a $10.3 billion deficit. Through hard work, that type of deficit can be 
 paid off but, if we had a democratic deficit in this country as a result of a botched attempt to become a republic, it would be virtually impossible to rework the system to regain that democratic element. It is impossible to make up any democratic deficit.
The Turnbull-Keating model will create a huge deficit in our democracy. What is this deficit? The President will be dismissible at will by the Prime Minister. It will be easier for the Prime Minister to sack the President than to sack his driver. That does not allow for a good constitutional system. We need a safety valve such as the monarch requires. The republican proposal suggested by Mr Richard McGarvie through a council of elders would also provide such a safety valve. In this two-thirds majority, the President would have a mandate of sorts and could claim to have an authority greater than the Prime Minister, because the President could say, `I commanded a two-thirds-plus vote of the parliament whereas you, Prime Minister, can command only'—let us say—`a 55 per cent or 60 per cent majority vote of the parliament.' As a result, friction will come into play, to the detriment of the democratic fabric of our society.
The public nomination process will be such as to deter people of high calibre from making themselves available for this high appointment. Those people who were considered and then overlooked would have their position substantially diminished if they had to return to positions of high authority, such as a position in a Supreme Court, the High Court or a position of that nature. Further, there is the potential for the High Court to become involved in the political decision making processes through the term `justiciability', which means allowing the High Court to determine whether certain political questions have been satisfied to allow the President or Prime Minister to act in a particular way.
As I am from a small state, the thing that concerns me most about this proposal is that the Commonwealth is driving this issue. You could have the ridiculous situation of the Commonwealth being a republic and every single state remaining a monarchy. Some speakers have told us about Australia becom 
 ing a laughing-stock in the international community. Take the tip: there would be no greater laughing-stock in the international community than Australia if perchance we were to become a republic but none of the states did. Then we would be a laughing-stock. A Labor appointed governor of Victoria said about the model:
The angel Gabriel could not have made a workable system from the model that emerged from the Constitutional Convention.
Mr Richard McGarvie was absolutely right.
Upon being elected to this parliament, I dedicated myself to do the best for the people of Tasmania and for the people of Australia. I would fail in that solemn undertaking to these people if I were to seek to foist upon my fellow Australians a system which I know is fatally flawed from the beginning. I support the concept, principle and symbolism of a republic, but I will most certainly be voting no to this republic on 6 November.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1999-08-10,"—I wish to speak tonight in support of the yes case. Probably like a lot of Australians, I have not taken much notice of the debate until the last few months. Probably like a lot of Australians, we have not necessarily taken any view at all about whether we had a republic or a monarchy. Our obsession with having a British monarch now is starting to deteriorate because of our own realisation that, in our own land, now is the time for us to have our own Australian born or appointed head of state. I probably reflect the view of a number of people who associate the British head of state with the United Kingdom. When a number of people my age—and maybe a little older, but not much—went to the pictures, we would all have to stand up for God Save the Queen . If you did not stand up, there would be some old fellow behind you slapping you over the back of the head because you would not stand up. I suppose that was my first induction into the separateness between our great country and the United Kingdom.
Despite the fact that a number of us are descendants from those people, whether they came out here willingly or unwillingly, it is time for us to cut those formal ties with the 
 British Crown. We need to understand as Australians that those institutions that we hold dear—our parliaments, our courts—will not be all that disturbed by us voting yes in the November referendum. I think that the actions the Prime Minister has taken in this period have denied us, and to a degree delayed, an opportunity to voice our opinions about whether we want to break those formal ties with the British Crown. I do not think it is fair to have the sophistry that lawyers like Senator Abetz and a few of the other lawyers on the other side—a lot more than there are on ours—come up with to try to delay or confuse the Australian people about their right to have those ties cut.
We in the Labor Party are committed to taking that next step for maturity to become an Australian republic. As a number of senators may be aware, Australian republicanism is not something that was discovered by the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Almost from the day when white settlement occurred in this country, there has been a move for us to make ourselves free and independent of the mother country. That symbolism has existed from almost that period. It has gone through the likes of John Dunmore Lang, a Presbyterian minister, and W.C. Wentworth in his early days right up until now with Paul Keating, Malcolm Turnbull and those other republicans. For a long period, Australians have agitated for the right to have their own Australian head of state and their own free and independent nation with those ties cut with the United Kingdom, as those ties are very much the British monarchy.
If we had an Australian head of state, as may occur as a result of the November referendum, a lot of us in the Australian community would see no better representative of the Australian spirit and what we all admire about our own country than the current Governor-General, Sir William Deane. Why wouldn't we want a man of that calibre, that standing and that humanity to lead us into the next century? Of course we do. The system that is being proposed in this referendum will allow that to occur. When people get up and go back to the past in talking about the House of 
 Windsor and all that, they ought to think of it this way: I emphasise again that we have a right, an obligation and a duty—and we are mature enough—to cut our ties with the United Kingdom and its monarchy.
Currently, as you know, our Queen is an hereditary monarch. The Queen is lucky because, from my own research in this, other than James I, she is the first monarch of England whose parents were both born in the United Kingdom. Both of her parents, the current Queen Mother and George VI, were born in the United Kingdom, but you would have to go back to Mary, Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley to find another British monarch whose parents were both born in the United Kingdom. In fact, Mary, Queen of Scots could hardly speak English. She was brought up in the French court, and she spoke French far more comfortably than she ever spoke any language of the country of which she became Queen and sought to become Queen.
In the current system in the United Kingdom—and we follow it, except that Prime Minister Whitlam changed the royal styles and titles in the 1970s—the Queen is the titular head of the Church of England. I know that does not mean all that much to people in terms of practicalities, but she is and will remain the head of an established church which an overwhelming majority of Australians would reject as having any role any further in the government of this country or the governance of any country.
The separation of church and state has been a long, established and difficult task to put forward, and it has been done as a result of revolutions, debates and a lot of parliamentary action. We do not want anybody who is the head of any church to be our head of state. In fact, as I understand, Sir William Deane himself is a Roman Catholic, and he is the one I believe should be our first President. In England itself, in the United Kingdom, there are a number of people in the old landed Catholic families who still maintain that they have not acknowledged any king since James II, who was the last Catholic monarch of England. So we have that anachronism now in our own Constitution and in the Constitution of the United Kingdom.
Of course, the symbolism is very important to us. It cannot be discounted. It cannot be thrown under the carpet. It is very important. The Queen, as has been emphasised by a number of speakers on both sides of the Senate, is the representative of the British government. When she or any of her family travels overseas, they are accompanied by British trade officials who promote British products, and at times they are detrimental to our own best interests. That is all well and fine. That is her role and the role of her family because they are the head of another country.
Indeed, you could have the ludicrous situation of the Queen going to the Lords cricket game and seeing Australia play England. Who would she barrack for? I would be putting money on the fact that she would go for the English, not for us.
—She wouldn't put much money on it.
—She has more than we have. The other thing the monarchists are claiming at the moment is that we already have the Governor-General as our head of state. Section 2 of the Australian Constitution says clearly that the Governor-General is the Queen's representative and enjoys office at the Queen's pleasure. It says:
A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.
The Governor-General has no greater claim to the mantle of head of state than does the Prime Minister. Our esteemed Prime Minister acknowledged as much when he said that he is going to open the Olympic Games in Sydney, no-one else. So, clearly, our head of state is someone foreign and our head of government is saying to all of us that he is going to open the Olympic Games, no-one else. I suppose technically, legally, constitutionally—whatever the legal terms are that Senator Abetz could tell me—she is our head of state and, under those rules in the Olympics, she would have to open it. But John 
 Howard has said that he is going to do it, which is all well and fine.
The proposal to change is a significant one. I do not think we can put it under the carpet again and say there is not going to be any significant change, because there should be significant change. Our system of government, our way of life and our laws are different and have been different from the way the British parliament has operated. We have a written Constitution. We gave women the right to vote before Britain did. We have an elected upper house. These are things that we pioneered in this country. We went to the United States of America to look at a system which we believed would be satisfactory and relevant to us. In the last days of this millennium, we are saying that it is time that we elect to proceed down the path to cut those ties and have our own Australian head of state.
A major concern for many of the constitutional conservatives is the potential for the exercise of far-reaching reserve powers by a newly appointed President. The constitutional crisis that occurred in 1975 means there are a lot of people who are worried about the undemocratic wielding of those reserve powers. For all intents and purposes, the reserve powers, as they currently exist, relate to four main areas: the power to appoint a Prime Minister, the power to dismiss a Prime Minister, the power to refuse to dissolve parliament and the power to force a dissolution of the parliament. The proposed changes associated with this bill empower the Prime Minister with a broad discretion to remove the President from office, and so they should. If we elect a government in the lower house, the lower house has the right to remove or put someone into power and no-one can be elected or go through any other system.
As I have said, it is now time for us to cut our ties. We have a long and proud history of republicanism in this country. We have a long and proud history of searching for some sort of liberty that is different from what our forebears enjoyed in the United Kingdom. We have that proud and honourable stain on us that makes us different from those people in the United Kingdom. It is our right to pursue 
 that. We cringe to no-one anymore. We are an independent nation but, in these last months, we do need to ensure that that symbolism that makes us truly Australian is voted for and supported by this parliament in November this year.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-08-10,"—The Northern Territory representatives at the 1998 Constitutional Convention were Michael Kilgariff, David Curtis, Moira O'Brien, Nova Peris-Kneebone, Gatjil Djerrkura and the then Chief Minister, Shane Stone—all committed republicans who I know personally and who I believe accurately reflected the majority view on this issue in the Northern Territory. The Constitutional Convention and the campaign for a republic have been inclusive and will give all Australians the chance to voice their opinions this year, particularly at the ballot box. There will be an extensive government public education campaign in September with all Australians receiving information on the merits of both the yes and the no cases. Of course, the media focus is patently obvious.
I trust the campaign will reach into rural, remote and Aboriginal communities in a meaningful way without the patronising overtones too often afforded minority interests. The two committees that have been formed to facilitate and organise the yes and no cases contain people of merit and will be funded equally by the government to state their cases. The total funding by government is $15 million and the advertising campaign will be launched in early October. The increased level of debate has heartened me in the last few days regarding this issue. I believe that the better information and education circulating about the republic and the more discussion that takes place can only increase the chances of a yes vote on 6 November.
I believe the vast majority of people in the Northern Territory want a republic. The Northern Territory is a young, vibrant region that is rapidly changing and reflects the broader changes in Australia. I am personally positive about Australia's future as a republic. 
 I believe that a republic is inevitable and that any delay is purely academic and frustrating important sociological change. The move to a republic has the potential to stimulate the development of a new Australian identity. Looking 10 years into the future, I would like to see Australia as a proudly cosmopolitan nation capitalising on its cultural diversity, something that the Northern Territory already does successfully and very well. No longer is Australia dependent on a British heritage.
I know the shared will between the community, government, business and academic institutions in the Northern Territory is for us to move forward into a diverse range of development, particularly engaging with Asia, and that this should be a model for Australia. Wherever we may have come from, citizenship binds us all in a commitment to Australia, a unique land with a distinctive way of life and many regional differences. I would call for an Australian head of state who reflects the nature of Australia as a modern, dynamic and mature nation. It should be open for any citizen of Australia to be able to be the head of state in their own country. I for one would like my children and grandchildren to grow in the knowledge of this opportunity.
It is also important that this change would give an opportunity for an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander person to access the opportunity to become the head of state. This would be a great step forward for reconciliation and underpin a positive contribution to the Australian nation. The question that needs to be asked when people argue that the head of state is only a figurehead is this: if that is the case, then why not have an Australian figurehead rather than one whose sole right is being born to the job, someone who can only claim to be a British aboriginal?
Matters of process are again causing controversy, as is the case in so many constitutional debates. Admittedly, it frustrates me that Australians may miss out on this historic opportunity due to problems and arguments over the form of the question and who elects or appoints the President. With regard to the issue of the election or appointment of the President, there is obviously a popular view for a directly elected head of state. At the 
 same time, the appointment process by the parliament, which itself has been constituted by popular election, is a sound basis for presidential selection. This process was in fact endorsed by last year's Constitutional Convention. I have no difficulty in accepting its proposition.
It is far more important to replace the House of Windsor with an Australian who has no rights to automatic inherited succession. Other than for media hype—for selling purposes of magazines—Australians do not relate to the puberty rites of Prince William or Prince Henry or the peccadilloes of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York. It is also vital that people realise that the referendum is not on the Australian flag or the national anthem. A yes vote will not result in a change to the flag or the anthem. In fact, the flag is protected by an act of parliament and any changes would only follow proper consideration after wide obvious electoral support and plebiscites.
Under the proposed changes, each state will retain responsibility for changes to its own state constitution. This will enable them to claim or retain their own identity. Similarly, I trust that the Northern Territory will progress in due course to statehood in its own right and ultimately negate the discrimination in this referendum vote which in effect affords Territorians only a half value voting status.
Let us not miss this chance to make the final leap forward to independence and stand as a nation proudly unique in the region and the world. Australia has changed and evolved in a most radical and wonderful way since Federation. Our Constitution was designed to allow for this evolution, and there is nothing wrong with changing the Constitution if it is timely and necessary. It is not a rejection of our heritage or history but rather an embracing of the new with the old and accepting a positive reality. It is timely and it is necessary at the end of this century, at the end of this millennium, and I am an advocate for the adoption of a republic.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-08-10,"—I want to begin tonight by firstly saying that I commend to you comments from my colleague in the Northern 
 Territory Senator Tambling. This may be one of the very few times that we stand up to speak on a subject in which we are in agreeance. There has not been a conspiracy in the fact that the two senators from the Territory are following one another tonight. There is probably something about this debate that is already starting to have a uniting influence across a number of sectors in this country.
In sharing my thoughts on the republic referendum debate tonight, I wanted to firstly pay tribute to one of our former prime ministers, Paul Keating. The discussion in this country about becoming a republic has been around now for more than six years—in a formal sense—with the Republic Advisory Committee meeting for the first time in 1993. I believe it was Paul Keating's vision and his courage that gave this debate energy. When he announced in 1995 that Australia should become a republic by the year 2000, he managed to stimulate this debate, which I believe has not had that kind of passion since that date.
We know, according to The Macquarie Dictionary, that a republic is a state in which the supreme power resides in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them. In particular a republic refers to a system of government that has no hereditary monarch—a person who holds political or constitutional office purely as a birthright. In Australia our head of state is not an Australian citizen, and under the present system they never will be. In fact, they don't even live here. Like the Australian Republican Movement, I believe that this arrangement is no longer appropriate nor suitable for Australia.
Nearly 100 years have passed since Federation and Australia still does not have its own head of state. But as a nation we have matured. I believe we have moved on from wanting to be attached to the colonial mother country and we are ready to recognise that we are a diverse nation and that we should have a head of state that is one of our own. It is time that our head of state were chosen on merit, not on birthright, that that person should be an Australian citizen, one who lives in Australia but, more importantly, one who 
 knows what it means to be an Australian. That goal can only be achieved by Australia becoming a republic.
I do not want to wake up in the 21st century knowing that Australia's head of state lives in London and is required to be an Anglican. I want to see that all Australians, whatever their religion or class or ethnic background, have the opportunity to aspire, if they so wish, to becoming Australia's head of state. Currently that opportunity is denied to each and every one of us under the present system.
I am also not often one for quoting my colleagues from the government side, but on this occasion I want to repeat some of the comments that were made by Senator Vanstone recently on the question of whether Australia should become a republic. She said:
National symbols are important. They should unite a nation. They should touch its heart.
She said:
A British monarch as our symbolic head of state no longer touches the heart of most Australians.
On this I agree with her. Australia is a very different place today compared with what it was like 100 years ago. The British monarchy is not relevant to an Australia moving to forge an independent identity for itself as we enter the 21st century. Few Australians would argue that the monarchy is still the central symbolic force in Australia or that it still embodies our symbols, our values, our ideals or even our sense of place. That is why many Australians now find the symbolism of foreign dignitaries toasting our absent Queen of Australia fairly uncomfortable and why it now seems odd that our parliamentarians swear allegiance to the British Crown and not to the Australian nation and its people.
Australia needs a revitalised and relevant symbolic force at the centre of its community and democracy. That can be achieved through Australia becoming a republic. The world has changed. There is no longer a British Empire and there is no reason why Australia should not have an Australian head of state. In his article in the Australian last week, Dennis Shanahan reminds us that in 1993 the Queen deliberately and publicly made the point that she expected Commonwealth countries to continue to evolve into republics.
To quote Paul Kelly from the Australian, the proposed model is `cautious, conservative and safe'. Instead of being a Westminster monarchy we would become a Westminster republic, with an Australian as head of state who is both impartial and a non-politician. The Prime Minister and his government will continue to run this country. As we know, the proposed model allows for a process which will involve the Australian people in the presidential appointment process through a public nomination process. The model will ensure a bipartisan appointment by requiring the support of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.
The appointment of a President will require the approval of two-thirds of the members of both houses of parliament. The President will have the same powers as the Governor-General currently has. Under the proposed model, the Prime Minister will be more accountable for his actions, if he chooses to dismiss a President, than he currently is with regard to the Governor-General. If he does decide to dismiss the President, he must go back to the parliament within 30 days to justify his decision or instead face a general election. While the Prime Minister can remove the President, he cannot replace the President with a political appointment.
But, in announcing that a referendum would be held to determine whether Australians wanted change, the Prime Minister claimed that, even though he was personally opposed to any changes to the current system, he would not actively campaign against it. But it is obvious from his actions that he is being somewhat disingenuous. In reality, he has sought to undermine and obfuscate the republic debate where possible. The issue of the wording of the referendum question highlights his attitude. No-one believes him when he says, `I don't want anyone to say that it was defeated because of trickery with the question. There was never any trickery intended.' Sure, he is now prepared to amend the question so that it adopts some of the concern, but the question remains.
So why is he so determined to ignore the advice of the committee, which believes that their preferred wording of the question more 
 accurately reflects the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention? I tend to agree with some of the sentiments I read a few moments ago from a press release of the Democrats that makes the statement—I believe, quite accurately—that the process of how the President is elected should be determined and conveyed to people through the education campaign and not on the ballot paper.
As Prime Minister, John Howard has shown a lack of leadership, I believe, not necessarily by not advocating that Australia become a republic, even though I believe that Australia's interests could be best served by him doing so. He should demonstrate leadership by encouraging rational and factual debate on whether Australia should become a republic. So far, I do not believe that he has done so, and that reflects badly on him, whatever his personal feelings on the matter may be.
I want to spend some time tonight making a number of comments about indigenous Australians and the republic referendum. It is an area that I believe the media has not paid particular attention to, particularly during the last couple of weeks. There are, of course, a variety of indigenous views on a range of matters associated with the republic, such as the method by which the President should be elected or the appropriate amendments to the Constitution.
Gatjil Djerrkura, in his speech to the Constitutional Convention last year, said:
It is ATSIC's view that Australia should now with pride recognise and acknowledge the cultural diversity of its peoples.
He went on to say that we are a very different country today than when the federation was formed and the Constitution drawn up. During the convention, Nova Peris-Kneebone said, and I quote from the Hansard  of the Constitutional Convention for 11 February:
The people I meet are often surprised and confused to learn that our head of state is also the Queen of England. I have talked with my team mates about these things, and I believe they share my experiences and concerns.
She went on to say:
But we are suffering an international identity crisis. I am offended, my team mates are offended and the 
 viewer at home is offended when we are mistaken for New Zealanders or some other nationality. Why is this, why are we not immediately recognised for who we are?
At the Indigenous Constitutional Convention held in Canberra in March this year, there was a call to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have an informed vote at the forthcoming referendum.
I want to pay particular attention tonight to a section of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum that was handed down yesterday. Recommendation 14 relates to the education campaign. The recommendation says that the information requirements of Australians in remote locations, of those with limited English skills and of young voters should be especially catered for by the education campaign associated with the proposed referendum in November, and that sufficient resources be allocated for this purpose.
So why is it important that this recommendation be drawn out during this debate? I do not believe that, to date, some of my colleagues have done this. Let me say something about my experience in the Northern Territory in last year's statehood referendum. Setting aside the outcomes of that and the way in which it was handled, there were some things about that statehood referendum that have become fairly obvious to those who were involved in it.
Most of us would have received today some research conducted by a multicultural communications organisation in association with NewsPoll. In particular, the pamphlet entitled `Indigenous Research Report' of May 1999 makes some very interesting—and, I believe, fairly accurate—statements. The research related to 30 telephone interviews with community leaders and a number of group discussions Australia-wide. Their executive summary and the points that they come up with are quite accurate. They say that the referendum is distant and removed from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that there is very little awareness of it or when it will be held.
In my recent travels around the Territory to remote communities, Aboriginal people have 
 been saying to me, `We voted last year on some constitutional thing. Why do we have to vote again this year?' So clearly, in my mind, there is confusion, particularly in the Territory. Last year the statehood referendum was held and people should be told that that was quite different from the referendum that they are going to be asked to vote on in November. So the role that the education campaign will play in this is particularly important. Young people, in particular, lack knowledge. There are, of course, older people in the communities who remember the 1967 referendum, which contained a question on whether Aboriginal people would have the vote. So there is, in their mind, another similar referendum. We need to pay particular attention to the simplicity of the message that we try to get across to people during this campaign.
This research also found that there is an inherent distrust of government and its policies and procedures, and a belief that any change initiated by government may ultimately be bad for Aboriginal people. That came out last year during the statehood debate when a number of politicians were pushing for a statehood referendum. The outcome was, I believe, the reverse of the outcome that they were seeking because, in the minds of Aboriginal and indigenous people, attention was focused on those people as being members of the government and that distrust came out. My fear is that a similar thing may occur this time. Unlike some of my colleagues in the Labor Party, particularly those in the Northern Territory, I believe that as politicians we need to be very careful about the kind of campaign we seek to run in support of the yes campaign. I think Aboriginal people will relate more to, and identify with, Aboriginal people who push the message; Aboriginal people who stand up there and speak for the yes case on behalf of Aboriginal and indigenous people. I am thinking of Aboriginal sports people, identities or personalities that people know, as opposed to politicians.
I say to the people who are about to embark on the education campaign that some of this research that has been done is worthwhile reading. I would also suggest that they use material that is simple and uncomplicated. 
 The question that will be before us will be a particularly difficult question for some people in the Northern Territory to understand—as I think will be the case in most remote communities across this country. It will not be an easy question for those people to decipher. We are talking about a Governor-General being replaced by a President. We do not say an Australian President. We are talking about that person being appointed by a two-thirds majority of members of the Commonwealth parliament. If English is not your first language—in fact, English may be your second, third or even fourth language—understanding what a two-thirds majority of members means is a difficult concept.
Tonight I say to the people who are putting together the education campaign that you must remember the people in this country who have a non-English speaking background. You must particularly remember indigenous Australians, particularly those people who live in the Northern Territory, when you put together the education campaign. It is important that Aboriginal people are involved, that Aboriginal people have input. It is important that you are mindful of the fact that in the Territory last year there was a vote on statehood. That is not the same as the referendum question that people will be asked to vote on in November this year.
Before I mention something that Nova Peris-Kneebone said during the Constitutional Convention last year—Nova is a constituent of both Senator Tambling and me because her country is in the Northern Territory—I want to say that I will be voting yes on 6 November and that I will be assisting wherever I can in the Northern Territory with the yes campaign. But I do have reservations in that I do not believe, given our experience in the Northern Territory, that politicians should be leading the fray and leading the argument up there. That is probably somewhat a different stance to that of some of my other colleagues in the party. Nova finished her speech at the Constitutional Convention by saying something which captures the thought I would like to finish on tonight. I think it captures what is in the hearts of most Australians as they either firm up their position on the republic or 
 slowly come to the realisation that this is the way of the future for Australia. Nova Peris-Kneebone said:
And I would like to see a model for a republic that gives an indigenous woman—perhaps my daughter—the chance of becoming our head of state.
If the future of this country lies in our children, then what a great opportunity we would provide for them if one of them, one day, could put up their hand to become our Australian head of state.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-10,"—Australia is potentially at a defining moment in its constitutional history. On the eve of the new millennium, Australians want the opportunity to choose how our nation will present itself to the world in the year 2000 and beyond. This should be a time of national pride and serious consideration of our future direction; a period when we sever the remnants of our colonial past from our founding laws. Further, it should be a period of close examination of our system of government, and whether, after 100 years of developing democracy, we are mature and advanced enough as a progressive democracy to take the next steps in significant constitutional evolution. Instead, we have before us proposals for constitutional change which are the product of a flawed Constitutional Convention which produced a cobbled together effort aimed at gaining the support of the major parties by reinforcing the executive's power through the parliamentary process. Further, the dominance of the executive, which both major parties, despite their occasional rhetoric to the contrary, are completely comfortable with, is expanded.
The primary vehicle for the establishment of this appointed republic is the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999. Its shortcomings are both numerous and serious. I will expand upon just a few. First, the long title of this bill, which is what will be put to electors, highlights the method of appointment of the President. That is quite proper because what distinguishes this form of republic most is the appointment process as opposed to the directly elected process. But it seems only commonsense that it should also mention the method of removal—that is, that 
 the President can be dismissed by the Prime Minister on the production of a letter from his pocket. The President will be reduced under this model to the status of a junior minister subject to unfair dismissal. The long title of the bill should reflect the true position of the conditions of tenure, or the lack of them, enjoyed by the proposed President.
Second, the bill contemplates a revolution in constitutional law in this country by expressly including in the Constitution the reserve powers of the President and the conventions guiding their exercise. By this fact, these powers will become justiciable. This could drag the High Court into a political controversy to subject the actions of the President to judicial review; an unprecedented situation in our constitutional history.
In my opinion the High Court must be, so far as is possible, a separate, independent arbiter on the proper construction of constitutional provisions. Involvement in political crises could seriously impair its capacity and authority to perform this function. It is simply not a body well placed or properly equipped to perform this role.
Third, the provision that the Leader of the Opposition must second the nomination of the President makes the bold assumption that a single formal Leader of the Opposition will continue to exist in Australian federal politics in the long term. Given that our Constitution needs to remain workable during the course of the 21st century, it is desirable that such assumptions be soundly based. Given the increasing fluidity of contemporary politics, it would be naive to simply assume that our party system will not undergo significant changes over the coming century. We should not forget that for much of this century we have not had an official Leader of the Opposition and that 23 out of 29 countries in the OECD do not have leaders of the opposition.
This was a problem picked up by the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, perhaps assisted by my submission to them. But whereas that committee simply recommended solving the problem by the inclusion of the phrase `if any', a much better step would have been to require candidates to have the support of all recognised parlia 
 mentary parties. If Australia follows the trend of other advanced democracies toward increasing pluralism in politics, it will be important that all political parties are part of the consultative process.
Fourth, the bill does not provide for a scenario where the Prime Minister's nominee is not approved by parliament. This is not an unforeseeable event and, therefore, provision should be included to enable a different candidate to be put forward at another sitting within a specified period, say, six weeks. This would prevent a Prime Minister from leaving the office vacant, or doing so for a period in order to pressure the parliament to approve his or her nomination.
Fifth, this bill does not provide sufficiently certain arrangements for the termination of the term of a President. Instead, the office holder enjoys tenure until a new President is appointed, for which no time frame is set. The office should fall vacant after a five-year term if a new appointment has not occurred. Further, a person should be able to serve a maximum of two terms as President, instead of the present open-ended provision that could theoretically give life tenure. In any executive position, which a President would enjoy, life tenure is undesirable.
Sixth, the provision concerning dismissal of a President has been widely remarked upon as creating an unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister. There are no stated grounds for dismissal and no mandatory parliamentary oversight. The power to remove a head of state should not rest solely with a Prime Minister but lie with the parliament, if you are to pursue an appointed model. If the parliament is good enough to appoint the President, it is good enough to dismiss the President. The parliament should act only after consideration of a report of a judicial commission into whatever allegations of misconduct or incapacity are brought against the President. Further, the President should be given the opportunity, if he or she so wishes, to put their case directly before the parliament before a vote is taken. These procedures should also apply to the removal of an Acting President.
The deficient means employed to devise the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 have also resulted in the equally inept  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 . This bill has at its heart an undemocratic method of appointing committee membership. One might have thought Australia was beyond the sort of rigging of the numbers contemplated by this bill. The Prime Minister simply appoints 16 members of the community who share his or her view and, together with the members appointed from his or her own party, he or she has control of the numbers. Given the central role of the committee, it would clearly be preferable if the committee's make-up were to more proportionately reflect the views of the electorate rather than the views of the Prime Minister of the day.
In addition, the bill also allows the nominations committee to function with up to 16 vacancies. This seems to be an extraordinarily low number, and again may allow manipulation of the numbers by the Prime Minister for his or her own purposes. A much higher minimum membership is clearly in order for the committee to be able to function. I do not see why any more than two or three vacancies should be tolerated to allow for unforeseen circumstances.
What is remarkable about the process that has brought these bills before this chamber has been the dogged determination of most politicians to stop Australians having the choice of electing one of their own for President. The course they have pursued has flown in the face of all opinion polls on the matter—polls to which politicians are usually acutely attuned, but polls to which I suggest the Prime Minister has listened carefully and been assisted in the way in which he has devised this referendum. One suspects that only a perceived threat to entrenched power could have given politicians the courage to so brazenly defy the public will.
Denying the people a choice on the direct election of their head of state is fundamentally undemocratic and will be resisted to the end by the people. The major parties today have combined once again to deny the people such an opportunity by refusing to allow my 
 private member's bill to be debated, which would have allowed the direct election question to be put along with the question we are considering. This action by the Senate today will probably help guarantee that the appointed President model is rejected at referendum.
The arguments for direct election of a President have been aired in various forums. I want to set out the key reasons why this country's citizens deserve the right to elect their own head of state—a right that has been denied to them by the major parties in this Senate and by the Constitutional Convention.
The appointed President model that is being put forward here goes against the most fundamental tenet of the Australian system of government. This system is recognised in law as being founded on the sovereignty of the citizenry. It is the people that maintain control over the structure of this system via the section 128 method, which requires a referendum for altering the Constitution. We must understand that to withhold from citizens the choice of determining the right to elect their own head of state is to prevent the people from having an independent head of state.
The Queen of Australia is independent of the Prime Minister of the day. Our new President will be the vassal of the Prime Minister. The executive will select a candidate for parliamentary approval which will, on precedent, be dictated by the self-same executive. How can that square with the notion that it is the Australian public—not the parliament, not the executive—that is sovereign?
A directly elected President will enhance the separation of powers in our system of government. The doctrine of separation of powers is insufficiently respected, but is one of the most important features of the political heritage of our nation. The politician appointed model would denigrate this doctrine by further concentrating power in the hands of the executive. The model gives the Prime Minister of the day summary and sole powers of dismissal. The Senate, the proportionately represented house, is specifically and deliberately excluded in this act of executive reinforcement, and the house of the executive, 
 the house of the representatives, will dominate the process. It is a shame.
Contrary to the parliamentary and judicial processes of other countries, the politician appointed model proposes that an Australian President may be removed at any time by a notice in writing issued by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister need not provide any reasons for this decision—extraordinarily, no grounds for dismissal are outlined in the model. There is no natural justice in the unfair dismissal provision provided under this constitutional proposal. It is clear the Prime Minister retains complete control over this process from start to finish.
Opponents of direct election are indisputably advocating a further concentration of power in the hands of the executive. They have perpetrated a scare campaign against direct election of our head of state. The scaremongers have been careful not to attack the principle, as they know this is both sound and popular. Rather, they cite what they see as the inevitable practical outcome, that we would end up with a politician as our head of state, as some sort of fatal flaw. It is by no means certain that such an outcome would eventuate. Systems can be devised to ensure that candidates who are apolitical are on an even playing field with those sponsored by parties—for example, by public funding for non-aligned candidates and by requiring aligned candidates to include in their adverts `authorised by' messages, such as currently occur in federal elections, so that the electors know they are voting for an aligned candidate.
Even if it is accepted that politicians may win the presidency by direct election, why would this be such a negative? First, it would be the will of the people. If Australians vote in a politician, it is their sovereign right to do so. Second, politics gives such people a grounding in affairs of state, and a grasp of the complexity of the range of issues with which governments must deal, that persons from other backgrounds may not possess. Third, there is no guarantee that a person from outside of politics will perform any differently in the role in a time of crisis than a former politician.
The Governor-General at the centre of the 1975 constitutional crisis, for example, was not a politician. He was an ex-chief justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The truth is that there can be no guarantees of the performance of an individual by virtue of the method of selection. Fourth, two-thirds of our governors-general have been ex-politicians anyway—and this is the system supporters of an appointed president want to preserve. At the root of all this is whether our federal politicians are willing to trust the people and give them the option of fully expressing their will as to their preferred means of presidential accession. The actions of the major parties in this place show that they are not. Instead they will attempt to foist upon the Australian people the flawed appointed President model, which Prime Minister John Howard knows is so electorally unpopular that he insists upon including the method of appointment in the question as a means of ensuring the referendum fails.
I will not be sorry to see these bills sink without trace after the referendum. They deserve to do so. Perhaps then elected politicians will be forced to transcend the vested political interests that on this issue reign so decisively in this place and listen to what the Australian people are demanding. The Australian people want a directly elected President. I will vote no to the appointed model to help ensure they realise that dream, and I look forward to the referendum crashing.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-08-10,"—In many respects the debate over the constitutional referendum has been unedifying. This is hardly surprising given that we are being asked to vote on a particular model that is designed to deliver an Australian head of state rather than being asked in an indicative plebiscite whether we Australians want to establish a republic by replacing the Queen and the Governor-General with an Australian head of state. An affirmative vote would have allowed time for development and mature consideration of competing models. A no vote would have curtailed the debate. An inconclusive result would have nevertheless provided valuable information about Australia's attitude to the issue.
It is now idle to speculate about what might have been a more appropriate way to gauge the nation's will, just as it is unrewarding for direct election republicans to castigate the version now on offer. For these reasons, I do not propose to canvass these issues nor do I intend to discuss the compromise question. The facts are that the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  is closely based on the model settled at the Constitutional Convention involving the appointment of an Australian head of state by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament.
The Prime Minister had agreed to put the model decided on at the convention to a referendum and, substantially, this is now what we have before us. Although opinion polls have consistently shown that, if we are to change from a constitutional monarchy to a republic, Australians want to participate by directly electing their President, the only choice being offered is to replace the Queen and the Governor-General with a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
If this is the only offer in prospect, the issue here is simple. It is whether Australians want to remain a constitutional monarchy or whether they will agree to the constitutional amendments that will establish Australia as a republic by replacing the Queen and the Governor-General with an appointed President. It would be disingenuous not to acknowledge that the constitutional scheme contained in the bill has some concerning features. Some of these have been identified in the advisory report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum.
I have misgivings about the power of the Prime Minister to summarily remove the President. It would seem that, despite the lessons to be learnt from the Whitlam dismissal in 1975, we are still to be wedded to an endgame of `who will shoot first'. This is not conducive to a relationship of trust between those who hold the highest appointments in the land, although it is a feature common to both systems. Similarly, I do not think the constitutional position of the Senate has been clearly thought through, nor the fact 
 that it has a powerful popular legitimacy in our parliamentary system. The bill provides that ratification of dismissal is a role solely for the House of Representatives. This may be explicable, as the critical issue in a dismissal may well be whether the Prime Minister retains the confidence of the House of Representatives. However, the underlying crisis precipitating dismissal may well be a deadlock of supply in the Senate.
In my view, the question of whether the exclusion of the Senate from the process of dismissal would resolve the problem in a dismissal scenario or merely exacerbate it is highly problematic. There are at least respectable differences of expert opinion on whether the reserve powers formerly exercisable by the Governor-General lie in convention or are grounded in constitutional law, how these powers will be affected by the transition to a republic and whether they should be justiciable. Doubts have also been raised about the effect of the constitutional transition on the traditional prerogative powers currently vested in the Queen and exercised by the Governor-General. In the model before us, these powers would be exercisable by the President.
These powers are exercisable pursuant to section 61 of the Constitution for the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth. However, as former Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason succinctly points out:
Our public law which largely originated in the medieval conception of the Sovereign and his powers and immunities has evolved over the centuries so that it is now appropriate to a modern system of responsible and representative government. In the result, our public law is as appropriate to a `minimalist' Republic as it is to a constitutional monarchy.
There are also cogent arguments concerning whether section 128 of the Constitution can be used to amend state constitutions to compel acceptance of a republican form of government and the consequential arrangements that would be necessary. This detail is obviously beyond the scope of my speech in this second reading debate.
If there are potential flaws in the proposed constitutional amendments, should responsible Australians vote for them? In my opinion, the 
 answer is a resounding yes. Obviously, I do not wish to be associated with any constitutional change that would lead to instability and uncertainty or be any less efficient than the existing constitutional monarchy. In that regard, many Australians are content to have a situation where the reserve powers are unspecified and the Prime Minister and Governor-General can dismiss each other depending on who takes the first initiative. The practical effects of the dismissal procedures under the bill are the same as under the present system. The Queen's role in dismissal is grounded in convention. She will act on advice and any attempt to elevate the monarchy into some kind of royal umpire is illusory.
I am convinced that the new constitutional arrangements are not so different in reach and effect from the present constitutional monarchy as to expose us to constitutional instability. In fact, I think that some of the arguments and alarmist scenarios that have been advanced against the bill are far-fetched. The prospect that a Prime Minister could get away with precipitous action in dismissing a President without incurring political sanctions is remote. Both systems offer stability, continuity and cohesion. Other nations have managed to achieve a constitutional balance between the prerogatives of a President and the Prime Minister. Why can't we? We have a robust democracy and the sky is not likely to fall in at the first constitutional hurdle we face in the transition to a republic. But the question remains: why change?
The next step in my journey towards an affirmative vote for this bill is more symbolic. We are about to enter a new century. Australia is no longer the country it was in 1901 and, while our parliamentary democracy has evolved since then, it has become evident that our mode of government and allegiance to the Queen no longer reflects Australia's independence, geographic location and ethnic diversity. The fledgling federation was a place of vast distances, where the overwhelming majority of the population was Anglo-Saxon and referred to Great Britain as the mother country. Australians today—even those with dual nationality—owe allegiance to Australia. 
 As such, it is fitting that our nation's head of state be Australian. The republic issue is about far more than whether the Queen is our head of state. It is about the national identity that we want to present to the world. As former Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen describes it:
It is a matter of importance for an independent Australia to state simply and unambiguously our national status.
The referendum debate is also a significant opportunity for Australia's youth to engage in the political process and to contribute to the future that they see Australia having into the next century. At a time when the youth of our country are facing many challenges, constitutional change symbolises new direction and hope for the future.
 As a present custodian of our parliamentary traditions, I have an abiding belief that I hold them in trust for the youth of Australia and for future generations, who have a great deal to offer our country. Under the new constitutional model it will be one of them that has the potential to hold the highest position in the land. Under a constitutional monarchy not one of them will ever qualify to be our head of state. This alone then is a great aspiration to give our children, our children's children and our nation.
No legal interpretations or constitutional contortions can overcome the fundamental discrimination entrenched in our Constitution against an Australian becoming a head of state. No matter how distinguished his service, our Governor-General, Sir William Deane, is relegated to the status of a mere representative. The very concept is un-Australian.
 The constitutional referendum also offers a unique opportunity for women to participate in one of the most significant questions regarding our nation's future in over 100 years. Unlike the Constitutional Convention of 1998, women were completely excluded from the conventions of the 1890s that determined the original drafting of our Constitution. It is also significant that the indigenous population of Australia, the original custodians, be included in decisions regarding the future of our country as, in my view, inclu 
 siveness is a fundamental plank of reconciliation.
 We are a gradualist society not given to radical change. We are rightly cautious about constitutional change, as the history of failed referenda will attest. The republic will not be made by the referendum alone; it will evolve and the people of Australia will evolve with it. One of the great triumphs of our parliamentary system is that it is not stagnant and rigid but fluid and evolving.
This referendum and the subsequent changes that will follow, should the yes vote succeed, will be a symbolic and significant step in our national evolution. On balance, I think it is better to have a bold and confident vision that looks to the future than one that looks only to the past. This is Australia's coming of age, as a number of speakers have said. None have put it any better than the patriot John Dunmore Lang who stated last century:
The colonists of Australia will doubtless at some future period establish a republican government for themselves and elect a president of the Australian states. It is a singular fact in the history of nations that Great Britain, with an essentially monarchical government, has for a long time past been laying the foundation of future republics in all parts of the globe and will doubtless be left at last, like the unfortunate hen that has hatched ducks' eggs, to behold her numerous brood successively taking to the water.
Will Australia be the last duckling to leave the nest or will we become the beautiful swan that we were destined to be? I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-10,"—Tonight in this debate I rise in support of the yes case. Much has been said during this debate—we have had the Constitutional Convention, the public debates and the media profiles; we have even had people in the other place who have leadership aspirations speculating about the claims on this particular issue. However, whilst there have been the yes people, the no people and the maybe people, the people who do not know which way they are going to vote still number many amongst us.
That is where we are at today. One thing that is patently obvious is that many people 
 do not understand the existing process in relation to the appointment of the Governor-General and many people do not understand the processes of the appointment or the election of presidents in other places throughout the world. I heard Senator Abetz earlier in the debate talking about the presidencies in Russia, Ireland, the United States and a number of other places. The fact of life is that, if you were to ask the average Australian how the presidents in those places were chosen—elected, appointed or otherwise—very few, if any, would have any idea of the process of how that takes place.
But what has become clear in this debate so far is that, unfortunately, the Prime Minister has firmly entrenched himself in the no camp. Essentially, we have seen the Prime Minister manipulate the proposed referendum question in a way that minimises the chances of the passage of the yes case in the referendum. That is unfortunate, because I believe that the maturity of this nation now requires that we move from our current state into that of being a republic.
The Prime Minister, supported by the monarchists at the cabinet table, have undoubtedly decided to ignore the recommendation of the joint select committee that was established to examine this particular bill. I might add that this committee was established by the Prime Minister himself, and it was most unfortunate that he basically ignored the recommendations of that committee. It is no secret that the Prime Minister is comfortable back in the 1950s and supports the monarchy and, of course, that is his right to do so. But many of us have moved on from that period of time and been brought up in a different era where our views, our hopes and our aspirations are quite different.
But, as the legislation stands, the Prime Minister has provided the no case with the only possible argument that they have to derail the campaign, and that is to attack the appointment process. I am sure that the Prime Minister just hopes that the whole referendum will go away. The Liberal Party has divisions within its own ranks, and understandably so. I would think that the younger members 
 would have a different attachment to the monarchy than those of the older generations.
—Where are you putting the dividing line—what age?
—I am not going to try to sort you out, Senator Ferguson. You are ageless in some cases, so I will defer to you there.
—Shameless.
—It is not, Senator Conroy. The fact is that we are dealing with an issue—I will come to this later—that divides on age to some extent. But there is a division within the ranks of the government, and that is a healthy thing. Most of the people on our side of politics—
—All of them.
—I will accept that interjection from the chair, particularly at this hour of the night. I ask the chair to defend me. The majority, if not all, of the people on our side of politics have accepted the republic. This has developed over a long time within our ranks. That does not mean that every Labor Party supporter out in the electorate is necessarily a republican, and it should not be taken that way.
—But everyone in here is.
—Yes.
—You are sheep. You do not really believe that.
—Senator McGauran might say that. Being a city farmer and in the National Party, he knows a fair deal about sheep. But we will not take too much from him.
What I am saying is that the Prime Minister undoubtedly hopes that this referendum will go away. The internal divisions it has caused within the Liberal Party are understandable. There seems to be unanimity on this side of the debate. As the debate has evolved, people masquerading as advocates for the republican side of the debate in the other place have been exposed. In particular, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has shown his true colours by trying 
 to scuttle the yes debate. This is an unfortunate context in which this whole debate is taking place. The debate should be taken at a far more mature level than what we are currently seeing emerge from those people particularly trying to entrench the no case.
The minister in question chose to have no role in the Constitutional Convention. However, he now sees fit to act as a chief spoiler. At the same time as he is advocating the office of President, he suggests that it will become a political partisan one. There are many people who share the direct election approach. Undoubtedly, a lot of people accept that approach. I feel that there is a genuine concern amongst some people in the community about which model they would like.
The opponents of the republic are using every opportunity to ensure that the referendum fails. All sorts of scare tactics have already been employed. The scaremongers have claimed that our system of government is under threat, that democracy will no longer exist in Australia, that the flag will be automatically changed and that even uniforms will have to be changed. These sort of tactics—I can only imagine what will take place over the next 88 days before the 6 November referendum—will ultimately lead to further confusion.
It is a fact that, despite what the supporters of direct election espouse, the checks and balances of a healthy system of government—namely, this chamber—will not be altered. As I am sure those opposite and those opposed to the republic in particular would attest, it is the norm that governments do not control the Senate, that all these checks and balances will not be changed and that revolution will not occur in Australia if we have an Australian as our head of state. As I see it, the new millennium provides us with the opportunity to have our country come of age and to have its own Australian head of state.
I would like to briefly turn to the Constitution. I heard my colleague Senator Hutchins earlier in this debate this evening refer to the Constitution, particularly to point 2 of part 1, general, of chapter 1, the parliament, which says: 
A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the  Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.
What we see in the copy of the Constitution I have read from is that the Governor-General is appointed by the Queen to be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth et cetera.
The practicalities of the appointment of the Governor-General is that the Governor-General is appointed by the government of the day, particularly the Prime Minister. All that we have through the Queen is the Queen giving her seal of approval to the person chosen by the government of the day. If one were to argue strictly, the current Constitution has not been followed in terms of what is written in it. Practice has evolved which now sees the Constitution not being adhered to or followed in its strictest terms. Whilst one might argue superficially that the Queen appoints the Governor-General and acts at the pleasure of the Governor-General, one would have to at least concede in a realistic fashion that this is not the process that takes place.
I am interested in the fact that in my living memory there has been no time when the Queen has rejected a nominee of the government for the position of Governor-General. The Queen has also not intervened in the internal affairs of the parliament of Australia. Why should we have a Queen who is remote from Australia and who has no attachment to Australia as our head of state? In this day and age, I cannot understand why. For the generations of the era of 30, 40 or 50 years ago, one could understand the attachment we had to the British monarch—and that there would be some association, and an understandable association—through the colonisation of this nation and through two world wars. But those generations have now moved on. This is the point that I come to in particular: there are new generations coming through.
I happen to be the proud father of three young children of the new generation who have no attachment to any monarch, not out of any disrespect for the monarch but because 
 it is something that is totally anathema to their understanding of what life is about. It is fit and proper for those people who have fought in the war, who have a British heritage or who have come here with an Anglo-Saxon background to have a rightful attachment to the Crown and, in particular, to the monarch. That is something that was instilled and inbred in the people of that generation. But there is a new generation that has moved on.
I have been to interschool debates where my children have participated. It did not matter what socioeconomic background the children they were debating came from, when it came to the issue of the republic and of retention of the Queen, it was never an issue with those young people. They have a different view and a different vision. I feel today their view and vision is being held back by the people who want to hold on to the past. Whilst that is all well and good, the future of our nation lies in the young people. People such as ourselves around here, with a few minor exceptions—and I am getting right into the age barrier now, Senator Ferguson—have fulfilled most of what we want to do in life.
—Oh, no!
—Oh, yes you have.
—You've reached a dead end!
—No, I have a long way to go; I am only a young bloke. But many of our hopes and aspirations have been fulfilled whereas many of these young people are still in the formation of their hopes and aspirations and of what they are striving towards. We are in the later phase of our lives compared with these people. They have a different set of values and a different outlook—not that there is anything necessarily wrong with their outlook, nor is there anything overly right with ours. They have a real desire to see themselves in a completely different light from how my parents, my grandparents and others of that ilk would have seen themselves.
In the post-World War II period, we had a great influx of migrants from many cultural backgrounds. This is not to ignore or deny the indigenous people who were here tens of thousands of years before white settlement 
 even took place. Any concept of a monarch in many of those cases is a complete anathema to their social values, their set of mores and their set of principles.
—They shouldn't have come here!
—That is not the issue.
—They knew what they were coming to, let's be honest.
—You are begging the issue. We invited these people in; they came in. Our nation has now gone through a natural transition. That transition will see and has seen that these people have no attachment to the concept of the Queen of Australia. Let me assure you that I respect those people who want to hold the view that they embrace the monarchy, but under no circumstances do I hold any attachment whatsoever to a person who is remote and detached from Australia being our head of state. As to the embarrassment that this causes when we get onto the public scene and we have toasts to the Queen of Australia, it is a complete embarrassment in its entirety.
I believe there is a lot of hoo-ha being put on about this particular change. We do need a republic. If the process that is envisaged in this proposal proves not to be perfect—and no process is ever perfect, no matter where you go—that still does not limit the opportunity in the future to change the process further if it is so required. From the debate as it is being waged currently, one would think that, if one puts in place a republic and the process of the appointment of the President of the republic, it is forever unalterable. One of the features of our Constitution is that it can be altered by a majority of citizens and a majority of the states of Australia voting in favour. It is not something that is set in place never to be altered, just as I do not think our forebears would have seen the Constitution as they put it ever remaining without change into the future. I commend, and I will be campaigning for, the yes vote for the republic because I believe our society has now matured to the stage where we should be a republic moving into the 21st century.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-10,"—A moment ago, Senator McGauran made the interjection across the chamber that people coming here should have known what they were coming to and that they were coming to a monarchy. I have to tell you, Senator McGauran, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that my old man reckoned that the best 10 quid that he ever spent in his life was on coming to this place. He said that all the way through. He wants to say to you, Senator McGauran, and all your mates out there, `Thank you very much.' He enjoyed it.
—He brought you with him! What about you?
—I will come to me in a minute. He came here, spent his 10 quid and got that back many times over. He thought Australia was a great place until the day that he died. Senator Ferguson said, `What about you?' You got me for nothing, Senator Ferguson. It was just like one of those sets of steak knives that you buy for $49.95. You got the tea cosy or whatever it was with it as well. That was me. Senator Ferguson, I know you could not possibly have done without me. You are very grateful to the 10-quid system that was there. There was no way that he would ever have been able to afford to come to Australia if it had not been 10 quid. In fact, I remember him flogging a few things—I can say this now that he is dead—to raise the 10 quid. I am old enough to remember that.
I suppose my first republican or monarchist memory of Australia was in the Walkerville picture theatre on a Saturday afternoon during 1959. I was never quite the sporting type, as most people know. Saturday afternoon for me was not a game of cricket. Saturday afternoon for me was to go down to the flicks at Walkerville. That was before all of these people who today want to censor everything and take it off. There used to be some pretty good films on a Saturday afternoon. The one thing I found bizarre was that the first thing they did was put the Queen on. I was not used to this in England but, when you came out here, the first thing that was put on in the picture theatre was the Queen.
On my first Saturday afternoon sitting down watching this particular show, I got a belt on the earhole from a woman who said, in a very broad Australian accent, `Stand up for your Queen.' As any nine-year-old would, I turned around, looked at her and said, `It's not your Queen, love. It's my Queen,' in a broad Pommy accent. I got the other earhole belted. Then I was told to stand up and not to be cheeky. That was probably Australia in the 1950s. Senator McGauran made the comment before that they knew what they were coming to. I think it was a very different country from today. In fact, I remember being traipsed out in grade 7—which was 1963, from memory—and made to walk for three miles to go down to wherever it was to stand on a road as the Queen drove by at 35 miles an hour. It was an amazing episode. Every schoolkid in the whole district had to walk and stand in the sun.
—What is your problem with that?
—We had to stand in the sun and wait for the Queen of England to drive by. I did find that somewhat bizarre, but at least I got out of some school and all the rest of it. I suppose that was a reasonable trade-off. In 1963 and in 1959, Australia was certainly very happy to have Queen Elizabeth as the head of state. I still remember Geoffrey Dutton in the 1960s saying that Australia should become a republic. Geoffrey Dutton is no longer with us; he died a couple of years ago. I think poor old Mr Dutton was likely to be lynched. The only thing was that in South Australia there were no trees left. I know this is not the RFA debate, and no doubt I will have a few comments on that, but had there been a suitable tree there, Mr Dutton would have been decorating it in the late 1960s.
The monarchy was very popular here. I remember my mum used to love going down and buying all of the magazines that had the latest royal stories. This was long before Rupert Murdoch became the greatest republican since Oliver Cromwell, which happened sometime during the 1990s. Until that time, it was what Princess Anne did here and what some of the others did there. In fact, it was a lovely world that used to get relayed in all 
 these magazines, which quite a large number of women in particular would buy. I know my mother-in-law read every last one of these things. When I took her to meet the Queen in 1992, she told me all the things that I had to do—what I had to call her and how I had to curtsy. Senator McGauran would have been proud of her. If ever Senator McGauran needs any advice on protocol, he has only to ring my mother-in-law and she will tell him exactly how to treat the Queen, Prince Phillip or any of the rest of them. Of course, I was quite happy to meet Her Majesty. I certainly made it clear that I was happy to go and meet anyone who had come from so far away to see me. There was a scandal at the time in 1992 when the Queen came and I was in state politics.
—Order! Can we have some order in this chamber? We are hearing Senator Quirke.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I have not finished yet. I have more. In 1992, I met Her Majesty. I must say that she was a nice lady who had come a very long way to see me and my friends, minus three. This big scandal that went on was because three Labor members—
—How long are you going to go?
—Quite a while, Senator Bishop. I am just warming up. Her Majesty and I had a chat for a while because my poor old mother-in-law, who curtsied for the Queen, actually froze halfway down. The Queen tried to help her up and all the rest of it. It was a lovely show. Prince Philip came up and said to us afterwards something like, `What are you chaps from?' When I said to him, `We are from the Labor Party, sir,' he gave us probably the response that we would get from a number of Senator McGauran's friends. He went, `I see. You need all the friends you can get. Ho, Ho, Ho.' That was it.
I thought it was a lovely show in the Adelaide Town Hall that time and, if the Queen comes here again, I will probably go again because I think anyone who comes that 
 far deserves to be recognised. The problem is that this person has come from across the sea and, to suggest that she is the Queen of Australia, is a nonsense.
—That is what Gough made her. Gough made her the Queen of Australia.
—I know what he did. Even God can make mistakes, as you know, Senator Ferguson, and that was one of them. At the end of the day, Australia's head of state is the monarch of another country that today we have few interactions with.
If I went out into the street back in the 1950s and 1960s, I would see British product of all type. I would see British cars. I would see stuff that had come from England that I have not seen here in many a year. In the 1950s and 1960s, Australia and Britain were very important trading partners. The Empire and the Commonwealth—as reflected in, firstly, Empire Day, which I also remember at school, and Commonwealth Day—were very strong, indeed. But it is not there today. If I go out into the street today, I find Japanese cars. In terms of a trading relationship, it would be probably more appropriate for us to have Emperor Akihito as our head of state.
—We nearly did, thanks to the Americans.
—I will come to that in a moment because the British did not do much to help in that exercise. But, since the 1950s through to the 1990s, we have found other trading partners. Of course, the military alliances before that changed quite substantially. When the two British battleships were sunk off the coast of Malaya in World War II on 8 December, that was the last British involvement in the Far East of any significance to Australia until 1945. In 1945, large numbers of British troops, British aircraft and British ships came to the Far East but only after their war—firstly, in Africa and then in the North Atlantic and in the European theatre—had been concluded.
Australia at that time took some hard and sharp lessons that took a generation or more to sink in. But the military ties with Britain are now almost all gone. The last of them are 
 up there in Butterworth in Malaysia and places like that where Australia agreed to pick up the slack in the late 1960s for when Britain would at that time retreat east of Suez, as they said, and they did.
Today, the arguments for having such close connections with Britain are non-existent. It is an anachronism, to say the least, to today toast the Queen of another country. I am quite happy to have a lot of friends who are monarchists and who say that monarchy is a stable force and all the rest of it. I can accept that as an argument. I suspect that the society we have here in Australia would be stable under any particular regime.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—Senator Campbell should join the queue. He knows how to do it. He runs it here. If he wants to join the queue, all he has to do is put his name up, tell the minister next to him that he wants to jump into the debate. That is fine. In the meantime, can I suggest that he go back to his port or whatever it was that he was having before he came in here and leave me to finish. I am having enough competition from my own side—that is a hint, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Your hint is well taken at this hour, Senator Quirke. Senator Quirke should be heard in silence on both sides.
—Thank you for your protection. To have an American President come to Australia and then to have to toast as the head of this great country of ours the monarch of another one—and so publicly a monarch of another place—I find pretty hard to swallow.
I have some respect for some of the monarchists who say that we have a system that has worked well ever since Federation. In fact, it has worked well in the states before that, since they got responsible government, and in some places as far back as the 1850s. Why will we not have that stability with a minimalist change whereby in fact we have an Australian head of state? There are people who say that the end of the world is coming, that it is only the British monarchy that has 
 given us this stability here in Australia for the last however many years. I find that a quantum leap of faith. I cannot understand the logic of that argument because I do not think it is right.
The reason we have had stability in this country is that we have worked for it. The institutions in this country are supported by the public out there. In this country we have been lucky and we have had a great deal of prosperity. We have not had foreign invasion. We have not had some of the traumas that have happened in other societies. It is not the monarchy that has given us that stability; it is all the other historical factors.
I want to come back to what Senator Murray said before. Senator Murray is obviously a strong direct election republican. I tell this Senate that there is one thing that will make me vote no on 6 November, that is, if the option before me is a directly elected President. I suspect that having the two competing mandates of an elected Prime Minister and his or her government and an elected President is a recipe for constitutional crises and political paralysis.
I have not yet heard anything from any of the people who support direct election that makes me change that view. I have not heard people tell me how you can elect a President without having an ever growing bureaucracy and political apparatus around that position. I have not heard that yet. In fact, I hope that some of the people, such as Senator Murray, who support direct election and who are coming out now and making these comments in this chamber and other places can address that issue, because that particular concept bothers me and worries me considerably.
I firmly believe that this should be a minimalist change. It is rather a shame that the Prime Minister has embraced more complex questions than are necessary. At the end of the day, the decision for 6 November is whether we will be a republic or a monarchy. That is the issue. Some of us will go out there and explain the issue in more detail than that, but at the end of the day that is the key issue. That is what it is. If people vote yes on 6 November, they are going to get a model for a republic. Maybe some of them would prefer 
 something like the United States model. Maybe some of them would not trust us to select the right person, but as it goes that is what the issue is on 6 November.
I find the issue simple. If I say no, I have to tick a box which says that I am going to accept the present system where the head of state is the monarch of another country. She is not a person I have any animus towards. In fact, I think that over many years the Queen of Great Britain has done a good job, an excellent job. The Queen of Great Britain has held the monarchy in Britain together and has lifted it in the esteem of the British public. Her children have probably not done much to help that particular institution, but I certainly think she has. I respect her as the Queen of England, as the Queen of Great Britain.
I cannot accept the fact that I am 12,000 miles away in another society which hardly trades with Britain, which has very few military links with it any more and which, in some areas, has very distinct and different foreign policies from us, yet we accept this person as the head of state of this country. Because of that, I would find it almost impossible to tick the box on 6 November. Had the direct elect republicans got their way, I probably would have seen more in the Queen than I am going to see on 6 November. I probably would have been inclined to have gone down there—it would have been very hard. It will be a bit like the referenda of 1988 where there were a few propositions. Has your watch broken down, Senator Ferguson?
—I wish you would break down. I want a couple of minutes.
—I will give you a couple of minutes. You will be right. There is plenty of time yet. The night is young. At the end of the day, I think the 6 November decision will be a simple one for most people. It is a shame we have had the intervention of the Prime Minister and intervention from Mr Reith in the way he has. In fact, in Mr Reith's case, it would be very much like me coming in here and telling everyone I was really a monarchist deep down but I am going to support the republic, and the reason I am going to do that is I want to ingratiate myself 
 to the leadership of the Labor Party. I think Mr Reith has set back some of the monarchist cause in this country. I hope that is so. I will be campaigning for the 6 November decision because I think it is a sensible one and a minimalist one. I make it quite clear: if there is any further referendum for direct elect Presidents, it will not be getting a yes vote from me.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1999-08-10,"—I am going to try to condense my remarks as much as possible because we wish to conclude the debate tonight and there is not a lot of time left. That means I am going to have to try to cut short some of the things I wanted to say. In response to some of the things that Senator Quirke said, there has always been a republican movement in Australia. For the last 200 years there has been a republican movement in Australia, ever since European settlement. As Senator Quirke knows, there are a lot of Australians whose ancestors did not really want to come here in the first place.
It is mostly the descendants of those people who did not want to come in the first place—they detested Britain and detested the monarchy—who have always carried on the tradition of wanting to change our system and our Constitution and the Crown we have in place today. The republican movement is not new. It is just that in recent times there have been attempts to gain some momentum by putting before the Australian people a variety of proposals which they think are popular, but we will find out on 6 November whether or not this is really the case.
There are a lot of Australians who have arrived in recent times. A lot of those who have come in recent times, including possibly Senator Quirke's parents, came because of the perception they had of Australia, of its history, of its Constitution and of its heritage. Australia was a country that they wanted to come to. It was Australia that they respected. It was Australia that was solid, Australia that was stable and Australia that had a democracy. It was the place they wanted to come to. So we have this contrast of people who came 200 years ago who did not want to come and those who have come, particularly since the 
 Second World War, and who wanted to come to Australia because of the country that Australia was.
I was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. If I remember rightly, I started my contribution at that Constitutional Convention by asking whether, if Australia was to become a republic tomorrow, I would feel any more Australian than I do today. The answer is simply no. I could not feel any more Australian than I do today. I could not feel any more independent than I do today. When I hear people overseas say, `If we remain a constitutional monarchy we will never be truly independent. It impedes our trade. It impedes our opportunity to trade with neighbouring nations,' I say that is the greatest load of codswallop I have ever heard. Australia today is recognised as an independent nation and one which trades under its own banner. People will always recognise that Australia is a totally independent country.
If Australia becomes a republic after 6 November next year, I will not feel any more Australian than I do today, nor I think will Senator Quirke, who spoke so eloquently just prior to me. We have heard speech after speech in this debate read by pro-republican supporters, I would say without enthusiasm. There were some speeches, like Senator Quirke's and Senator Hogg's, which were not read, and there were people who actually spoke from the heart. But an enormous number of speeches were read by pro-republican supporters without enthusiasm, as though they were reading a thesis for a university degree; it was something that they had spent much time researching but it was not from the heart. That is unlike Senator Lightfoot and Senator Abetz, who spoke from the heart, with enthusiasm and as though they really meant what they were saying. There was no tokenism, no symbolism from them. They spoke from the heart, as though they really believed what they were saying.
I am not sure whether it was Senator Hogg or one of the other previous speakers who said that our Governor-General, Sir William Deane, was relegated to the Queen's representative. I am sorry, it may not have been Senator Hogg, but I did hear one of the 
 speakers say that the Governor-General had been relegated to the Queen's representative. It overlooks the fact that the Governor-General has powers that the Queen does not have. The Governor-General has far more powers than the Queen has. The Governor-General may be the Queen's representative, but to all intents and purposes and as far as I am concerned, Sir William Deane is our head of state.
I do not know that there is any reference in our Constitution to a head of state. I have read it a couple of times and I cannot recall any mention of the words `head of state'. As far as I am concerned, the Governor-General is our head of state. It was good enough for him to go and represent Australians in Switzerland at the time of a recent very sad event, where everybody thought of him as the head of state of Australia. In many other areas, Sir William Deane, who is so much admired by many people opposite and others, is truly the key figure and the representative of Australia.
I will be voting no at the referendum. I will also be voting no at the third reading stage of this bill. My colleague Senator Schacht probably knew that before I said so. It is not that I do not want this referendum to go ahead, because I do. But in fact the quirk of our system says that, unless there is opposition to the bill, there cannot be a case put so that people can make an informed judgment by having information provided to them on both the yes and the no case. So I will be voting no at the third reading stage of this bill. I want Australians to have a say in this referendum, because I think this is something that needs to be decided. But I would like it placed on record that I will be voting no for those reasons. I will be one of those who will be responsible for making sure that Australians have the opportunity to make an informed decision when it comes to the referendum because there has to be a case prepared for both opinions when the referendum is put to the Australian people.
I heard one of my own colleagues just a while ago talking about ducklings leaving the nest and becoming beautiful swans. When I hear that sort of rhetoric describing the republic, I am taken aback, because I do not think 
 that is speaking from the heart. I much preferred to hear what Senator Lightfoot said.
I distinctly remember that during a visit from a French delegation a couple of years ago one of the French members of parliament got up and said, `And when are you Australians going to leave the nest? When are you going to actually become independent and stand on your own two feet?' One of my colleagues got up and asked this member of the French parliament, `Sir, which model of the French republic do you think we should model ours on—the first, second, third, fourth or fifth republic?' That member of parliament from France was somewhat taken aback when he was asked that question.
I have been concerned when people have talked about the recommendations of the select committee and have referred to it as being a bipartisan committee. I always understood the word `bipartisan' to mean a group of people of opposing views coming to some consensus at the end of a discussion. In the case of the select committee I think the word `bipartisan' has been used very loosely. What it meant in this case was that the pro-republicans had one point of view, and that those on that committee from the Liberal Party and the National Party who had a differing point of view dissented from that report. For the media and others to talk about a bipartisan select committee is misrepresenting the term `bipartisan' in relation to this particular subject. The committee members were people of opposing views and at the end of their deliberations they still had opposing views. So I do not think it is right to even suggest that that select committee was a bipartisan committee. It was a party composed of people who were pro-republican and pro constitutional monarchy; they did not have a similar position, they had a differing position at the end of their inquiry.
Senator Hogg talked about the future for young Australians. He said that when the Queen is mentioned all young Australians believe that that plays no part in their future. He wanted to have a future for young Australians, which in some sense meant that, if we get rid of the Queen, they have some brighter future. My daughters have now grown up, but 
 I have a young granddaughter. I want young Australians to have the same opportunities that I had. I grew up in an Australia where opportunities abounded.
There are far more important things than changing the symbols to give our young Australians opportunities, by way of providing opportunities for jobs, for advancement, for education. There are a whole range of things that we can do for young Australians other than change the symbols of this nation. Changing the symbols will provide them with nothing. Some of them may get a feel-good feeling about it, but there are far more important things than changing the symbols that will make it possible for young Australians to be confident about the future and have the sort of future that I had when I was a young Australian, when it was possible for young Australians to achieve so much. It is still possible for young Australians to do that. There is no need to change the symbols for it to happen.
I am a supporter of our current Constitution. I am a supporter of the institution of the Crown, not of the wearer of the crown. I am a supporter of the institution of the Crown, because I think that is what is important in our Australian Constitution. As I said earlier, I regard the Governor-General as the head of state, and the Queen as the sovereign of Australia. She is the Queen of Australia. Gough Whitlam made sure of that: he actually made her an honorary Australian. So to talk about having a `foreign' Queen—to use the terms of those opposite—as our head of state is something that Gough Whitlam fixed up back in the early 1970s: she is the Queen of Australia. She is also the Queen of England but she is the Queen of Australia.
As I said, it is not the issue of the Queen or any other wearer of the crown that is important to me but the institution of the Crown. And to those opposite who talk about wanting to rid themselves of the Crown and the British monarch because we no longer trade with Great Britain and there is no closeness I say that, if that is the case, why on earth do they want to stay in the British Commonwealth? Part of the information that is being put to people is that, yes, we are going to have a 
 minimal change: we want to get rid of the Queen and have an Australian President, but we want to stay within the British Commonwealth. Well, if the British Commonwealth is so important, why? If there is no trade, if we have nothing in common, why on earth don't they want to break those ties?
I do not want to break them, because I think that there is an important historical context. It is important for Australia as a nation. It is important for those people who have come to Australia to have the opportunity, as Senator Hogg said earlier, to bring their children up in this wonderful country of ours which gave me so many opportunities, has given my daughters so many opportunities and will, I hope, give my grandchildren many opportunities.
I must conclude, because the time at which the Senate will to adjourn is getting very close and I know that the minister wants to conclude the debate. I wanted to explain to the Senate the reasons that I will be opposing this bill at the third reading, and I hope that on 6 November this proposal that is being put forward by way of referendum will be resoundingly defeated.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-10,"—in reply—Tonight I rise to close the second reading debate on what is a very important issue indeed, and that concerns the legislation which is necessary to go forward in order for the people of this country to go to a referendum on 6 November this year; and there is no more fitting place for this debate to occur than in the Senate of this country. I thank honourable senators from all sides for their contributions and note their diversity of views. That is a healthy sign, not one which is necessarily divisive or in any way demonstrates a malaise or a polarisation in our community. Far from it—it shows that senators have thought this through. In fact, a common theme has run through their contributions tonight, and that is what they think is best for the future of this country.
I say at the outset that the government's objective has always been to put forward a package of amendments which give effect to the outcomes of the Constitutional Conven 
 tion. It is clear that, in large measure at least, that objective has been achieved. In his foreword to the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, the Chairman said:
Generally the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 and the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 faithfully reflect the findings of the 1998 Constitutional Convention. The Committee accepts the evidence that the provisions in the Bills are workable.
That shows the even-handedness and the transparency with which the government has approached this matter. At the outset I would also reject any criticism in relation to the government's approach to the handling of this referendum and the bills that are before the Senate.
We have seen just recently that the government took on board part of the recommendation in relation to the question to be put to the people of Australia on 6 November. That recommendation, which came from the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, was not unanimous. There were dissenting reports, and the government carefully considered all views that were mentioned in that report.
I might say that, in research which the government has released publicly, it was revealed that some 63 per cent of people polled did not know how the President would be elected or chosen, and therefore it is essential that in that question which is put to the people of Australia there is mention made of how that is done. But, of course, the government also took on board the recommendation of the committee in so far as who the President would be replacing, and I think that was a very even-handed approach indeed in relation to the question which the government proposes should be put forward.
I also say that the government will be moving amendments to the republic bill to reflect several of the committee's recommendations, and I will be dealing with those tomorrow. There are also amendments in relation to the nominations committee bill, which will be dealt with tomorrow as well; and I will be addressing aspects which have 
 been raised in the second reading debate speeches during the committee stage.
There was some mention made by some senators in relation to the education campaign that the government will be undertaking in September. The government is mindful of course that, in relation to those parts of the community which do not have English as a first language, there are special needs to be met—and particularly so with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—and that will form part of a special strategy in relation to our public education campaign. It has been announced publicly that the government has assisting it an expert panel consisting of Sir Ninian Stephen, Professor Cheryl Saunders, Professor Geoffrey Blainey, Dr John Hirst and Dr Colin Howard. They will be assisting the government in respect of the material that will be used in the neutral education campaign. This, of course, is designed to inform the Australian public as to the existing system, what is being proposed in relation to the referendum, how the referendum works and how it affects the states. This forms a solid basis from which the people of Australia will make a choice. In coming to that choice, the government has funded both the yes and no committees $7.5 million respectively, and they will engage in a campaign in October which will be along the lines of an advocacy campaign, each putting forward their own respective views in relation to where Australia should be going, and then the people of Australia will have a choice placed squarely and robustly before them. Of course, after that, the Australian Electoral Commission will also be forwarding the yes and no campaign—

(3) and (4)The average amount of Childcare Assistance paid on a weekly basis varies due to changes in family income, childrens' hours of attendance, school and public holidays and other variable factors. However almost 60% of families receiving Childcare Assistance receive the maximum level, and the following examples provide information of a family with one child receiving the maximum level of Childcare Assistance.

A family enrolling their child in community-based long day care for (a) 30 hours per week: would have a weekly fee of about $105.00, receive $57.90 in Childcare Assistance, $8.00 as Childcare Rebate and pay a gap fee of $39.10 per week.
The same family enrolling their child for (b) 50 hours per week: would have a weekly fee of about $169.00, receive $96.50 in Childcare Assistance, $15.60 as Childcare Rebate and pay a gap fee of $56.90 per week.

Caution is urged using figures on openings and closures because of the volatile nature of this information—centres amalgamate, change ownership, change names or transfer a name to another service.
