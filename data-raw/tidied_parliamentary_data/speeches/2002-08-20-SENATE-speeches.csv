"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-08-20,"—I seek to clarify an answer I gave to Senator Allison. I have just been sitting here thinking about it, and I think I said, with respect to the incidence of meningococcal disease in children whose families smoke, that it is four times higher if the mother smokes, five times higher if the father smokes and nine to 10 times higher if both parents smoke. I may have said `per cent higher' rather than `times higher'—that is, I may have underestimated it. If I did make that error, I meant to say `times' rather than `per cent'.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health: Tobacco</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-08-20,"—Mr President, I also offer you my congratulations. I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senator Conroy today relating to corporate governance.
—And Senator Vanstone's?
—And Senator Vanstone's—if you want to toss that one in as well, thank you, Senator Bishop. What we have seen today is the handpass to Senator Coonan, who wants to handpass this to another inquiry. This is a government that, 12 months ago, was dragged screaming and kicking to request Professor Ian Ramsay to conduct an inquiry. What we have seen since then is just inquiry after inquiry. Professor Ramsay consulted extensively; he produced a report. In March, the government called for comment on Professor Ramsay's report. Today, they have delayed it further. `It is CLERP 9,' they say, `We will just release another discussion paper; we will call for comment.' Anything to stop doing something serious about dealing with the corporate crooks in this country.
This is a government that, before the election, told people not to worry about their family payments debt. They wrote to everybody and said, `Don't you worry about that.' But, after the election, what did they say? They said, `Pay up,' and did not tell people what they were going to do—that is, strip them of their tax refund. Before the election, the government said they would make directors pay back their bonuses when a company subsequently collapsed. After the election, we have another vague promise that we might see legislation sometime this year if we are lucky, or possibly next year. This is a government that will do anything to avoid tackling one of the biggest problems in this country, a problem which is eking away at investor confidence—that is, the shenanigans of the corporate sector.
This is a government that just will not act on the big end of town. Huge salaries and extravagant option packages have been paid to executives—and the Prime Minister, as long ago as 1999 in the face of this greed, just requested some restraint. The first time was in 1999. He said, `We have to ask the corporate sector to just be a bit better behaved.' It is 2002 now, and what has he got to say? He says, `If the big end of town don't start taking notice of community sentiment, I might have to act.' Do not hold your breath, Australia. Do not hold your breath in the hope that this Prime Minister will actually grasp the nettle and do something. The law requiring disclosure of the details of remuneration packages has been flouted, and what has the government done? Nothing. I just heard the Treasurer say in the other place, `If you have any evidence of the law being flouted, give it to ASIC.' But it is just not that simple. 
Labor, with the help of the Democrats, amended the Corporations Act to require the disclosure of such details. Senator Ian Campbell, who had the duty and carriage of the bill in the chamber, said in the debate on the amendments:
We will not be supporting the Labor amendment.
That is straight out of Hansard, Senator Campbell. Only begrudgingly did he decide not to oppose the amendment, because the majority in the chamber supported it. Senator Campbell's preference was to hold a review on the issue. The government is showing a real talent for holding reviews on matters concerning management accountability, but more on that later—anything rather than act!
ASIC knows that the provision is not being complied with and says that it will not act until the government follows up on the recommendations of the joint parliamentary committee to clarify the provision. When asked why it would not enforce the provisions, ASIC said, in March 2000:
The committee has since published its report and the government will presumably deal with that and tidy the provisions that need to be tidied. When that is done, serious enforcement becomes an option.
That is not good enough. The minister has the power to direct ASIC to investigate and should do so. Further, the government accepted the recommendations of the committee in February 2001 but has done nothing since, knowing that ASIC and shareholders are waiting for it to act. I fear ASIC and others—the shareholders who put their faith in this government that it would actually do the job and force the companies to comply with the law—have presumed too much. We are not even asking for something new—this is a law from 1998. All we are asking this government to do is get its act together and start enforcing this and make its mates cough up to investors what they have been getting away with. No doubt the preference of this government would be to hold another review, and I am sure we will hear more about that shortly. That has been the response on the important issue of auditor independence, as I have already mentioned—an issue this government only acted on after the collapse of HIH.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-20,"—Congratulations, Mr Deputy President, on your election to that most important office in the Senate.
—It never ceases to amaze me how many times Senator Conroy can make speeches about corporate regulatory issues and never come up with a `single seminal original idea'—
—Your idea is to hold a review!
—Senator Conroy!
—to quote the words of Professor John Nash from that wonderful movie A Beautiful Mind—not a `single seminal original idea' in all of that work. We waited for his leader, Mr Crean, to come forward with the detailed policy we were promised on Sunday. All I can say, having read Senator Conroy's contribution to banking policy last year, when he had a private briefing from the Australian Bankers Association on a code of conduct, is that Senator Conroy came out with a banking policy stolen and plagiarised in large chunks from the ABA's policy statement and passed off as his own work.
—You said the union wrote it for me.
—Senator Conroy!
—What did we get yesterday? Senator Conroy was obviously called up by Mr Crean, who said, `Look, we need something on this corporate governance stuff. I'm having trouble governing the Labor Party, so let's go and pick on someone else.' Senator Conroy responds, `Look, I think I can put something together for you.' He goes to the IFSA web site, pulls up my speech from Brisbane and pulls out all the chunks of the government's policy. He says, `We're going to bring in a rule about options.' That is government policy already. He says, `We're going to implement the Ramsay recommendations.' Good idea, Senator Conroy! The government announced its recommendation of that years ago. 
I ask anyone to compare Mr Crean's speech yesterday with my speech. Poor old Senator Conroy obviously got a call on Sunday afternoon from Mr Crean, who said, `Look, I promised to get tough on corporate governance. I've got to make a speech tomorrow, Steve. Can you whack together some words for me?' So he goes to the IFSA web site, pulls out all the chunks of my speech in Brisbane and says, `Look, Simon, this is good stuff. We'll crack down on corporate people.' The sad thing is that, if someone then goes to Mark Latham's web site, they find that Mark Latham is actually saying that we should not get so tough on corporate crooks if they are sort of related to the Labor Party. Poor old Mark Latham is saying that ASIC is unfair to corporate crooks if they are friends of Labor, but Simon Crean and Stephen Conroy have discovered corporate governance in the last five minutes.
The sad thing for Labor is that the government, as is recognised not only within Australia, not only by shareholders but also by stakeholders broadly, has been working on ensuring that Australia's corporate regulatory system is one of the best in the world—if not the best in the world. Labor have had six years to come up with alternative policies and have not done so. The biggest difference between Labor and the coalition on this is that Labor continue, as they did in government, to respond to crises on a crisis-by-crisis, knee-jerk reaction basis. I say that you do not create good policy in that environment. What you have got to do is start with a sound set of principles, and the government's principles on this are based on one sound principle, and that is that you need to improve and enhance the quality of disclosure.
—Labor's principle is to make as much noise as they can—and you see from Senator Conroy's behaviour in the chamber here that he has a severe case of verbal diarrhoea and would make Woodside Petroleum jealous of the amount of gas he produces out of his mouth. All he does is talk, but every now and again I pick up what Senator Conroy says about corporate governance and I find no new idea. We have actually asked him. His great idea about how to regulate the financial system, in relation to the financial sector reform act, with its new system of regulation to improve the quality of disclosure to people, is to actually get rid of the regulations altogether. That is his idea. We have said to Senator Conroy, `Come forward with an alternative regulatory system for super and managed funds.' You have got Senator Sherry over here saying we need more disclosure and Senator Conroy saying we need less—in fact, Senator Conroy saying we do not need any at all. Senator Conroy needs to go away and do some hard work—not just copy other people's policies, not copy other people's ideas. He has got to give up his plagiaristic ways and actually do some hard work. It is hard work. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Business Corporate Governance</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-08-20,"—The principle on which the Liberal government of this country operates is that it is soft on the big end of town but it is too tough on families and small business. That is its operational principle. The other operational principle that Senator Ian Campbell and the Liberal government operate on is that they talk tough when the heat comes on— when there are constant complaints and constant examples. We have had HIH and One.Tel—just a few examples. They talk tough when the heat comes on but then, when the heat comes on from the corporate sector not to do anything, they do not do anything.
I heard Senator Campbell on the John Laws show just over a week ago, the day after my discussion with John Laws about getting tough on some of the malpractice in the superannuation industry. This government rolls out the pat old solution of `improved disclosure'. Just improve disclosure, improve information and improve education—that is its magic wand for minimising the sorts of abuses we are seeing in the corporate sector in Australia. We only have to look at the comments made by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, last night. Last night he claimed that the current law required listed companies to disclose the value of options provided to executives, yet we know—and my colleague Senator Conroy asked this of the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin—that in March 2000 the chairman of ASIC told the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities that ASIC could not enforce the current law requiring companies to disclose the details of executive remuneration. 
The government knows that the current law is ineffective. Has it done anything? In fact, ASIC has asked the government to clarify the current law in respect of disclosure of the value of options. Has the government done anything? No, it has not. It talks tough when the heat comes on from the general public and people who are concerned about some of the abuses that are occurring, and then the heat comes back on from the corporate sector—or some elements of it— and it does nothing. It tries to ride out the wave and the rightful public concern when these sorts of problems occur. It tries to ride it out, talk tough, placate the public and move on in the hope that the public will forget. Today Senator Coonan referred to yet another inquiry into issues of corporate governance. It is actually a discussion paper on top of an already completed inquiry. That, again, is typical of this government's approach: when you get into trouble, talk tough and announce an inquiry and then people will hopefully forget about the problems that are occurring in the corporate sector. Time will pass and the government will do nothing, which is its record.
We have the inquiry held by Professor Ramsay—the so-called Ramsay report that was given to the government in October 2001 on measures to improve auditor independence—but this government has not implemented one single recommendation of the Ramsay inquiry. Not one has been recommended. It has had 12 months. It heard ASIC in January this year make further comments about the Ramsay inquiry, yet it has done nothing. This government is lax on enforcing rigorous accounting and disclosure requirements on big business in this country. As I said, the government rides out the heat of the moment—the criticism—and then, when the heat from the top end of town comes back on it, it does nothing. All it can rely on is so-called increased disclosure and education— `Let's educate the public.'
This is in marked contrast to the response to the questions posed by my colleague Senator Lundy to Senator Vanstone regarding social security. We know that there is a massive crackdown, via their tax return, on families who have been overpaid their family tax benefit. The families who have been inadvertently overpaid, families who have struggled to do their best in meeting the requirements of the law, had not been informed that any moneys outstanding would be taken from their tax refunds—except, of course, in the year leading up to the election. We know what happened in the year leading up to the election: the government announced a waiver of certain debts in this particular area.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-08-20,"—Mr Deputy President, congratulations on your new role. I wish you the best in that important role. We have heard Senator Conroy's sort of Shakespearian monologue with crocodile tears flowing in honour of the so-called small businesses and families that he stands to support. That is all they really are—they are nothing more than crocodile tears. It is rhetoric and political shenanigans. The record speaks for itself. I, for one, stand here in support of small business and am aware of the pain and suffering that small business endured in the Hawke-Keating years, under the Labor government, when we had record high interest rates and record high debt in this country. That caused all sorts of pain and suffering for small business. That is the first thing I would like to put on the record. We now have record low interest rates— amongst the lowest interest rates for 30 years for small business. That is what they want, and they want government off the back of business. So for Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy to suggest that they are standing up for small business is like the pot calling the kettle black. In regard to corporate crime, I am very pleased to reiterate what the federal Treasurer said last night at the Australian Industry Group annual conference.  
—He's wrong. He's got it quite wrong.
—Let me make it clear what the facts are. I thought it was an excellent presentation. Were you there, Senator Sherry?
—I was in here doing some work, unlike you.
—You should have been at that dinner listening to a very good presentation. Some of your colleagues were there. I noticed that your colleague Craig Emerson was there—I was on the same table as he—and I hope he has passed on some of the information to you so that a little education session can take place with those people across the chamber. In regard to corporate crime, we have a record second to none. I put the facts to you: 69 jailings in the last three years, amounting to 229 years in total. Where is the record on that? We stand with our heads high. At the last election you were promising $1.5 million per annum in increased funding for ASIC. Our promised increase, which will be implemented, is $23 million, so there is simply no comparison that can be made.
Let us move back to small business for a minute and exactly what the government is doing to support them. You have talked about the reviews. One of those is the Dawson review of the Trade Practices Act. A number of submissions have been made to that. I would like to highlight in particular the one from the ACCC. I congratulate them on the work they have been doing. We need to have a tough corporate watchdog in their role, and they play an important role.
The ACCC have called for the introduction of criminal penalties for breaches of certain provisions including, in part IV of the act, price fixing for hard-core cartel activity. That has received support from a number of quarters, including the Business Council of Australia. The ACCC have also advocated significant increases in pecuniary penalties with regard to the relevant regime. The review is scheduled to report in November this year, and I am looking forward to that, as is small business around this country.
—This is another inquiry. What are you going to do about it?
—We have got the runs on the board in terms of corporate crime. We are out there doing the job and working hard. We are not just nitpicking from the sideshow. There is a little sideshow alley over there on the other side of the chamber: look at the facts and see the runs on the board. That review that was announced on 9 May looks at the anticompetitive behaviour of business around the country—
—Don't you talk about the big end of town. During your 13 years of government, you had a Labor troika: big business, big government and big unions. As I said earlier, it is like the pot calling the kettle black. The honourable senators on the other side need to take that into account when they are putting forward their propositions.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-08-20,"—Mr Deputy President, let me also offer my congratulations on your election to your current post. It seems that we have two standards running together today in public life: firstly, our treatment of corporate regulation as it applies to major companies via the packages paid to executives and senior management and, secondly, our treatment of families, particularly low-income families and welfare recipients who qualify to receive the family tax benefit payment. They are two different approaches.
Looking firstly at the issue of corporate regulation, corporate governance and executive rewards, whether they are wages, superannuation, shares or share options, it is clear that the government is more than satisfied with the status quo. There is no great intent to have any radical shift or change in its policy approach. The government's approach is clear, and we understand it. It involves inattention, lack of regulation, lack of accountability, refusal to enforce the law, refusal to properly fund regulatory agencies like ASIC and no enforceable rules for the big end of town but, opposed to all of that, tough and enforceable rules for families and welfare recipients. 
Look at what the government has done. It has stood by and watched executives repeatedly reward themselves ridiculously high reward packages, even when the company's performance has declined at the first instance and continued to decline over time. Further, the government has not insisted that such packages be fully disclosed to shareholders in accordance with the law. Not one company director has been prosecuted for their failure to comply with this requirement under the law. 
To make matters worse, the government has continued, and still continues, to starve ASIC, Australia's corporate regulator, of funds so that it is unable to fulfil its function. So much so—so bad is the funding, so reduced is the funding—that in ASIC's annual report in 1998-99 it stated:
But we may now have too few staff on the ground to achieve the outcomes we and the government want.
Even though insufficient funding was brought to the government's attention in the annual report, no remedial action was taken at all. Compare that with the family tax benefit package, the subject of a couple of questions to Senator Vanstone. In this one particular area concerning the introduction of this benefit some two years ago, the government has repeatedly failed families.
When the bill was brought in, the government repeatedly said that changes made to the system were going to mean more money for families and greater simplicity for families in understanding the system. Underneath those purported benefits, the design of the system was such that it included an automatic clawback mechanism. The design of the system ensured that the government got back a share of increased payments meant to compensate for the GST. Because parents are required to estimate their income a year in advance, those who work harder, who work overtime or irregular hours, who move in and out of the work force to care for a child or who simply change jobs within the service sector of the economy accumulate debts ranging into thousands of dollars. Today we heard of two instances from two different areas: in Queensland, there was a $3,000 debt; in the ACT, a $4,000 debt. If estimates from last February are correct, the debts keep rising and keep building up.
One flaw in the system ensures that, even when families do, as they are supposed to do, report changes to their incomes, the flawed family payment system does not adjust their payments correctly, leaving them with massive debts at the end of each year. Cleverly, the government has also made sure that it gets access to these debts through the tax system. So a lot of struggling families will be shocked, and are constantly being shocked: when they do their tax returns and expect to receive a modest return of somewhere between $500 and $1,000, they get advice that their tax refunds have been stripped by the government's clawback without any notice at all. The Howard government has refused to alter the unfair rules governing family payments, even though last year 650,000 Australian families—one in three families receiving payments—finished the year with an average debt of $850. Last time round, of course, the government found a magic $1,000 for each of these families to cover their debts.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2002-08-20,"—Mr Deputy President, I join with other senators in offering my congratulations to you on your elevation to the important office of Deputy President yesterday. In this debate this afternoon it seems that, in accusing the government of being soft on the big end of town but hard on families and small businesses, Labor simply cannot get over its us and them mentality. Throughout its history, Labor has operated on the basis of an us and them mentality—management and labour, capital and labour—and now we have the big end of town versus families and small business. Labor is always trying to set up a scenario of divide and try to rule. We know what a dismal failure it has been in that regard, because modern Australia does not involve an us and them situation; it does not involve an us and them mentality. All Australians have shared interests, and those families and small businesses that Labor has referred to in today's debate are also part of the big end of town, because it is those families and small businesses that—either directly or through their superannuation fund accounts—own the big end of town. Australians have shared interests and it is time the Labor Party recognised that. 
The Labor Party accuses the government of doing nothing with regard to enforcing corporate governance. I remind Labor senators that, in response to the 1998 Australian Securities and Investments Commission annual report, Labor promised an additional $1.5 million in funds for ASIC to assist it in its enforcement and administration of corporate governance—$1.5 million is what it promised. What has this government delivered? Over the next four years, there will be $23 million per year in additional funding for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. There is the record for all to see as to who has the stronger commitment to ensuring that appropriate corporate governance is enforced.
Senator Conroy accused the government of not being sufficiently speedy with regard to corporate governance reforms. Senator Conroy knows only too well the process that is followed with regard to corporate law reform that has applied throughout the term of office of this government with its Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. There is a process whereby a CLERP issues paper is issued. That is then considered, and input is received from the community. We then have draft legislation issued which is considered both by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services— which I chair and of which Senator Conroy himself is a member—and by the broader community. Following consideration of that, we then have final legislation introduced into parliament which is further considered by that committee and by the community.
—Three months consultation is required by the law they passed.
—Indeed. Three months consultation is required because we have a national scheme of corporate regulation and consultation with state governments and state Labor ministers. That process is well known to Senator Conroy, and that is the process that this government pursues to ensure that we get our corporate law absolutely right. It is important that our corporate law is right, because if you make an error in that you have to go through the whole process again, which involves further delay. It is important that our corporate law is absolutely spot on, not only for the individual businesses subject to regulation by that law but indeed because of the important place that Corporations Law and corporate regulation have in the entire Australian economy.
If Senator Conroy is complaining about the government delaying corporate law reform, what is he doing with regard to the Financial Services Reform Act? That legislation was passed some months ago, the regulations have been announced, and it is Senator Conroy with his disallowance motion who is delaying the implementation taking effect of those regulations. Notwithstanding the fact that the whole financial services community in this country want those regulations to come into operation, it is Senator Conroy's motion for disallowance that is delaying their implementation. So it is the Labor opposition, not this government, that is the source of any delay with regard to corporate governance. The simple fact is that, through that process of corporate law economic reform, this government over the last six years has ensured that Australia has leading edge Corporations Law. We are streets ahead of the United States, and that is why, notwithstanding one or two corporate collapses in this country, compared with the United States our situation with corporate collapses is far superior.

—I understand that, Senator Allison. Senator Allison, by way of explanation from the chair, I actually had your name on my list, and when you did not stand to get the call I was very surprised indeed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to tobacco.
The minister has indeed announced a program of $300 million to fund over 14 years an immunisation program for meningococcal disease. The Democrats wish to say at the outset that we certainly support measures which can reduce the risk of this disease, particularly to young people. We recognise that 20 deaths a year are 20 deaths too many. However, the minister seems not to recognise that the very large majority of those young people who contract this disease are living in a smoking environment and that in fact they are 10 times more likely to contract meningococcal disease if they have parents who smoke and smoke at home. They are also much more likely as young adults to contract this disease if they smoke. We would argue that immunisation is a very expensive way to protect these children and young adults—it will not protect them from lung disease, it will not protect them from throat cancer, it will not protect them from the many smoking related diseases—and that a fraction of that $300 million, if it had been set aside for smoking prevention, could have made an enormous difference not just to meningococcal disease but to the 19,000 people in Australia who die every year from smoking related diseases. 
There have been numerous studies done in recent times looking into the incidence of smoking in young people in particular, and one that was conducted in 1999 showed that there was a small decline in smoking for the group aged 12 to 15. It is still 14 per cent of that population of children who smoke, but there has been a small decline. It was considered by those who conducted this study that that decline was likely to have occurred because these children would have been exposed at a very impressionable age to the national tobacco campaign `Every cigarette is doing you damage'. That was conducted between 1996 and 1999 and, as I said, it is highly likely that this very small decline in smoking rates for the 12- to 15-year-olds was related to that campaign. Smoking rates for 16- to 17-year-olds have remained stable. Across the board, smoking rates are still 20 per cent. They have reduced from 25 per cent over the last decade or so, but now it seems to have bottomed out, and I would argue it is because the Commonwealth is not spending sufficient money on tobacco smoking prevention campaigns.
We do not want to turn this into any sort of political football—as the minister was suggesting in her earlier answer to the question—and we do want to end meningococcal disease, but this decision, I think, has been taken in haste. It is a quick fix. It is an expensive solution and it does not tackle a key factor which is implicated in the disease— that is, smoking. So I would urge the government to use some of this money on a smoking prevention program—that very successful mass media campaign has clearly worked. If we are to reduce the incidence of smoking to lower than 20 per cent, then steps of that sort must be taken to do so. They have proven to be highly successful elsewhere, as I said.
In fact, to provide some more statistics, if the group of 269,000 students who were smokers in 1999 continued to smoke, we could expect 134,000 of them to die prematurely. That is an enormous number of people. So there is every reason to spend money on smoking prevention campaigns. There are health reasons, there is obviously the human dimension of people who unnecessarily become ill and who die at an early age. The other point to make is that cigarettes sold to underage people, children, still amount to around $100 million worth a year. Whilst the states are doing well in reducing children's access to cigarettes, still $100 million worth is going into their hands and doing them harm.

That the Senate take note of the document tabled earlier today.
I refer to the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Act Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Beef Export to the United States of America Order 2002. This document arises following a great many events, including consideration by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee of the Senate prior to the Senate rising at the end of June. It was the subject of recommendations made unanimously by all members of that committee—that is, government, opposition and crossbench senators—which supported a recommendation designed to ameliorate proposals made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in May to manage the quota, which so outraged sectors of the Australian beef industry and the farming community that we saw some of the most critical statements ever made about a minister for agriculture in this parliament. Perhaps there have been others more so, but it was certainly unusually so in the sense that this was a National Party minister being roundly criticised by a constituency that he would consider to be his own.
The recommendation of the committee was to give effect to the minister's proposals but with a significant discretionary amount taken from the quota. I should say that Australia has a 378,000-odd tonne quota entitlement to the United States which attracts a 4.4 per cent tariff. Anything exceeding that attracts a tariff of 26.4 per cent, so clearly shipments within quota entitlement have a distinct advantage over outside of quota shipments. The committee heard evidence that various abattoirs would wind down and close and that there would be thousands of job losses in regional Australia arising from the minister's proposals. So the Senate committee was minded to make recommendations to vary the minister's proposal to allow for some discretionary allocations to keep abattoirs operating, to keep jobs in regional Australia and to keep the beef industry as functional as possible. 
Quite remarkably, in discussions leading up to the time that the minister made his statement on 15 May this year, he advised the industry that any shipments which had been dispatched prior to the promulgation of the order would not be considered to have been shipped outside of quota entitlement. But then when the order was initially advised following the rising of the Senate, in a way of course that was designed to make it impossible for a member of this Senate to move to disallow it—and it is being produced only today—the minister announced that shipments on the water after 15 May would not necessarily be considered to have been shipped within quota.
The result was that American beef importers, those who had purchased shipments from Australia on the understanding that those imports would fall within quota entitlement and would not attract a punitive tariff, were finding that they had paid for shipments once on board a ship only to find that they would be liable potentially for a 26.4 per cent tariff. Naturally, they were outraged and immediately sought to have that matter rectified. 
I have been given to understand that the minister, who set up an advisory panel to deal with this discretionary quota allocation matter, used that body to overturn his original decision so that shipments which were on the water between 15 May and 1 July would not attract the punitive tariff and would be considered to have been shipped within quota. That was an important change, but it is just a measure of the incompetent way in which this minister has handled this matter and a further example of how he has lost touch with the needs of the industry in a way which, frankly, could well have prejudiced our trading arrangements in terms of those very important beef importers in the United States. It is a very important sector. In excess of 40 to 45 per cent of our beef exports go to the United States of America, so it is certainly a very important export market, and the way the minister has handled this is nothing short of atrocious.
Currently, the same Senate committee is considering the question of the appropriate means for managing the quota allocation next year and in the future, amongst other things. Last night this committee heard evidence from some very significant beef processing companies including the largest company, Australian Meatholdings. There was also evidence from the Cattle Council of Australia and a number of other producers. It is fair to say, without pre-empting the views of the committee, that a significant number of witnesses—and certainly some of the larger and, dare I say it, more influential members of the beef community, if I can put it that way—remain extremely critical of the quota management arrangements and are adamant that the arrangements need to change for next year. 
I do not intend to canvass the options, because that is a matter properly before the committee and the committee will consider those arrangements when the evidence before it has properly been taken. But at last night's hearing I asked some questions of Mr Sutton from Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia, AFFA, with regard to the department's view on quota management for the future, given that the department has obviously been advising the minister about this issue for some time and has taken a fairly key role in the management of the quota until now. I asked Mr Sutton about one of the key issues for quota management—that is, which base year of trading history the department used, subject to the method they were using, of course, to determine the quota entitlement a particular exporter would have. I asked:
Is there a view within the department that the base year for the next year of quota management should be 2001?
This is an important issue. Mr Sutton replied:
We do not have a view. As you know, that is an issue for the panel— 
that is, the independent panel that the minister set up—
and for the government to take a decision on report from the panel.
I asked again:
So the department does not have a view?
Mr Sutton replied:
We do not have a view that is relevant.
It seems to me that the department no longer have the confidence of the minister in terms of the advice that they may have given in relation to quota management. The minister appears, on Mr Sutton's advice, to have charged an independent panel with providing advice to government and not the department on this very important issue. I hope that the minister will also listen to the views of the Senate committee, and I am hopeful that on this occasion as well the committee will come to a common view as to the appropriate system to manage the quota in the future. We cannot have the chaos which has been caused by this minister on this issue arising again next year. The industry is too important.
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Meat and Livestock Industry</title>,Documents,21,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-08-20,"—I move:
That the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 1), as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 350 and made under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, be disallowed.
In rising to move the disallowance motion, I bring to the chamber's attention some of the following issues and the reasons for taking this action. Within six months of enacting regulations pertaining to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 2001, some 400 small businesses have either closed or are in the process of closing. Most are family owned and run. Between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs will potentially be lost. Sixty-thousand Australians who currently own imported used vehicles will have their vehicles greatly reduced in value and pay higher insurance premiums— when and if they can get them. It is not only the businesses directly involved with low volume imports that are being affected by these regulations; there are knock-on effects for support industries as well. As small businesses close, car owners and enthusiasts will find it increasingly difficult to service and maintain their vehicles. The motorist who wants to buy these vehicles because they are unique or they suit their own specific needs will no longer have the freedom of choice. The only vehicles that are now allowed to be imported are those that the Department of Transport and Regional Services deem as `specialist and enthusiast' vehicles.  
The act, and these regulations, are the result of a 14-year campaign by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries—the FCAI—to stop, or all but stop, the import of used vehicles. The act and regulations are also the culmination of a five-year campaign of selective information that has been provided by the department of transport to ministers and opposition members.
Before I go any further, let me read a quote from a discussion paper written by the chief engineer of the certification approvals section in the federal department of transport, dated 20 September 1990:
The intent of the low volume scheme is to make available to the public vehicles which may otherwise not be marketed ...
Yet we are repeatedly told by the FCAI and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services that the original intent was for the supply of specialist and enthusiast vehicles. This is just one of many examples of misinformation coming from the FCAI and the minister for transport.
Upon reading the explanatory memorandum provided by the minister for transport it could be concluded that the Motor Vehicles Standards Amendment Act 2001 and these regulations will provide the small businesses, used vehicle importers and the new vehicle industry with a viable industry. A reading of the EM indicates that the Australian motor vehicle consumer will be a winner. Nothing could be further from the truth. Where is the win-win situation? Where is this viable industry for small businesses, franchised dealerships of the new car industry and the Australian consumer? Page 9 of the 2000 annual report of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries states:
Numerous consultations have occurred with Ministers for Industry and Transport and senior officers on the used vehicle import section of the MVSA Review, seeking a package of measures which represents a fair and balanced outcome for our members. 
They have been provided with the FCAI's detailed recommendations on revised policy arrangements covering the establishment of specialist vehicle criteria for all vehicle types and transition arrangements for used vehicle imports.
These same criteria were put to the MVSA review and the committee stated:
The Task Force considers to ensure only Specialist and Enthusiast vehicles are eligible would have an adverse impact on the viability of small business and would reduce consumer choice. The Task Force does not see any positive benefits for restricting the vehicles to enthusiast vehicles. For these reasons, Option 1 is not considered appropriate.
Yet that is what we have: an inappropriate scheme which has been found to severely restrict small businesses. It is a scheme which has never been recommended by any independent or parliamentary inquiry. Why was this incorrect information therefore included in the explanatory memorandum to the bill?
In the explanatory memorandum provided by the minister for transport, the statement of problems is summarised as follows: 
·	The growth in used import numbers may undermine the uniformity objectives of the MVSA.
·	The growth in used import numbers may undermine the passenger vehicles `plan'.
·	There is horizontal inequity between the two avenues of supply to the market if the LVS growth continues.
The three stated problems simply do not exist. Each of the three points implies that growth is the problem, so where is that growth? Statistics over the last two years for the importation of used vehicles indicate a stability of imports. For the year 2000, there were 16,825 vehicles. In 2001, there were 16,391 vehicles. That is no growth. The lengthy document which was presented in 2001 refers to 50,000 used imported vehicles entering the country in 2002. For the first six months of this year, 10,161 vehicles entered and that is nothing like the projected 50,000 vehicles. These numbers are also distorted because there was a rush for plates before the cancelling of the licences on 7 May. In fact, the figures for April and May this year have doubled the monthly averages, but that is due to people having to rush in to get these licences or plates before the licences cease to exist. 
With regard to the first dot point, surely the objectives of the MVSA are to provide uniformity of safety of vehicles to the Australian consumer. Where is the evidence that these vehicles do not adhere to the same safety requirements of full volume imports? What is the plan for passenger motor vehicles? According to a joint media release on 8 May 2002 from the National Party leader, Mr John Anderson, and Senator Minchin:
The Government has been keen to provide a framework whereby the automotive industry has confidence to invest.
Yet we have numerous media releases from the former Minister for Industry, Science and Resources stating that there is very strong growth, increased sales and expanding exports of Australian produced motor vehicles. Doesn't this indicate good reason for investment? Senator Forshaw from the ALP in New South Wales said that he `was not entirely convinced about the threat to Australian car makers if the scheme continued unchecked'. How can 16,800 used vehicles, with a model age of between seven and nine years, affect 808,685 new car sales?
The third dot point in the explanatory memorandum to the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 2001 is totally incorrect. We have already dismissed the stated sky-is-the-limit growth and there is no argument regarding horizontal inequities. I believe this is related to the supply of evidence and testing. Which vehicles imported new into Australia in full volume have testing conducted in Australia?
If all three dot points in the statement of problems are incorrect or misleading, is there a problem at all? If not, why were the amendments to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 and these regulations introduced in the first place? How can such misleading statements, even within the document called the explanatory memorandum relating to the tabling of the bill, be accepted? Members of parliament from all sides have allowed a bill to be enacted on a possibly false premise. These regulations do not do what was promised. They strangle a small but viable Australian small business industry, putting thousands of people out of work. 
The small business side of this debate has been cloaked in secrecy. I refer to a heated debate in the coalition party room as reported in the press, which led to a separate inquiry and a report by the small business section of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The report was to evaluate the effects that these regulations would have on small business. We will never know what was in the report as it is now classified cabinet-in-confidence. We can only assume that, as the cabinet buried the report, it confirmed that the small business sector are being forced out of business to allow the multinationals to control the used as well as the new vehicle industry. In that case, it would also confirm that possibly two senior cabinet ministers have misled cabinet in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. If this is the case, a very serious breach—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The One Nation senator has been critical and said that ministers in both the lower house and the upper house misled parliament. That is not correct under standing orders and I would ask you to ask the senator to withdraw those allegations. Misrepresentation is very serious.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Harris, that is unparliamentary and I am sure you are standing up there to withdraw that comment with respect to misleading parliament.
—On Senator Boswell's point of order, my statement was: in that case it could also confirm that possibly—
—This is not a point of order, Senator Harris.
—I am speaking to Senator Boswell's point of order.
—Are you seeking leave to make an explanation? 
—I seek leave to make an explanation.
Leave granted.
—I clearly said that it was possible that two senior ministers may have misled cabinet, the House and the Senate. I did not say that they had. I clearly said it was possible that they had. That is my explanation.
—If you said in your initial contribution that it was possible that they may have misled parliament, then I assume that is not unparliamentary and you should proceed. But no doubt we will check Hansard as to what is correct with regard to those statements.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think with absolute surety that you will find that it was `possible'. In continuing, there have been two reports by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. The first report recommended drastic changes to the regulation. After repeated representations to the minister for transport there does not seem to be much difference. The important sections, which have given these people a decent livelihood, have not been changed. Having read the most recent report, I must say I was very disappointed with its inaccuracies. I will only address the inaccuracies and the statements in chapter 4 of the report. They are as follows:
(a) Contrary to the government's claims, the increase in used vehicles is less than the growth in new car sales.
(b) There is no threat to the Full Volume industry, used imports are not viable until they are around 7 years old. Misinformation has been supplied to lead people to believe that most used imports are new or nearly new.
(c) The intent of the low volume scheme has always been “to make available vehicles not sold under full volume”. The Specialist and Enthusiast idea came in 1995 for passenger cars only to “protect the Australian industry”. To carry it over all vehicle types is an about face of the original intent.
(d) When the LVS was being developed it was recognised very few diesels were available to the motorist so the eligibility criteria was changed to allow “diesel engines to be classified as a new model if no diesel engine variant is available in Australia”. It was not lax administration as claimed by the FCAI and Toyota. It was one of the set objectives of the scheme.
You only have to be in a rural area to realise that there is a substantive difference between a vehicle that is propelled by petrol and one that has a diesel motor, not only in the vehicle itself but also in where and how you can travel with them in relation to getting fuel for the vehicle. It goes on:
(e) Regarding concerns about safety, even the Task Force stated that there was not a safety issue.
So they are the inaccuracies that have come through.
What are the emerging problems? One problem was that the FCAI kept lobbying to shut down the industry and the government listened to them and not to small businesses. The other problem was that the Department of Transport and Regional Services refused to allow the industry to introduce accredited workshops at one-third of the cost of the Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme. This would have cleaned up the industry with a more effective scheme for the benefit of all. With the banning of the family car in 1995, the numbers were capped at around 15,000 to 18,000 vehicles. The FCAI know this is their last chance to close the industry, as they have lost the battle in all other countries. Even England and North America now allow imported used vehicles. SEVS was put to the government by the Chief Engineer of the FCAI to close small businesses in the industry. While SEVS and RAWS remain, that will be the outcome.
The committee was right: thousands of jobs will be lost, families will break up and some will even lose their homes. As you would know, most small businesses mortgage their homes as finance or security for their businesses, as banks want bricks and mortar as security. The only thing that will stop this is a motion of disallowance enabling a fresh start. I think the MTAA made it quite clear where they stand when, in their submission to the task force, they called for each compliance plate approval holder to import only one vehicle per year as opposed to 25 vehicles per year. The scheme originally was for new cars only and was introduced as certification costs would deprive the Australian public of the full range of vehicles which they would normally expect to be available. Those regulations are going to have exactly the opposite effect, in contrast to the original intent of the Low Volume Scheme. By the time the government reviews the criteria, jobs will be lost, businesses closed, homes lost and families destroyed. Action is needed now and we do not need another whitewash. 
In consultation with the department of transport, the low volume industry developed an industry accredited workshop scheme. Yet with a change of staff in 1999, it was no longer acceptable and the RAWS developed at three times the cost to industry. If the government's objectives are to `ensure that only safe vehicles are supplied to the consumer within an appropriate regulatory environment', then fundamental amendments are required as the present scheme will ensure there will be very few vehicles available to the consumer and they will be no safer than the current vehicles. As the fundamental purpose of the SEVS, as submitted by the FCAI, was to close the small business participation in the used vehicle industry, the recommendations of the committee will have little or no effect on the final outcomes. The outcomes will be the closure or near closure of the industry with thousands of jobs lost, allowing the multinationals to control both the new and used vehicle industry. What it comes down to is this: the government has gone against the recommendations of the MVSA task force and has gone against its stated policy on free trade as espoused by the Prime Minister on his overseas trips to the USA and Europe. The government has gone against many of its own backbenchers and sacrificed many Australian jobs, all to keep big business and the multinationals onside.
In my right of reply I will highlight some further issues and inaccuracies including a most concerning issue relating to not only the possible but the probable closure of the Australian side of this industry and these Australian jobs being exported to New Zealand. I have several documents that I have been obtaining over the last two days directly from New Zealand that show extreme inconsistencies in the information that is actually being provided not only to the members of this chamber but also to the minister. The information is totally inconsistent with the actual statistics that are being put out by the New Zealand export sector of the car industry.",SENATE,<title>MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-08-20,"—Labor will not be supporting the motion to disallow the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 1). The opposition is aware of the concerns that remain in parts of the industry, including those who exercised their right to demonstrate at the One Nation rally in Canberra yesterday. I did not see that but I believe there was an organised demonstration. If this motion did succeed, the new scheme in total would just fall over. This would totally undermine the intent of the legislation that was passed in this chamber on 27 September 2001 and came into effect in April this year. In short, this necessary scheme that is designed to regulate the importation of second-hand vehicles would simply fall apart. In my view, it is not open to this chamber or to the other House to amend regulations, so this disallowance motion, if successful, would knock over the whole process and the scheme that is largely in operation.
That has actually been the objective of some of the industry, and that is not Labor's position. We in the opposition laid out our reasons for supporting the reform of this industry when the bill passed through this place last year. The opposition will not support a rearguard action by some in the industry and in the One Nation Party to undermine that reform and undo the changes that are in place. The rhetoric about Labor's motives and the allegations and comments made by Senator Harris today—that we are beholden to a different part of the industry—are unfounded and are, quite frankly, typical of One Nation's hysterical approach to policy.
I would also say for the record that the level of residual dissatisfaction with those reforms is minuscule. In my case—and I was on the committee that looked at the industry and inquired into it—I have had one inquiry, and I am advised by the shadow minister that he has had fewer than 10 letters from the campaign supported by One Nation to disallow these regulations. In my view, that in itself is testimony that the reforms are not as devastating to the industry as the scaremongers and doomsayers would have us all believe. Those who have ideas and suggestions on how to improve the operation of the new regulatory regime for imported second-hand vehicles must work now with the administration of the scheme and put constructive suggestions forward. The opposition does not believe that an ISO regulatory regime alone is enough. That position is not accepted. Similarly, the opposition is satisfied that the appropriate review panels and mechanisms are in place to ensure that aggrieved parties have redress. To date the mechanisms have not been tested, although the scheme has been in place for some time. Over time the rigour and effectiveness of those mechanisms will become clear, but at this point the opposition is not moved to adopt that concern and is not moved to support the motion by One Nation.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-08-20,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats and as a Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee member to support the motion to disallow the regulations introduced in December last year relating to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. I want to make a number of comments in relation to that. I was certainly on the same committee as Senator Buckland and, from an evidence point of view, there was no clear delineation one way or the other that what was being put forward established without doubt that the original intent of specialist and enthusiast vehicles had been satisfied or that what we were seeing coming out of the process was in the best interests of this particular sector within the automotive industry of this country.
I think that the introduction of the regulations last year was, to put it mildly, not the best day for a group of small business owners in a number of places in Australia but, more particularly, in regional areas within Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. What I fear—and this is something that perhaps the government needs to take on board and to consider, given that no evidence was brought forward one way or the other— are the likely consequences in relation to the loss of jobs and the loss of small businesses, and whether, in fact, there will be a shift of jobs, as Senator Harris says, in relation to offshore places, particularly New Zealand. I think the crucial issue is about diversity in the automotive industry in this country and the loss of choice for road users in this country. The crucial thing in thinking about this particular issue is that, despite the fact that we are talking about one committee, we need to keep in mind that there were two reports prior to that—one from a government committee and the other from an interdepartmental task force—and all of them have raised exactly the same issues.
It is not a question of parties picking up particular issues that suit their ends. These issues have been on the table for quite some time and they have certainly been brought to the attention of the government. The government, of course, has chosen a different option to the ones recommended by departmental officers and ones recommended by the government's own committee that looked at the issues some years ago. I refer to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—the government committee—where they had said, in relation to the new regulations being offered, that they had concerns that the impact of the Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme and the specialist and enthusiast vehicles scheme in their current form will ensure the demise of an entire sector of the industry, with the potential for some thousands of job losses. I think the government needs to keep that in mind. It is the government's own committee that stated that the new regulations will have disastrous effects on employment within the industry, yet it fails to take any action, particular in terms of looking at the impact of the regulations. It is not a question of the Australian Democrats or the One Nation Party defending themselves; it is a question of the government addressing possible consequences and issues that need to be resolved. Certainly, the regulations do not go anywhere near what needs to be satisfied. 
It is also interesting to note that the committee recognised that it was inappropriate for the government, through the department of vehicle safety standards, to pursue what appeared to be broader industry policy through the use of safety standards themselves. It seems to me that, if you want to fix the industry, do not look at regulations and safety standards as the means of trying to bring about that change. Deal with it head-on. That is the only advice I can offer. Something that has been put forward is the Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme requiring ISO9000 accreditation to obtain registration. It seems to me that the Australian Democrats are the first to recognise the benefits of the series of accreditation in this case in respect of procedural quality, but it seems that effective accreditation requires the implementation of the appropriate standard development systems for the end product. I think we also have to say that, at the same time, it must not be abused as a tool to complicate and provide further unnecessary paperwork, and nor should it be the vehicle to drive an alternative policy agenda, which appears to be the case.
The proposal that has been put forward through the alteration of the regulations for low-volume vehicle importers is disjointed and, in parts, impractical and unnecessary. A part of the new regulation is the requirement for imported vehicles, normally six to eight years of age, to meet new car standards. This applies to car lighting especially. Ordinary resellers of motor vehicles are not required to meet such stringent, and I believe excessive, rules. And, while we are not about to support a compromise on the safety of vehicles used on Australian roads, the Democrats believe that standards should be applied equally across an entire industry, not to certain parts of it in an ad hoc way. Certainly, that has been shown in this case. If the requirement is that imported used vehicles must pass some new standard test, then that test must apply to all used vehicles. Alternatively, a base standard could be set up, which all vehicles on the road must pass.
If the department were serious about this issue, particularly on safety standards, then there would be agreements with other countries on what are acceptable levels and there would also be a set of standards to apply to all vehicles on Australian roads. These regulations appear to simply protect the interests of other industry players in this country at the expense of small operators. I do not see a conflict here in not having the space to cater for Low Volume Scheme importers. It is, in my view, a spurious claim to say that it is about one or the other, when the evidence certainly does not justify that. It is difficult to see the negative effects on the original equipment manufacturers from the activity of this sector—the evidence simply is not there. When you consider what is there, the small- or low-volume importers represent a fraction of the number of vehicles that are sold in the Australian market each year, and they are generally vehicles that are sold when they are six to eight years of age.
Having said all that, we are not blind to the fact that there needs to be reform in the industry. There will always be those out there who are not doing the right thing. We accept that without question. Consequently, we think it would have been more appropriate for the government—as it has done in the case of the automotive industry, the petroleum industry, and so on—to suggest the establishment of an industry code for the motor vehicle industry regarding vehicle imports. Such a code would see the development of an industry accreditation body, which would write the safety and conversion requirements for imported vehicles and would also administer education and qualification attainment for workers and owners within the industry. It seems to me that this body alone would include representatives from the industry, the department and the industry's peak body. This issue has seen two Senate inquiries and an independent task force report, which have all returned recommendations on the need for reform in the industry as a whole, but not in the highly restrictive manner that is being proposed by this government. The only question that remains after having considered that is the question of space in the market. There is room within the Australian car market to sustain both a viable new car sector and a viable used car sector. 
—Who said that? Where did you get the evidence of that from?
—Certainly, from the evidence that has been put forward, those are the conclusions that can be drawn. In my view, consumers should be offered the largest practical choice and the government should take the needs of small business into consideration when determining policy for the country on this particular issue. Whilst I recognise the numbers at the end of the day on this particular issue, we do support the motion to disallow the regulations. We believe that there were better ways to go about this. We think that, given the number of reports that have been put forward—particularly by departments, departmental officers and the relevant committees—the evidence simply is not there to justify this move. In saying that, and recognising again the numbers, I have to say that whilst we support the motion to disallow we will not be supporting the call for a division.",SENATE,<title>MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-08-20,"—I think we had better cut to the chase on this. I am absolutely surprised by both Senator Harris and Senator Ridgeway, because they belong to parties that continually call for tariff protection. Senator Harris's leader wanted to build a tariff fence right around Australia and said it would provide more jobs. Here we have a situation in Japan where, at the end of four years of a car's life, it becomes more expensive to register that car than to buy a new car. The price of a Japanese car is lowered by artificial means, in other words. If the government said, `We are bringing in a Japanese car, and we are going to subsidise that car by $4,000,' there would be screams and shouts. Senator Ridgeway would be crying foul and so would the One Nation senator. But that is exactly what is happening here. At the end of four years, the car is worthless because it is cheaper to go and buy a new car. So they can throw it in the dump, they can turn it into scrap metal or they can pull the tyres off it— but they cannot put it on the road. Senator Harris wants good old Australia to take the dumped cars from Japan and make them compete against our car industry. That is what it is all about. You did not say one word about that. I do not know whether whoever wrote that speech understood it, but you certainly did not understand it.
We have a great car industry. Ten years ago, this car industry exported one car—and I think that car happened to belong to one of the embassies. We exported one Commodore. Now our car industry exports are $5 billion. They want them in the Middle East; they want them everywhere. We did not get there by wrecking the car industry. I remember we had a vote about this five or six years ago. I was on the other side of that debate at that time and, quite frankly, I was embarrassed to be there. Finally, I am on the right side in this debate.
Senator Harris says, `They weren't doing any harm; there wasn't any increase.' Senator Harris, in 1995, 1,700 cars came in; in 1996, 2,873; and, in 1999, 13,741. Then the panic button was pushed, and 16,410 cars came in. I understand that you will not understand this, Senator Harris, but I would have thought that Senator Ridgeway would have understood it. Those cars have to be sold on the market. Say you go in with your 1999 Holden and you want to buy a 2003 Holden. The dealer who sells you the car sets a trade-in. That trade-in then has to compete with these imports.
—What about support for competition?
—I am all for choice, but you do not import injury. You do not import subsidies. That is why we have anti-dumping laws, and your party is all for it. The other thing that surprises me about the Democrats is that all this industry—or 90 per cent of this industry—is in your leader's electorate. Ninety per cent of this huge, terrific car industry is in your leader's electorate.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Did you mean my leader's electorate, Senator Boswell? Or did you mean that of Senator Ridgeway's leader? 
—It was in the electorate of Senator Ridgeway's leader. By gee! If you think you are on three per cent today, just wait until tomorrow. You will be grovelling down at the bottom end of the market. Senator Ridgeway has always appeared to me to be a very intelligent sort of person. How he ever got sucked into this one I will never understand!
But let us talk about small business. Yes, there are 48,000 employers in the manufacturing industry. That is big business; that is the big end of town. I have had to take them on over their dangerous advertisements, and we got them to a position that I think is reasonable. But let us talk about the little dealer in Mareeba. He has a showroom. Probably he and his wife own it. He has a couple of mechanics and a couple of salesmen. He is a small business person. You are going to knock him out of the game. You are going to knock the used car dealers out, as well as automotive employment through the Holden franchisee or the Ford franchisee. There are thousands of them in country towns around Australia. They underpin the prosperity of those towns. They are the first people to put in a couple of hundred bucks for the local race meeting or for whatever is going around the village. They support it; they are part of the town—and those are the people you are going to affect.
Do not come in here crying crocodile tears for small business, because it is the small business people who run all these franchises around rural Australia. They trade a 1985 Holden for a 2002 Holden, and then they have to sell the trade-in against a Japanese car which has been imported because it has absolutely no value in Japan—you could turn it into scrap metal. They are selling a trade-in against a dumped car, and they cannot get the margin. What do they do? If they were smart, they would start importing cars too. You would have your franchisees importing second-hand cars. If that happened, we would not have a car industry. We would have a car industry like they have in New Zealand—a screwdriver industry. They do not manufacture cars in New Zealand. They do not have a car industry in New Zealand. If you do not want a car industry in South Australia, support the disallowance motion, because that is what you are going to end up with.
I have agonised over this. I have taken a lot of weight on this. I get no joy when people come to me and say, `My business is in jeopardy.' I understand that. I have tried to be honest with them. I have tried to be sympathetic with them. But, in the end, you have to hurt someone. Either you are going to hurt these importers or you are going to hurt the little franchisee at Mareeba, Roma or any of those places. We can dillydally around with the figures and do all these sorts of things but, in the end, it amounts to importing injury to the car industry—and it is a car industry that, quite frankly, I think we all should be proud of. We took the tariffs off the industry and told it to compete, and it did. I think the cars that we drive at the moment—I have a Commodore—are equal to anything in the world. They have certainly improved. 
The workers—apart from a few odd, stray people who do not play the game in the parts industry—have met their obligations. They have pulled their socks up and met the competition, and you guys want to pull the rug out from under them. I cannot understand you, Senator Ridgeway. I cannot understand it. If it were a matter of competition against the Japanese, I would say that there is no problem—that is competition. But you want to import a car that has been devalued to zero to compete with Australian manufacturers. This is totally opposed to anything the Democrats have ever said. I suggest the Democrats get Senator Andrew Murray back and they might get a bit of intellectual capacity back. I know he is on strike on the backbench, but get him back and get him to raise these issues in the party room and he will explain them to you.
We have a choice. We can have an imported car industry and have 6,000 people employed, but gradually it will whittle our car industry down because our automotive franchisees will not be able to compete. They will then have to bring in these dumped cars, and so it will grow. New Zealand had a car industry. It has not got one anymore. We actually export a lot of cars to New Zealand and overseas. We brought in a scheme and told people that they could bring in 25 cars. Then they registered mum and the kids and had multiple companies, and the cars just flooded in. They went around the system. That is fair enough. We tightened the system. They went around the system. We tightened it until we could not tighten it any more and we had to get away from it. But every company in Australia just cannot go out and do what they want. I am sympathetic towards them. I have had them in my office. I am sorry for them. But when you are in government you have to take the position that is going to inflict the least hurt on the most people. That is what we have done, because there are 48,000 people employed in the manufacturing industry and 50,000 people employed in small business. Weigh that up against the 6,000 people involved in this, and you would make the same decision. It hurts the other side; I concede that. But why put an industry at risk? I hope that your disallowance motion does not get up.  
You have spoken to me about imports from New Zealand. I have made inquiries on that. To the best of my knowledge, 300 cars a year come in from New Zealand. They are brought in by people immigrating to Australia and bringing their car with them. Of course, you can bring in SEVS under the new regime we have put in. If they are specialised, vintage or muscle cars—cars that are not manufactured in Australia—people can bring in up to 25 of them. We have kept out any cars that compete and are manufactured in Australia or are imported from Japan, because they are dumped. We have done that in order to protect this great industry and to protect the employment of all the small business people, not only in the cities—and there are many there—but all over Australia. There are very few small towns or regional centres that have not got a Toyota dealership, a Holden dealership or some type of dealership. You are putting all that at risk.
I hope that with the few words that I have given you, Senator Ridgeway, you will have a conversion: the scales will fall from your eyes and you will not support the motion. Senator Harris, you are certainly on the wrong track on this, like most things One Nation get on. They fall into conspiracy theories, listen to rubbish and nonsense—it has happened—and you bring it down here and import it. But when you are down here, you are not talking to just any people; you are talking to people who have a few ideas and who can go and research what you are saying. You cannot peddle nonsense down here, because you are tested. You are tested in the Senate, you are tested by senators having access to information and you are tested by various things such as debate. How can you get up and say that you are not putting the automotive industry at risk? You are and you know you are, but you are doing it because a few people have wound you up. People do that but sometimes you just have to walk away and say, `No, that is not right.' The government will not be supporting this disallowance motion, the Labor Party will not be supporting this disallowance motion and I hope no-one else in the Senate will, other than Senator Harris.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-08-20,"—I rise in my right of reply to the debate relating to my motion of disallowance. The motion of disallowance is not about exports and it is most certainly not about wrecking the Australian automotive industry. The regulations pertaining to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 2001 have caused severe hardships for hundreds of people. There were previously around 1,500 compliance plate approved holders but today only 11 businesses have applied for registered automotive workshop approvals, a take-up of less than one per cent. I just want to emphasise that to the chamber. Prior to this regulation coming in, there were approximately 1,500 approved holders. When this regulation is finally decided today, if it is not disallowed, there will be 11 approved holders. We have to look at those numbers. The government has said that some of these people have been rorting the system, and I am not in any way, shape or form purporting to support them. The government has also said that the information we base our arguments on has no substance. I will return to that issue at a later date.
The regulations place excessive limits on the type, make and model of used motor vehicles that low volume industry is allowed to import. Requirements to operate under the new scheme involve expensive workshop set-ups, excessive government charges and a tangle of bureaucratic red tape. Because the regulation at its implementation and printing has effect at law, it is already working out there in the industry. It has caused marriage break-ups. This is not One Nation being wound up; this is the reality. It has caused undue financial hardships imposed by the regulations. Businesses have been affected without compensation. These people had a licence to import a certain number of vehicles and these regulations remove that right without any compensation whatsoever. One Queensland businessman has agreed to my using his own personal case as an example. He has lost more than $100,000 in his compliance equipment and parts and he is now searching for a job. He will not recoup the money that he has used to mortgage his house and could ultimately lose his home— all as a result of these regulations.
Another business owner has vehicles which were actually in the country under his actual import licences before the regulations came into force. The Department of Transport has refused to plate those vehicles due to unrealistic deadlines. A compliance plate approval holder has approval for American vehicles for which production stopped in 1989. Many of his clients in Queensland have imported vehicles but cannot yet afford to have them converted and complied. These people will lose their vehicles because it is not worth his while to enter into this new system when the vehicles will not require compliance after 2004. Some people have been instructed to actually export the vehicles that they have legally brought into this country. They have been told to completely dismantle them or destroy the vehicles. If this occurs, the owners will lose up to $30,000 and this is totally unacceptable. 
There are numerous other examples of how these regulations are harming the industry. There are many myths surrounding the industry and perhaps the biggest myth is that of spare parts. Let me put some real facts on the record. Full volume vehicles— that is those that are imported and sold on the market in Australia and also those that are manufactured in Australia—also have problems with spare parts. One shop repairer took three months to source a driver's door for a Subaru vehicle, which is a full volume saleable vehicle in Australia. We have a low volume importer who has previously imported Chevrolets who can access, out of Hawaii, parts for those vehicles faster than a dealer in Queensland can access parts from Adelaide. Low volume vehicles are being serviced by mainstream dealers, and one Toyota dealer sponsored the low volume industry's national conference. Nissan have put out a circular stating that they will supply any part for imported used vehicles. Toyota dealers are making good profits by supplying parts for these low volume vehicles. Owners are happy with them because they offer good value for money.
Senator Ridgeway raised an important issue relating to the difference in criteria that is being imposed upon people who import these low volume used vehicles, in that, if a person in Australia has on their lot a vehicle that is of the same age, they are not required to go through the criteria that one of these low volume importers is required to go through to put another vehicle of a comparable age on the market. That is a very important issue. Senator Boswell, in his opening comments, spoke about putting real issues in place. He spoke of my home town of Mareeba. I find it very interesting that I personally know both of the dealers in Mareeba and in the three years that I have been in this chamber neither of them have ever raised the issue that these low volume imports are a problem or any source of problem to them either selling their new vehicles or selling their used vehicles.
I would like to refer to some statistics. In an answer to a question that I put to the Hon. Chris Ellison, he has kindly provided me with some statistics based on motor vehicle imports by port of loading for the period January to June 2002. The report contains substantial inconsistencies. It states that 288 motor vehicles were imported from the port of Auckland into Australia in the period January to June 2002. However, a little further into the document we find that the entire number of vehicles accredited to New Zealand for the same period is 42. This document is either extremely flawed or the department is having extreme difficulty keeping in touch with the volume of vehicles coming from New Zealand. 
That document is freely available to any senator who wishes to check it out. I now want to refer to a document from New Zealand. For the year ending in July 2001, the document shows that 1,556 vehicles came into Australia from New Zealand and these are purported to be personal imports. To comply with being a personal import, the person has to have owned that vehicle in New Zealand for 12 months, so it cannot be a new vehicle. In addition, that person can only bring over one vehicle for themselves.
I would like to draw Senator Boswell's attention to a few issues. In February 2002, in one instance 11 vehicles were imported into Brisbane. At another undefined port of arrival, 17 vehicles were imported in one instance. In two instances there, 28 vehicles were imported but under the regulations only a single import is permitted if they come in under personal imports. Four vehicles were imported into Melbourne in February 2002. The description of a designated vehicle refers to the vehicle's spark ignition, internal combustion, reciprocal piston engined cylinder capacity exceeding 1,500 cubic capacity but not exceeding 3,000 cubic capacity—a new motor car assembled. So in Melbourne in February 2002, four new vehicles came in under what is supposed to be a personal import. 
In January, 14 used vehicles in one group, 10 in another group and 17 in another group were brought into Sydney and Brisbane. In February 2002, a total of 212 vehicles were brought into Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney under personal imports. In March 2002, another six brand new vehicles were brought into Melbourne and two other undefined ports. My concern is that either the department is unaware that these vehicles are coming in—so are they illegal?—or there is another way of bringing vehicles in from New Zealand about which we are unaware at this point in time.
Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services a question on 5 March 2001. For clarification, the reference is to imports that were available to the low volume industry, so the figures I am going to quote now are through the Low Volume Scheme. According to the minister's answer, 302 Toyota CXR series units and 1,322 Toyota Soarers were imported in 2000. For Toyota Supras—
—What year is this?
—In the year 2000. There were 338 Supras and 3,483 Toyota Surfs. If you add those up, 5,445 units were brought into Australia under the low volume system and they are all Toyotas. If Toyota were to make an economic decision for those vehicles to be no longer available to the low volume Australian importers, and Toyota then decided to put those units through its defunct assembly line in New Zealand, is that how we have this anomaly between what the department is telling the chamber has come in and what New Zealand are saying they have exported? As I have clearly said from day one, this is my real concern. In respect of the regulation before us, the low volume industry has clearly said that the industry needs to be restructured. Until 1999, it worked with the department to achieve that. All of a sudden, there was a change in direction by the department and we have a totally different outcome in these regulations.
As all the honourable senators know, we only have two choices in this chamber with a regulation and they are to disallow it or to agree to it. I wish to disallow this regulation because it will and has perpetrated undue hardship on the existing low volume importers. This is a wake-up call for the government to get their act together, because if they defeat this disallowance motion and we then find that we have those 5,000-odd units coming back into Australia via New Zealand through Toyota it will be on their heads.
Question negatived.
—I would like the record to note that One Nation was the only party supporting the disallowance motion.
 (Senator Bartlett)—I am sure the record will note your statement, Senator Harris.",SENATE,<title>MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-20,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002. Once again this government is pursuing an industrial relations agenda that seems totally out of step with society. The idea behind this ill-conceived amendment is to amend the Workplace Relations Act to prevent the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from certifying or varying an agreement that contains a provision requiring the payment of a bargaining services fee. But, not content to prevent the Industrial Relations Commission from certifying or varying an agreement that may contain a provision requiring payment of a bargaining services fee, this bill goes on to comprehensively expunge the idea from the industrial relations system.
This is not the deregulated Workplace Relations Act that the coalition brought in in 1996 with so much fanfare. In fact, what it is now beginning to look like is an act that contains many provisions which attempt to ban, discipline, excise or regulate the conduct of unions and their members. It is a far cry from the apparently lofty objectives set out in the original 1996 act by the coalition government. Let me remind the Senate that the object of section 3 under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 was: 
... to provide a framework for cooperative workplace relations ...
It goes on to say:
(b) ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and employees at the workplace or enterprise level ...
But, in relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002, we have a government that is intent on re-regulating everything it finds distasteful or difficult in its eyes—not in society's eyes, not in an industrial relations sense, not with regard to what industrial relations needs or requires, but what it finds objectionable. It is quite wrong. It does not, apparently, refer back to the objects of the act and have a look at what it is supposed to do.
What it is supposed to do is provide a fair framework of industrial relations, to provide a system which allows employees and employers to regulate the conditions of employment by the means that they choose. It goes on to say at (e) in the objects of the Workplace Relations Act that it is about:
... providing a framework of rights and responsibilities for employers and employees ...
This government is intent on mouthing those things but not following through. What it does not want to do is allow a framework. What it wants to do—and it has been doing it for some time, and it seems intent on continuing—is provide quite proscriptive legislation—quite damning legislation when you start to read the full import of it. Not content simply to provide a framework to allow regulation and to allow employees and employers to get on with the business of being in business, the government wants to be able to ensure that all the things that it finds difficult to deal with—whatever troubles it—can be banned, regulated or excised. That seems to be its mantra when it comes to workplace relations.
Rather than letting workplace relations mostly govern itself, it seems to me that the government has abandoned many of the concepts that it set out in its 1996 legislation, given that the 1996 legislation in my view was not particularly fair to begin with. It has decided to intervene at every twist and turn where it has found something difficult, something it could not swallow and could not allow to go on. It is such an interventionist government, yet you hear from the government that it is not an interventionist government and that it does not put itself in the shoes of the fisherman and deal with matters. That is what it says, but in reality that is what it always seems to do.
The government, through Mr Tony Abbott in his second reading speech, has characterised this as trying to stop the bringing about of `Clayton's compulsory unionism'. He believes—perhaps I should really rephrase that—or he at least says that it is in effect a compulsory union levy. Again, this is the strange mantra that this government throws up. It has strawman reasoning as its idol. It brings up something like a compulsory union levy and says, `This is what it's about,' but when you read the title—the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002—you do not see that term mentioned. So the government promotes a myth and then tries to knock it down. There is no point in doing that. If it argued its points cogently and openly, we might be able to have a decent debate about bargaining services fees, rather than the strawman reasoning proposed by Mr Abbott.
In fact, my view is that he has missed the point again anyway. He often reminds me of the boy with the finger in the dike. Industrial relations is a model that is fluid, and you have Mr Abbott running around trying to put his finger in places where the fluid tends to break out. Why? Because he does not like the developments in industrial relations. Industrial relations has been developing ever since people decided to regulate work and in fact go to work and industrial relations will continue to develop notwithstanding Mr Abbott, and it is about time he understood that. It is not a case in point for him to be trying to find outlets and saying, `Look, I don't really like that flow, so I'll put my finger in and try to stop it.' Regardless of the draconian legislation that he brought in in 1996 and the many attempts to amend it to make it even more draconian, Mr Abbott should really go back to the drawing board and have a good look at some of his issues that have floated up and been put forward. He should look at them and have a meaningful discussion with the shadow workplace relations spokesperson and try to move forward, rather than being antagonistic. I think that in truth he really misunderstands industrial relations. It is not really my place to say so, but perhaps I can suggest that it is really primarily about people's behaviour at and in work. That is where Mr Abbott really fundamentally misunderstands the whole idea of industrial relations. He sees it as a contest. It is not a contest; it is about people's work and life. Mr Abbott comments in his second reading speech: 
... members opposite claim that these compulsory union fees are in fact some kind of an industrial version of the fee for service principle.
Mr Abbott then descends to using a strange analogy about someone painting his house and later demanding a fee for the service. Whatever you want to make of the analogy, it seems Mr Abbott is either ignorant of industrial relations practices throughout the world or misinformed about the systems of industrial relations practised in many Western democracies. It seems to me that he draws a false analogy. It is not the appropriate analogy to draw, because in the analogy he described—where the painter painted his house without consultation—he left out consultation. In industrial relations to make a certified agreement—as Mr Abbott knows— there has to be consultation with the employer, the unions and the employees. That is the process, and he understands that better than most, I suspect. But he does not argue it, and that is the point I make. He does not want to argue from the facts of the case. He wants to argue from what he thinks the facts should be.
If he truly objects to a clause about compulsory union levies, then he should talk about it. But we are not even talking about that—that is long gone. That has long been a matter that has not been on the statute books. What we are talking about is a bargaining fee for service, but he does not want to argue about that, because he knows that union security clauses, the Rand clauses in Canada and the concept of bargaining service fees have been around for a very long time. Western democracies have picked them up, and they exist right across the Western world. But Mr Abbott does not want to talk about the principle and does not want to discuss how those things should be progressed. He simply wants to argue about a painter painting his house, which is really quite extraordinary in the sense that in any event it was probably a contractor and not an employee doing the painting, but we do not really need to go to that point. The point I am trying to make is that, if he wants to look at the way forward in industrial relations, he should really start from torts. He should start from the basis of understanding industrial relations concepts and then trying to progress his arguments legitimately without strawman reasoning and without fake analogies.
The free-rider concept has been picked up in the US and in Canada, and it basically allows for a fee-for-service arrangement. Mr Abbott touched on this himself but is far from ensuring that the industrial relations system has balance—in other words, far from ensuring that there is balance in the industrial relations system which provides for fair bargaining, good faith bargaining. Perhaps Mr Abbott could also have a look at that concept—one that he does not seem to agree with. If he looked at good faith bargaining himself, he might be able to at least come to the table and start talking about the truth of the concepts themselves—in other words, talk about the issues of free-rider and bargaining services fees rather than the spurious arguments that he puts up.
His agenda seems to create a lopsided system which favours employers to the detriment of workers. That appears to be his aim, but he does not want to state that either. Perhaps he should, if that is his purpose. What may be relevant is whether the principles of freedom of association are trammelled in the issue of the bargaining services fee. Of course, they are not. The Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee had a look at this issue and there seems to be some argument from the Australian Industry Group that the bargaining fee clauses restrict an individual's freedom of choice. The ACCI similarly argue that the bill is necessary for the proper functioning of the act. In short, they believe that there is some restriction on being able to at least argue about the principles of bargaining services fees because they are likely to be viewed as restricting the person's freedom of association rights. Of course, rather than have that argument, Mr Abbott wants to waffle on in another direction. 
Let us come back and look at those sorts of points. We already know that Canada has a bargaining services fee clause called a Rand clause; we already know that America has union security clauses. It has not been argued for many years that they somehow offend freedom of association. We could always have that debate if there were any substance to it, but I do not believe there is. On the other hand, in the report by the Senate that I mentioned earlier, the ACTU agreed that a bargaining fee was consistent with the user-pays concept. Clearly, it does not, in my view, offend the principle of freedom of association. It is distinct from that and quite separate.
In the report, Labor senators took issue with the practice of this government of misnaming bills. They said that this bill is not about compulsory union fees; this bill is about bargaining services fees. In industrial relations, this government always seems intent on misnaming the amendments. This is another example of that. It might want to take a look at truth in advertising and at least put proper names on its bills, because, in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002, we are talking about bargaining services fees; we are not talking about prohibition of compulsory union fees. But I can always hope that the government will at least try to strive for truth in advertising.
The government seem to recklessly adopt the practice of misnaming bills, but, be that as it may, Labor senators also highlighted the premature nature of the bill. It seems to pre-empt a matter that is before the courts. The full court in Electrolux v. Australian Workers Union has now been heard and determined, and a judgment has been issued. I am not aware of whether or not that matter is on appeal to the High Court, but that is not particularly germane to the issue. The government tend to say, `We wish to progress our ideological position in workplace relations, irrespective of what might be currently before the courts.' They then say that bargaining fees in enterprise agreements are being forced on employers without their consent. That is not right. As I said earlier, certified agreements require a consultative process and the agreement of both employers and employees to come to the terms of the arrangement, and it has to be registered with the commission.
The report goes on to make the point that the government's view is plainly wrong about that. It is not possible, the report says, under the present legal framework. It is summed up well on page 39—I will not necessarily take the Senate to that part tonight, but I recommend that it is particularly good to read the Labor senators' minority report, particular paragraph 1.29. It is also worth noting that Senator Murray, who has been a great contributor in this area, also came to the conclusion—I think I can say this without misquoting him—that bargaining fees are an issue that can be debated here and represent a principle worth examining and considering. I am aware that he has also put amendments in the Senate, but I do not need to go to those—they can be dealt with in the committee stage.
I think it is worth saying that it is permissible to hear legislation while matters are before the courts, but it must be when there are demonstrably good reasons. None exist here; none exist for the urgency with which this government seems to pursue some of these things. Be that as it may, certainly in respect of this workplace relations bill, no good reasons have been articulated here which persuade me that there was any urgency about it. The simple concept articulated, as I understand it, by unions for the claim—that is, a bargaining services fee— was supported by the ACTU June conference in 2000. It supported the policy of unions including clauses in certified agreements to require payment by nonmembers who are subject to the agreement. The rationale, as I understand it, was that this decision is a cost recovery for the time and resources expended by unions in negotiating agreements. 
The proposition is that it is appropriate that all workers who benefit from the union negotiated agreement make some contribution to the cost of negotiating and certifying that agreement. The commission should not have its hands tied when dealing with these issues. The commission should be able to examine these issues both at first principle and upon the merits of the particular case. But the government, as I said, has taken a very interventionist approach which is at odds with its stated position.
An interesting article appeared in Workers Online in June 1999 by solicitor David Chin, who argued the case quite cogently for a bargaining services fee. He argued that the simple catchcry that it offends the principles of freedom of association is a familiar refrain used by opponents of all forms of union security or preference clauses. However, this appeal to a universally accepted principle to justify free-riding is, in his words, both superficial and simplistic. He goes on to argue:
Free-riding is not tolerated in the commercial sector ... Similarly, there is no justification for making unions provide industrial services to non-unionists. 
He goes on to say that the right to freedom of association as articulated in the ILO conventions is a distinct and separate matter. He argues:
In the context of an anti-union federal labour law system—
such as the present system—
the problem of non-members free-riding on the industrial gains of unionists very seriously threatens the ability of unions to pursue its aims. If non-members continue to be free to enjoy material gains won by unions without having to contribute in any way, the lack of incentive to join threatens to undermine the bargaining strength of unions. For collective bargaining to work, employees must be confident that enough others will cooperate and join with them in the union to make their contribution in union dues worthwhile.
Therefore, what he effectively says is that it is fair to argue for a bargaining services fee.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2002-08-20,"—I rise to speak in opposition to the so-called Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002. This bill is yet another part of this government's ideological drive to destroy Australia's industrial relations system. This system has delivered over time a minimal amount of industrial conflict between workers, their union representatives and their employers. In doing so, it has contributed immensely to developing a competitive economy that maintains the rights of working men and women.
This government's sole aim since it was elected in 1996 has been to undermine and destroy this system. It has sought to do so in a number of ways. Firstly, it has tried to eliminate the role of the independent umpire in conciliating and arbitrating industrial disputes. Secondly, it has sought to remove trade unions from collectively representing the interests of their members in industrial bargaining. The government claims that this bill prohibits bargaining agent fee clauses from appearing in collective agreements in order to protect the rights of non-union workers, but the real reason this government opposes bargaining agent fee clauses is because they will assist trade unions.
This bill is just another step in the government's campaign to undo Australia's industrial relations system. In recent years, the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has been extended to include making sure collectively negotiated agreements are fair and agreed to within the confines of the law. This bill directly attacks the commission's role in this regard. It undermines the government's own legislation that provides for the commission to approve certified agreements where they are objected to. This government will go to any lengths to destroy trade unions in this country. They will even undermine the provisions and principles that govern their own workplace relations legislation as they do so in this bill. 
This bill is nothing but a knee-jerk reaction based on purely ideological objectives. The inclusion of bargaining fee clauses in certified agreements is consistent with industrial relations law and practice as it has developed in other countries. It is also consistent with international standards. Instead of putting forward a purely ideologically driven, knee-jerk reaction, the government should be encouraging a balanced and objective debate on this issue. They should be looking at it with an eye towards developing a system that fairly regulates and governs bargaining agent fees arrangements. 
This bill is not about prohibiting compulsory union fees as its title would suggest; rather it aims to prohibit the inclusion in certified agreements of clauses allowing bargaining agent fees to be charged to non-union members. Such fees have emerged in other countries as recognised and legitimate features of collective agreements. The legality of their inclusion in collective agreements in Australia is still under consideration by both the industrial commission and the Australian court system, as is their right and proper role. In seeking to disallow such provisions, the government are seeking to second-guess the commission. They are also seeking to second-guess the employers who have agreed to such clauses. But, most appallingly, they are trying to second-guess the workers who have freely and democratically voted for such clauses.
The original version of this bill, as it was presented to the Senate more than a year ago, was contrived in reaction to a series of commission decisions. In 2000 some unions, as is their right under the Workplace Relations Act, began to negotiate for the inclusion of bargaining fee clauses into certified agreements. The Employment Advocate, as is his right under section 298Z of the Workplace Relations Act, then lodged an objection to such clauses in an agreement that had been negotiated in the electrical industry. The Employment Advocate argued that such clauses breached the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. The full bench of the commission rejected this assertion. In another case, in June this year, the full bench of the Federal Court endorsed the inclusion of bargaining agent fee clauses into certified agreements. In other words, once the courts and the commission finally settle this matter, it looks as though the government will be caught out by its own legislation. It should be noted, however, that the government has indicated that it will appeal this decision in the High Court. The whole issue of bargaining agent fees is then still a live issue before the courts.
—Answer your mobile phone!
—It is Bill Kelty! What the government is trying to do with this bill is place arbitrary constraints on its own legislation to fit in with its ideological drive against the involvement and empowerment of trade unions. In doing so, the government is effectively undermining the provisions of its workplace relations legislation that guarantee democratic decision making in the workplace, unhindered bargaining between workers and employers and the independent review of such bargaining. Certified agreements containing bargaining agent fee clauses have not just been agreed to by employers but have also been democratically endorsed by a majority of workers who are bound by such agreements. Where an objection has been raised, the commission has independently decided that such clauses are legally allowable.
Bargaining fee clauses are thus no different from other clauses that can be contained in any certified agreement, such as working hours, pay or leave entitlements. They bind employees, whether those employees like them or not. If those employees believe such clauses are unlawful, they have the right to lodge an objection with the independent umpire. That is exactly the process that has taken place in the case of the various certified agreements that have included bargaining fee clauses. It is wrong then for the government to arbitrarily decide that it will legislate to exclude a certain type of clause regardless of the fact that such clauses have been freely negotiated by workers and their employer, democratically and freely voted on and endorsed by the workers, and independently reviewed and endorsed by the commission and the full bench of the Federal Court. The sole reason the government is putting forward this bill is that bargaining agent fee clauses will strengthen the unions that collectively represent the interests of the workers. 
In many countries, such as the United States and Canada, governments and courts alike have recognised the merits of allowing bargaining agent fee clauses in collective agreements. And why shouldn't they? Trade unions and their members expend significant resources in representing the interests of all workers in negotiating agreements with employers. It is unfair that every worker benefits when a union bargains on their behalf, even though not every worker makes a contribution. This is especially the case when you look at how well workers do when unions bargain on their behalf. 
According to the independent Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training, in 2001 union pay rises averaged 4.6 per cent, compared to only 2.2 per cent for workers on individual contracts. According to the ABS, union members are far more likely than non-union members to be entitled to annual leave, sick leave and long service leave. If an employer and a majority of workers agree, why should not non-union free riders be required to make some sort of contribution to the union that delivers them better wages and conditions? These sorts of practices are not entirely new for Australia. In 1998, the Australian reported that the Borbidge government in Queensland had legislated in favour of several farmers organisations affiliated to the National Farmers Federation to effectively rope farmers into being members in order to trade. The National Party has shown that, when in government in Queensland, it is willing to legislate for some sort of compulsory association requirements for farmers, but when it comes to workers and their unions it takes another tack.
The government has taken part in a great deal of scaremongering surrounding the issue of bargaining agent fees. The minister for workplace relations has, like his predecessor, expended considerable time arguing that such arrangements will result in backdoor closed shops. An examination of how non-union bargaining fee arrangements have developed in countries like the United States and Canada reveals how such arrangements need not result in de facto closed shop arrangements. Instead of reacting to the appearance of bargaining agent fee clauses in collective agreements with a knee-jerk prohibition, these countries have approached the issue rationally, developing a system that protects the freedom of association rights of non-union members. In the United States, bargaining fee clauses were first allowed under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act 1947. Since that time, in a series of Supreme Court cases, the regime governing so-called agency shop agreements has developed significantly. Similarly, Canada has a detailed regime governing such agreements. The so-called Rand formula has developed from a court decision in 1946. South Africa has a legislative regime dealing with such agreements, as contained in the South African Labour Relations Act 1995. These nations have sat down and developed sound guidelines or allowed the courts to develop the parameters for bargaining agent fee arrangements.
The governments and courts of the United States, Canada, South Africa and the other nations of the world that allow such arrangements have decided that they are fair. They rightly agree with the principle that all workers should make some sort of financial contribution towards the union that delivers them better pay and conditions. They have then either set up a legislative regime to govern bargaining agent fee arrangements or allowed independent umpires to define their parameters. With most governments approaching the issue in such a rational and constructive manner, it is little wonder that the International Labour Organisation has decreed that bargaining agent fees do not breach the principle of freedom of association. The government should be taking a similarly rational approach. If workers and employers want to insert bargaining fee clauses into democratically endorsed agreements and the government has concerns about the abuses of such clauses, then it should conduct a sensible debate about such clauses, rather than a knee-jerk prohibition, and allow the courts and the commission to develop reasonable and lawful guidelines and parameters—especially considering the fact that this matter is still a live issue before the courts. 
Labor are committed to such an approach. Unlike the government, Labor respect the right of workers and their unions to freely bargain with their employers. Labor support the right of unions to levy some sort of bargaining fee for the improved wages and conditions they deliver to non-union members in negotiating collective agreements on their behalf. We support that right if it has been democratically endorsed by a free vote of the majority of workers. We also support the right of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to review agreements that allow such fees to be levied. Labor respect the commission's right to arbitrate in such cases, in line with its overall role as an independent umpire in industrial disputes, agreements and disagreements. 
If there are fears that bargaining fees could be abused, those fears should be expressed during a rational and sensible debate and not result in a blanket prohibition. This government's reaction to this development in worker-employer relations should not be directed by a knee-jerk reaction driven by an ideological opposition to workers being represented collectively by trade unions. We believe Australia should be following international developments in this area and allowing bargaining fee clauses, as do numerous countries such as the United States, Canada and South Africa. 
Finally, we should also allow the courts to develop their own response to these developments, as this is still a live legal issue before them. Australia's government should respond with reason and sensibility to developments like this in the field of industrial relations. It should encourage a free and open debate and respect the principles contained in its own legislation, especially principles relating to the right of workers to collectively bargain with their employers with a minimum level of hindrance. This bill exposes the government for what it really is: a government whose only agenda is to destroy the right of workers to be collectively represented in their workplace by trade unions. It should be opposed.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-08-20,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002. In doing so, I particularly want to congratulate preceding speakers, Senators Hutchins and Ludwig, on their excellent contributions to this debate. Both Senator Hutchins and Senator Ludwig have made specific reference to the fact that, through this legislation, this government is trying to outlaw a practice which is recognised in many other countries in the world as legal, a matter for employees and employee organisations to negotiate and enter into agreements about. 
Further, as has already been pointed out, this legislation comes about because this government did not achieve all of its objectives when it introduced on earlier occasions its various pieces of legislation and amending legislation with respect to workplace relations. I will come back to that point in a moment. This government is attempting to legislate to prohibit an activity which courts in this country, both the Industrial Relations Commission and the Federal Court, have recognised as a procedure open to employees, employee organisations and employers to legitimately engage in. It is recognised as a legal procedure for trade unions and employee organisations to enter into agreements with employers for the payment of bargaining service fees and to enter into agreements with employees for that purpose as well. 
This would otherwise be referred to by the conservatives in this country as fees for service or user-pays, something that is not only encouraged but supported through legislation at many levels of governments across this nation. It is an integral part of the philosophy of the Liberal Party and the National Party in this country to require user-pay systems, to require that persons who enjoy or access services and benefits provide some payment for those services. If you look at what has occurred right across the country—in many cases under conservative governments, whether it be at state, federal or local government level—you will have seen over recent years an increasing move towards user-pays. To see this, you only have to go to local government areas. In years gone by, many services provided by local authorities were free to the public, to the members of that community. The members of that community paid their rates to the councils and in return were able to access services. But today we find lots of services that community groups and individual members of the community have to pay for.  
I could go on at length about that but that is not the subject matter of this bill, although it is at the heart of the debate about what principles should apply here. On the one hand, the government constantly says that people who want to access services and receive the benefits of services should pay their fair share and pay the appropriate fee for such a service. On the other hand, when it comes to bargaining fees for trade union services, the government takes the completely opposite view. In fact, it introduced legislation into this parliament to effectively outlaw that practice, that legal right, and endeavoured to further prevent trade unions from carrying out their legitimate and legal activities.
Why does the government do that? We all know why it does that. It is because, as we constantly hear in the rhetoric from the government benches—whether in speeches, in interjections, or in newspaper articles written by Minister Abbott or by some other spokesperson or somebody who hopes to be a spokesperson for the government on industrial relations issues—it just does not like unions. It does not like the fact that the Labor Party has an association with the trade union movement.
—That's not completely right.
—It is a fact, Senator Boswell, that you do not like trade unions and you do not like the association between the union movement and the Labor Party. You can see it throughout the history of this government since it came to office in 1996. It has consistently set about, and indeed in some cases achieved, the emasculation of industrial regulation in this country. It has set about dismantling the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. The philosophy that was put forward to do that was that this government was about encouraging individual agreements between employers and employees. Of course we all know that, when it comes to trying to negotiate an individual agreement, for most employees in this country it is not a fair or equal negotiation. It is simply a case in which one organisation—the company—has much greater power than the individual employee. It is a credit to many employers in this country that, nevertheless, they are prepared to negotiate with their employees and to respect their rights. But this government wants them to take the opposite tack. It wants them to use their power—their economic power in particular—against employees and trade unions to punish them. We have seen that advocated by the minister himself in recent times. He has written articles and made speeches saying, `Employers are not tough enough on unions in this country. We have provided you with the laws whereby you can take unions, union officials or employees to court, and you should do so. You should fine them and you should seek to penalise them through the legal system that we have created.'
One of the key things that this government set out to do was to reduce the power of the Industrial Relations Commission and to wind back the range of matters that industrial awards could cover. We can recall that in the very first piece of legislation the list of matters that could be within an industrial award was limited to 20 or so items. One of the problems that the government has now found itself facing is that what it thought might be prevented through its legislation—namely, the ability of a union and an employer to enter into a bargaining service fee agreement—has not been prohibited. As the Federal Court found in the Electrolux case, which is currently the subject of appeal, that type of arrangement is not illegal. Therefore, the bill amends the legislation to make it mandatory for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to refuse to certify an agreement which contains what is called an objectionable provision. An objectionable provision will now include the payment of a bargaining services fee. By this route, the government is seeking to restrict, or indeed prevent, the ability of trade unions to enter into agreements to collect fees for bargaining services that are provided to the work force at large, particularly where such fees would be paid by certain employees who benefit from the outcome of such an agreement— that is, employees who are not members of the union. 
The government regularly gets up on its high horse and says, `People have the right to belong to unions and they have the right not to belong to unions. They shouldn't be forced to belong to unions and they should not be forced to pay union dues.' They are not forced to belong to unions—as we know, the law does not allow that to happen—and they are not forced to pay union dues. But that should not mean that employees who are able to obtain the benefits of what the union negotiates should not be expected to pay for those benefits. At the moment they are getting a free ride. It is hard to find any other area of society where this government supports a free ride. It supports a free ride for workers who do not want to belong to unions but want to pick up the benefits by way of improved wages and conditions, improved superannuation benefits and so on. This government wants to support the free ride for workers who are not members of trade unions or employee organisations to get those benefits without having to put their hands in their pockets to help to pay for the fact that those services had to be negotiated by the trade union. But the government is happy to support the principle that there is no free ride in other areas.
Let us take a few examples. The first is health insurance. This government has made it abundantly clear that nobody in this country should get a free ride when it comes to health care. All of us have to pay the Medicare levy whether we use the services of the health system or not. If you are a taxpayer you pay the Medicare levy. Whether you go to the doctor 100 times a year or you never go to the doctor or use the hospital service during the year at all, you pay the minimum levy. Furthermore, this government—in order to assist the private health industry—has now made it effectively compulsory for people to take out private health insurance, because if they do not take out private health insurance they can be hit with the private health insurance surcharge. This government says that there is no free ride when it comes to health cover.
The next example is in the area of education. There is no free ride for education. Increasingly, people across this country who have kids at school are having to pay fees, even in the so-called free public education system, because this government refuses to put the resources in that are required in that system. Let us take some private sector examples. Just about everybody who is of the legal age in this country obtains a licence to drive a motor vehicle. If your car breaks down on the road and you want some roadside assistance, inevitably you ring your local or state organisation, whether it be the NRMA in New South Wales and increasingly in the other states or the RACV. This is a service that is available to everybody in this country. There are thousands of members— probably millions of members—of these organisations. You have to pay a fee to access the service. If your car breaks down and you want some emergency assistance, you ring up the NRMA and they say, `If you're a member you can get the service; if you're not a member we'll send the van or the tow truck out and you can sign up on the spot.' So the principle of user pays, or paying for services that you access, is fundamentally ingrained in our society.
I could think of many other examples but time does not permit it. We could talk about the Law Society, because there are so many lawyers on the front bench of the government. Try practising law without being a member of the Bar Association or the Law Society! It is impossible to do it. Try practising law and refusing to pay the subscription to the lawyers fidelity fund!
—Try doctors!
—Yes, as Senator Mackay reminds me, try being a medical practitioner in this country and functioning in the health sector without being a member of either the AMA or a GP association, without taking out the relevant protective insurance and so on. In fact, as we know, doctors in this country are saying, `We are having trouble because of some of the problems associated with that area.' It all means that they depend upon the associations that represent their industry or their profession, and whether they have to access the service or not they obtain the overall benefits of it. Members of this government are prepared to support that. Indeed, as Senator Hutchins pointed out, it happens in the farming sector as well, as Senator Boswell knows. Yet when we come to the trade union movement they say, `Oh no, it shouldn't be open to trade unions to expect workers who are going to receive the benefits of what those unions negotiate to pay their way in some small way in terms of a subscription fee for the benefits that they achieve.' 
—Muscle the workers.
—Senator McGauran interjects. Senator McGauran, I am very interested in your interjections and the speeches you make, because I know you. I have followed your career in this parliament for a number of years.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-08-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise this evening to make a comment on the document relating to the government's response to the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on Indigenous funding 2001. As one can only quickly skim these sorts of documents in the time we are given between tabling and this commentary in the Senate, there are a few things I want to say about this response. Firstly, I want to say that, knowing in great detail and depth the problems facing Indigenous people in this country, and in particular in the Northern Territory, in relation to the provision of services, health and education, this document and this response are very disappointing. The government uses the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission only to try to substantiate the programs that they have in place, whether or not those programs are efficient or effective.
From what I can see, it simply uses the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to try to justify—with some licence in the use of the English language in some areas—what it is doing. Let me give you an example. In the area of school education, there is one suggestion in this document that the Commonwealth Grants Commission has identified seven methods where it considers further activity is needed in order to achieve better educational outcomes for Indigenous students. One of those is improving access for Indigenous students by involving parents in decision making processes concerning the management and delivery of schooling for Indigenous students.
The Commonwealth defends its record in this area by referring to the Commonwealth funded Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness programs, commonly known in the area as ASSPA schemes. But they are also commonly known in the area as homework programs or tutorial facilities. By and large, these committees in schools set up facilities after hours to provide Indigenous students with additional tutorials. These are not programs that actually mentor, train, educate or provide assistance to Indigenous parents in communities, be they urban, rural or remote, to get involved in school councils or whatever the equivalent board may be that manages and delivers schooling to Indigenous students. Where the Commonwealth Grants Commission makes a suggestion that more Indigenous parents ought to be involved in the management and delivery of schooling, this government defends its record by pointing at its ASSPA programs, which are far from the mark of getting parents involved and knowing and understanding the management and delivery of schooling, and getting involved in the day-to-day decision making processes of that school.
The thing that really struck me when I first read this was the commentary about mainstream Commonwealth services. A line in this report says:
The government has taken a number of initiatives across all of its programs to improve the accessibility of mainstream services for Indigenous people. 
It mentions many, but the one I want to focus on tonight is about providing better access to education, employment and income support services, with a number of initiatives under the Australians Working Together package. Let us have a look at what that means. This report does not say how they are going to do that. This report makes no reference to the fact that, in the last six months in the estimates process in relation to the provision of services through Centrelink, where the Australians Working Together package is targeted, we had officials admit to us that the provision of Centrelink service standards out bush was, in fact, a black and white issue. One thing I have to say about those public servants is that that is right. They were correct. That is, if you are black and you live in remote Australia you do get a very different service from that a non-Indigenous person gets in this country, particularly in the Territory. It seems to me that the provision of these services throughout the Territory is quite different and quite inequitable. This report just does not seem to actually grasp that difference and those difficulties. This is a report that seems to want to justify what this government is doing, without actually facing the problems and the inequities that exist in this area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. (Time expired)
