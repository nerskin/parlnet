"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—These amendments by the Labor Party would ensure that regional forest agreements, which, as the committee by now may be aware, are not to be vetted by this parliament under existing provisions, would be brought before both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The regional forest agreements are signed by the Prime Minister and whichever 
 state Premier is relevant. They involve the handing across of tens of millions of dollars—$200 million all up—of taxpayers' money which goes essentially into infrastructure to boost the profits of the big woodchip corporations through building roads into more and more remote and important wild native forests so that those forests can be logged, burnt and then treated with 1080 poison—a process which is described under this legislation as ecologically sustainable logging.
The forests themselves are the property of the Australian people, from the world heritage rainforests, which are currently being logged and burnt in Tasmania and piled into woodchips at Burnie to be exported to the paper mills of Japan, to the giant contentious forests of Western Australia, to the forests right up through New South Wales, to the forests of East Gippsland. The shortcoming of this amendment is that it does not include the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement or those of East Gippsland or the Central Highlands of Victoria. That is because the Labor opposition joined with the government to give Tasmania and eastern Victoria second-class treatment here. That was under the pressure of the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania, which is totally subservient to the woodchip corporations. As I have said on a number of occasions, one cannot judge the influence that is brought on the big parties by the massive donations coming out of woodchip corporations like North—the biggest woodchipper in the southern hemisphere—Boral and Bunnings, and going into the electoral coffers of the coalition and the Labor Party.
That gives a clue as to why we are dealing with legislation which is going to extend for 20 years the destruction of Australia's wild forests, the wildlife in them and their ancient ecosystems, and indeed their heritage values, extending from natural heritage to the indigenous people's heritage in this country—against the wishes of 80 per cent of the Australian people, the owners of those forests. The woodchip corporations have been able to levy such untoward influence that we are dealing with legislation today which sells out the interests of the majority of voters in this country. The polls show that that is not just 
 the majority of Green voters or Democrat voters but also Labor voters, coalition voters and, extraordinarily enough, One Nation voters, even though One Nation would like to open even national parks to logging, according to candidates in the last federal election.
So the biggest woodchip domain in the country—two-thirds of export woodchips come out of the little island of Tasmania—is excluded from this Labor amendment because of the pressure of the woodchip corporations on the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania, where Labor is even worse than the Liberals. Labor wanted to send to the woodchippers some 50,000 hectares of grand forests in Tasmania which even the Liberal Party down there would have been nauseated to have seen sent to the woodchippers and decided to protect. Of course, it was at that time dependent on the votes of Christine Milne, Peg Putt and Di Hollister in the Tasmanian parliament to ensure it stayed in office. Because those three Greens were in the parliament, along with Michael Foley in Franklin, 50,000 hectares of forests were protected. But they do not have the balance of power at the moment. Peg Putt is still in the Tasmanian parliament, despite the degradation of democracy in that state when Labor and Liberal got together last year, largely over the forest issue, to change the Constitution Act to make it wellnigh impossible for some of the Greens at least to win an election under the new rules.
The hand of the woodchip corporations can be seen right through this, and the power they extend into the Labor Party is at least the power they push through into the Liberal Party. That being so, we are left with an amendment now which would bring in the regional forest agreements in New South Wales and central and western Victoria. Senator Troeth, who is the spokesperson for the government here today, throughout this debate has solidly refused to give any detail about the impact of this legislation on the forests of her own neighbourhood of western Victoria, let alone the rest of the country.
Importantly to the people of Western Australia, the regional forest agreement there would be brought before this chamber for assessment. That is quite proper because, as 
 I said, hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money will flow from this legislation through the government to the woodchip corporations but only a small proportion of that will then flow back through donations to the government. It is important that parliament vets the expenditure of taxpayers' money wherever it might be, just as it is important that parliament vets what happens to this nation's heritage, not least its forest heritage, where 50 per cent of the species of plants and animal life in this country live and which is now targeted for destruction under this legislation supported by both the big parties.
It is very important that this amendment gets up. I am heavy-hearted about the fact that Tasmania, East Gippsland and the Central Highlands of Victoria have been excluded by the Labor Party. Unfortunately, I do not control the numbers, as you know, Madam Chairman, and this is the best we can get out of it, so I will be supporting these amendments.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-01,"—I just want to say briefly that we Democrats tried earlier in the piece to ensure that all RFAs could be revisited and perhaps renegotiated and at the very least we could have the opportunity for disallowance here in the chamber. We were not successful with that, and I think that is to the detriment of the whole process. However, the amendment that we have before us will allow at the very least the opportunity now to revisit the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement, over which there has been so much emotion and tension because of the inept way both the state and federal governments have dealt with it. There is a real chance, I hope, to get some gains in terms of ensuring that, if we must have an RFA for that state, it is one that is far more environmentally appropriate and ecologically sustainable, to the extent that that can be achieved under the current dynamics of this chamber.
I share with Senator Brown the regret that the Labor amendment in this instance does not open up the opportunity to revisit all the regional forest agreements, but at the very least it does allow—to the great joy, I think, of many Western Australians—the opportunity 
 to engage again in the dialogue and try and achieve a far better outcome, most particularly in terms of environmental aspects in relation to that particular RFA. So the Democrats will be supporting this amendment, but we regret that it does not go further. The Hansard will show that as a party we tried.
—Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—Chair, I can do without the intonation that there is some frustration with the fact that I am giving my best to contribute to this debate. I want to ask the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, whether the government has legal advice as to any constitutional ramifications of states being treated differently under this clause; that is, the regional forest agreements for Tasmania and for the East Gippsland component of Victoria being denied scrutiny by the parliament, whereas regional forest agreements for elsewhere will get scrutiny. Section 99 of the Constitution says that in certain matters the Commonwealth shall not treat different states or regions of Australia differently. I wonder if the government has sought or has any legal advice on the impact of this particular amendment, if it were passed, so far as that constitutional requirement is concerned.
—The question is that opposition amendments (R4) and (6) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—Is the government going to respond to that or is Senator Troeth simply going to sit on her seat, unable to give any information to this committee? This is an important matter and I think the very fact that there is no response at all—not even a yes or a no to that question—is a cavalier way of treating a very important matter that Australians are concerned about. I would expect that the government would be able to respond to such a simple question as to whether advice has been sought or not, even if the senator representing the government is not prepared to give the substance of that advice to this chamber to help it determine how it should vote.
—We have already given it and you know it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—The next amendment to be dealt with is the one I am bringing forward on behalf of the Australian Greens which would ensure that regional forest agreements that are amended after they have been vetted by parliament would then come back to parliament for 
 viewing. But there is still some work to be done on that by other people in the committee, and I would ask that we hold over this amendment until a later time.
—Is it the wish of the committee that that be deferred until later? It is; therefore, Senator Greig is the next to speak.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-01,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 3 on sheet 1294, as revised:
(3)	 Clause 3, page 3 (after line 10), after paragraph (d) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , insert:
		 (da)	 the agreement is expressed to expire at the end of 3 years after it was entered into;
This amendment seeks to allow for a sunset clause expiry after three years for each regional forestry agreement. This is not to be confused with our later amendment to put in a sunset clause for the whole act. We Democrats believe that 20 years of native forest clearing and woodchipping is clearly too long. We think that any government policy or program could do with a review after a few years.
There is much scientific evidence that the decisions made so far are problematic. Indeed, I again cite the case in Western Australia where changes were made to the RFAs within weeks of them being signed. I think it is a very reasonable request to have sunset clauses in order to review the process, and I believe a three-year period from the date of assent of this legislation is more than reasonable.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—The government will not be supporting this amendment. We believe that it injects an even greater lack of certainty into the process and certainly would not encourage investment in, and commitment to, the industry in the way we would like to see under the proposed legislation.
I also point out to Senator Brown that, with regard to his previous question regarding legal advice on the previous amendment, it is not the fault of the government if he consistently does not hear or misunderstands what I do say when I speak on behalf of the government. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman 
 Watson, Senator Brown must realise very well that, under his previous amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7, I read out to him the legal advice given to the government, and I will reinforce this now so that there can be no mistake as to the legal advice the government has received. I do ask that Senator Brown listen particularly closely to this. The legal advice provided to the government from the Office of General Counsel on 10 August 1999, is on pages 4 to 5, paragraphs 7(b), 8 and 9. Paragraph 9 states:
There is, in our view, no way consistently with section 99, that the existence of an RFA for a region can be made to depend on the RFA surviving a process of parliamentary approval or disallowance. This is the case whether all, or only some, RFAs are subjected to that process.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—I thank Senator Troeth for that catch-up. I want to support Senator Greig's amendment. Again, as with all these amendments, it gets increasingly obvious that the whole show is being run by a handful of woodchip corporations and the boards of those corporations, most of whom have never been to see the forest ecosystems they intend to destroy to make a quick profit by exporting Australia's forests out of this country for downstream processing elsewhere in the world, and, ultimately, most of them end up on the rubbish dumps of unnecessary landfills in Japan and Korea.
Senator Greig's amendment says, `Let's have the RFAs reviewed in three years.' The woodchip industry says to the government, to which it gives these instructions, `No, we need 20 years to make sure that all the unprotected forests of Australia have been cut down'—they use the term `harvested'—and for the wholesale destruction of these wild forests that most Australians want protected.
In the way of that destruction are things like 10,000 hectares of koala habitat in New South Wales in the catchment area of the wholly Japanese-owned Harris Daishowa mill at Eden. In Tasmania, world heritage value forests are at stake, which, according to world experts, are the tallest hardwood forests in the world. The largest temperate rainforest in Australia is the Tarkine wilderness in the north-west of the state, which Senator Calvert, a government senator from Tasmania, tried to establish yesterday did not exist. That an 
 extraordinary intervention. The only thing that does not exist in this debate, unfortunately, is the conscience which would allow the government to do its proper job in defending these regions.
As Senator Greig said, in his home state of Western Australia there has been ferment over the way in which the Court government, with Prime Minister John Howard having put his signature on a regional forest document, is moving to destroy large areas of old-growth forests, which the people of Western Australia do not want destroyed.
What the woodchip corporations want is 20 years of no review of their activities in the forests. It is Bunnings in Western Australia and it is North Forest Products in Tasmania, which, the committee may be aware, is also the company that is mining for uranium at Jabiluka against the wishes of the Mirrar people. It is Boral in New South Wales, in Tasmania, and so on. They have agents like the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia and Forestry Tasmania dancing to their tune, and they simply see this as a domain where they will be able to get on with their work of destruction for a quick profit, with downstream processing overseas.
All they have to do is to cut these forests down, get them to a wharf and put them through a giant woodchip mill, the biggest of which—newly established in Tasmania at Hampshire, just south of Burnie—can shred more than 1,000 tonnes of forest each year while employing just 10 people to work the computers that work the machines that shard these fantastic rainforests in a couple of days into woodchip piled on the wharves. You will have seen them in Burnie, Mr Temporary Chairman Watson.
These forests, which have been growing for centuries and harbour the spectrum of magnificent wildlife—the possums, the birds, the eagles, the bats and the extraordinary array of insect life—will be suddenly destroyed, within months, if not days, and turned into chip to be exported to downstream processing, where the jobs and profitability are. There is a 1,000 per cent mark-up for the overseas buyers of these wrecked forests, and this wreckage is subsidised by this government. Money is being taken out of the taxpayers' pockets to 
 pay for that destructive process, and the government does not want that even reviewed by parliament. Now it says, `Three years of this destructive activity is not enough. We want 20 years handed across to our donors in the woodchip corporations—the people who donate to our electoral coffers.'
As I said, Hazel Henderson, an economist from the United States with whom I had dinner here last year and to whom I explained this process to, said that that is corruption. In the United States it would not be allowed, but here it is. It is not just the woodchip cycle but it is the money cycle that has to be seen if you are going to understand why not only the government but the opposition can go along with this process, despite the wishes of 80 per cent of Australians. It is eminently sensible that this process be reviewed in three years.
Can the government cite an analogous case for allowing a process such as this, with such massive ramifications on the interests of this nation, not least young Australians—20-year-olds today—who will be able to do nothing about this until they are 40? Can the government cite an analogous case for removing from parliaments and governments the right for review of a national asset of this extraordinary importance for 20 years? I challenge Senator Troeth, on behalf of Wilson Tuckey and Robert Hill, who are the ministers for conservation and the environment respectively—at least they are the titles they have—to get up and give an analogous case. So far as I can remember, never has there been such subservience to such a minority of financially interested players who could not give a hoot about the jobs in the industry, the downstream profit making for this country and the balance of payments in this country, let alone the environmental ramifications. I will wait and see, but I doubt Senator Troeth will get up with any defence at all of the government's intention to vote down this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not support this amendment, moved by the Democrats. The RFA process and RFA agreements are about providing security. It is security on both sides. I use the word `sides' to this debate, but it is 
 something we want to get away from. We want to get away from this continual concept of battle grounds or sides between the conservationists on the one hand and industry, workers and communities on the other. The process is about providing resource security for the industry and security in terms of the reserve system.
These agreements have been negotiated over some time now on the basis of a 20-year period. This period is necessary to ensure security so that investment can take place in industry to promote downstream processing and value adding, so that the appropriate structural adjustments can occur and so that security of the reserve system is actually meaningful rather than something subjected to a year-by-year decision or, in this case, a three-year termination. It would be quite wrong at this stage to limit that period back to three years when people have, in good faith, negotiated and developed agreements on the basis of long-term security.
I must also say that it is quite wrong to suggest that there is no review process. There is a review process. It is required that a review take place every five years. So it was quite wrong for Senator Brown to stand up and say that there is no review. I am sure, given the earnest dedication of Senator Brown to his cause and given the establishment, we hope, of a wood and paper industry council that will consider the industry issues, that there will be ongoing review. These are not agreements that will just be signed and then disappear off into some bottom drawer to be not revisited. I do not mean `revisited' in the sense of continuing to look at them for the purposes of redrafting or amendment, but rather `revisiting' in terms of ensuring on an ongoing basis that all of the objectives of the national forest policy statement are being met and are being advanced.
We cannot support an amendment which seeks to limit the operation of such agreements—and, effectively, this legislation—to that cut off date of three years.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—I did ask some questions of the government, and I notice that, again, the parliamentary secretary stays glued to her seat 
 and is unable to respond. That is the pattern of this debate—one of denying this committee important information for this deliberation, but doing so because there is no answer to the basic premise that this legislation has anything to do with protecting Australia's forests. It has everything to do with sending them to the woodchippers over the next 20 years.
I acknowledge Senator Forshaw's position on this. I do not accept the argument, but I at least acknowledge that he is taking part in the debate on behalf of the Labor Party. Senator Forshaw said that the RFAs are about providing security. They are about providing security for the woodchip corporations to do what they want. The real security that should come out of this debate would be provided by Australia moving across to the already available plantation base—with mature plantations able to provide all of Australia's wood needs from building materials through to woodchips. I will not go over that ground, because I presented it very clearly to this committee in preceding days.
 That is where the win-win situation is—and, by the way, where the jobs are being created; 1,000 jobs at the proposed new mill at Tumut—even though this RFA process did not look at plantations at all. The government voted down just the other day my move that it should look at feasible and prudent alternatives—the plantation base, which would give Australia a win-win situation here. Plantations already provide, with recycling, 75 per cent of Australia's wood needs and by far the majority of jobs in the industry.
Senator Forshaw spoke about security for the industry in this legislation, but there is no security for the workers in this either. Since the regional forest agreement was signed in Tasmania a couple of notable things have happened besides the continuing destruction of forests. One is the closure of the Amcor woodchip and wood pulp mill. Straight after the signing of the regional forest agreement—about which these big corporations said, `This is the way to secure jobs'—they are importing pulp from Indonesia. Two hundred jobs went west there. Where was the Labor Party in Tasmania taking decisive action against the bad faith involved in that? It did not. Over 
 400 jobs have gone west. People have lost their houses and their livelihoods—a breach of faith in inherent contractual arrangements with these woodchip corporations just ripping those contracts in the wake of a regional forest agreement which was said to bring security. It has brought nothing of the sort. All it has done is enhanced the profit lines of the corporations that do not even have their head offices in Tasmania, that treat Tasmania as a Third World country. What nonsense to talk about security!
The previous speaker said that people have negotiated in good faith. Really? So why the secrecy? Why is it that I cannot even get information out of the government which it has? Senator Troeth has made this clear, and refuses to give to the parliament—let alone to the public—information about the way in which this industry marauds Australia's forests but does not return either jobs or profits.
You hear Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, talking about the need to redress balance of payments problems in this industry. The simple fact is that the bad faith of this industry—not the good faith—means that we export twice as much wood as we import, but we pay four times as much for the imported materials. In other words, the downstream processing is occurring overseas. We are actually exporting much more wood than we import. But because we are bunnies, because government refuses to put teeth into legislation like this which would protect Australia's interests, we end up paying for the processing that goes on overseas, particularly in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and increasingly in China. We pay the value added in importing half as much as we export at four times the cost, so we end up paying double. It is a vacuous argument. Where is the good faith in that?
Senator Forshaw said it is quite wrong to say that there will be no review. Let him amend Senator Greig's worthy amendment to make it five years. I am sure I could help talk Senator Greig into going to five years instead of three years. But when Senator Forshaw says there will be a review every five years, we know very well, Mr Temporary Chair 
 man—and you have been watching this debate for some years in Tasmania—that there are no teeth in that review. Parliament is not involved, so who does the review? The woodchip corporations do, and people like CALM, Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia. Against huge public concern, they want to hand more forest, not less—and the habitats of rare and endangered species like the chuditch, the magnificent spotted tiger cat and the red-tailed black cockatoo—across in what we are expected to call a good faith process, where the review is put in the hands of the people who do that sort of thing. If the Labor Party or the government really wanted a review with teeth in it, they would be supporting this amendment. Sure, there is a five year provision for review in there which means nothing—nothing at all. If you want to put teeth into that and you are dinkum about it and there is good faith in it, you would be supporting this amendment.
—The question is that the Democrats' amendment be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—I move Greens amendment (5):
(5)	 Clause 3, page 3 (line 12), at the end of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , add:
		 ;(f)	 the agreement provides for the conservation of all species of Australia's indigenous forest fauna and flora throughout the areas in which those species occur;
		 (g)	 the agreement provides for the protection of wilderness and heritage values, cultural significance (including significance to Aboriginal people), and landscape and aesthetic attributes;
		 (h)	 the agreement provides for forests to be managed so as to maintain or increase their carbon sink capacity and to minimise the emission of greenhouse gases from forest activity;
		 (i)	 the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system to protect old-growth forest and wilderness values is in place;
		 (j)	 the agreement provides that prices for wood from public native forests and 
 plantations at least cover the full cost of efficient management (including regeneration) attributable to wood production, include a fair return on capital, and provide an adequate return to the community from use of a public resource;
		 (k)	 the agreement provides for the protection of water availability and quality;
		 (l)	 the agreement facilitates ecologically sustainable tourism.
This is a good faith amendment, so I am sure it is going to get Labor's support. This amendment says, `Let's implement the national forest policy', which both the government and the Labor Party say is the basis for this regional forest agreement legislation. Here the Greens are moving to say, `We didn't think the national forest policy was up to scratch, but let's take your own barometer and your own standards and implement them.' So I have moved that after paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), as they stand in the bill, we add further paragraphs to validate a regional forest agreement. It would have to have these things in it. Paragraph (f) states:
the agreement provides for the conservation of all species of Australia's indigenous forest fauna and flora throughout the areas in which these species occur;
Even the woodchippers say that that is vouchsafed, so there would be no trouble with that. Paragraph (g) states:
the agreement provides for the protection of wilderness and heritage values, cultural significance (including significance to Aboriginal people), and landscape and aesthetic attributes;
We are told through the national forest policy that over 90 per cent of wilderness will be protected, that heritage values are protected—we had that debate the day before yesterday, I think—that Aboriginal cultural significance is looked after, and of course landscape and aesthetic attributes will be protected. Forestry Tasmania says its activities actually enhance the aesthetic landscape values. So there will be no problem for the Labor Party or the government to support that. Paragraph (h) states:
the agreement provides for forests to be managed so as to maintain or increase their carbon sink capacity and to minimise the emission of greenhouse gases from forest activity; 

I do not usually use the word `minimise', because it does allow people to weasel their way into doing what they indicated they would not. But we are in a giving mood to allow the government and opposition to support an amendment which comes within their very own parameters. The government is aware that some 25 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gases come out of the destruction of native vegetation. Not least, 400,000 or 500,000 hectares of native vegetation in Queensland are being destroyed each year. This looks particularly at the forest component of that greenhouse gas emission, which is disaster because this is leading rapidly to the warming of the world. We know that in the last year we had the hottest year in recorded human history, with massive economic and social dislocation potential, not to mention the environmental problems.
I will be asking the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, in a moment about the government's information on this greenhouse problem and what the greenhouse carbon storage figures are for the forests that are threatened by woodchip activities, including cutting and burning over the period of 20 years of this agreement.
Paragraph (i) of the Australian Greens amendment says that regional forest agreements should have:
the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system to protect old-growth forest and wilderness values . . . in place.
That is the wording of the government's own national forest policy. And (j) says:
the agreement provides that prices for wood from public native forests and plantations at least cover the full cost of efficient management (including regeneration) attributable to wood production, include a fair return on capital, and provide an adequate return to the community from use of a public resource.
The government could not do anything but support that. Here is a government which believes in national competition policy and does not believe that industry should be propped up by government. The Labor Party, of course, introduced that policy and is right behind it. I am simply moving to put that into the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  to make it clear to the big woodchip corpora 
 tions which have had hundreds of millions of dollars of propping up in Australia. I remember the Field Labor government in Tasmania, in 1990, transferring a $270 million debt, accrued since woodchipping began in 1970 by Forestry Tasmania, into the public debt. Interest of tens of millions of dollars has been paid on that debt, depriving Tasmanians of hospital beds, police stations in rural areas—and Senator Troeth is concerned about rural communities—school rooms and all sorts of public amenities.
For years, Labor and Liberal governments have put public money into woodchipping activities that are destroying forests. We have been expecting the public to pay to have their forest cut down and exported to woodchip mills. This puts an end to that. This says, if you are going to cut down the forests that are owned by the people, then that should be done at a profit. That is basic government philosophy. Here is core, Prime Minister John Howard philosophy at its best in this amendment from the Australian Greens. In a couple of minutes, Senator Troeth is going to get up and support this amendment. At last we are going to have some harmony and agreement in this place. Paragraph (k) says that:
the agreement provides for the protection of water availability and quality.
There is concern in Senator Troeth's own home area about this. For example, in Victoria we have heard that there is very keen community concern that logging in the headwaters of streams in the Otway is going to sully the water availability and quality. The government is very well aware that work by the water authorities in Victoria has shown that, as far as their catchments are concerned, the forests are of prime value; that the forests should be kept as they are and not cut down if we want to maintain the quality and quantity of water that those forests provide to over three million people in Melbourne. They are more valuable standing than they would be cut and exported to the Harris Daishowa mill in Eden. That is pure, good, economic as well as water quality sense and it is one of the reasons why people, not least in urban areas, want to have these forests kept standing. So 
 we will have government agreement on that. Finally, paragraph (l) says that:
the agreement facilitates ecologically sustainable tourism.
Senator Troeth believes in ecologically sustainable logging. She says that that is what this provides. That is a non sequitur to me, but she believes in it. It is in the national forest policy, on which this is based. We say, and we have proved to this committee because there has been no countermanding it, that job creation in forests in Tasmania is in keeping the forest vertical, that 18,700 jobs are in this industry in Tasmania and more than 3,000 of those depend on forests. There are fewer than 3,000 jobs in cutting down forests in Tasmania. So you have the two things competing. Tourism is putting on jobs; logging, woodchipping is shedding jobs. So it is commonsense that you make sure you look after the industry that provides jobs, keeps the profits in the locality and ensures the aesthetic amenity that locals want. That will be something that Senator Troeth and indeed the Labor Party would agree with.
Here we have put forward amendments which come out of the government's own policy. We have written them into the regional forest agreement to make sure that there is no default on them further down the line. I would expect that we are going to get wholehearted support on this from the government.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—Senator Brown knows very well that the government will not be supporting these amendments because they add another seven conditions to the nine which are already required by the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  for an agreement to be recognised as a regional forest agreement. I have spoken earlier in this debate about flexibility. The last thing we want to do is to be imposing prescriptive conditions on those people who are trying to work within the confines of the regional forest agreement. So firstly, these conditions are far too prescriptive.
Secondly, they are duplicative of the requirements already contained in the bill's definition of an RFA. Thirdly, they attempt to 
 introduce considerations that are not the primary focus of RFAs. I would like to again proffer some advice that was obtained from the Office of General Counsel on 10 August 1999, and I quote from page 6, paragraphs 22 and 23:
A problem with a number of these conditions is that they are not limited to the region or regions covered by the RFA. The effect of this is that for an agreement to be regarded as an RFA it must, for example, provide for `the conservation of all species of Australia's indigenous forest, fauna and flora throughout the areas in which those species occur'.
That is in respect of proposed paragraph (f). Proposed paragraph (g) states:
The protection of wilderness and heritage values, cultural significance (including significance to Aboriginal people), and landscape and aesthetic attributes:
Further, the advice reads:
Neither of the requirements in proposed paragraphs (f) and (g) are limited to the regions covered by the RFA. Also, proposed paragraph (j) of the definition requires that the agreement must provide `that prices for wood from public native forests and plantations at least cover the full cost of efficient management, including regeneration attributable to wood production, include a fair return on capital and provide an adequate return to the community from use of a public resource'.
We are unaware of any mechanism by which an RFA could set prices for wood. Therefore, it is difficult to see how that requirement could be met. I convey to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the government will oppose the amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—I indicate, on behalf of the opposition, that we will not be supporting this amendment. We believe that the concerns that Senator Brown has sought to address in his proposed amendment and also in his remarks are adequately dealt with in the amendments that we have moved which have already been adopted by the committee. I refer in particular to the fact that any RFA now has to be entered into having regard to the objects of the act, which was a provision that we had inserted into the bill. We were also successful, with the support of the Democrats and the Greens, in having an extensive objects clause inserted into the act. That objects clause sets 
 out the relevant national goals that are specified in the national forest policy statement. We believe that the formula which we have introduced into the legislation is adequate and appropriate and, in our view, it is not necessary to amend the definition in the way that Senator Brown has proposed. Further, in some cases what he has done actually goes beyond the requirements of the national forest policy statement. In that way some of the proposed additional definitions would be unnecessarily restrictive. For those reasons we cannot support the amendment moved by Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-01,"—The Australian Democrats are supportive of this amendment, largely because it deals with language and the use of language. Language is very important. It can be used, abused and manipulated. I wonder whether, 100 years from now, Australians will look back at this debate and ask, `How is it that at that point in time the parliament thought that the continued destruction of our native forests was appropriate, reasonable or necessary?' I am sure that they will focus on the use of the language that has been used throughout the debate—terms such as `Forest Protection Society', which is actually a group of people who want to tear down the forests, and `ecologically sustainable logging in native forests', which is a contradiction. I think what Senator Brown is trying to achieve with his definitions is not so much further complications, as the parliamentary secretary suggests; he is simply trying to focus on the use of language to bring home the notion that what we are talking about is the preservation of our forests. Using language to try to create an argument in support of logging is unacceptable. On that basis, we will be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—Senator Forshaw, on behalf of the Labor Party, said, `This is already in the objects clause. We don't need to put it into the definition.' The basic problem with this whole process is that the government and the opposition are strong on waffle—they will put something into objectives, because they do not have to be abided by—but they are not 
 strong at all on dinkum parliamentary rules for the woodchip corporations. When I move, on behalf of the Greens, to incorporate the objectives into the legislation to give it teeth, the big parties say no, knowing that the objectives will not be met in this legislation. You will remember, Chair, that the government did not even want the objectives to be drawn up to give protection to wildlife.
In New South Wales, there are 1,000 hectares of koala breeding habitat being logged in the Murrah forests near Bermagui under the regional forest agreement which protects rare and endangered species. It is not good enough to just raise a hand to the forehead about this. It should be written into the legislation that that cannot happen. When I move to protect those koalas in that breeding colony—through an amendment which gives teeth to the national forest policy, which Prime Minister Howard says is his guiding dictum on this—the government says it will vote it down.
Is that not hypocrisy? Is that not double standards? Is that not welshing on the people of this country who expect wildlife—not least koalas hanging on in forests which are the most densely populated components of our ecosystems when it comes to biodiversity—to be protected? No. It is weasel words that are used. If a Green comes in here and says, `Well, let's be dinkum about this; let's put some honesty into this process,' the government says, `Well, we can't do that.' I know, and many other people know, that is because of this system whereby the woodchip corporations and their donations into government coffers are more influential than the concerns of the majority of Australians about koalas and bird life and the other remarkable mammals that live in these forests which are facing death and destruction under this piece of legislation. The government would like to cut this debate short because it has no answers and no integrity in this shameful process, going on unreported in this parliament—
—Much to your disgust.
—It is much to my frustration.
—You can't get one word in the newspaper.
—The parliamentary secretary gives no answers here but wants to interject. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, who said she is concerned about regional Australia, says there is no way the government will accept Greens proposed subparagraph (j) here, which provides that these forests will not be cut down subsidised by public moneys, that they will have to return a profit to the public purse. She said there is no way that can be implemented. I will look at that further down the line.
I want to challenge Senator Troeth and the government on their concerns about these amendments. In a moment I will seek leave to amend this amendment to meet the parliamentary secretary's concerns. Then we will see how honest and dinkum this government is about what it says. In a moment I will move to remove subparagraph (j) requiring the forests to be run in a profitable way for the Australian people.
Senator Troeth said, regarding subparagraph (f) providing for the conservation of Australia's fauna and flora, that there is legal advice to say that my amendment would mean that you would have to do that throughout the country. I maintain that would be a good thing. But she says that this legislation should be confined to regional forest agreements. I foreshadow that I will move that, in subparagraph (f), the words `throughout to occur' be replaced with the words, `in regional forest agreement areas'. It will expedite proceedings because we are going to find the government wanting in a minute.
As to subparagraph (g), which provides for the indigenous people of Australia to be heard and for their interests to be looked after, again the government says, `We've got legal advice to say that the amendment the Greens have put forward would extend outside regional forest agreement areas.' Heavens above, we do not want the government being required to protect wilderness values and indigenous cultural values outside forests! But I will accept that on this occasion, even though I think that should be a government priority, so I will be seeking to amend subparagraph (g) by adding the words `in regional forest agreement areas'. Let us confine it, as Senator 
 Troeth wants, to make these amendments acceptable. So there you are—she has had three objections. I have met all three of them. I seek leave at this stage to amend my amendment No. 5 in the way I have indicated so that the committee can get the support of the government.
Leave granted.
—I amend my amendment as follows:
		 Paragraph (f) omit ""throughout the areas in which those species occur"", substitute ""in regional forest areas"".
		 At end of paragraph (g), add ""in regional forest areas"".
		 Omit paragraph (j).
Here we have the support of the government to make these amendments. I am getting somewhat excited here about the prospect that we are now going to get the government to support these Green amendments which have been altered to meet the concerns as expressed by the parliamentary secretary. I hope she has made calls to Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, and to Senator Hill, to let them know about this breakthrough.
While she is talking elsewhere, I point out that this will lead, amongst other things, to the end of breaches of Environmental Protection Authority requirements in Western Australia, where there has been overlogging of jarrah. It will lead to the protection—at least of its habitat—of the world's largest freshwater crayfish in Tasmania, something that is not happening at the moment, and of course to the protection of areas of Aboriginal significance.
Let me here read a comment from Darlene Mansell of the Deloraine Aboriginal Centre saying that, up until this date—and things are about to change, I hope:
Our interests have just been totally ignored. There will be no tangible outcomes to our community, whether it is employment, social, economic or whatever—even spiritual at this stage. We go to our land now and it is almost a mourning process. You go to your land and you see the destruction 
 which has occurred. Rather than it being a cultural activity that you are going out to protect, to see, to do certain cultural things, in fact you find yourself going up to the land to basically cry—that is the truth of the matter—because of the destruction and the raping of the land which is going on in Tasmania day by day. I hope this committee can somehow take stock of what is going on behind the scenes at Kooparoona Niara.
That is the Aboriginal name for the Great Western Tiers. To continue:
I think if you really have the opportunity to get out to the land and see the destruction of the land, you might have a clearer understanding.
That is why the Greens have moved subparagraph (g). I have taken heed of the parliamentary secretary's concern that it might lead to protection of Aboriginal cultural values outside regional forest agreement areas and I am agreeing here to confining it to the areas encompassed by a regional forest agreement. This would include Kooparoona Niara and would bring some assuredness back to the grieving people, including those of the Aboriginal community at Deloraine.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—The government will still oppose this amendment as Senator Brown has amended it. But I am pleased to see that Senator Brown is gradually coming more into line with government thinking. Certainly, some of the words that he uses in that amendment are ones to which the government subscribe in the legislation as it stands. However, there are still elements that we object to in that amendment, such as the clause dealing with carbon sinks. If Senator Brown really wanted to encompass the ideals of the RFA legislation, he should withdraw this amendment rather than amending it. The government will still be opposing it, even though it is in an amended form.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—So you see the duplicity of this whole process—the absolute hypocrisy, duplicity and dishonesty that the government engages in here. It is saying one thing and it is meaning another. It is not going to have any amendment to this. When it gets up and says, `The Greens motion is out of order because it is too wide and too all-encompassing and the 
 government has advice that it should be more restrictive,' and I say, `Okay, I will agree with the restrictive government interpretation,' as, sadly, one has come to expect in this committee, the government then welshes and says, `No; no amendments at all.' It makes a farce of debating the issue in here. But one must stand up and debate the issue, because the interests of the Australian people are being sold out by the Howard government—the government of Prime Minister Howard, who signed these documents and who has flown around the country from Perth in Tasmania to Perth in Western Australia—signing the death warrant for our forests and the death warrant for thousands of jobs while they are at it, and the profit line enhancement of a few big woodchip corporations. That is what this is all about. The whole process of the government's sincerity in this matter has just been unmasked. It will go unreported. It does not make any difference.
—You are asking for newspaper coverage, are you Bob?
—The answer to that is: yes, I am.
—Well, you are not getting any.
—Senator Troeth apparently is indicating there that she has some control factor on what the press gallery writes or does not write. I might ask her to get up and explain how she manages to keep the lid on the press gallery. This is interesting territory. I have been looking for the missing factor. I have been looking for why it is that people are in uproar and turning out in tens of thousands in Western Australia and yet there has been such minimal coverage of this. But Senator Troeth has just indicated that she knows what is going on. She knows why this issue is getting so little coverage. I might add that there is no difficulty in getting coverage of a lot of other issues which I think are pretty trivial. But Senator Troeth has a line to the press gallery there which I do not have. Maybe she would let us know about it.
I am quite happy to put the argument here. I am very sad to see that the government cannot even stand by its own implied statement that it would support this amendment if 
 it were restricted in the way that Senator Troeth first indicated.

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-01,"—I move amendment No. 1 on sheet 1525:
Clause 3, page 2 (after line 31), after subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , insert:
			 (iia)	  non-indigenous heritage values;
I would like to reflect on my earlier comments with respect to the values as they are set out in the definitions of the act. As I stated earlier on, the act itself requires, under clause 3(a)(ii), separate listing of indigenous heritage values, having previously set out all of the other values. The purpose of moving this amendment is to recognise the non-indigenous values. I reiterate my earlier comments. If it is sufficiently required to have a separate reference to the indigenous heritage values and, by way of doing that, clearly indicating that they are not covered by the previous values as set out in the act, then the non-indigenous values that I have referred to earlier in this debate are also not covered. I put it to the Senate to consider this in the light of adding balance to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 , not to detract from any of the indigenous values that it sets out to protect but for it to do that also for the non-indigenous values.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we do not support this amendment. I outlined our position in the earlier debate. In our view, the concept of protecting non-indigenous heritage values, if it needs to be, is already covered. We find the proposed amendment disingenuous. It is sophistry. We cannot support it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"— 
Similarly, the government believes that the inclusion of the words `non-indigenous heritage values' is not necessary, as we believe, Senator Harris, that the words are already covered by the provisions in the clause under national estate values, world heritage values, social values and environmental values. We see it as an unnecessary amendment and will not be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—I will be supporting this amendment on behalf of the Greens, because—
—Hold the front page on this one.
—No, I think these amendments should be regarded on their merits, not according to some previously defined political assessment. The fact that One Nation is bringing this forward makes no difference to the merit of the amendment. Senator Harris should be heard on that basis. Both the government and the opposition have argued that there is no need for it, that it is superfluous and covered in the objectives of the act. In doing so they cut the rug from under their argument that it should not be here. If it is not doing anything that is not already in the act, then why not allow it? Where is the argument against it?
We heard from Senator Harris the day before yesterday that there are concerns that in the bush there is steam machinery and old tram tracks. I have seen the snigging tracks in Tasmania, which cannot be preserved in the way that would be required by this, but there is machinery out in the bush, some of it very innovative, harking back to a time when we did not have the mass destruction of forests we have had since the woodchippers arrived in 1969. I have no difficulty in giving the act some teeth as to the implications of the objectives. So I support the amendment.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-01,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 4 on sheet 1294, as revised:
Page 3 (after line 30), after clause 4, insert:
4A  This Act to be subject to international obligations
	 This Act has effect subject to Australia's obligations under international law, including obligations under any agreement between Australia and another country or countries relating to matters of environmental protection and forest management.
This amendment relates to international treaty obligations and seeks to put an obligation into the regional forestry agreement legislation to ensure that it is clearly subject to international agreements between Australia and other countries that relate to matters of environ 
 mental protection and forest management. These agreements include, for example, Ramsar wetlands, the biodiversity convention, the migratory bird agreements and so on. It is necessary for this to be explicit in this legislation as the legislation at a federal level ensures that it links the state regional forestry agreements with Commonwealth law. It is the Commonwealth which signs these agreements on behalf of the nation as a whole and, given that both the coalition and the Labor Party when in government have either signed these agreements or enacted policy on them, we look forward to their support.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—The government will be opposing this amendment. We feel that the RFAs themselves have taken world heritage into account, and there is no way an RFA can override Australia's international commitments. We will be opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—We will not be supporting this amendment. Firstly, as I have said in relation to a number of other matters, we have already successfully amended the bill by the inclusion of the objects clause, and that includes paragraph (2)(b), which:
. . . ensures that Australia fulfils its obligations under relevant international agreements . . . 
Senator Greig's amendment makes reference to the act having effect subject to Australia's obligations under international law; that is a rather open-ended and undefined proposition. Clearly, the international agreements that have been entered into by Australia are ones that are readily identifiable and can be applied, but the reference to international law is one which we would see as providing complications in interpretation. Further, we will be moving amendment No. 8 on our list of amendments and that makes reference to the World Heritage List, the Ramsar convention and other relevant international obligations.
Finally, as the parliamentary secretary has already noted, there is included in the definition of an RFA a requirement to have regard to world heritage values. We believe that the legislation together with the amendments that 
 we have moved covers the issue of international obligations satisfactorily, so there is no need to complicate matters with this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—The argument we have just heard effectively says that if you have objectives in an act you do not need anything else. You just write out your list of objectives and say, `We are going to do this, that and something else,' and then you do not need the operative clauses. I disagree. What happens with legislation and the way parliament works is that you set out objectives in an act and then you provide the laws which will meet those objectives. Here Senator Greig moves to do just that, and the government and opposition say, `No, we won't support it.' It shows what a sham and what a toothless piece of paper this regional forest agreement legislation is and what a prescription it is for destruction. Senator Troeth on behalf of the government just said, `There is no way an RFA can override Australia's international commitments.' That is totally misleading, and I will tell you why. In Tasmania the regional forest agreement provides for the woodchipping and total destruction of forests which are of world heritage value, in defiance and in breach of the World Heritage Convention, signed by the Whitlam government in 1974 or 1975.
—That is your interpretation.
—Let us not have an opinion difference on this. Let us support Senator Greig's amendment so that it is written into the legislation and people cannot weasel out of it one way or the other or say, `It is our interpretation.' Let us have it in the legislation. If you think this is open to interpretation, Mr Temporary Chairman, you could expect that Senator Troeth, who has just said that she thinks it is open to interpretation, that she disagrees with my interpretation, would want to support this amendment to eliminate such doubt.
—You are clutching at straws.
—I am not clutching at straws; I am clutching at the defence of 
 forests which you are sending to the woodchippers, with their wildlife.
In 1993, just six years ago, after this whole process got under way, the then executive director of the environmental strategies directorate wrote to the then minister, Ros Kelly. I want to quote from that letter, because it affects areas that are currently being logged and which the current minister, Robert Hill, has been to. He stood in the middle of a clear-felled area of world heritage significance. But the advice from his department at that time was:
It is the portfolio view that the proposed roads and forest harvesting operations—
read for that `logging operations'—
in the Huon and Picton valleys—
in Tasmania, of course—
will have a significant adverse effect on the current Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.
That is, it will be in breach of the World Heritage Convention. Mr Buckingham went on to say:
The Huon and Picton valleys have been identified in numerous reports as contributing to the integrity of the adjacent World Heritage Area and their inclusion in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area would enhance and safeguard its integrity.
Clause 32 of that letter reads:
The Huon and Picton valleys have been identified as having World Heritage values which would add to those included in the existing Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, including pristine catchments, glacial and karst features—
that is, cave features—
important Huon pine and tall eucalypt communities and outstanding scenery. Continued forestry activities in the area, with its suite of attendant impacts, will degrade the natural values which have been identified as of World Heritage quality to an extent which may preclude any future options for adding these areas to the existing World Heritage Area.
The government knows full well that the World Heritage Convention says that signatories are obliged to identify world heritage areas and protect them. This government tears up that convention. It is breaking the World Heritage Convention through this process, because not only has it not moved to include and nominate these world heritage value forests and forests which protect the existing 
 world heritage values, including wilderness values, but it has also sent in the chainsaws, the bulldozers and the helicopters dropping firebombs to burn what is left of the forest after the woodchippers have left. I can tell you that they have then in these world heritage areas distributed 1080 poison to kill the mammals that happen to come in from remnant forests to feed on the genetically modified fast growing plantation forests that the big woodchip corporations hope will give them a profit a little further down the line. What a disgusting process this is. What a deception is going on here.
If the government and the opposition stand by the world heritage convention and the Ramsar agreement that Senator Greig spoke about to protect our world heritage value wetlands and the wildlife and birdlife in them, why will they not support this amendment? I will tell you why they will not support it: they do not support those conventions and they are involved in an act of breach of the world heritage convention in particular. This is happening in Tasmania today, and the minister for the environment, Robert Hill, has been there and has stood in the middle of it. Have you ever heard of such a dereliction of ministerial duty, let alone of an obligation to an international convention?
How far this has drifted from the days in which the High Court ruled that federal parliament had the authority to uphold the world heritage convention to protect the Franklin River against an aberrant state government which wanted to put a dam on that river and destroy its world heritage values. Just across the ranges to the east, today the maverick and destructive state government of Labor Premier Jim Bacon is destroying world heritage values, and this legislation, which is supposed to protect those values, is a toothless piece of paper because this government—the government of John Howard—is complicit in the destruction of world heritage forest in my home state. You cannot say that it does not know, because its own department has said so. So it is duplicitous as well as destructive. That is the reason why this government will not support this amendment and, sadly, that is the reason why 
 the opposition will not support it either. I certainly will.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-01,"—I would like to relate my comments on the contents of the Democrats' proposed amendment and highlight what they are actually asking this chamber to do at this point in time. They have moved an amendment to the proposed act that will require Australia to effect its obligation under any agreements that Australia has with other countries relating to matters of environmental protection.
The point I wish to put is that, if this chamber is to seriously consider this item—and I am not in any way stating that it should not—it is the responsibility of Senator Greig to have provided to this chamber a copy of those agreements. How can we be asked to debate an issue—and to commit this parliament and the Australian people to it—the ramifications of which I seriously doubt that the people in this chamber understand?
Let us look at one such treaty that I am aware of, and I am sure that there are many more that I am not aware of. It is Agenda 21. If Senator Greig wanted to highlight our obligations, why hasn't he brought this particular document to the attention of the chamber? Through you, Chair, I will ask Senator Greig—if he can—to relate to this chamber what chapter 11 of that agreement actually says, because I do not believe that he will even understand or know what is in chapter 11 of Agenda 21.
Let us have a look at the history of Agenda 21. Where did it come from? It came out of a biodiversity conference in Rio and it was signed by Ros Kelly. What has actually happened to that document since? It disappeared into a black hole, to the exception of those who could progress it in relation to environmental and green issues. It took me four years to get a copy of the document. When I got a copy of the document I realised why they did not want me to have it. It goes into such issues as water management that will progressively digress down to private enterprise every bit of water resource in this country. 
This is a document that the Labor Party has committed Australia to and, if the government of the day think that they are clear and free, I am very sad to say to them that they are not. They are equally complicit because the government of the day continue to report to the United Nations on the implementation of Agenda 21. And I would suggest that there would be very few members on the government side who could stand up here today and relate the issues within Agenda 21.
We are being asked today to sign a blank cheque, because I believe that the members of this chamber do not know the contents of the agreements that are they are agreeing to allow or disagreeing on. I believe that this chamber would be far better off and would work more efficiently if senators put the work into providing to the chamber the information that other senators need to make a balanced decision on the issues that are being put before them. So through you, Chair, I will ask Senator Greig to actually relate to this chamber the contents of chapter 11 of Agenda 21.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-01,"—In relation to the previous amendment, being a Democrats amendment, the Democrats obviously supported it. I clearly indicate that as well. On behalf of Senator Greig, he probably would have been happy to answer Senator Harris's question except he has gone to do some preparation for his first speech, so if he has some space at the end of his first speech he might fit that stuff in there.

4B  Minister to establish forest database
	 The Minister must cause to be established a comprehensive and publicly available national forest database to ensure that decision-making 
 and management of long-term timber supplies are based on the best available information.
This amendment is reasonably self-explanatory. It seeks to add an extra clause into the legislation to require the minister to establish a national and publicly available forest database to ensure that decision making and management are based on the best available information.
Much of the information that goes into RFAs is difficult for the public to access as it is secret or unavailable. The Democrats believe that all this information should be public and maintained for the good of the community and those with an interest in forest management and to ensure that there is maximum public confidence in the adequacy of any decision making at government level surrounding forest issues. I think one of the problems, amongst many, with the whole RFA process has been a fair degree of community scepticism—amongst a significant part of the community, anyway—about the adequacy of the decision making and dubiousness about what actual data that decision making is based on. So, to overcome that public dubiousness and cynicism about the process, the Democrats believe that this straightforward amendment would ensure greater openness and access to information for the public.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—The government will be opposing this amendment on the grounds that this information is already available. I draw to the attention of the Senate Australia's State of the Forests Report 1998 , and I would like to quote from the foreword in order to set at rest Senator Bartlett's worries that this sort of information is not publicly available. It states:
The national State of the Forests Report  was called for in the Ecologically Sustainable Development Strategy  (1992) and the National Forest Policy Statement  (1992). It is to be a report to the public, published every 5 years. The present report was compiled by the Management Team of the National Forest Inventory, which is based in the Bureau of Rural Sciences. The National Forest Inventory represents the forestry and conservation agencies of the Commonwealth Government as well as all the States and Territories. Together, these agencies 
 have compiled the most comprehensive factual information about forests currently available, and presented it in a form that can be primarily used by the general public, but by specialists as well.
So I feel sure, Senator Bartlett, that the existence of this document should set your mind at rest about this sort of information being available; therefore, we regard the amendment as unnecessary and will be opposing it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—The Australian Greens oppose clause 5 because it removes the powers of the Commonwealth to protect the forests of Australia. It is again a central component of this hand-across of the fortunes of our forests to a handful of woodchip corporations and their agents at state government level. You will see that the clause in the bill the government is bringing forward, and which is presumably supported by the opposition, although there is an amendment coming up that we will be dealing with in a moment, says:
5	 Certain Commonwealth Acts not to apply in relation to RFA wood or RFA forestry operations
(1)	 RFA wood is not prescribed goods for the purposes of the Export Control Act 1982 .
So that goes west.
(2)	 An export control law does not apply to RFA wood unless it expressly refers to RFA wood.
This is one of those tortuous pieces that enter these clauses. It goes on:
	 For this purpose,  export control law    means a provision of a law of the Commonwealth (other than the Export Control Act 1982  ) that 
 prohibits or restricts exports, or has the effect of prohibiting or restricting exports.
In other words, remove the Commonwealth export control laws. It further states:
(3)	 The effect of RFA forestry operations—
by the woodchippers, I add in there—
must be disregarded for the purposes of the following:
That is, this clause says to disregard the effect of the woodchip corporations on the forests insofar as `(a) section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975', which protects forests and which lists national estate values. That gets knocked out by this bill.
Subclause 3(b) relates to `approved procedures under Section 6 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'. This centre of federal authority in protecting this nation's heritage gets depth charged by this clause. It removes any responsibility from a future minister for the environment who would want to act on behalf of the majority of Australians to protect this nation's forest heritage. We know that the current minister, Robert Hill, wants to act on behalf of the woodchip corporations, but there may be a future minister who feels that it is their duty to uphold their portfolio's requirement to advocate for the environment in cabinet. This clause says that they will be disempowered into the future.
This minister for the environment wants to disempower all future ministers for the environment from doing their duties. He has decided to act against the interests of the forests of this country. He wants to make sure that no future minister can come along and return honesty to the portfolio.
Under subclause 3(c) we see that section 11 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the heartland of that legislation, has also been torpedoed. Under subclause 3(d), `section 6 of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983' gets knocked out, yet the government has just said that international treaties are looked after under this legislation. Unfortunately I have put the quote from Senator Troeth aside, but she said that the international obligations were protected by this legislation. Why are they 
 knocking out the world heritage legislation with this clause? Because this government knows that this is a prescription for the destruction of forest environments in this country. It is riddled with dishonesty. How dare they come in here and talk about ecologically sustainable processes. It is about ecological destruction, and this clause says it all: get rid of the federal powers which would allow a responsible future government or minister to move to protect forests.
We will soon be dealing with clause 7, which says that any future minister not only is disempowered but, if they were to move to protect these forests, they will have to compensate the woodchip corporations, which have paid not a cent for those forests, simply to have them protected in the interests of the Australian people. It is disgusting, derelict, culpable legislation. That is why we Greens totally oppose this clause to disempower any future federal government, parliament or minister who wanted to get back in tune with majority Australian public thinking on the future use and abuse of our forests.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-01,"—The Democrats also oppose clause 5. This is one of the most disconcerting, indeed appalling, aspects of this legislation. It is only a small bill—it has only eight sections, all up—but this clause is one of the worst aspects, for the reasons, among others, that Senator Brown has just outlined. It quite specifically and blatantly seeks to exempt the Commonwealth and Commonwealth environment acts from any oversight of RFA forestry operations.
The Democrats believe that RFAs must be subject to all sections of federal environment legislation. There is hardly any point in having federal environment legislation if we are going to then exempt significant operations from that legislation, particularly something as vital to biodiversity, to ecosystems and to sustainability as our forests. To have a bill that exempts forestry operations—the logging of our native forests on a wide scale—from federal environment legislation is quite an abomination. The effect of RFA forestry operations under this clause will be disregarded for the purposes of the 
 Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. To exempt forestry operations from the impact of the World Heritage Act is quite astonishing.
The government and others may say that the process of developing RFAs is so comprehensive, so scientifically based, so soundly founded in good environmental practice that we do not need to have federal environment legislative protection, because the RFAs cover all that. If they do cover all that, why do we need to exempt them from these acts? If they are already operating on a sound environmental basis, they should meet all these sections of federal environment legislation in any case. It is quite astonishing that something as fundamental as forests should be seen to be able to be exempted from federal environment protection.
The Senate will remember that, during the debate on the environment protection legislation in June, the Democrats moved to include RFAs and forests as a trigger in the new environment legislation that will operate from next year. Labor and the coalition combined to ensure that forests were excluded from the new environment legislation. This is another chance to make up for what the Democrats believe was a major mistake in that regard. We certainly hope that other senators will join in opposing clause 5 of this bill.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—I am actually glad that Senator Brown has made yet another of his repetitive speeches, because the real intent of his opposition to this clause is very clear. Not only does Senator Brown want to make it as difficult as possible for an RFA to be entered into but, when it is entered into, he still wants export controls to continue to apply and he also wants the spectre of Commonwealth intervention through environmental legislation to continue to hang over the industry in the region.
Senator Brown has said to me that my concern is for the welfare, job security and interests of rural people—and it certain is. I want clause 5 to stand so that these agree 
 ments can go on as they have been framed and give the industry security, give job development in the region security and, at last, give the Australian people a proper vehicle for a rejuvenated timber industry to go forward into the next century. That is why I want clause 5 to stand, and that is why I will be proposing that the government support the clause. What benefit would it be to a state to go through the RFA process, complying with that agreement, and continue to have the threat of capricious Commonwealth action hanging over its head? None at all. That is what the Australian Greens want—the cessation of the RFA process. There is no way that I am going to subscribe to that.
The exemptions that are proposed in the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  under clause 5 are made because the RFA itself and the management prescriptions contained therein are based, as Senator Bartlett remarked, on thorough assessments, having due regard to statutory Commonwealth obligation. For example, the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and provision for ecologically sustainable forest management under each RFA ensures the ongoing protection of environmental and heritage values in the region. Thus no further assessment in relation to the effect of RFA forestry operations is required apart from state requirements that have been accredited under the RFA. Opposition to the clause would act directly against that rationale. We therefore strongly support the clause.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—I indicate that the opposition will be supporting clause 5 but, in doing so—subsequent to this matter being dealt with—we will be proposing an amendment to subclause 3, paragraph (d). This is opposition amendment No. 8.
We support the inclusion of the overall clause because it is absolutely fundamental to the whole RFA process. Senator Brown knows that and Senator Bartlett knows that. We know that they are opposed to the RFA process. They do not support it—they have never supported it—and what is indicated clearly here is that they will do whatever they can to try to undermine it.
The agreement that was entered into, the national forest policy statement and everything that has occurred since then in developing RFAs have all been on the basis that the RFA agreements—once entered into between the state and federal governments—would operate in lieu of the provisions of various aspects of Commonwealth legislation. That was agreed to. You only have to look at the national forest policy statement itself to see that. For instance, with respect to the issue of the export of woodchips, it says at page 8:
The Commonwealth will remove controls over the export of unprocessed public and private plantation wood, subject to the application of codes of practice to protect environmental values.
It then goes on to say:
Commonwealth-State regional agreements based on comprehensive regional assessments (see Section 4.3) or agreements between a State and the Australian Heritage Commission on the management of forests listed on the Register of the National Estate (including the application of harvesting codes of practice) will constitute the basis on which the Commonwealth will meet its legislative obligations under s. 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1974. For areas not covered by comprehensive regional assessments, existing processes and annual export approvals will apply.
It has been clear all the way through that RFA agreements that are properly entered into and meet the criteria and the objectives of the national forest policy statement will operate and Commonwealth law would continue to apply in areas where an RFA is not entered into. The whole process, of course, is designed to ensure that all of the areas to be covered will be covered by an RFA by the end of this year. We still hope that we can meet that target—notwithstanding the substantial dereliction of duty by the current federal minister.
But putting that to one side, to oppose this clause is to really take away the very foundations upon which the RFA process has been developed—that is, an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states to have RFAs operate in lieu of the provisions of that Commonwealth legislation. That is not walking away from the obligations at all; it is merely a transference, if you like, of the way the obligations will be met—from one form of statutory control to another form. What we 
 have done in our amendments is strengthen this legislation in those areas where we believed it was necessary. But we continue to support this clause because it is fundamental to the whole RFA process. If it were not to be passed, the process would effectively become null and void.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—The government says that it needs to abolish the time-honoured powers of the Commonwealth to protect this nation's heritage so that it can uphold regional forest agreements. That says it all. This is a prescription for the destruction of millions of hectares of Australia's wild forests, the wildlife in them, and the ecosystems.
The woodchip corporations essentially drew up this legislation and kept amending it, all the way to its appearance here in this parliament. Senator Troeth would not dare get up and give a guarantee that Australia's forests and their environmental values will be protected under this legislation, because if she did so she would be a liar—and that of course is something that she would not want to be seen to be in an honoured place like this.
We hear that this legislation can give assurance to people because it is only going to implement logging in Western Australia, Tasmania, East Gippsland, central Victoria, right up the Great Divide, through the coastal and inland forests of New South Wales, and into south-east Queensland. It will only allow such logging subject to the protection of environmental values. I could use stronger terms, but let me say that every player in this whole tawdry scheme knows that that is bunkum. That is deception. That is falsehood. This whole legislation is based on a deceit.
We hear `ecologically sustainable' used in a disgraceful fashion—you know, the use of words to mean the opposite to what they say. This government, led by the Rt Hon. John Howard, Prime Minister, put its signature to a process which leads to forests which have never had the hand of modern technology near them being destroyed by chainsaws ripping the heart out of them by the woodchippers for profit, and they call that ecologically sustainable. We all know about the honesty of that process. Well, I will not 
 be part of it. I am indignant about that. This is a shameful process. It is disgusting. If this government wants to send those forests to the woodchippers, let it say so. Let it talk about the environmental expense of that, and the death of those forests, and the destruction of that wildlife. Then we can debate on honest terms. But this is a disgusting farrago of dishonesty, from the Prime Minister right down to the representative in this place at the moment, and they know it.
No wonder the Prime Minister has still to come good on my invitation in 1996 to come and see the forests in Tasmania he was issuing a death warrant to. He is not big enough to do that. He can come down to Tasmania and sign the death warrant on those forests, but he has not got the gumption or the innards to come down and look at what that means on the ground and to see for himself why the majority of the Australian people do not want him to do that. What he is capable of doing is putting his hand out, or the hand of his party, to take hundreds of thousands of dollars from these woodchip corporations to help the next election process. I think that whole process is corrupt, and this nation loses as a result. When you destroy a forest you cannot get it back. No scientist and no engineer, and certainly not this derelict Prime Minister, can recover the nation's heritage once it is destroyed.
This Prime Minister is sending in the chainsaws, this Prime Minister is sending in the firebombers, and this Prime Minister is sending in the poison which destroy those forest ecosystems. What are we to make of the honesty of him and his government when they say that is ecologically sustainable? How dare they! What an affront to the Australian people. What an affront to all future generations of this nation who will have lost to them this forest heritage. What an abrogation of the duty of this government to not only look after but enhance the fortunes of his nation's wildlife. The Prime Minister's representative might sit there and smile and talk about jobs in the bush, but let her tell this chamber how it is that a Prime Minister can give assurances that there will be jobs coming out of this—this was when he signed the death warrant of 
 these forests in Tasmania in March last year, or before that—but then say nothing when the closure of the Burnie pulp mill led to the loss of 280 jobs. Assure the jobs: that is what this is all about. Bunkum!
What about the 31 people who were sacked by North—the woodchipper and uranium miner—in May this year after the Prime Minister promised that those jobs would be secure? Where is the honesty in that? If he cannot face up to the duplicity of talking about protecting environmental values and sending in the chainsaws, where is the honesty of saying, `I'll protect jobs' and then seeing them thrown out?
Senator Troeth talks about the bush. What about the families of those people who were sacked by North after the regional forest agreement was signed? There is a guarantee here for the woodchip corporations. Where is the guarantee for the workers in the bush? You know, Mr Temporary Chairman Ferguson, as well as I do, that if I bring an amendment in here to try to guarantee those workers their jobs, this government will vote against it. What about the shedding of 40 contractors' jobs in February by North, which makes a contribution to the Liberal Party's election coffers? Is there no two-way line whereby the Prime Minister can say to that corporation, `I promised these workers jobs. The regional forest agreement was the security they wanted. You cannot do this.' Of course there is no two-way line, because the whole process is bankrupt, but the Prime Minister's signature is at the bottom of it. It is duplicitous, it is disgusting and it is unpopular, but it is funded by people who, as far as the forests are concerned, are totally unethical and immoral.
So we move into the next century under this prescription of getting rid of federal powers with the woodchip corporations in control of our forests. Not even the Labor Party dare stand against that. Well the Greens will. Again, I say that this process is in no way sealed for the next 20 years by this clause of this bill. You might get rid of the federal powers, but you do not get rid of the feeling of the Australian people for their forests, not least the indigenous people of this country. You might bring in the police and, 
 as occurred last week in Launceston, see five citizens fined $10,000 dollars all up for trying to do the job that the Hon. John Howard should be doing on behalf of this nation. Those citizens were patriotic enough to get in the way of bulldozers which are ripping into world heritage value forests that you say will be protected under this legislation. You can see how disgusting this process is—and this has the government spokesperson laughing.
—They were obstructing lawful activity, and you know it.
—What law? Here we are in the process of getting rid of laws to allow this process. So you get rid of laws for the woodchip corporations, but you bring in the penalties, you and your minions, Mr Temporary Chairman, for those citizens who want to stand in defence of our forests because they know that no future people can come back and undo the damage being done now.
What have we got in the chamber today? There are two government members; no minister for the environment; no answers given to questions; and no defence of the indefensible. In my book, the Prime Minister is on trial in this chamber today. When a Prime Minister says, `We are protecting the environment,' on the one hand and on the other hand, in this very clause, does away with 30 years of environmental laws in this Commonwealth, you can judge for yourself the integrity of this government on this issue.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—I move opposition amendment No. 8:
Clause 5, page 4 (line 20), at the end of paragraph (d), add"", except in so far as it applies to:
		 (i)	 a property included in the World Heritage List; or
		 (ii)	 a wetland included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance kept under the Ramsar Convention; or
		 (iii)	 forestry operations that are incidental to another action whose primary purpose does not relate to forestry."".
The amendment seeks to add those words at the end of paragraph (d) of clause 5, which states:
. . . section 6 of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983.
Let me outline our reasons for moving the amendment. One of the 11 national goals of the national forest policy statement is to ensure that Australia fulfils its obligations under relevant international agreements. Of course, we have ensured that that is reflected in the objects of this bill and that RFAs must have regard to those objects, including adherence to obligations under relevant international agreements.
The two key agreements are the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and 
 Natural Heritage under the auspices of UNESCO and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. These are binding agreements entered into by the Commonwealth government on behalf of the Australian people. They cannot be ignored, and their implementation cannot be simply delegated to state forest agencies.
Our amendment exactly mirrors the government's own environment protection and biodiversity conservation legislation, which has passed the parliament but has not been proclaimed into law. Our amendment needs to be made to this bill because the other legislation is not completely in place. Without our amendment this bill would totally exempt forestry operations in world heritage areas from Commonwealth protection pending the other bill coming into force. Given the government's performance on other world heritage matters, that is a risk that we believe should not be taken.
It is important to note that our amendment is narrower in its application than the 1983 World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. That act empowers the Commonwealth to also exercise planning controls over not just listed world heritage properties but also areas that are being nominated for world heritage listing or are subject to an investigation initiated by the Commonwealth into their world heritage value.
This is not to suggest that Labor believes that potential future world heritage forest areas should be overlooked; rather it is a recognition that the RFA comprehensive regional assessment process provides the appropriate mechanisms to examine whether other sections of RFA regions or areas are of world heritage value. Further possible world heritage nomination processes are explicitly addressed in some of the existing RFAs in Victoria and Tasmania.
So we ask the Senate to support our amendment for the reasons I have just outlined, and we specifically point out that if the government does oppose this amendment it is really voting against its own policy position and it will, unfortunately, be giving free rein to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr 
 Tuckey, whose antipathy towards world heritage properties is on the public record.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-01,"—The Democrats would like to indicate our preparedness to support this opposition amendment. I think in some ways the aim of it is to partly mitigate the impact of section 5, which the Democrats and Senator Brown tried to remove from the legislation—unfortunately unsuccessfully. This goes a small way towards addressing the damage that is being caused by that section remaining in the legislation and, as such, I suppose it is better than nothing, although again I think it is worth emphasising that it is very much a second or third or fourth or tenth best option. But it does ensure that the section that enables RFAs to be disregarded for the purposes of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act does not apply to properties included in the World Heritage List or Ramsar wetlands or forestry operations that are incidental to another act whose primary purpose does not relate to forestry.
So it does provide some scope back into the protections provided by the world heritage act and to that extent it is worthy of support. But again I think it must be emphasised that it is very much a second best option, still leaving widespread scope for RFAs to operate outside the requirements of federal environment protection legislation—something that the Democrats believe is a fatal and fundamental flaw in this legislation. It does not remove that fatal and fundamental flaw but perhaps makes the fatality slightly less immediate and slightly less complete, so in that sense and for that purpose the Democrats are prepared to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—As Senator Forshaw has remarked, this amendment attempts to qualify exemptions provided to RFA forestry operations under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983, and it does so by incorporating qualifications contained in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
The government does not agree that this proposed amendment is necessary. The EPBC 
 Act implements key elements of the 1997 COAG agreement by dealing with environmental assessment and approvals processes. It provides a framework for a more effective national approach to environmental management, ensuring that resources are focused on delivering better environmental outcomes at all levels of government.
The RFA provisions in that act remove the application of new environmental assessment and approval requirements under that bill while an RFA is in force. Transitional and savings provisions contained in the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 1999 provide for the continuation of relevant existing environmental legislation which would otherwise be replaced by the EPBC Act for the purposes of developing and finalising RFAs for specified reasons, and this is consistent with the COAG agreement in relation to forestry matters, which requires any arrangements entered into as part of an RFA to not be affected by these new environmental processes.
The RFA Bill provides support for RFA forestry operations by exempting such operations from existing environmental and heritage legislation. The EPBC Act complements the RFA Bill by ensuring that environmental assessment and approval requirements relating to RFA forestry operations which are satisfied under the RFA process are not revisited under the new environmental legislation while an RFA is in force. So we will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—That is just a reiteration of the government position that this is a woodchip operation and they will not have the environment getting in the way. The parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the Prime Minister, has just said that the regional forest agreements provide support to existing forest operations. You will have heard me say this before, and it is much the same elsewhere: in my state, 80 to 90 per cent and in some cases 95 per cent of those forests are going to the woodchip mills to end up on rubbish dumps in the Northern Hemisphere. Yes, this provides support for that process and, as we have just heard from the government, they do not want 
 environmental laws getting in the way of that. That says it all. I support the amendment.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—I move Greens amendment No. 6:
(9)	 Clause 6, page 4 (lines 21 to 27), omit the clause, substitute:
6  Termination of RFA by Commonwealth
		 The Commonwealth is deemed to have terminated an RFA:
		 (a)	 if a court finds that a State government which is a party to the RFA has breached a State law concerning forest management, forest industry practices or the conservation of environment and heritage values in forests; or
		 (b)	 if it has given one month's notice of the intended termination to a State government which is a party to the RFA.
We have just heard the government supporting draconian fines being placed on young people who go to the forests to try and peacefully defend them because, the parliamentary secretary said, they were breaching the laws. Let us see how consistent this standard is. The Australian Greens are here moving an amendment which says, `If the woodchip corporations breach the laws, let us have these agreements, which are therefore broken, terminated.' We will see how strong the consistency and avoidance of double standards by the government is. Paragraph (b) of the amendment says that the Commonwealth is deemed to have terminated a regional forest agreement:
if it has given one month's notice of the intended termination to a State government which is a party to the RFA.
In the future, somewhere in the next 20 years, it may be that a more enlightened government is going to respond to the majority of Australians who do not want forests being destroyed when there is a perfectly good plantation establishment to provide this nation's wood needs. The alternative is there. Maybe commonsense, if not national considerations of heritage, will come to the fore under a government which has got a heart—the heart that is missing from this Howard government. 
 And in that case we should not be trammelling a future government to being tied into an agreement. It is sensible. It allows the parliament to reflect the values of the day. It does not try to disempower future governments or parliaments in the interests of a few big, heartless woodchip corporations.
Already, since the signing of regional forest agreements, there was such illegal logging in Goolengook heritage river area in Victoria that the Kennett government, which had actually promoted and been the means by which illegal logging was taking place in heritage river areas, had to go back and retrospectively change the laws so it and its logging friends would escape legal action there. Double standards, you see. There are also problems in the Otways and elsewhere in Victoria and of course in Tasmania, and I will come back to those when this debate resumes later in the day.
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-01,"—I plan today to continue my contribution to the policy debate on rural and regional Australia. I would like to begin by repeating what I said in the chamber last week, and that is that the big challenge in rural and regional Australia, particularly given the opening up of the Australian economy to the world, is that as we move towards deregulation and globalisation it is up to government at all levels—federal, state and local—to come up with effective strategies to assist the bush to survive in this new global environment.
The debate that we face on this is really between two points of view. One is to focus on the major centres and let the smaller centres just downsize naturally, without any assistance—in other words, perhaps recognising the imperatives of a global economy and saying, `Well, the more efficient way to run things is from the bigger centres, places like Dubbo, Wagga, Tamworth and Lismore, and the smaller centres will naturally fade away.' The other view is to empower all communities, including the smaller centres, to actually leverage themselves up under local leadership to find their niche in this new marketplace. Later on in this speech today I want to go into a number of examples, a number of cameos, of small centres which in a totally economic rationalist world you would think would decline and die but have shown that they have the ability to survive and, with a little bit of government assistance and with a little bit of leadership in the local area, to find their particular niche in the world.
I favour very much this second broad approach. The reality is that the larger centres, the Waggas, the Bathursts, the Tamworths and the Lismores, will survive anyway. They will survive against the Sydneys, the Melbournes and the Brisbanes because they have enough critical mass to grow. The thing that greatly concerns me, and I bring it to the attention of the Senate today, is that they are getting a lot of their growth and taking a lot of their strength from the surrounding countryside. I used to work for a number of years in Wagga 
 in south-west New South Wales. If you look around Wagga, you see that what is happening is that the smaller centres are the ones that struggle as Wagga acts as a magnet to commerce. These are places like Junee, for example, 20 kilometres away, Cootamundra, Henty, The Rock, Mangoplah and Cookardinia—by the way, they had the greatest football team in the Riverina at the time; Mangoplah-Cookardinia United used to beat Wagga. So there is a great lot of spirit in some of these little centres. These are the ones that actually suffer as the big towns take up an increasing part of the economic framework of growth of a particular region.
So let us look at what has happened in recent times with the centralisation of commerce, with modern communications and technologies, and with modern transport means—people having greater access to cars. If you are like one of our senators who lives outside Junee, if you wanted to go shopping you might go to Junee or you might bypass that and go to Wagga, 20 kilometres away. So we have to actually build incentives into the system and help local leadership develop strategies so people are going to want to stay in local areas.
Certainly, they may go to big centres like Wagga to do a lot of their business. But we must give the smaller centres the opportunity to capture as much of that as possible so that not only the people who are actually in the little towns but also the people in the countryside will have a greater opportunity to stay in those centres. That will happen if we give this sort of assistance.
If we were not to move on strategies that would assist the small towns to survive, we would face, in terms of the whole landscape of Australia, a fairly bleak future. We would have a greatly depopulated landscape. We would have, under the alternative scenario, very few people outside the major centres. We would have rural holdings growing in size and therefore fewer people out on the land and we would have a lot fewer people in the towns that originally used to service those. So I am suggesting that maintaining a structure in rural Australia where we have big thriving centres and also have a series of increasingly 
 thriving towns and villages is a lifestyle in this country which is worth fighting for.
I would like to emphasise the role of government in particular in the survival of these sorts of locations. I want to inform the Senate of the example of a place called Walcha. Walcha is a small area: it has a town population of 1,700 and a population in the surrounding areas of 3,500. It is up on the northern tablelands of New South Wales. It is fairly close to places like Armidale and Tamworth and it is feeling the effects of the competition of those bigger centres as people increasingly move to do their shopping and business in those larger centres. A place like Walcha, which you might think with that number of people will just wither and die, really has the opportunity to fight back and government has a role in helping the Walchas of this world survive. I will give you three examples of government initiatives in the Walcha area that will help bring that about.
The first relates to the major industry surrounding Walcha, which is the timber industry. We have regional forest agreements, and we have spent a lot of time debating them in this parliament in the last two weeks. We have a balance that we still have to get right in this country between conservation and development. We have in the forests surrounding Walcha and in the traditional management practices of the timber industry the opportunity to harvest and to renew those forests in an orderly manner.
But if the state government, which has prime control over the RFA in that area, gets it wrong, what will happen in Walcha will be just what will happen in the Hunter Valley and in many towns, such as Dungog and places like Stroud and Seaham. They will die because there is not enough timber to feed the mill, the mill shuts down, the timber workers do not have a job, all the support industries go out of business and the town declines. So that is a possible future facing Walcha if the state government does not get it right.
Interestingly enough, the federal government has a role in Walcha as well, and it is one which we may not realise. This is why I would like to draw it to the attention of the Senate. In Walcha is a very advanced veterin 
 ary lab. It seems a strange place for this lab to be. It is a family business which has grown over the years and it has an international market for its product. As a matter of fact, most of its market is international because we have set up a regime—this must have been a long time ago—where the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation actually has a monopoly on some of the services that these people would like to provide. Why? It is a historical overhang which we should probably do something about because, if there are small businesses in country areas that can compete with the CSIRO, why should they not do so? This is a move that this parliament should take some interest in.
The other way in which the parliament has assisted Walcha relates to regional transaction centres, which we are setting up across the country. They are one of the major underpinnings of small country centres that can help them survive. We have seen over the years a wide range of government services disappear. Indeed, I am involved at the moment in a Senate committee inquiry, and its report which we are about to sign off—on unemployment and employment in regional Australia—has made it very clear that the government's role can be quite crucial. With regional transaction centres we have the opportunity now to rebuild the infrastructure that has been lost because of a range of government decisions.
In the case of one town, our report actually goes through what government facilities have been lost. When I looked through the list of facilities, I saw they were all state government things which have been shut down. Railways have been shut down as well as hospitals. Withdrawal of police services, the downsizing of the teaching service and a whole range of other things have been done by the state government.
What we have done federally is to come back and put in an underpinning through rural transaction centres. These are centres where people can undertake banking and a whole range of other types of activities that will help people stay in those areas. If you have to constantly drive from the farm, past the town, 
 to the city, which might be 70 kilometres away, and come back, the pressure of living in that sort of isolated environment will drive people from the land in this country. With new technology we have seen the opportunities for that to come back.
We also had a great win for the bush recently in terms of that technology, which will give people in Walcha great heart—and in many other much more remote places—when Telstra last week launched in this parliament its Big Pond advance system, which is a way of communicating in the bush via satellite. Initially terrestrial systems will be used but, where that cuts out, the system will switch to the satellite. In terms of the number of megabits per second, we were talking about normal standards of 64, but this satellite system has a standard of 200 megabits per second. The bandwidth in remote Australia under this system will jump way past what is available in the cities. So let us chalk one up for the bush there.
Through government assisting the development of these sorts of new technologies, people can live in a place like Walcha and carry on their traditional business, but they can also develop, particularly via these new communication technologies, a whole range of other businesses. One of the great things that came out of the partial sale of Telstra is the fact that, under the rural communications infrastructure fund, we put aside money—initially a quarter of a billion dollars and, out of the last sale, more again—to support these sorts of developments and a whole range of little projects out in the bush that would improve communications between people who are living outside the big cities and the people who are in those big cities.
We really need to provide those opportunities further because, if you are running a business that is communications based, you can live in a place like Walcha and, provided you have that link in communications, run whatever your business is out of that area. We have the opportunity in the next 100 years to actually turn around this depopulating development that has occurred right through this century. I have mentioned before A.D. Hope's comment about the parasitic nature of the big 
 cities and the fact that then there was a low population concentration in the country; that has now become lower. With new technology we can switch this right around and help people move out of the big cities to live in these beautiful areas that have a great lifestyle, and that will improve the lifestyle in country Australia.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-09-01,"—On Monday, 30 August, Senator Mark Bishop asked me a question on the issue of the GST and construction contracts. I seek leave to have the response incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
On Monday 30 August 1999, (Hansard page P7641) Senator MARK BISHOP asked me:
i.	 On the commencement of the GST next year, how will taxpayers determine the capital value of an incomplete commercial property as at 30 June 2000? Will that valuation include just cost to date, or could it also include cost to date plus the discounted value of future rental returns in that valuation?
ii.	 In regard to an incomplete commercial property development as at 30 June next year—which is proposed to be sold upon completion—how will the profit attribution factor be 
 calculated on the pre and post-GST profit components?
I now seek leave to have this response incorporated in Hansard.
i.	 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has been consulting with the industry on the valuation requirements.
The ATO will issue guidelines shortly on the valuation requirements under:
-	 section 19 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Act  1999 (that is, on construction contracts spanning the GST implementation date); and
-	 Division 75 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999  (that is, the margin scheme for property sales post-GST implementation).
The guidelines will take into account industry needs such as simplicity and certainty, while ensuring an appropriate basis for calculating GST liability.
For transitional valuation of construction contracts spanning the GST implementation date:
-	 if a business's records make clear the value of supplies incorporated on the building site at 1 July 2000, that will be a sufficient record for the purpose of estimating the value of an incomplete commercial property as at 30 June 2000;
-	 the valuation will not include the discounted value of future rental returns in that valuation.
ii.	 The amount of profit attributable to the pre and post-GST profit components of a commercial property development project will depend on the method used to value the property as at 1 July 2000.
-	 The guidelines issued by the ATO will ensure that an appropriate basis for attributing the profit to pre and post-GST components is used.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Incomplete Commercial Property</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1

1 September 1999",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—This amendment would mean that regional forest agreements would be terminated by illegal actions by state governments or their minions. If a court found that a state government which had signed off on a regional forest agreement had breached the state laws concerning forest management, forest industry practices or the conservation of the environment and heritage values in forests—remembering that if they do that you cannot get the forest heritage back—then the regional forest agreement would be deemed to have been terminated.
Earlier in the day, Senator Troeth, by interjection on behalf of the government, disclaimed patriotic citizens who go into the forests peacefully to protect them and who are hauled before the courts because they are in breach of laws set up by state governments under the push by the woodchip corporations to prevent them from protesting. I challenge the government to support this amendment, because in upholding the laws we cannot have double standards—at least one government senator agrees with me on that. Involved in this is a penalty if state laws are breached, the penalty being that the regional forest agreement would be terminated. Secondly, if the Commonwealth has given a month's notice of an intended termination to a state government then termination would follow. That is a power the Commonwealth needs to retain, seeing it is removing all its other powers under this legislation to protect Australia's forest heritage.
I mentioned the Goolengook heritage river area where illegal logging took place and hundreds of hectares of prime heritage forest in Victoria's East Gippsland were cut down under the direction of the authorities. If you follow the chain of command up you come to the Minister for Conservation and Land Management, Ms Marie Tehan, in Victoria. If you go further you come to the Premier of 
 Victoria, Jeff Kennett. Under those circumstances of a massive breach of Victoria's own laws—found to be so, I might add, by the Supreme Court of Victoria—what happened? Instead of there being any penalty for the woodchippers who carted those heritage forests off to Harris Daishowa's mill at Eden to be sent off to Japan, or any positive response to that from the Kennett government, they simply brought in retrospective laws to validate their illegal actions. Isn't it time we made a stand against that? Is that what we are going to continue to allow? This government will, because this government is not going to support these Greens amendments.
In the Otways in Victoria, very close to Senator Troeth's own base, there has been illegal logging in catchments and road reserves. In Victorian forest management areas there is evidence of logging levels exceeding legislated sustainable yields—that would be illegal—and of logs being downgraded for sale—and that would be illegal. What has the government got to say about that? These are regional forest agreements which were to bring peace, security and order to the forests, but since they have been signed there have been gross illegal acts by the woodchip corporations—and, at least in Victoria's case, by the government itself—in places like East Gippsland and in my home state of Tasmania, which have led to the destruction of national estate and heritage river forests. As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, once that happens, Australia has lost them forever—them and their wildlife—and they do not come back. Does Mr Howard, who, as Prime Minister, signed off on those regional forest agreements, care a twig? What is his action to ensure that these illegal acts by woodchip corporations under the said control of Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, in the case I have just outlined, stop?
Far from stopping it, the Howard government encourages it. Under this regional forest agreement this government says, `We have the example in Victoria and Tasmania'—and no doubt in Western Australia and in New South Wales—`of illegal logging under the states' own laws. What is our reaction to that? We will hand the powers that we have to 
 prevent that across to the same state governments.'
What an extraordinary thing to do, unless you understand that this government and Prime Minister Howard, through their actions, have shown that they do not care that the majority of Australians want that stopped. They do not care about the wildlife and forests of this country. I expect that they are not going to support this Greens amendment, which would give them the power to ensure that, if state governments continue to commit or allow illegal acts in the forests, the RFAs will be terminated.
If the government does not support this, let me never hear another government representative, including Senator Troeth, get up and criticise those Australians, not least the thousands of young Australians, who have gone out into the forests to protest about what is happening there. Let us have an end to this high-minded condemnation from on high of those young Australians. By opposing this motion, in effect the government is saying, `We know that the woodchip corporations and even state government instrumentalities can act illegally, and grossly so, involving millions of dollars worth of forests and their heritage, and we are actually going to abet that by giving more powers to the very people who do that.' I will remember this moment and this vote, and every time the government or anybody there wants to criticise citizens who want to protest in the forests as being law-breakers, I will remind them that they are in this process giving their tick to illegal acts in the forests of this country by the woodchip corporations and by state government instrumentalities.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-09-01,"—It will come as no surprise to Senator Brown that the government is opposing this amendment. I will remember this moment and this vote as yet another piece of evidence of the fact that Senator Brown will say and do anything to inject more uncertainty into this RFA legislation. This amendment is designed to create as much uncertainty as possible once an RFA is 
 signed, and for that reason we are strenuously opposing it.
The RFAs themselves provide the grounds on which RFAs may be terminated, and RFAs also provide a process to enable disputes to be resolved without recourse to termination. It is the overriding intention of the Commonwealth to comply with the terms of RFAs. However, this proposed amendment could lead to RFAs being terminated due to a minor technical breach of the RFA even though steps may have subsequently been taken to deal with that breach. As the amendment says, it allows the Commonwealth to terminate an RFA for any reason on just one month's notice. In relation to this point, again I will quote from the Office of General Counsel advice given on 10 August 1999, page 6, paragraph 24, which says:
The problem is that the deemed termination is expressed to take effect upon the giving of notice. In that case, what purpose does the notice serve and can it be regarded as notice of intended termination when the termination is already deemed to have occurred?
I would also like to take issue with Senator Brown on his calling upon thousands of young people going out into the forests to express their disapproval of this or any other government legislation. I would like to say to him that there are equally as many thousands of young people who depend on the timber industry for their jobs and for their parents' jobs, and they want to see this legislation go through.
In the past few days I received a media release from a community awareness campaign which is being organised in my home territory of western Victoria to highlight the economic, social and environmental benefits of an RFA and the need for a positive outcome for the timber industry. This was at Creswick in western Victoria and there were some 150 forestry workers there. Senator Brown may be interested in the fact that the timber industry injects $99 million into the Victorian economy and it employs almost 4,000 people across the western region. I am very proud to be associated with an industry which provides employment at regional levels at those levels of employment. Both as a person and as a Victorian senator, I do not 
 see any reason why the timber industry should not be given that amount of direction and facilitation through a piece of Commonwealth legislation which will enable it to carry on its industry peacefully and with such good economic outcomes.
Why shouldn't that timber industry be able to employ the number of people that it does, and why shouldn't that timber industry be allowed to carry on a perfectly legitimate business without interference from people like Senator Brown? The only encouragement that Senator Brown has ever given the timber industry in Tasmania and in other places is to organise disruptive demonstrations, to throw himself at cars in an effort to impede the cause of progress and, through his activities and those of allied political parties like his, literally scare investment away from Tasmania. Senator Brown has quoted again and again falling levels of investment in Tasmania. All I can say is that, as far as the timber industry or any allied industry looking to put investment money into Tasmania is concerned, the sorts of activities that Senator Brown has indulged in for the last 10 to 15 years make Tasmania the last place in which timber industries or allied groups would put investment money.
The fact that some industries have continued to try to develop timber and allied industries in Tasmania speaks volumes for the sort of courage that they have. Senator Brown should be the last person to talk about being worried about jobs or about industry development because it is exactly this sort of amendment which shows that he holds totally the opposite view. He is determined to destroy the RFA legislation, which in the government's view provides exactly the sort of underpinning which the timber industry needs to develop in the future.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-01,"—If Senator Brown and Senator Troeth are both going to remember this day, I am going to remember this week and last week and—at the rate we are going—we will be remembering a few weeks in the future as well. One thing that I hope I do not have to remember and that I hope people will forget is the contents of a press release that Senator 
 Brown has put out today, which he has entitled, `Forest industry chaos looms as Senate disallowance hangs over RFAs'. He says chaos in the logging industry and in federal parliament is looming `following the Senate's amendment of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill in Canberra today'. He goes on to refer to the fact that the disallowance provisions had been carried. I want to assure this chamber, the timber industry, all the state governments, the communities involved and indeed all the people of Australia that Senator Brown's claims are totally spurious. Furthermore, they demonstrate what his real agenda is.
As I have indicated previously, we have moved to put in provisions which are designed to enable public and parliamentary scrutiny of regional forest agreements for the purpose of ensuring that there is not chaos and for the purpose of ensuring that RFAs reflect the goals of the national forest policy statement. The national forest policy statement—as I have said before and as I will say again—and what has occurred since then in developing RFAs has been a process about trying to take this industry out of the chaos that has existed over the years and to bring some stability and order into it. That is what we support, that is what this legislation supports and that is what our amendments do, in improving this legislation, to ensure that stability exists.
We are confident that, providing the state governments do their job, the federal government does its job and particularly if we can get a new minister for forestry, there will be in the future regional forest agreements that will bring stability and improvements to the industry. I reject the rubbish that Senator Brown has put out, but it does demonstrate his agenda.
His agenda is further demonstrated, of course, by the amendment that we are now dealing with, which the opposition will oppose. The amendment states:
(1)	 The Commonwealth is deemed to have terminated an RFA:
		 (a)	 if a court finds that a State government which is a party to the RFA has breached a State law concerning forest 
 management, forest industry practices or the conservation of environment and heritage values in forests; or
		 (b)	 if it has given one month's notice of the intended termination to a State government which is a party to the RFA.
The first proposition, that an RFA is deemed to be terminated by the Commonwealth on the basis that there is a finding of a court in respect to what could well be a totally unrelated matter—that is, a breach of state law concerning forest management—is an absolute over-the-top proposition. It is a matter for the courts to deal with such breaches and, if necessary, impose penalties. There is no valid reason to make it a condition that any such finding that occurs automatically terminates an RFA. It is a nonsense proposition.
Secondly, the proposal that the mere giving of one month's notice of termination is sufficient to terminate an RFA is also an over-the-top proposition. It removes the very stability that the whole process is built upon—that is, agreements being entered into after a lengthy and thorough process between state governments and the federal government. To then have a provision in Commonwealth legislation which says, `All the federal government has to do is give one month's notice and that's it,' is a preposterous proposition to put.
We are talking about agreements that are negotiated to provide security of the resource and of the native forest estate for the next 20 years and, it is intended, beyond those 20 years. Take the proposition that you can develop a regional forest agreement to deal with all of that, set programs in place, declare areas reserved, declare that areas are able to be logged, promote industry development and try and promote investment. Then you have to turn around and say, `Oh, yes, but the Commonwealth can decide, just on a whim and without any reasons being given whatsoever, that with one month's notice that agreement can be terminated.'
Frankly, that is just a nonsense. I would have thought that, by putting that proposition forward, any person holding themselves out to be a legislator or a member of a legislative body, as this parliament is, not only would 
 not be doing their job but would be deliberately and wilfully trying to undermine the legislative processes of this parliament and of this country. We will not support the amendment.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-01,"—I will not go back to the response by Senator Troeth except to say that, although she cries crocodile tears about jobs in the industry, she said nothing when 400-plus jobs were lost out of the industry after the regional forest agreement was signed in Tasmania, and she will not say anything about the same thing happening in Victoria. It is the woodchip corporations not the workers that the government stands for. That is why they have no section in this legislation to make sure that workers are compensated rather than woodchip corporations. On behalf of the Australian Greens, I seek leave to move amendments 10 and 12 together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(10)	 Clause 6, page 4 (line 22), omit ""The"", substitute ""Subject to this section, the"".
(12)	 Clause 6, page 4 (after line 27), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (2)	 An agreement between the Commonwealth and a State that is:
		 (a)	 in force at the time of commencement of this Act; and
		 (b)	 expressed to be a Regional Forest Agreement;
		 is deemed to include a provision deeming the Commonwealth to have given notice of the termination of the agreement in the circumstances covered by section 4B.
	 (3)	 For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the Parliament that all RFAs that are in existence at the time of commencement of this Act be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in accordance with section 4B.
These clauses provide that there would be termination of existing regional forest agreements so that parliamentary scrutiny can take place, as it should, before they are signed.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-09-01,"—The government has called on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999  at very short notice. This demonstrates the point made by Senator Faulkner a short time ago about how quickly the agenda of this chamber can change at the direction of the government. Despite the outrageous claims made by the minister for industrial relations in the other chamber this afternoon and this morning, in terms of his public comments, it is the government that, at all times, has to take responsibility for the legislative program.
This matter has been brought on at the direction of the government and we are ready to deal with it posthaste. However, we note that there are a number of matters still outstanding in terms of advice to Senator Collins, which she has sought from a department, and I trust it will be available. We also note that there is no running sheet available for the consideration of amendments and that no Democrat amendments are being made available. This demonstrates the inadequacy of the government's planning and how totally unorganised it is. I trust that these matters will be attended to. I am confident that Senator Collins will carry forward the Labor Party's position on this, in the highly competent manner in which she always does.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-01,"—At the commencement of the second reading debate, I welcome Ian Senator Campbell, who appears to be representing the government in the debate on this legislation. Can he clarify that that is the case?
—That is the case at the moment.
—Might it change? 
—I am looking forward to your second reading contribution.
—In the spirit of cooperation, Senator Campbell, I heard from the Nursing Mothers' Association just a couple of days ago that Minister Reith had a mother-friendly workplace. I hope this trend improves in relation to how we deal with various industrial matters into the future because certainly running around this place is not conducive to my pregnancy! But, to the main points of the matter. Unfortunately—and this message is to Senator Hill—the way in which the minister and Senator Hill proceeded today in the House of Representatives and the Senate is possibly going to protract this debate rather than speed it up.
I am quite ready to stand here for 20 minutes and speak to the second reading motion. However, some of the matters which would have been more clearly refined with more adequate notice will now have to be dealt with in the committee stage. Again, in the spirit of cooperation, I am prepared to do that but, as Senator Carr mentioned, I am waiting for some advice to come back from the department before I am in a position to do so. Equally, I hope the Democrats are ready to deal with their position on this matter.
The history of this youth wages debate—or, more recently, debacle—is one that goes back quite some time. For those who have a genuine interest in the debate, it is a debate about wages and community standards. It is a debate about whether junior rates are fair in their full application in the workplace. Unfortunately, Minister Reith, as has been pointed out in the House of Representatives today, has used this issue as a political football for almost the whole time of this government, to the detriment of young workers. The opposition has not been prepared to take this stance and, to some extent, the recent reactions on this issue reflect that. The opposition has, at all times, been concerned about young workers.
Let me also express in my introductory remarks some disquiet at some of the more recent positionings on this issue by the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats do not seem to be clear on what their strategy 
 is on this matter. We initially had from the Australian Democrats last week an indication that they would seek to refer this matter to a Senate committee. Had that progressed, we would not be standing here today, because it would be with the Senate committee, on which I represent the opposition. But, no. Other Democrats saw light over the period of a week, and it has not been referred to a committee. At the time, we again indicated—and this was highlighted in the House of Representatives today—that we had no desire for this matter to go to committee. The reason we had no desire was that we had joined with the Australian Democrats some time back—some years back—in the view that the commission should determine these matters, and the commission has done so.
Senator Stott Despoja's question last week showed that she did not seem to comprehend this. Senator Stott Despoja asked Senator Alston whether there would be a process. Senator Stott Despoja, the legislation was in the House of Representatives at that point. There is a process provided in the bill—which Labor forced the government to amend—which I hope this debate will either highlight or show will be adequate to deal with the issue of age discrimination for young workers. If I do not get the opportunity to cover this point in this second reading contribution, I will do it in the committee stage of this debate. If that protracts the committee stage of the debate, so be it, because the Labor Party has taken a view which supports the future of young Australian workers. We will demonstrate that view through the Senate debate.
Let me say also, in relation to Senator Stott Despoja's actions on this matter—and I am disappointed that the Democrats are now participating in this cheap politicking—that yesterday's urgency debate was another example. Senator Stott Despoja moved a motion yesterday that the Senate urgently consider the issue of youth wages—in fact, I was pulled out of our caucus to deal with that one—and then, shortly afterwards, it was withdrawn. Either the Democrats are serious about this issue or they are not. Either you want it to go to committee, or you do not. 
 Either you understand it, or you do not—but you do not seem to. There seems to be very little evidence that the likes of Senator Stott Despoja have actually read the commission's report. This is the commission report that you guys commissioned, and yet, from the press releases I have seen, there is so very little evidence that it has been read.
Unfortunately, a sign of that little evidence was Senator Murray's press release today. Senator Murray's press release today accused Labor of doing a backflip on junior rates. Senator Murray was the one who overrode Senator Stott Despoja in the first wave of Reith reforms back in 1996 and instigated the commission process. Senator Murray is the one who is responsible for that commission process. Senator Murray is attempting to be practical, rational and credible by saying that decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis in the commission but, at the same time, he is saying that Labor is doing a backflip by supporting that very proposition. I am sorry, but the Australian Democrats cannot have it both ways.
Let me move on to Senator Carr's comments in relation to Minister Reith. What on earth motivated Minister Reith's abysmal performance in the House of Representatives in question time today? I am sorry, but that was one of the most incredible performances I have ever seen. That is the best challenge I have ever seen for the standing orders in this place, which are interpreted to mean that you cannot accuse another member or senator of being a liar. That was the best challenge to those provisions I have seen in four years in this Senate.
In one sense I am happy today that I am able to follow my leader and deal with the issue of personal explanation, because, as far as I can ascertain, no-one was asked to bring this matter on—not Senator Harradine, not Senator Brown, not Senator Murray or anyone else from the Australian Democrats, and no-one from the Labor Party. So perhaps Senator Campbell might like to give his own personal explanation, because it appears as if Minister Reith is accusing him of being the liar. That is what it appears to be.
Back to Minister Reith's motives. Why is he doing this? I suspect Senator Murray thinks that Minister Reith is doing this as some really smart political ploy to ensure that the Labor Party does not back down. Minister Reith knew that the Labor Party was not going to move away from its commitments in this area. On this occasion, Minister Reith is pulling a cheap political stunt—true to form. He is pulling a cheap political stunt to simply take the opportunity to kick the Labor Party.
There is nothing new in that for Minister Reith. The thing that has astounded me throughout my career in this place is the extent to which commentators do not understand this. He does not have a good track record. I have looked at the first wave of industrial relations reform and how his office—and he himself—behaved through that process, and, let me tell you, he would have to be one of the most disreputable ministers I have come across in this place.
I will now go to the detail of my second reading contribution and I will seek the Senate's forbearance by asking for leave to incorporate any points that I am not able to cover. Before I do that, perhaps I should also outline to the Senate the matters in the commission's report on which I am waiting for further material before the opposition can complete what would normally be a full second reading contribution on matters such as this.
The debate in the House of Representatives and some of the recent press releases from the Australian Democrats have caused me to go back to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's report and highlight various issues. There are two issues that I will be seeking to highlight both in this second reading debate and in the committee stage of this bill. But, again, I need to point out that we do not have a running sheet for the committee stage and we do not have any amendments from the Australian Democrats, even though they have told the world that they are meant to surface.
—We're not in the committee stage. This is the second reading debate. You don't have running sheets for second reading debates.
—I did not ask for a running sheet for the second reading debate; I said that we have no indication of what the running sheet will be for the committee stage. If the government is so keen for us to move quickly on this matter, I presumed you would try to do it tonight. Is that not the case, Senator Ian Campbell?
—We don't sit tonight.
—This afternoon? Is it the case that you wish to proceed to the committee stage on this matter this afternoon?
—As soon as possible. Preferably, as soon as you sit down.
—Then I would like to see a running sheet. As the Clerk has indicated, there are no amendments yet from the Democrats.
—You don't need a running sheet if there are no amendments. We'll put the question for the second reading right now and get on with the committee stage and your problems will be over. I'll thank you for your cooperation.
—No, the committee stage will not be that quick.
—Senator Collins, address your comments through the chair, please.
—Certainly, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am glad to do that through the chair because Senator Ian Campbell, of course, is feeling particularly vulnerable on this matter because he knows the status of his own position. It is an absolutely ludicrous situation that we are dealing with this bill in this environment with no running sheet to go to when the whole world knows that the Democrats had forecasted that they would have amendments to this bill.
But, again, we are actually cooperating in this matter. I am indicating that I am prepared on behalf of the opposition to incorporate much of what I or other members of the opposition would seek to cover. I am absolutely astounded at this further episode of complete mismanagement by the Manager of 
 Government Business in the Senate. But, again, that is his problem. It is his reputation. We will deal with the issues from our end at very short notice.
I will go once again to the issues that are still lacking proper delineation in the commission's report. I will highlight these matters for the benefit of the Australian Democrats. Near the conclusion of chapter 3 of the commission's report is an indication of a model that the commission is calling the commission's own `motion proposal' based on points raised by the state of New South Wales. This is their preferred position in relation to resolving the issue of age discrimination and junior rates. At point (a) on the bottom of page 124 of their report they say:
For the purposes of an award by award examination procedure, there ought to be a rebuttal presumption that junior rates are not per se  discriminatory (using the statutory technical meaning of discrimination as distinct from the simpliciter  sense of meaning to treat differently).
At point (c) they say in terms of the process:
If the presumption is in fact rebutted, the next step would be the removal, the merger, or part retention of junior rates through a work value assessment of the work carried out, if any, by juniors and by other relevant classifications covered by the award. The aim of this step would be to ensure the development of a classification structure with differentiations based objectively on: the skills required for each respective position; the work and responsibility undertaken by those employees; and the conditions under which the work is performed by each grouping.
I was absolutely sure that whoever was going to be representing the government in this debate would not be able to deal with sensible questions on this issue, so I pre-empted the matter and went directly to the Assistant Secretary to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. He has undertaken to come back to me with additional information on this matter. I can see that he is not currently here. In fact, I query whether the department is actually represented at the moment. It appears as if they are not—again, uncharacteristic for a debate on a bill. I am still waiting, for the benefit of this debate, for the government to be able to highlight to the Senate precisely their understanding of the meaning of those 
 phrases and how they believe the bill, as amended in the House of Representatives, adequately deals with those issues.
Many have raised the concern that the amendments do not adequately allow the commission to deal with the issue of age discrimination. I want to refer to a brief excerpt from the commission's report at page 135 which highlights an extreme example of some of the principles that need to be dealt with in a case by case consideration. It says half way through the top paragraph of the page:
Reversion to bare age related junior rate after a significant period of performance of duty at managerial level appears to be inconsistent with equal remuneration being given for work of equal value in the sense that the expression is used in Australian industrial principle. The value of work to be assessed under that principle may be affected or modified by the notion of maturation factors. But those factors are not contradictory to the principle itself.
What I understand that paragraph to really mean is that the commission still needs to be in a situation to assess a broad range of factors—and I think the amended bill allows for that—and those factors include such things as maturation factors. The extreme example in the report of a young person who has been working at managerial level who goes back to a position highlights that the principles underlying the issues here are equal remuneration being given for work of equal value. It is the work value principle. That is the benchmark that can be used to assess discrimination. That is essentially the point that the commission highlights on page 129 of its report, where it says:
The desirability of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives is implicit in the Act.
Let me repeat that for Senator Stott Despoja:
The desirability of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives is implicit in the Act.
And the government's amendments do not change that fact of life. It is based on work value principles. It is based on the principles I referred to a moment ago about equal remuneration being given for work of equal value. That is what it is about.
Now let me at least commence my written notes for my speech on the second reading so 
 that the rest of it can be incorporated. I mentioned the history of the debate and the sadness I have at the way in which both the Democrats and the government have used it as a political football to the detriment of young people. Labor welcomes the proposed amendments to the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999 . This bill, in its original form, was rejected in March of this year because the Labor Party could not possibly support the blind insertion of junior rates across the board into awards and agreements that do not presently have such provisions.
I wonder why, after the Australian Industrial Relations Commission handed down its report, the government introduced this bill into the House as it was—practically no change—with no consideration of the commission's report. I wonder how the government could listen to what the commission had to say and believe that it was justified in doing so. This has gone on long enough. This has been a political football for long enough, to the detriment of young people.
We listened to the commission's report. We had to be honest in our reception of the commission's report. We could not ignore it and we could not be blind to the evidence. We could have ignored the harsh reality and made platitudes about junior rates being equivalent to age discrimination, but we have not. We have listened to the commission and we have made the hard decisions as a consequence.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-01,"—I rise to speak as one of the Democrats speakers on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999 , an amended version having passed through the House of Representatives recently and, as is widely known, as a result of an agreement between the coalition and the ALP. Obviously I do not have a problem, and the Democrats do not have a problem, with anybody in this place seeking to reach agreement with other members or other parties in this place. Getting a constructive outcome is part of what the parliamentary process is about. What is more of a problem is when 
 you reach agreements that produce a bad outcome, and that is what the ALP have done.
We have seen in recent days Kim Beazley desperately talking about the need to find some relevance for the Labor Party. Now with the newly liberated state that they have found themselves in, as part of trying to find a purpose for themselves, they are trying to find something to do a deal with. That is fine; the trouble is that they have done a terrible deal. Senator Collins continually goes on about how terrible it is that this issue has been a political football between the parties for so many years. I guess their solution is to blow the full-time whistle and ensure that it is locked in for all time that young people will be discriminated against and that they will be worse off. And the ALP, for whatever reason, now feel that they have not been able to find a constructive and positive outcome to the issues that have been raised so many times: the need to ensure a fair go for younger people and the need to ensure that young people are not the football of employers, that they are not kicked around from one spot to the next and that they are not treated as second rate citizens purely on the basis of their age. That is what being treated like a political football is all about, and that treatment will now be locked in for all time as a result of the agreement that the ALP have reached with the coalition on this particular issue.
The coalition never made any secret of their desire to ensure that this unfair treatment was locked in—that younger people are treated as second-class citizens in a way almost unparalleled in the world in the extent of discrimination that they face and in the extent of the disadvantage that they face in doing the same job as other people and yet getting a lower rate of pay. The Labor Party have decided that they will back the coalition's agenda, an agenda which they have to concede, in deference to the coalition, has been an open agenda for many years. They have now decided to back that agenda because they have been unable to find any other way to make themselves politically relevant. It is a pity that their political relevance has had to come at the expense of young people whom they 
 made so much noise about trying to protect for so long.
Throughout this debate, in the second reading stage and in the committee stage when we get to it, my colleagues and I will be able to draw on, in great detail, the supposedly principled words of Labor senators in this place in 1996, including Senator Collins, when they highlighted their supposed commitment to ending this discrimination, to ensuring that this unfairness was not entrenched and to finding a way of helping young people and ensuring that that second-rate status was not maintained. Yet now, when the crunch actually comes, some desperate need for political relevance or some strange sense of liberation has driven them into the arms of Peter Reith's agenda, not only locking in the certainty of continuing discrimination in the workplace for young people on the basis of age but also providing a mechanism for it to be extended. And that I find quite breathtaking.
Senator Collins—and, I am sure, any other ALP speakers who try to defend the indefensible on this issue—will spend a lot of time, for some reason, attacking the Democrats. Senator Collins spent a lot of her speech doing that, and the farcicality and cheapness of the comments in which she seemed to be trying to suggest that the Democrats had not read the commission's report hardly need emphasising.
It is clear from Senator Collins's comments that she may have read the report, but it was certainly a very selective reading and clearly not getting at the basis of the issues that the whole report was meant to try to address. Similarly, obviously she has not read or was not listening to Senator Stott Despoja's question last week to Senator Alston in relation to junior rates of pay. Somehow or other she seemed to think it was about process rather than the basic issue of why Australia will now, as a result of this agreement with the ALP, continue to share with the Netherlands the distinction of being virtually the only industrialised country to regard 19-, 20- and 21-year-old workers as juniors when it comes to pay rates, even though they are considered full adults for the purposes of most 
 other legislation. That is what the question was about. Where she gets this idea of process and such from I do not know. Obviously she was not able to read the Hansard from last week, let alone the commission report.
It is worth looking at the defence that Senator Alston used in response to that question. It is the nub of what this debate is about. I am surprised in a way that the ALP did not use that defence as well. They haven't to date, perhaps because it is so farcical that even they cannot bring themselves to raise it. It was simply on the basis that somehow or other this protects young people's jobs, protects the jobs of 21-year-olds if they get paid less than someone who is 24 and does the same work with the same degree of skill and experience. Why should that apply in particular for 21-year-olds? You may as well say the same for 50-year-olds.
A lot of older workers are having trouble maintaining their jobs. Why don't we argue that their pay rates be dropped because that would help their job to be preserved? The idea that somehow or other, because someone's age is 21, their job is preserved if they get paid less than everyone else makes no sense unless you try to suggest that it applies to everybody else. Of course, the agenda of driving down workers' wages across the board is something that I am sure some members of the coalition, including the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, would be quite keen to do, but again it is quite astonishing that the ALP would be willing to associate itself—as the party of the workers, the party of the unions—with any move that would ensure lower wages and worse conditions.
The degree of outrage from significant sectors of the trade union movement is not surprising because they know this is not about protecting jobs; they know it is about driving wages down. That is what this legislation will do. It will ensure that significant numbers of younger people's wages will remain lower and it will actually put pressure on wages across the board. Again, it is quite astonishing that this is the solution after all these years and that, after all the fine words of three 
 years ago when the workplace relations legislation went through in October 1996, this is the best solution that the ALP could come up with.
Senator Collins seems to focus on some sort of suggestion that the Democrats have not been sure which way to go with this. It seems the best she can do, rather than trying to actually defend the indefensible with what the ALP has done, is to say bizarre things like, `We haven't got a running sheet yet,' even though we are just starting the second reading debate. It is quite astonishing.
It is worth pointing out to the chamber that the Democrats' amendments had been circulated even though we are just at the second speaker in the second reading stage of this debate. Somehow or other she thought that withdrawing an urgency motion was some indication of not knowing what we were about. Senator Collins may not have noticed—I am sure other senators did—that there was a very important debate in this chamber yesterday afternoon on native title regulations and a disallowance on native title. That was the last day that that regulation could be disallowed, that that disallowance could be debated. If there had not been a vote on that disallowance motion by the end of business yesterday, then the instruments would have taken effect by default. That is a highly inappropriate way, I am sure all senators would agree, for a matter, particularly of that importance, to be determined.
In trying to facilitate the opportunity for as many senators as possible to have the opportunity to comment on that important matter, we withdrew the urgency motion because it would have taken up an hour that the Senate did not have because of the need to dispense with the native title regulations on that particular day. I suppose that is the sort of thing you have to expect from a party that really has no ability to defend what it has done in this area. Even quite normal attempts to facilitate the progress of business in this chamber get used as some feeble form of political attack.
A similar attitude was taken to the Democrats referring a matter to the committee for examination. It is quite clear that neither of 
 the other parties in this place wanted it referred to a committee. The one piece of legislation on which the ALP quite clearly had a view as to whether or not to refer it to a committee was this particular one. That is simply because they did not want examination in any detail of the very shabby and poor deal they have done. As I said at the start, I do not have a problem with deals; I do have a problem with bad deals, appalling legislation and entrenched discrimination. Clearly, the ALP did not want the opportunity for a committee to examine in detail how hollow and how feeble this agreement is between the ALP and the coalition. They did not want to have significant numbers of trade unions coming in and highlighting to them how atrocious this agreement is.
—You are a de facto partner.
—Senator George Campbell is saying that Democrats are in a de facto coalition with the Liberals. You may have noticed that you guys are voting with the coalition on this one. It might not have caught your attention yet. Maybe you are still back in 1996 and think you have the right approach on this legislation, but I should inform you that the rest of your party have actually sold out on this legislation from where they were three years ago and you guys are going to vote with the coalition on this. The Liberals and Labor are voting together on this legislation. How that makes the Democrats some de facto member of the coalition is beyond me, but again that is the extent of the defence of the ALP. They are throwing irrelevant lines like that around the place in some sort of defence of the indefensible.
As I said at the start and have said again since, I will happily reach agreement on any legislation with the Liberals or with the ALP if I think it is a positive legislative outcome. Obviously what we have here is an appalling legislative outcome; that is what I am criticising. You vote together all you want. I will vote with you if it is something that is good. This is appalling and you cannot expect us to support something so hopeless.
When we look at the explanatory memorandum and at the aims contained within it, 
 we see that the legislation seeks to permanently exempt junior rates of pay and certain types of trainee wage provisions from the operational provisions intended to prevent and eliminate age discrimination in awards and agreements. It locks it in permanently. That is what this legislation seeks to do—and with the support of the ALP as it has been amended. It would be almost too easy to quote all the remarks from the ALP which were made three years ago. I think I will leave it to my colleagues to do that because there are so many. If I do so we will be here all week at least. I refer to all those supposed `high principle' words which were made not just three years ago but many times since then. I quote:
Similarly, when employers say that they will sack young workers if they are forced to pay them competency based wages instead of discriminatory youth wages, we need to expose their hypocrisy.
That is a direct quote from Christian Zahra in the lower house on 23 November 1998. He continued:
We need to stand against this unjust age discrimination and fight on behalf of young workers who are clearly being exploited.
Obviously the ALP has given up the fight. Obviously the need to be relevant, to be liberated from its previous role in life, has led it to fall away from what were quite good and strong-sounding words. Something as normal, I would have thought, as another party in this chamber reaching some agreement with the government on legislation has meant it having to backflip on a fundamental issue. It is certainly fundamental to the Democrats. It is something that we have highlighted as being important to the party time and again over the years.
I would have thought that, if anything was fundamental to the purpose and the reason for being of the ALP, it would have been something as basic as working conditions for younger people and the impact on wage rates for all workers. Maybe this is another example and another sign of the ALP not knowing what its reason for being is anymore. It does not know what its role is in the political spectrum anymore and this is what it has come to. It is a great shame in many ways that that is the case, but obviously it is a 
 much greater shame for the young people who are now going to be permanently discriminated against as a result of this legislation—in a way that young workers do not have to experience almost anywhere in the world. It is quite breathtaking.
Senator Collins's great interest in seeing the Democrats' amendments, I hope, is a sign that when we reach the committee stage of the legislation the ALP will consider them seriously, take them on board and perhaps look at trying to improve the legislation. That is what the Democrats are trying to do, and will continue to do, during the committee stage. I urge opposition members, and government members for that matter, to examine the Democrats' amendments. I imagine we will reach the committee stage some time tomorrow if we continue on with this legislation, so there will be plenty of time to examine the amendments.
As Senator Collins has said, this issue has been around a long time. It has been to the Industrial Relations Commission for significant examination and many of the Democrat amendments are based on the findings of that report, but they are also based on the fundamental principles that the Democrats have outlined time and again—going back many years—about the need to ensure that employers are not able to permanently exploit workers purely on the basis of age. To suggest that somehow or other that protects jobs is almost laughable. It is the sort of remark we get from Minister Alston in question time because he has to fill up the space somehow or other. It is sad to hear others in this place putting forward arguments such as that.
There is one other furphy that I would like to nail in relation to this issue. It is often put about in the general community that somehow, if this bill did not go through, if the exemption for junior wages did run out next year and the discrimination ended, it would lead overnight to 16-year-olds being paid full adult wages. Clearly that is not the case and it would not happen. It is a widespread misunderstanding amongst the public that the position the Democrats are taking, and have taken consistently over many years, would mean 15- and 16-year-olds automatically 
 getting paid full wages. That is another fatuous falsehood put about by many people. What it would ensure is that workers get paid on the basis of the job they perform—the same as workers in the same workplace who are 30 or 40. That would extend to all workers.
There is nothing magical about turning 21 or 22 in the workplace that means that you are necessarily deserving of more pay or doing a better or more difficult job. Similarly, there is nothing magical about turning 25, 30 or 35. The attempt to maintain the fiction that that is a reasonable basis for determining wage rates is the nub of this whole debate. There is a lot of heat and light around and a lot of feeble insults are being thrown to try to hide that fact, but that is the simple and fundamental fact; that is the foundation of this legislation. Unfortunately, as a result of this legislation, unless the ALP does give serious consideration to the Democrat amendments and to the very significant and legitimate community concern about this issue, we will be faced with that farcical principle being entrenched in legislation on a permanent basis.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-09-01,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, as I foreshadowed in my speech at the second reading stage, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in Hansard.
—Is leave granted?
—I was just commencing chamber duty when this matter came up. Senator Campbell said to me that, if leave were granted, it would be appropriate for me to say that the usual courtesy should be extended by my being able to see it. If I can look at the end of the speech, I will grant leave. I will withhold granting leave until I have seen it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-09-01,"—I rise to speak in this debate principally to put on the record some of the myths that exist in respect of junior rates of pay. As has been indicated, the ALP is supporting the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999 . The original proposals put by 
 Minister Reith would have been the worst possible outcome for young people in this country. The bill was completely inadequate, as was the government's response to the report of the inquiry into junior rates of pay by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
The ALP position inserts into the bill the provisions for (1) providing discretion to the AIRC to look at each case on its merits, (2) placing the onus of proof on the applicant party through any change and (3) ensuring that the law does not force the extension or removal of junior rates of pay in a blanket fashion but rather provides a framework for case by case determination. This legislation guarantees the independent role of the AIRC in these matters while ensuring that the commission considers the promotion of youth skills, youth employment and community standards in making decisions.
Junior rates of pay were developed at the beginning of this century and are clearly no longer appropriate as we move into the next century. They are a flawed concept and there is no logical or practical reason for their existence. There are many reasons to remove them, and no reason to keep them in place. Since they were first developed, junior rates of pay have not undergone any significant reform. The nature of the junior rates system contained in awards is incoherent, inconsistent and outdated.
Adult rates from 1986 were subjected to award restructuring to fix this exact problem. There were large discrepancies between wage rates across industries and even in workplaces. The restructuring process moved to modernise awards and eliminate discriminatory differences between them. Junior rates of pay have never been subjected to this process. For example, a 15-year-old employed in the printing industry is entitled to a minimum rate of only $3.08 per hour while the minimum rate of pay for a 15-year-old shop assistant in Victoria is $5.69 per hour. Neither the nature of the work done nor the skills used account for the substantial difference. Another example is where a 15-year-old factory hand under the metals award is paid $3.79 per hour. Employed as a shop assistant in New South 
 Wales the same person would get $4.55 per hour. The shop assistant minimum wage is 20 per cent higher than that of the factory hand. Joe de Bruyn, secretary of the SDA, said:
Workers in fast food outlets and supermarkets are doing exactly the same work as their counterparts aged 21 years and over.
That union has something like 75 per cent of unionised teenage workers as its members. The only argument being used for junior rates of pay is one that we have heard many times before, and Minister Reith uses it again in his second reading speech:
In summary, the commission's report finds that junior rates are important for getting young people into jobs, that none of the alternatives put to the inquiry are feasible replacements for junior rates, that any move to abolish junior rates would cost young people jobs, and that the introduction of adult wages at 18 would have significant disemploying effects.
The rhetoric is that if we keep the wages of young people down, if their wages are less than we pay to adults, they will  suddenly be employed because new jobs will be created. Absolute bunkum.
Junior rates of pay for young workers in OECD countries are quite common, but their absence is more pronounced. Junior rates of pay have been a part of the Australian workplace for the last 100 years and for the last 100 years there has been no correlation between junior wages and the employment levels of young people. The report of the AIRC inquiry into junior rates of pay, released on 24 June, gave a number of examples of the utilisation of junior rates by employers over this period. However, it also gave examples and summaries of work where, over many years, junior rates have been ignored as the job performed by the younger workers was equal to, if not better than, that performed by those over the age of 21.
For example, as far back as 1913 the non-trades builder's labourer or construction hand in the building and construction industry appears from the outset to have been conceived as a kind of able-bodied trades assistant paid at full rate. No junior rate was provided by the awards. Lads, or junior workers, would be among those employed under the flat rate for all of one shilling and 
 4½ pence per hour, determined for the labourer's classification.
To similar effect, in 1937, the Public Service Arbitrator, Westhoven, said about state railway construction work for juniors:
The youth of 19 or 20 strong enough to be, and who is, employed on ordinary construction work is usually paid as an adult.
The OECD Employment outlook  of June 1999 discusses the issue of youth and minimum wages and the transition from school to work for young people. While it is argued by some that high minimum wages destroy jobs and have a limited impact on poverty, Card and Krueger have argued that minimum wage increases can, in some circumstances, result in net jobs gained rather than the losses predicted by conventional wisdom. Card and Krueger's research deals specifically with young workers. When examining the effect of rises in minimum wages on youth unemployment, they discovered that there is a negligible impact. In France, for example, the teenage employment to population ratio declined by over 18 per cent between 1975 and 1996 but the rise in minimum wages relative to average wages accounts for less than half a percentage point of this decline. In Australia the largest single industry employing young people in our economy is the retail sector. The retail sector also has consistently higher minimum rates of pay than any other sector for young people.
In a speech to the Senate on 8 March this year, I argued that the reality is that junior rates of pay are not the problem in terms of unemployment of young people. If they were, then the problem would be easily resolvable. I will give you an example in my own state. In the 12 months to December 1998, the average full-time youth unemployment rate in the Illawarra statistical district was 27.9 per cent. In the Richmond/Tweed/Mid North Coast statistical district, the rate was even higher at 35.8 per cent. In comparison, adult unemployment for the month of December 1998 was 10.9 per cent in the Illawarra and 12.9 per cent in the Richmond/Tweed/Mid North Coast district.
The AIRC reports that full-time labour force participation among young people has 
 collapsed over the last 30 or so years. In 1966, teenagers comprised 14.1 per cent of the entire full-time work force with some 615,000 employed, when junior rates of pay were in full bloom in awards in this country. By March 1999, only 220,700 teenagers were employed full time, although in the meantime the entire work force had in fact grown 1½ times larger. The proportion of teenage to full-time workers had plummeted to 3.4 per cent.
This decline has been partly offset by a growth in the level of part-time employment. Wooden shows that the part-time share of employment of 15-year-old to 19-year-old males grew from 5.2 per cent in 1966 to 49.3 per cent in 1995. For all males, the corresponding growth was from 3.7 per cent to 11.1 per cent. Part-time employment of 15-year-old to 19-year-old females grew from 6 per cent in 1966 to 72.3 per cent in 1995. For all females, the corresponding growth was from 24 per cent to 42.7 per cent.
The reason there are fewer entry-level jobs for young people is that, as a result of structural changes in the economy over the past decade or so, these jobs have disappeared out of our economy. The number of apprenticeships and traineeships has fallen. Job opportunities in the banking industry and the finance sector—which was a major employer of young people—have gone. Technological change, privatisation and corporatisation and a contraction of the public sector have displaced them. Through structural change we have abolished thousands and thousands of what were essentially job opportunities for young people. They have not been replaced within our economy. The only way in which we will get those young people back into jobs is by putting resources into skills and training for them that match the gaps in the labour market. If you want to create jobs for young people in this economy, that is the way to do it, not by forcing down the level of their wages, which will not in itself create one job.
Junior rates extend in almost all cases to young workers up to the age of 21. In our society you are considered an adult at 18 years of age. At 18 you carry out all of the responsibilities of an adult. You can legally 
 enter into binding contracts. You can be jailed. At 18 years old you get all adult rights except one: you can vote, you can make independent decisions and you can get married, but still you can be paid less than someone over 21.
The junior rates system is discriminatory and has to be developed. I believe that people should be paid in a system based upon competency and skill. Regardless of age, if someone has the skills and can do the job they should be paid the full wage. Young people, if they are not as skilled or competent as someone older, will be paid less but must be paid according to their ability and must be given an opportunity to gain skills and to progress.
Doug Cameron, the National Secretary of my own union, the AMWU, said:
The AMWU has always said that the apprenticeship system was a model that combined quality training, career path opportunities and wages set at a level that recognise mutual benefits to apprentices and employers . . . junior wages does not fit this model and means increased discrimination, inequality and an inevitable reduction of apprenticeship and quality training opportunities.
In its report, the AIRC was constrained by government imposed limits. Due to this, it was not able to consider alternatives to the system of junior rates of pay. In fact, it said in its report:
We do not close off the possibilities that there are feasible alternatives. We explored the possibility of developing our own proposal but did not persevere. We are already persuaded that in the design and replacement of junior rate classifications no one size fits all . . . The Industrial parties and other interested parties would need to be involved and that procedure fell outside the statutory limits of our inquiry.
Why was this not referred back to the AIRC? Why were fresh terms of reference not issued to the commission to come up with some solutions? At the end of the day, much more needs to be done in this process. We need to define the term `junior' so that it accurately reflects the definition in our society. A junior is someone who is not yet an adult. In our society, someone that is under 18 years of age is a junior. To have junior rates of pay extend to age 21 is both outdated and in direct contravention of society's values.
If you look very carefully at the home page of the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, under the `Youth Life Force' topic heading, you will see the youth wage position paper, the submission to the AIRC inquiry into junior rates by the Premier's own Youth Council. One of the key recommendations of the council, as submitted to the inquiry, was a proposal that the age structure for junior rates be altered. While progressions in wages would still be in place for young people between the ages of 16 and 18, the Youth Council proposed that the full adult wage be payable at 19 years of age in recognition that by this age a person has the responsibility of an adult and can perform with the productivity and maturity of older workers. The Victorian Premier's Youth Council clearly has more of an idea about the issues in this debate than does the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. It recognises that the skills, maturity and contribution that young people can make do not magically appear upon attaining 21 years of age. They can and do contribute at this higher level for many years before this and should be recompensed accordingly.
This legislation is not a solution to the lack of employment opportunities for young people. All it does is defer the inevitable. In the face of a fierce ideological push by this government to entrench junior rates of pay, this bill, as amended by the ALP, gives young workers at least some hope. At the end of the day it is not a solution. The only solution is to develop a system based on skill and competency that delivers training opportunities for young people from the moment they leave school to enter the work force. Yet all we have seen under the Howard government are cuts to assistance mechanisms for young people. The Skills Development Council has been slashed. Apprenticeships need to be given a greater importance. And the Work for the Dole scheme for our unemployed young people offers no skilling or training when employers are desperately seeking skilled workers. We have seen recent announcements by Telstra, for example, of the need to look to developing something like 30,000 skilled workers in the IT industry. There is a push to have workers brought in from overseas to 
 meet those skill deficiencies in that industry when there are real opportunities to put effort into skilling and training young people in this country to fill those job vacancies.
The AIRC report into junior rates highlights that the employment provided to teenagers is seldom accompanied by formal training. The number of 15- to 19-year-old employees who received in-house training more than halved between 1989 and 1993, falling from 147,000 to 65,000. This puts an even greater onus on the government of the day to provide training and education for our young people so they can successfully make the transition from school to work.
The OECD employment outlook June 1999 analysis of the transition from school to work suggests that collective bargaining structures are better contexts for new school leavers to get into employment, as are well-developed apprenticeship systems. There is a variety of mechanisms that can be applied to deal with the questions of wages, wage rates and wage relativities of young people in employment. They go to the question of skills and training and the type of policy settings that were adopted by the Labor Party when it was in government in terms of the youth trainee wages, which is one element of the process.
If there is to be a junior wage, it should be a training wage. Paying all young workers less, simply because of their age, will not create significant employment opportunities, which is the fundamental challenge that faces this parliament. It is a fundamental challenge that is not being addressed by the approach that is being taken with respect to this legislation. While the ALP has to make amendments to it that will take some of the pressure, burden and onus off young people, the reality is that the focus has to be upon developing an integrated skills and training process that will equip young people for the jobs that are now available in the labour market of 1999 and 2000 and not what existed in the labour market of the 1950s.
—Before I call you, Senator Allison, I have a matter already before the chair, and that is the incorporation of part of the speech of Senator Collins on the second 
 reading debate. Leave was sought for that to be incorporated. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.
The speech read as follows—
It is unfortunate that the Democrats feel the youth have been betrayed by these amendments. We certainly do not. We listened to the AIRC and we considered their findings and then we faced the facts. We were able to get the government to bend in their stance on this issue. The government wanted blanket insertion of junior rates into every industry and award. They wanted to remove power from the AIRC and their ability to consider the merits of doing this.
These amendments now reflect Labor's policy position, that is to give power to the AIRC to decide the merits of retaining, inserting or abolishing junior rates on a case by case basis. The Government, through this bill in its original form, sought to tie the AIRC's hands. Had it been passed it would have ensured that all junior rates provisions would have been enshrined with limited scope for the Commission to make an independent decision. I would have thought that an independent industrial arbiter was critical to our democratic future. At a time when it is under threat from a conservative government, one might expect the Democrats to stand up and fight for its independence. But not so.
If the original bill had been passed, joint consideration of the competitiveness of young workers and equality of treatment of those workers would have been effectively removed from the hands of the industrial umpire. The competitiveness of young people in the labour market is as much determined by their skills as it is by their wages.
In looking at the youth wages issue, and its relationship with youth employment and fairness, we have been honest about what the evidence has thrown up. If there is one message that we have repeated in the two months since the commission's report, it is that we must seriously challenge ourselves as to whether we are doing the best we can for young people.
While we acknowledge the importance of youth employment, there are genuine differences of opinion on the relationship between wages and employment. We continue to reject the government's simplistic characterisation of what is a complex issue.
Labor has consistently argued that there is more to the labour market than wages. We are asking the AIRC to take into account a range of factors—and we are making that requirement explicit. Skills are critical. So we inserted words requiring the AIRC to consider skills. Fairness is critical, so we inserted words requiring the AIRC to consider communi 
 ty standards. We said that, above all, we must be prepared to challenge ourselves, we must have an open mind. So we inserted the capacity for the AIRC to consider new proposals on a case-by-case basis. These amendments rule nothing in or out. What they do is give parties an opportunity to argue their case. But they do so in a clearly articulated context.
In his press release of 24 June—a press release that has mysteriously disappeared from their website and from the Parliamentary Library—Senator Murray supported the case-by-case approach. That was not the position of Senator Stott-Despoja that same day, but that is what his press release says.
The Commission has not closed off the possibility that there are feasible alternatives, and neither has Labor. That is why we have established the capacity of the commission to consider alternatives on a case-by-case basis. And we have outlined the context in which that must occur- with reference to employment, skills and community standards. The onus is now clearly, in this balanced context, on the proponents of change.
Community Standards
I am surprised that the Democrats don't consider community standards to be an issue in this debate. In fact, they gave it so little consideration that it was not even included in the terms of reference for the AIRC's inquiry. An 18 year old is, in the eyes of the community and the economic structure of this country, an adult for all intents and purposes. At age 18, people are entitled to be regarded as adults. We believe that is what the community expects—we believe that to be a fair thing.
There have been some suggestions that further consideration of junior rates for 15, 16 or 17 year olds needs to be had. But at 18 years of age you are an adult, you lead the life of an adult. The community expects this. But does the community also expect you to do that on a lower wage than other adults? The commission must still resolve this matter.
Employment
Labor starts from the presumption that youth unemployment is a multi-faceted problem, which must be tackled on a number of fronts.
The youth labour market is vulnerable. It has been subjected to a number of major changes over the past two decades. Of these, the most significant include:
.	 A major shift away from full-time employment and towards part-time employment.
.	 Employers have increasingly utilised part-time employment to achieve greater flexibility in managing staff resources in response to increased competition. The strong growth in service industries, and their increased emphasis on more 
 flexible service delivery (particularly trading hours), has also contributed to the growth in part-time employment.
Because of its vulnerability, Labor has every intention of getting it right. Because of its vulnerability, we believe the community would want us to err on the side of caution in removing age-based discrimination.
An example that has been raised is through gradual phasing out of junior rates and a gradual phasing in of competency based pay, to minimise any impact on the labour market.
While we are aware that many people won't see the Minister's backdown as a victory for Labor, I hope that in the time ahead of us, they come to see it as a sign that Labor is serious about getting youth employment right. Because despite the government's rhetoric, Labor in our last term made greater inroads into youth unemployment reducing it by 31,000—than the 23,500 the coalition has reduced it by in three and a half years.
Skills
The issue of youth wages is a complex one precisely because it involves potential trade-offs between youth employment and fairness for young people. To complicate things, it also has implications for the incentives for young people to invest in skills acquisition.
Why would an 18 year old undertake extra training for their job, when, on completion of that training they see no reward. Their skill level is the same as a 23 year old who undertook the same training, but their pay is 30% less. This 18 year old is treated as a junior, even though they would be doing the same volume of work, the same range of tasks and working under the same conditions. When they get on the bus to go home, they are also expected to pay adult fares—I will take that argument further in just a moment.
First I want to say that it is because of this complexity that Labor has achieved a situation in which these matters can be considered in a framework that seeks to balance these factors.
That framework makes it clear that we will not look at wages independent of skills. For instance the work value principle has become an accepted standard, both industrially and socially. It is clearly intended that this principle is captured within the terms ""skills"" and ""community standards"".
Conclusion
Labor argued vigorously against the insertion of youth wages into areas where they do not presently exist. We will continue to do so. The government has finally accepted Labor's position on this matter- a position that we have reiterated consistently since the AIRC report. 

We said we would await the AIRC report. I seem to recall the Democrats also did at the time, and I await with interest to hear the Democrats rationale for why we should go beyond the Commission's decision and introduce by legislation an age of majority at 18, 19, or 20 years.
Some Democrats have expressed outrage on behalf of young people. I ask them to have a look at what the AIRC report actually says. The AIRC had a substantial body of evidence before it. you set up the inquiry—although I must admit that I find it surprising that in your terms of reference there was no recognition of community standards, no requirement of fairness—now you must examine the findings. You said that you accept the approach for justifying junior rates or skill-based alternatives on an industry or award basis. You said you could live with that.
Labor can live with that too. Understand that Labor has not done a backflip on our position. We want what is best for young people, so we had to consider the findings of an independent body. Although we believe there could be a better solution, we could not blindly pursue our ideals in the light of these findings. The amendments before the Senate provide certainty. Thankfully, the government has given its word that it will not be introducing legislation to give effect to its preferred position in the life of this parliament. We take them on their word on that.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-01,"—First of all, I briefly commend Senator George Campbell on his remarks. There is more there, I think, that the Democrats would say they agree with very strongly than disagree with. In fact, we most definitely agree that there is a need to define what is junior. We agree too that under 18 is very preferable to 22, which is what the ALP will agree to in their amendments. Senator George Campbell is right too that this legislation is not the solution. For that reason, I would have thought the ALP should vote it down but, instead, we have an amendment which really does nothing to improve the work opportunities or the discrimination against young people that are inherent in this bill.
Tonight I want to talk about leadership, about liberation from policy and perhaps principles, about consistency, and about Mr Beazley and the Labor Party. Like many Australians, including 100,000 members of the shoppies union aged under 21, I am trying to work out why Mr Beazley and Labor have backflipped so spectacularly on the issue of 
 youth wages. I am sure that Senator Collins, Senator Bishop and Senator Hogg—all former officials of the SDA—are in the same quandary, and I look forward to hearing their views on the issue later in this debate.
But today I want to go back in history a little. In December 1993 the Labor government, through then Senator Bob McMullan in the Senate and Mr Laurie Brereton in the House, accepted a Democrat amendment to outlaw discrimination on the basis of age, sex, sexual preference and physical disability—the award review process would eliminate such provisions from awards. Kim Beazley was then employment minister and, as far as I can remember, raised no objections. In May 1994, the Working Nation white paper, of which Mr Beazley's current deputy, Mr Simon Crean, was a major author, again committed the government to abolishing age based discrimination, but over a three-year transitional period for abolishing junior rates. The paper says, on page 34:
The Government supports the transition, over time, to competency based arrangements from the current system of age based wages for young people.
The Democrats agreed to the three-year transition period to 1997, and the Labor government started working with the ACTU on the junior rates test case.
In October 1996, the ALP, now led by Mr Beazley, stridently opposed the amendments to the workplace relations bill moved by the Democrats to extend that date by three years and to institute a junior rates review by the AIRC because of the failure of the test case to come up with a viable alternative model. Labor's Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Sherry, a former Miscellaneous Workers Union official, said—
—That's the wrong union.
—Perhaps you should listen to this, Senator. He said:
Junior rates should be abolished next year because they permit discrimination between two workers simply on the basis of age, even though they are doing the same work and have the same experience . . . 
He described the issue as:
. . . a very critical area. 

Three former SDA officials and now ALP senators, Senators Hogg, Collins and Bishop, all opposed the amendments to defer the abolition of junior rates, with Senator Hogg telling the Senate that all junior rates did was supply employers with `cheap fodder'. We could not agree more.
In December 1998, when Mr Peter Reith started his push to repeal the provisions he had agreed to two years before, Mr Beazley challenged him in the parliament. Mr Beazley endorsed the view of shoppies union head, Joe De Bruyn, who said:
The real issue being that, with junior rates, you have got discrimination and that is simply not acceptable in society today . . . 
as `a sensible position'. Again, Senator Campbell has echoed those words. On 10 February 1999, shadow employment spokesperson and former ACTU President Martin Ferguson was urging the House to:
. . . examine and read in detail the submission from the Shop Assistants Union to the junior rates inquiry.
Mr Ferguson said:
Whilst acknowledging that in some cases there is a need potentially for junior rates of pay—but not across industry in general—it argues that equal work for equal pay is an important principle. If two people are standing side by side doing work of equal value, why should they be paid differently just because one is 18 and the other 28 or 38? That is the real issue before the chair today.
Mr Ferguson went on to say:
I am not prepared to stand by and allow employers to discriminate against young people . . . 
One person who obviously read the shoppies' submission was his boss, Mr Beazley. This is because a key point made in the shoppies' submission is that an adult rate should be paid from 18 years of age onwards, recognising the cost of living of most 18- to 21-year-olds living away from home and their work value.
On 11 March 1999, Mr Beazley thundered in the House about the inequity of over 18-year-olds being treated like kids, accusing the government of wanting to:
. . . turn young adults into juniors.
I might quote at length from Mr Beazley because he put it so eloquently:
Do you kid yourselves that 19- and 20-year-olds in our community do not have family responsibilities, because there are plenty that do. There is no suggestion that, if they have a couple of kids, there would be any exemption from the processes that the government is putting in place. If you are a young truck driver aged about 19 and with family responsibilities, you are likely to be deprived of $80 a week in your wages if you are then subject to an extension of junior awards or junior rates into the 18- to 21-year-old categories. Those aged 18 to 21 years vote, they marry, they have children, they enter into contracts, they have legal obligations and they are entitled to be worthy of their hire.
My colleagues and I agree wholeheartedly with the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. A young person aged 18 years is an adult, and should be treated like an adult for the purposes of wages, as they are in all but a mere handful of OECD countries. Mr De Bruyn must have been very pleased to see Mr Beazley endorsing his union's view on junior rates.
On 24 June this year, three months later, with the release of the AIRC submission on junior rates, Mr Beazley argued that the AIRC should be allowed to review junior rates, award by award, free from any presumption about junior rates. He said:
What will you give the young people of this country if you want to impose on the commission a presumption—not allowing the commission to conduct its affairs on a case-by-case basis but telling the commission that they will produce a junior wages level if a young person is employed in an area, with no obligation on the employer to argue why that should be so.
Mr Beazley slammed Mr Peter Reith and his bill as `reneging on that agreement with the Democrats'. He said:
. . . this whole thing before us is a massive piece of slipperiness on his part.
He also said that Mr Reith's was a `completely and utterly untrustworthy government'. Again, Mr De Bruyn from the shoppies had nothing to worry about in Mr Beazley's remarks.
Let us come forward another three months to last week. Suddenly all that has changed. Gone is Mr Beazley's strong view that 18- to 21-year-olds were `worthy of their hire', gone is his argument that the government would `impose a presumption on the commission to 
 produce junior rates', gone even is Mr Beazley's concern with slippery deals and reneging on promises. Gone is Mr Beazley's and Labor's six years of history of seeking to rid Australia of junior rates and bring us back into line with the rest of the OECD.
Mr De Bruyn was absolutely furious, and with good reason. Around 100,000 of his 230,000 members are under the age of 21. For a year, his union's submission had been quoted with approval by Mr	Beazley and Labor as a sensible outcome for junior rates—a case-by-case analysis below 18 years, a commitment to reduce discrimination, and adult rates at 18 years. Suddenly, after assurances from Mr Beazley, the night before the bill is slammed through the House of Representatives, the SDA gets a late night call from Labor saying, `We're sorry, we've changed our mind.' They did not even have the excuse that it was a tough negotiation. Arch Bevis let the cat out of the bag when he boasted that the government had picked up every one of the ALP's amendments. Well, where was the amendment about an adult at age 18 getting an adult wage?
—What did you get for selling the taxpayers out: 20 Rothmans?
—If you have a look at the Democrats amendment, Senator Quirke, you will actually find that it is there, so I look forward to your supporting this. Where was the amendment clearly establishing Labor's preference for skill based rather than age based awards, as put so well by Senator George Campbell? Where was the amendment removing the presumption in the bill in favour of junior rates so that the commission could make a genuine case-by-case assessment? The government did not have to agree to these amendments, which were all part of the ALP's position only a few months ago, because the ALP did not insist on them. They were so desperate for a deal, any deal, that, according to the Sydney Morning Herald  on August 26:
Labor had	 advanced so far in its preparedness to do a compromise with Reith that it had drafted full blown amendments opening the way to extend age based pay rates indefinitely. 

Joe De Bruyn was beside himself with disbelief, and you would be. He said:
Well, that's not good enough because of everybody else that's in on it. You had Reith over a barrel—he was looking for a deal to get himself off the hook and instead of trying to find material improvements for youth workers who were doing the same work as adults, you've let the opportunity slip . . . you didn't even try.
How true. The ACTU executive was furious. The Metal Workers Union, the Miscellaneous Workers Union, the National Union of Students and Young Labor have all slammed Labor's betrayal, because that is what it is. Labor's youth wages policy was developed in 1993-94 by the combination of employment ministers Kim Beazley and Simon Crean, industrial relations ministers Laurie Brereton and Bob McMullan and the then ACTU President Martin Ferguson. All of them are still there in shadow cabinet, and all of them have been involved in this desperate dirty deal that didn't need to be done.
Mr Beazley has, in our view, failed a fundamental test of leadership—that of consistency of principle. He has been exposed by this deal as a man without principles, who will say one thing one month and do completely the opposite a few months later. To that extent, he is the perfect dancing partner for Peter Reith. On behalf of the workers of Australia, I live in fear of what new nasty ideas this duo will now cook up. Will it be denial of unfair dismissals for employees of small business? That is also a populist notion; about as populist as junior wage rates. Labor opposed it last year, but what does this mean for next month? The workers of Australia now know that Labor under Kim Beazley simply cannot be taken at its word.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-01,"—I rise to speak on what is one of the most pernicious bills to come before this place. The Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1999  will have the effect of consigning hundreds of thousands of young Australian workers to unequal pay for equal work under a discriminatory scheme which has no justification. What makes this piece of legislation even worse is that the only reason we are debating it at all is because the Labor Party has col 
 luded with the government to sell out young Australians dirt cheap in a dirty deal. Under the terms of this deal, the Australian Labor Party will flout a tenet it has long held as inviolate: that work of equal value should be paid equally. In the context of yesterday's call for a return to basics by the Labor opposition, this betrayal of the principle of fairness for workers is even more shameful.
Not surprisingly, the announcement by the ALP last week that it would turn its back on five years of opposition to youth wages and discrimination against young workers and vote with the government was met with horror and anger by union and youth representatives, who had thought that they could at least rely on the ALP to hold firm on this issue. Up until last week, this faith was well placed. Hansard is full of grand speeches from the members of the opposition detailing their strident opposition to youth wages. How quickly they have recanted on five years of what has amounted to little more than empty rhetoric, and what a pity it is that so few have come forward to explain themselves this evening.
The opposition to youth wages is well founded, and workers and young people have every right to be livid with the opposition. The opposition of the Australian Democrats is similarly well founded, and I would like to set out the reasons this evening, although the objections to the government's youth wages proposals have been on record for years now. Our opposition is concentrated in three areas: the effects of the retention and extension of youth wages on young people, the current state of the labour market, and the possibility of viable alternatives to age based discriminatory wage levels.
At the outset, two points must be emphasised and understood. Firstly, the alternatives that were proposed to youth wages do not involve the abolition of differential rates of pay but rather their replacement with competency based rates, and consequently many of the arguments being advanced for their retention are irrelevant. Secondly, the government proposed not only the retention of youth wages in existing awards but also their extension to awards where they do not currently 
 exist. Make no mistake: the government is not about retaining the status quo but is about reducing the income levels of thousands of young people. Now the ALP is labouring under the illusion that the deal they have brokered with the government prevents this extension from happening. It does no such thing. In fact, it leaves the way clear for extensions to take place on application to the AIRC. Furthermore, these applications will take place within the context of the de facto approval by the parliament of youth wages as an employment generating measure—a contention which has never been proven.
It cannot be denied that youth wages are discriminatory and grossly unfair to young workers. They fundamentally contravene the equal pay for equal work principle, enshrined in the international labour and human rights conventions to which Australia is a signatory. On this basis alone, the Democrats have significant concerns with the government's attempts to flout its promise to examine non-discriminatory alternatives.
Young workers do not have access to junior rates of rent, food or clothing and only full-time students qualify for travel concessions. Young people incur the same costs of living as adult workers, yet many receive heavily discounted incomes. Those aged over 18 are deemed to be adults by our society: old enough to vote, to drive, to drink, to be tried as adults, to undertake financial obligations and so on. Yet this government believes they are not mature enough to be paid an equal rate for equal work with their older counterparts.
Over the past 20 years in Australia, real wages have declined markedly for young people, despite a significant increase in adult wages over the same time. Real wages for young males have fallen by 18 per cent from $395 in 1976 to $322 in 1996. Real wages for young women have fallen by 12 per cent from $361 in 1976 to $316 in 1996. Over the same period, real wages for adult males have increased by seven per cent and by 12 per cent for adult females.
Furthermore, youth wages undermine the value of youth labour by determining the worth of a young worker according to her or 
 his age, rather than skill. This perpetuates the view that youth labour is of less worth than adult labour, a view often based on intangibles such as maturity when in many cases, particularly in the sectors which tend to employ young people, the work of differently aged workers may not differ in any material way. This raises the potential for young labour to be exploited: most young workers do not belong to a union and many work in insecure, casual or part-time jobs with cut-rate pay.
Youth wages are profoundly inequitable and should be resisted for that reason alone. The Australian Democrats are aware of the need to examine means of creating job opportunities for young people but do not believe that wage reductions are the way to achieve this. Those who seek the retention and extension of youth wages claim the alternatives would be worse. However, this argument ignores the real nature of the type of work most young people do. The majority of young people are employed in the retail and service sectors. The type of work they undertake shares a number of common requirements: flexibility, projection of a particular image or marketing strategy, adaptability to new sales processes and technologies, and physical stamina.
The growth in the consumer market, particularly the youth consumer market, has increased the demand for highly productive, easily trained and flexible employees who reflect the image and marketing of particular retailers or service providers. These are clear incentives other than cost to hire young people and should not be discounted in the debate over the effect on employment opportunities for young people of replacing youth wages with competency based rates. Both Mitsubishi and Holden have recently abolished youth wages, recognising the value of their younger employees and understanding that workers should be paid according to skill and productivity, rather than according to an inflexible model which offers them no incentive as workers to improve their competency or productivity.
The nature of youth work has also changed markedly. Youth wages grew out of the apprenticeship tradition, which involved a 
 clear, training/wage level trade-off between employer and employees, long-term job security and a basis in pay increments according to skill acquisition. The past decades have seen a massive reduction in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships, in favour of institutionalised training, usually at the student's own expense. Most work undertaken by young people is low skilled, involving minimal training which generally takes place in the first months of employment, with all employees retained on the basis of their acquisition of a particular level of competency, regardless of their age.
The justification posed for the retention of youth wages is that they have a positive effect on youth unemployment levels. This argument is put in the absence of any supporting evidence. Youth unemployment levels have continued to rise since the introduction of youth wages. In fact, the youth unemployment rate has undergone a more rapid rate of increase since 1968 than that of any other group in our community. The unemployment rate of 15- to 19-year-old males was 2.9 per cent in 1968, compared with the current rate of 25.3 per cent. For females it was 3.9 per cent in 1968, compared with today's rate of 27.9 per cent.
Young people have been severely impacted by the effect of recessions on the pool of available employment. The entry level positions which used to be available for young people no longer exist. The state and federal governments have greatly contributed to this through the substantial reduction in Commonwealth and state public service positions. Today there are next to no under-20-year-olds working in the public sector, yet the government continues to place the blame for youth unemployment on young people.
Under current federal employment policies, which have halved funding to employment assistance, most young people are no longer eligible for intensive work search assistance. One of the most dangerous effects of this legislation is that it will serve as a proxy for the real action that needs to be taken to create jobs for young people. Minister Reith's employment agenda is all about wage and condition reductions to try to spread available 
 work more thinly, extending the growing numbers of the working poor in our society. Now the opposition will also be able to enjoy the protection of this proxy, thanks to its complicity in the perpetuation of the myth that all that is needed to address youth unemployment is to keep youth wages below subsistence levels.
The Democrats do not accept this agenda and will resist the government's attempts to shirk its responsibility for job creation. This is a government which last November reneged on its commitment to invest in job creation through industry support and instead prefers to pursue a regressive approach which will reduce the income levels of hundreds of thousands of Australians. This legislation breaks faith with young people. Is it any wonder that young people are becoming increasingly cynical and disenfranchised with the political process? It is based on little evidence that it will lead to job creation and, as presented, is deeply flawed.
The minister is fond of quoting employer surveys in his favour, conveniently failing to mention that they are based on selective sampling, misleading questions and that, even so, the results show employers citing other reasons than merely the cost of hiring young people. International evidence is similarly inconclusive and cannot support such an inequitable policy. Past Australian experience shows that the reduction of wage levels has little effect on unemployment levels. For example, between 1981 and 1983, youth wages declined relative to adult wages but youth unemployment rose by a 64 per cent. In 1992, the Reserve Bank of Australia stated:
The recent deterioration of the youth labour market does not seem to be due to any change in relative wage levels, which have been declining steadily since the mid-1970s.
The same arguments being advanced now for youth wages were put in favour of retaining gender based differential rates of pay. Yet the disastrous effects that were predicted to result from paying women the same rates as men for work of equal value never eventuated.
In our submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission inquiry, the Democrats argued for the replacement of 
 discriminatory, age based junior rates of pay with a competency based structure. Young people must also be offered training to develop skills and receive appropriate remuneration through wage increases as their competence increases. This would recognise the value of youth labour, and end the discrimination and exploitation that currently exists in over half of industrial awards.
The government wants to entrench youth wages where they exist and extend them to all awards. In doing so, it is breaking its promise to wait for the AIRC to examine non-discriminatory alternatives, proposing the drastic reduction in pay rates for hundreds of thousands of young people and turning its back on positive job creation. If the government is serious about creating job opportunities for young people, it would do far better to direct its employment efforts towards extending eligibility for job search assistance to young people, improving access to education and training, and making and maintaining commitments to investing in sustainable industries to create meaningful and secure jobs.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-01,"—I am going to start my speech on the second reading by asking a question which I hope will be answered satisfactorily for the Democrats and for the nation at the end of this debate. If the nation as a whole, and the political parties as a whole, accept the notion that nearly all 15-year-olds in employment should be on youth rates, can you explain to me why there is a justification for 22-year-olds to be paid youth rates? Why in your great agreement have you not put a ceiling on the youth rate application? I look forward to the very informed answer I will get from both sides, especially from the adviser who shook his head vigorously.
I cannot believe that Senator Collins, for whom I have a great deal of regard, and Senator Campbell—from the Labor side—for whom I have considerable regard also, can honestly stand in here and defend this bill before us. I know you have been sent in to do a job and I really want to know if your hearts are in it. Senator Collins, before she came to the Senate, was a national industrial officer 
 with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the SDA. She, along with Senators Bishop and Hogg, who as far as I know are not speaking in this debate, should know more about this issue that anybody because, I am advised, about 100,000 of the 230,000 members of her union are under the age of 21 years. So this is an issue with which she should have great affinity.
I think Senator Collins's former boss was Joe de Bruyn. He is the leader of the SDA nationally and he had this to say about Labor's new junior rates position:
The Labor Party had a unique opportunity to force Peter Reith and the Federal Government to recognise the validity of the claim that 18 to 20 year old workers should be paid the adult rate if their work performance justified such a measure.
He goes on:
Instead, without any consultation with the largest Union in Australia which covers 75% of unionised teenage workers, it has negotiated a shoddy deal with Peter Reith to preserve the status quo.
Joe de Bruyn goes on:
Young workers will undoubtedly be deeply disappointed that the unique opportunity to achieve wage justice has been squandered in the interests of needless compromise with the Government.
He then says:
The Union itself is bitterly disappointed that it was not consulted by the Labor Party over its deal with Mr Reith and that the basic entitlement of young people to a fair rate of pay has been given away.
Senator Campbell's successor—that is, the Labor Party's Senator Campbell—over at the Metal Workers Union, Doug Cameron, was equally incensed, saying the decision `provides every indication that federal Labor has dropped the ball on moving the policy focus away from trying to create short-term, low skill, transient jobs that provide no future for young workers.' He said that he could not understand why the Labor Party would embrace a key element of the deregulated labour market agenda of the Liberals. Doug Cameron went on to say:
It is an agenda which has increased job insecurity, led to a lack of dignity at work for young workers and left young people in a totally inequitable labour market position. 

The problem for the Labor Party is that, when we come to the IR legislation, they are going to be defending the right of workers to receive appropriate wages and conditions, yet in this circumstance they are defending the right of workers not to receive appropriate wages and conditions. I am sure that that inconsistency in their situation will be brought home to them by the government.
The ACTU executive expressed its deep concern and disappointment at the Labor Party and coalition agreement and rejected the government's bill as dishonest and misleading. The amendments I have circulated, and I will move them later on in the committee stage, have been developed by us in consultation with the ACTU and fully reflect its preferred position, as well as ours. The ACTU is quite right when it says that junior rates, as expressed through this bill, are a simplistic approach to the issue of youth unemployment.
Over the past 20 years in Australia, many of them years in which the Labor Party was in power both here and in the states, real wages have declined markedly for young people despite a significant increase in adult real wages over the same time. So one has gone up and the other has gone down. Real wages for young males have fallen by 18 per cent, going from $396 in 1976 to $342 in 1986, which was 10 years later, to $322 in 1996. Real wages for young females have fallen by less, but they have still fallen by 12 per cent, going from $361 in 1976 to $332 in 1986 to $316 in 1996. Real wages for adult males have increased by seven per cent over the same period, and real wages for adult females have risen by 12 per cent.
In its recent employment outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found no clear case for junior rates. I quote:
On the basis of the available evidence, however, it is not clear that a rise in minimum wages has unambiguously led to job losses for youth in all circumstances . . . The substantial difference across countries in teenage employment trends can only be marginally attributed to differences in the evolution of minimum wages and must be explained by other factors. 

The Reserve Bank, in a 1992 analysis of youth employment, found that wage rates did not seem to be driving the decline in youth employment. It said:
The recent deterioration of the youth labour market does not seem to be due to any change in relative wage levels, which have been declining steadily since the mid 1970s.
Professor John Freebairn of Melbourne University, at a recent Reserve Bank conference on unemployment, also concluded that the evidence on wage rates and unemployment was not clearly proven. He said:
Unfortunately not a lot is known about the magnitude of elasticities of substitution between labour categorised by gender, age and skill level . . . For Australia there have been . . . natural experiments which also suggest a low elasticity of demand for particular types of labour. The 20 per cent increase in relative wages for females in the early 1970s have no discernible effect on the gender composition of employment and unemployment.
Similarly, research by Professor Bob Gregory at the ANU and by Bernstein and Schmitt at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington show little relationship between minimum wage rates and unemployment. I am quite sure that, when the IR debate comes up, the Labor Party will in fact refer to these kinds of studies because they support its view that real wages should be maintained for workers, a position the Democrats agree with. However, in this instance the Labor Party is not supporting that, and that is the inconsistency in its situation.
The ALP should know all of this evidence, because the SDA, in its submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, reflects all of this evidence. This is the same submission that the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Kim Beazley, described as `a sensible position.'

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-09-01,"—Tonight I wish to disclose certain unusual property transactions in Edmonson Park, Sydney, involving key backers of the Labor Party Right. In late 1997, Ms Dobromilla Seigl wanted to sell land which she owned in Edmonson Park, Sydney, for around $650,000. In early December 1997 she received a telephone call from a man claiming to be named Anthony Contervento. He offered $800,000 for the land, provided that the land transfer could be concluded swiftly.
It appears that Ms Seigl had her suspicions about the deal. She overheard Mr Contervento talking on one occasion to people on the other end of the telephone in Arabic, not Italian. Also, all negotiations for the sale of the land were carried on via a mobile telephone. The one time that Ms Seigl tried to contact Mr Contervento on a landline, it turned out to be an answering machine at a business owned by Mr Karl Kazal. Mr Kazal comes into this issue again a little later on. Despite her apprehensions about the propriety of the deal, Ms Seigl liked the price offered and, on 12 December 1997, the property was sold to Mr Contervento for the sum of $800,000.
So what is the problem with this? The problem is that Mr Anthony Contervento does not exist. Just look at the spelling of the name: C-o-n-t-e-r-v-e-n-t-o. Clearly someone with no knowledge of Italian has made it up. Recent inquiries have been made about the existence of Mr Contervento. He was known as Ray Kazal, but he changed his name in December 1997 to Anthony Contervento. In January 1999 he again changed his name—this time to Jimmy Kazal. Six days after the sale to the non-existent Mr Contervento, on 18 December 1997, the Zayad Bin Sultan al-Nahayan Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation Ltd—ACN 081 093 629—was formed. Its founding directors were Karl Kazal, Tarek Kazal and Assam Alrahmah. The latter was a businessman in the United Arab Emirates. Now here comes the interesting bit: on 30 December 1997 the non-existent Mr Conter 
 vento sold the property to the foundation for $1,419,000.
—What?
—That is a very good question, Senator Macdonald. That represents a capital gains profit to the non-existent Mr Contervento of $619,000 in the space of 18 days. Not a bad little earner for a supposedly legitimate business transaction, was it? Then, in mid-February 1998, Karl Kazal spoke to Elders Real Estate about the sale of the adjoining property—lot DP 389866. One wonders who is going to be buying what in that transaction and one wonders whether any tax is going to be paid or whether the money will just disappear, as it appears to have done in this case.
So what does this all mean? There are only two possible reasons for one member of the Kazal family to buy a property and then a few days later sell it to a supposedly charitable trust controlled by two other members of the Kazal family: either the Kazals are ripping off the trust that they control or they are laundering money. If we assume that they are not ripping off a trust that they control themselves, then the question is: why are the Kazals laundering money?
Who is this shadowy friend of the ALP Right, Mr Karl Kazal? Is it the same Karl Kazal who was behind the stacking of 450 people into Lakemba Day Branch at the behest of Labor MP Tony Stewart? Who is this mate of the Labor Party? Is this the same Karl Kazal who got $2 million from the Labor-friendly Sydney Cove Authority to redevelop two properties that his company owned in The Rocks, including the new Vault nightclub? Who is this mate that the ALP Right uses to stack out its branches? Is it the same Karl Kazal who, for his efforts in helping to stack out Lakemba Day Branch, got $45,000 in state government funds for the Lebanese Muslim Association Sports Club? There are many questions that need to be answered in this sad and sorry tale, and I certainly hope that the Labor Party comes clean in disclosing the answers.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Property Transactions: Edmonson Park, Sydney</title>",Adjournment,19,1
