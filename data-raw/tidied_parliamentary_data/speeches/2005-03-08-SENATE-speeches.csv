"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-03-08,"—Yesterday I was talking about the differences between the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s powers and the Postal Industry Ombudsman’s powers proposed in the Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004 [2005]. I thought they were quite significant. The second reading speech for this bill says:
In many respects, the PIO will be provided with similar powers to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. For example, the PIO will be able to require a person to provide information in writing or to attend before the PIO to answer questions. The PIO will also be required to provide procedural fairness to Australia Post, registered PPOs and their employees in the investigation of any actions they have taken.
However, whereas the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s powers are tailored to the investigation of public sector administrative actions, the PIO’s powers will be customised for the investigation of service delivery complaints in relation to both Australia Post and private operators. Moreover, as the PIO will have jurisdiction over non-government entities which have voluntarily registered with the PIO, the PIO will not have certain powers that are considered unnecessary or which would act as a deterrent to PPOs registering with the scheme. For example, it was not considered appropriate to provide the PIO with the power to enter premises or to override a person’s claim to legal professional privilege.
Senator Conroy also referred to the fact that the PIO will not have the powers, which are currently provided to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, to order compensation.
These changes obviously concern me to some extent in that it is also made clear that, in respect of Australia Post, the PIO will be expected to deal with delivery of mail matters whilst the Commonwealth Ombudsman will continue to deal with the administration activities of Australia Post. This does concern me, but we will have to see how it develops in practice—whether this difference of powers will impact on how Australia Post is dealt with by the Ombudsman or the PIO in the future. That is something we will consider later.
What did concern me in that particular section and in the bill is the fact that the government has chosen to give the PIO fewer powers than the Commonwealth Ombudsman to encourage private sector providers to sign up to the PIO and its scheme. I really think that is unnecessary. I think it is an unfortunate approach that the government has adopted. Given that the delivery of post is such an important matter in terms of communications in Australia, the matter of voluntarism should never have come into play. The government said that the PIO would apply to the private sector as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman applies to the private sector—that is, to everybody. Not only is this scheme voluntary for private sector providers but, as an incentive to get private sector providers to sign up to the scheme, the powers of the PIO vis-a-vis the Commonwealth Ombudsman have been reduced.
I certainly express the Democrats’ concern with that approach. I notice the ALP are moving amendments on this, and we will certainly support those when we get to the committee stage. There is no benefit to this bill vis-a-vis current arrangements if we do not get the private sector providers into the PIO scheme. The scheme has been made voluntary and has been pared back to encourage private sector providers to come. This scheme is not going to be working effectively unless we get the benefit of the private sector coming in.
I hope the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, will address in her concluding comments what measures the government has taken to get private sector providers to sign up to the PIO scheme, whether the minister is confident that the major private sector providers will be signing up to this scheme and, if it ends up being a voluntary scheme, what measures she intends engaging in to get the private sector providers to sign up to it. If they do not sign up, this bill will be of no benefit and we will have wasted the public’s time. The Democrats will not oppose this bill, because it is revenue neutral, but we certainly think it is important that the benefits of this scheme be promoted further to bring the private sector on board and, if need be, that the scheme be based on the telecommunications precedent that requires they join up rather than simply leaving it to be voluntary.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL INDUSTRY OMBUDSMAN BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-03-08,"—I thank the senators who have contributed to the debate on the Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004 [2005]. The bill implements a government election commitment and will establish a dedicated Postal Industry Ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and provide consumers with a recognisable, dedicated and independent entity to deal with complaints about the provision of postal services. The Postal Industry Ombudsman will have responsibility for investigating postal delivery services, including the receipt, processing and delivery of postal articles and the provision of courier services. The Postal Industry Ombudsman’s powers will complement the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s existing powers. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, for example, will retain existing powers to investigate actions by Australia Post that do not relate to the provision of postal services, such as employment matters.
Provisions in the bill will mean that most, if not all, service delivery complaints against Australia Post will be dealt with by the Postal Industry Ombudsman in a similar way to those against registered private postal operators. However, complaints against Australia Post can still be dealt with by the Commonwealth Ombudsman where it is more appropriate to do so.
I am heartened to hear senators in their contributions to this debate say that they support the establishment of a postal industry ombudsman. The legislation has been drafted after an extensive process and with historical evidence following consultation with the state and territory offices of fair trading. I have to say that there have only ever been 37 recorded complaints about the delivery of postal services by postal service providers other than Australia Post. I think that that really puts it in perspective.
It is disappointing to see that there are foreshadowed amendments proposing to take what is an almost non-existent problem and create a compliance burden by requiring everyone to participate in the scheme. The opposition have foreshadowed an amendment that in my view is unnecessary for this bill.
In developing the scheme, it is important to balance the rights of consumers—of course, that is always a critical factor—with the level of complaints. We always have to look at the cost and complexity of implementing the scheme for business and, indeed, for government. After an exhaustive consultation process, we do believe—and I must say that I personally believe—that the provisions in the legislation strike the appropriate balance.
During the course of the debate—although unfortunately I was not able to listen to all of it—there was a comparison of the volume of complaints in the postal industry with that of the telecommunications industry, which is entirely a gross exaggeration. To give an example: in 2003-04 the TIO—that is, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman—handled 75,904 complaints, of which it investigated 59,850. The TIO has an annual budget in excess of $6.5 million and has over 1,000 members. In very stark contrast, the Commonwealth Ombudsman handles only 900 to 1,000 complaints every year for Australia Post. As I said earlier, the state and territory offices of fair trading have advised that there have been only 37 recorded complaints about the delivery of postal services by postal service providers other than Australia Post. Quite simply, the reality is that this industry receives an entirely different level and nature of complaints compared to the telecommunications industry.
I can only suspect that homework has not been done on this issue and that serious thought has not been given to what a waste of resources it would be to impose the expensive TIO model on the entire postal industry. Rather, establishing the PIO as a dedicated office within the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s office will ensure that the correct balance is achieved between the protection of the rights of consumers and the cost and complexity of administering the scheme. It will offer many of the same benefits as the TIO but with a lower cost and the advantage of using existing expertise in the field.
In summary, the government believes that this bill, as it is currently being considered, will be beneficial for Australian consumers, small business and private postal operators. It will provide consumers and all postal operators, including Australia Post, with an avenue to more effectively resolve service disputes and difficulties. I commend the bill.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-03-08,"—The Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 is a minor regulatory bill which makes some technical adjustments to the Navigation Act as it affects the safety of ships at sea. The first two amendments in the bill simply remove an inconsistency within the current law. The bill also removes the uncertainty caused by a lower court decision as to whether offences under the act are indictable or summary. To that extent the bill is not controversial.
Another amendment relates to penalties. Essentially, it will bring penalties in the Navigation Act into line with those set out in the Crimes Act. Instead of specifying financial penalties and jail terms specifically, the formula approach will be adopted. For example, the Crimes Act provides that, if an offence is expressed to be subject to a penalty, no fine is specified. Instead, the maximum fine will be five penalty units multiplied by the maximum prison term in months. In essence, the application of this formula will help to standardise the Navigation Act, although it will effectively increase the penalties as well. This is a practical issue, and we on this side of the chamber support the changes.
There is, however, a matter referred to in the Bills Digest. It concerns the relationship between the principal legislation and the setting of penalties in regulations. The point is well made, and it goes to consistency of approach. As this bill seeks to make all offences under the bill indictable offences, the offences and penalties set out in the regulations ought to be contained in the principal act, not in the regulations, and attention is drawn to this anomaly. The suggestion is that the bill should have provided an opportunity to bring about that consistency. The minister might care to address the reasons for that in his or her response in closing the second reading debate.
It is also opportune today to address some matters on shipping policy. As Australians, we ought to be embarrassed about our either disappearing or disappeared shipping industry. After all, we are almost totally dependent on shipping for our export trade, and perhaps a few facts should be outlined in order to set the context of my remarks. Of the world seaborne trade of 6,000 million gross tonnes, trade to and from Australia comprises almost nine per cent—quite a significant figure. The Australian industry’s part of that nine per cent is only 1.4 per cent—in other words, about 85 per cent of our shipping costs are paid to overseas operators. The cost to Australia, in those same net terms, is over $3.6 billion per year, and growing—almost 14 per cent of the current account deficit. As we all know, the current account deficit is at an all-time high, and is most likely to keep growing. The trend for Australian participation is downwards, with increasing foreign dominance and increasing losses of foreign exchange.
The story is almost the same with insurance. Very little insurance underwriting is done by Australians. It almost seems that we have a fatalistic attitude that these are not native industries for ourselves. The question is exactly the same as in any other industry—essentially in our secondary and tertiary industries. It is interesting, of course, to ponder that riddle, particularly in light of more recent discussion as changes in the economy, the net foreign debt and the current account deficit become more central to our future.
In economic terms, transport cost is invisible—and one makes the obvious point in passing that for this government that is a most appropriate description. In addition to what might be called a cringe mentality, in Australia we have always suffered the dead hand of conservative forces in this area of creation and maintenance of emerging industries. It is a matter of great regret that these forces are strongest in government in the area of primary industry, which has always been dominated by the National Party. It is no accident that for many years the transport portfolio has been captive to the National Party, with few exceptions. Nor is it an accident that trade and industry portfolios have again been dominated in this context over time by the National Party.
Given the huge power of that single vested interest, it is little wonder that trade, industry and transport policy in this country is so skewed. Look at transport policy: whether it be road funding, rail investment or shipping—both international and coastal—the purpose is the same. It is the user who is the sole beneficiary, not the industry providing the services or consumers who pay the costs at the retail end. There is not the slightest interest in transport industries per se; they are simply a crude cost. And if they are only a crude cost, the obvious solution is to reduce the crude cost to the lowest possible point. Yet we see that the cost of this policy direction to our economy in net terms is absolutely enormous.
We therefore have a glaring double standard in that we choose which industries we as a nation support, and that support, obviously, and in another context properly, is determined by those who are elected to government and those who are in power. In terms of consequences it means that effectively we do not have a real transport policy in this country. What we do have is a piecemeal of road funding and, belatedly, early signs of a regenerating rail industry. But the gaps between the two continue to be enormous. We still have massive bottlenecks at our ports, for example. It is not a new problem caused by the huge demand for coal or iron ore, which has been the subject of media reporting over the last three or four months. No amount of buck-passing back to the states can excuse the losses to the Commonwealth and, by definition, to all of us when the losses are national and apply across the board to every citizen living in this country. Getting a container released through Customs is as slow as it has ever been, largely due to the processes put in train by Customs. Of course, Customs is a Commonwealth government agency.
Other Western nations have built new container ports outside metropolitan areas. In Australia, where nearly all mainland cities are growing areas, the main container ports are landlocked by suburbia. The crisis with the bulk loading facilities has now, apparently, caught everybody by surprise—but there should not be surprise. We simply do not have a comprehensive national transport policy. The current government’s response is glib. They say, ‘Gee, yes, we do have a problem, but congestion at our ports is a state problem,’ and they give the state governments a flick in passing. But out on the Pacific Ocean there are hundreds and hundreds of ships sitting at sea awaiting a berth, paying tens of thousands of dollars demurrage every day, and the government say it is not their fault. If it were wheat or meat it would not happen. They are not new problems. They are endemic in Australia simply because of the totally self-interested producer basis upon which transport policy is formed, maintained and implemented. That is the way it has always been. So it is no surprise to anyone that the shipping industry currently is in such a parlous state.
There are some others who are accountable for these appalling circumstances. Here I refer to some of those more influential economists whose thesis has long been based on the theory of natural advantage or natural comparative advantage: you concentrate on what you are best at and you do not allocate funds or resources to develop alternatives over time. Therefore we grow more meat and wheat and we dig more iron and coal—we do whatever comes not necessarily easily but whatever comes naturally. By that attitude, when international shipping is so cheap, we are silly not to take advantage of it, the argument goes. It does not matter if it is a floating hulk of unknown ownership with a crew of virtual slaves travelling up and down our major coasts.
So the theory of natural advantage is very convenient. If it were applied to any other industries we would have very few at all in this country. It also assumes that shipping will always be cheap but, as we are now seeing, that cycle has shifted. Freight rates have gone through the roof and even more export dollars are being lost through the added costs of shipping. Exporters are suddenly complaining as their added transport costs have spoilt their competitiveness. Market forces are wonderful when they run so strongly in your favour, but it is a great excuse not to have a policy. But now, of course, the consequence of the inaction of the last 10 years is that we are at the total mercy of overseas providers, hence the question of why we have no shipping industry of our own.
We in the Labor Party believe that we should have an indigenous shipping industry. We cannot see why shipping should be different from any other industry. But it does need a policy and it does need a fair degree of leadership, and we suggest that they have both been absent over the last 10 years under the current government. Indeed it is ironic that this bill is about some minor regulatory policy on ship safety, and yet one of the big issues is the safety of much of the international fleet which is used to transport Australia’s trade. The government’s policy means that our coastline is increasingly being serviced by tramps from around the world.
The single-voyage permit system, as it is now administered, is about dumping services against the interests of local industry. It is no wonder then that, since this natural advantage or comparative advantage argument has taken hold, our coastal shipping trade has been decimated to the point where it is virtually non-existent and, if one were a realist, almost impossible or impossible to revive. The scheme of single-voyage and continuous-voyage permits has seen a reduction from 40 per cent to 25 per cent in the number of Australian flag ships plying our coastline. Of course, all the dollars involved in that have gone overseas. And so the story goes on and there is no end in sight.
There are few countries in the world where cabotage is not fiercely protected, and that includes that great bastion of free trade, the United States. That is why we believe that we too should have a competitive shipping industry. Many will know that coastal shipping around Australia carries 30 per cent of the non-urban freight task. Why is that the case? It is because, in the final analysis, it is more efficient than both rail and road. For example, the supply of petroleum products to North Queensland is managed by two ships. For road transport, that is the equivalent of 30,000 B double trips per year. So what can we do to get some policies in place to encourage the growth of our local industries?
Firstly, and obviously, we need to get The Nationals out of the control room or out of their dominance of industry, trade and transport related portfolios. While ever they run those central portfolios we cannot expect a rational or efficient approach in the genuine national interest. Secondly, we need some changes to attitudes whereby some equivalence is given to the regulatory and financial environment in which an Australian industry can grow, and grow successfully over time. In doing that we need to recognise the reform already implemented in the 1980s by the then Labor government in shaking out a lot of the undesirable featherbedding that was occurring. Given access to modern technology, there is no reason for Australian crews not to be competitive with shipping from other Western countries. But it must be said that there does need to be a level playing field.
As we know, the government continues to stall in its response to the Independent Review of Australian Shipping, which was commissioned by the Australian shipping industry in 2002—over three years ago. That report was presented to government in September 2003, and since that time there has been no comment—only a stony silence—from the government. Clearly, for the reasons I have set out, it is fair to say that there is not the slightest interest. The conclusions of that independent shipping review are quite instructive and worthy of serious consideration.
The review observed that international shipping is obviously a global market in which Australian operators are encumbered by constraints not faced by competitors. Those constraints were described variously as: the inability to choose a ship register of their choice because of the provisions of the Shipping Registration Act; the inability to recruit and retain Australian officers at internationally competitive terms, due to the operation of the tax act; and an in-built prejudice or bias against an indigenous Australian shipping industry. In simple terms, the remedies recommended were the removal of these constraints but stopping short of any policy requiring government grants or subsidies. For coastal shipping, the review found that domestic operators were at a regulatory disadvantage to overseas operators using the single- and continuous-voyage permit system.
The key element though is that foreign operators are not burdened by the Australian tax system, employment conditions or employee costs. That is, shipping services are effectively being dumped in circumstances that would not be tolerated in any other domestic industry. However, I say again that that should not surprise anyone because none of these reforms, none of these changes and none of this desire to create an indigenous shipping industry is in the least bit palatable to the government. To them, any Australian shipping industry is a threat and, therefore, all other policy is subjugated to that prime need.
One asks the obvious question: what future is there for shipping? It seems to us that the simple answer is that, while ever we have The Nationals in control of these key policy areas—transport, industry and trade—there is little hope. Other industries, like the manufacturing of agricultural chemicals, fertilisers or any other primary industry need, also face that same attitude. That is why the debate on a free trade agreement with major countries such as China all of a sudden becomes so interesting and fascinating—because, again, guess who is in control of policy? The debate that will come with the free trade agreement with China and the current debate that we are having on shipping policy are indeed sad ones—firstly, because it is so vital for our country that we do something other than bend before the self-interested sectional interests that dominate these areas of policy; and, secondly, because we need to grow and get past attitudes, which may have had some strength or relevance one hundred years ago, whereby we deny ourselves opportunities into the future. It is simply time for change and it is time for the development across-the-board of some serious transport policies that are truly nationally focused and nationally orientated and that give national outcomes as opposed to narrow sectional or purely producer outcomes.
We must say that at this stage there is a serious vacuum, and you would be very generous indeed to suggest that there is any sign at all that change will occur over the next two or three years. The obvious forecast—although not the hope—is that our shipping industry will be allowed to wither and we will continue to pay increasing amounts in both real and normative terms to foreigners to ship out the goods we produce. Unfortunately, that is the bottom line in this debate.",SENATE,<title>NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-08,"—The Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 makes a few minor amendments to the Navigation Act to clarify certain legal points and remove certain anomalies. Schedule 1 of the bill clarifies that certain offences under the regulations shall be indictable offences. This follows a ruling by the Victorian County Court that offences relating to the failure to display lights on a ship in order to avoid a collision should be treated as summary offences. The bill removes references to nautical assessors, which became redundant some 15 years ago. Nautical assessors, as I understand it, were once appointed to advise a court in matters dealing with offences against regulations. The bill also brings penalties into line with the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers. Section 258 of the Navigation Act sets penalties of up to $10,000 or two years in prison for offences relating to collisions, lighting and signals. However, the details are left to regulations. Under the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers, serious offences punishable by penalties such as these should be contained in the parent act to enable the parliament to scrutinise the laws being made.
The large numbers of laws made through regulation and disallowable instruments no doubt mean that some will go unnoticed, except perhaps by a few who may or may not have any knowledge in the specific area of law being dealt with. Often we wonder whether that suits government and we wonder whether the government leaves the detail to regulations because it wants that detail to go unnoticed. Our view is that detail should be scrutinised by stakeholders and the parliament wherever possible. As this bill deals with section 258, it would have been a perfect opportunity to tidy up this anomaly, together with some of the other anomalies that might also have been dealt with. We urge the government to do the necessary work—to find those sections where regulations should be brought into the parent act and to take the action required to make that happen. The Democrats will support this bill unamended.",SENATE,<title>NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-03-08,"—I thank both Senator Bishop and Senator Allison for their contributions. I think Senator Bishop’s contribution ranged a long way wide of the very sensible amendments in the Navigation Amendment Bill 2004 which, from the short briefing I have had in relation to this, seem to seek to address issues raised particularly by the Victorian County Court decision of November 2003 and some related matters. But I cannot let my summing up go by without addressing the issues of transport planning in Australia that were raised by Senator Bishop. Having worked alongside the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and leader of The Nationals, John Anderson, in the development of the AusLink policy that was announced last year, when I was still in that portfolio, I would say that I only agree with Senator Bishop to a certain extent. The efficiency of the Australian economy and the efficiency with which we can deliver goods to our ports and then goods to the rest of the world, be they bulk goods or manufactures, comes down to having an integrated transport plan.
In fact, under the leadership of John Anderson, AusLink was the first serious attempt at creating a national transport plan that seeks to increase the efficiency of Australia’s transport system. It not only created a very comprehensive and sensible policy framework that sought significant new investments in rail and road infrastructure to make it as efficient as possible, but it also saw a significant increase in the Commonwealth’s investment in that infrastructure and took investment in road and rail on to a new five-year framework, recognising the fact that investments in major infrastructure are not things that naturally fit into a three- or four-year budget cycle. AusLink, for the first time, has put transport planning into a far more sensible and coherent structure but has also put it on a long-term and substantive funding structure. As I recall, the increase in funding for both rail and road projects was in the order of $12 billion over that period.
What you find—and I follow this debate closely because I regard Australia getting more goods out to the market as absolutely pivotal to addressing the current account deficit—is that the people of the world want to buy Australian goods, but a lot of these artificial barriers and constraints on the economy were created by a lack of good integrated transport policy planning in the past. You only need to look in Senator Mark Bishop’s home state of Western Australia and see the transport chaos that is being wreaked on that state by his comrade the minister for transport in Western Australia, Ms Alannah McTiernan, to see just how culpable that state government is. It is indicative of state governments around the country. I am sure you, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, as a Queenslander, and Senator Boswell, who is in the chamber, would know the sort of chaos that the Queensland government has put in place, with its lack of long-term planning around the south-east Queensland region and the lack of a plan that allows for the massive growth that is taking place around south-east Queensland and the greater Brisbane area and can see what that is doing to Queensland.
In Western Australia successive federal and state governments have funded a major link between the industrial areas out to the east of the airport and the port, linking the hinterland of Western Australia to the port of Fremantle through a major construction work known as the Roe Highway and the Fremantle Eastern Bypass, to effectively get large trucks out of suburban Fremantle. This project was funded by both political parties at the Commonwealth level, and it has been supported by previous administrations at the state level. It has been a bipartisan plan to build this long-needed link in Western Australia, and it really is emblematic of the problem we have with transport planning in Australia.
Previous state and federal governments put hundreds of millions of dollars into building this long link—some tens of kilometres linking Fremantle with the eastern hinterland—and getting it designed to make sure trucks can get into the port quickly and efficiently. From memory, if the Roe Highway project is completed—and it certainly will not be completed in the next four years, because the state Labor government has halted it—it would get rid of 24 sets of traffic lights for a truck moving from Midland and the east down to Fremantle. Any environmentally minded person would recognise that having a truck starting and stopping 24 times with a full load while heading to a port is an environmental disaster in terms of both greenhouse gas emissions and all of the other pollutants that get emitted every a time a truck puts its brakes on and has to go through a dozen gears to get back to normal speed. That is a disaster. What Western Australia has done after successive governments—
—They won the election.
—It transcends the politics of an election, it really does. It is something that transcends this debate because it applies right across Australia. One day, when Senator McLucas is an ageing minister in a future Labor government, she will have to contend with this as well. Ultimately, if we do not get that conjunction of federal and state long-term planning right, then Australia will be held back, Queenslanders and Western Australians will be held back and all those other less important people in the rest of the states will also be held back. It is very important we get this right.
I use the example of this particular road in Western Australia because it is very clear in my mind and because it is emblematic of a problem that is replicated from Ipswich to Brisbane and in many areas of south-east Queensland. This road—the Commonwealth and state funded Roe Highway—has gone through stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, and it is creeping towards Fremantle. It is a magnificent piece of road infrastructure which really would transform the efficiency of that port and create great outcomes for the Australian economy, but for very short-sighted political reasons the state government decided to stop the road as it got to a key marginal seat.
Those of you who have seen The Truman Show, starring that magnificent comedian and actor Jim Carrey—and those of you who have not seen it, please go and see it—will remember Jim Carrey sitting with his mate on the edge of a beautiful piece of road throwing cans off the end of it. I always think of Roe Highway stage 7 as similar to that situation in The Truman Show. You have this road that just stops. If some sensible state government does not complete the link, future generations will always wonder why they have this magnificent road that just stops. To understand, they will have to look back at the politics of Western Australia of the last three or four years and the one marginal seat that got in the way of this great piece of infrastructure.
That is a reality around the country—we are going to have short-term political considerations. AusLink, I have to say, is the best opportunity we have to get past them. I tell Senator Bishop that I watched very closely when the previous opposition spokesman on transport, Martin Ferguson, was chasing me around the country when I was roads minister. He was promising whatever I promised and then adding 10 per cent to it. He kept on promising a national land transport plan and I was genuinely looking forward to it. In fact, I had a bit of trepidation because I thought that Martin Ferguson might actually come up with a land transport policy. We had put our heart and soul into AusLink. We had put a hell of a lot of money into it. Yet all that Mr Ferguson seemed to do was to follow me around. Wherever I promised to spend a bit of money on the Calder or the Ipswich Motorway, he would always come along to the same seat and promise to spend 10 per cent to 15 per cent more. He kept on promising a national land transport plan but it never came out during the election. I kept on asking the people in our campaign headquarters whether Martin Ferguson had released his policy yet, and the answer was always no. Nothing ever came out. It was just a mishmash of bandaids and electoral promises depending on which marginal seat he was visiting.
So it is slightly hypocritical of Senator Bishop to be talking about the lack of an integrated transport policy. The reality is that, under the leadership of John Anderson and this government, with AusLink we now have a substantial transport plan. It is not just about building more roads. It is about massively investing in rail infrastructure, catching up on massive underinvestments in both road and rail in past years and investing billions of dollars in links around our ports—and that will benefit shipping by improving the efficiency of shipping in and out of and around Australia.
The other thing AusLink does, as I said, is massively increase investment at the Commonwealth level. One of the simple things the states could do, rather than having a spat about who spends what on infrastructure, is simply agree in the next round of budgets to match the funding increases that the Commonwealth have put in through AusLink. That would be a good compact. I make that challenge today in the context of this speech in the second reading debate on the navigation bill: why don’t the states simply match the funding increases that the Commonwealth are putting into road and rail infrastructure through AusLink in the next five years? That would see a massive increase.
In Queensland, for example, we have increased funding by, from memory, 61 per cent. In Western Australia, we have increased funding by about 76 per cent. In Victoria, from memory, there has been just over a 100 per cent increase in road and rail spending by the Commonwealth. Quite frankly, if the states simply matched those AusLink increases, signed up to AusLink, stopped all their squabbling about the construction code and got some of this money onto the ground as quickly as possible then many of the constraints that are referred to in newspaper articles about the current account deficit could be abolished very quickly. To that extent, Senator Bishop, by raising the debate today, has done the country a service. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-08,"—The National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005 amends the National Health Act 1953 to allow the minister to determine prostheses that are going to be covered by health funds with no gap payable and prostheses which are to be covered by health funds but for which a gap will be payable by the health fund contributor, and to determine the minimum and maximum benefit amount listed for each gap permitted prostheses. In making these determinations, the minister may take into account advice from experts in the area of prostheses and in the health insurance industry.
This bill requires that health funds must provide no gap cover for at least one prostheses in relation to every in-hospital procedure for which a Medicare benefit is payable. The stated aim of the bill is to enhance the value of private health insurance and increase choice for consumers—and I will say more about the stated aim at a later point. The estimated savings from this measure are $4.3 million in 2005-06 and $20.6 million in 2006-07, based on an implementation date of 1 April 2005. It is interesting to note that the earlier bill that was introduced prior to the last election proposed savings of $61.9 million over four years based on the same implementation date, 1 April 2005. That being said, this measure originally featured in the 2003-04 budget, which identified savings of up to $49.6 million, with an implementation of 1 July 2003. I make that point simply to say that the figures seem to be moving around a little bit.
This bill was first introduced into the parliament on 12 August 2004. However, it lapsed when parliament was prorogued for the election. The bill varies from the original bill only in some relatively minor technical aspects, although some of these may, in Labor’s view, impact on patient costs. From the beginning, the Labor Party has expressed real concerns about this legislation. We have expressed concerns for a very transparent reason: that the premise of this bill, ostensibly, is about saving money for the government and for the health insurance industry. Doctors groups, including the AMA, have been consulted and so has the hospital sector, both public and private. However, it is obvious that the major impact of this legislation will be felt by patients because they very well may have less choice and certainty and face more out-of-pocket costs. But it is not an issue that consumers have been made aware of. I acknowledge the difficulty in doing this. It is not until we face having to access prostheses that we, as an individual or a community, truly understand what the cost of that might be. It is only when you have to have a hip replacement or a new heart valve or a stent to clear your arteries after a heart attack that you truly understand the cost of prostheses.
Patients are being ignored by this legislation—which, unfortunately, is typical of this government. There is nothing in the bill that ensures that a patient is informed about their out-of-pocket costs, and there is nothing in the bill that ensures that any savings that may be made by the health insurance funds will be passed on to consumers. We clearly need some changes in this area, and we acknowledge that. The system that we have needs an overhaul. But there are many questions regarding the capacity of the legislation that we have in front of us to bring about the required change. In April 2003 the Howard government announced the introduction of a range of reforms to:
… make private health insurance more efficient, competitive and deliver better value for money for members.
They claimed that this set of reforms would tackle supply costs, with their subsequent pressure on premiums, by seeking to rein in the costs of prostheses and eliminating the second tier default benefit—which ensures that there is a reasonable private health reimbursement level, even when a fund does not have an agreement with a hospital—for all but a few small rural and remote private hospitals.
In the 2003-04 budget the government estimated savings from these proposals at $49.6 million over four years. But the department unfortunately could not provide us a further breakdown of how those savings would eventuate. It was clear to us then, as it is now, that these initiatives are being driven by the private health insurance sector, not by consumers. As a result of questioning from Labor on these issues and a push from the private hospitals and the doctors’ groups on the licence given to the private health insurance industry in the proposal, the government finally rescinded the decision to abolish the second tier default benefit. Therefore, the bill in front of us is dealing with only the remaining prostheses commitment, first announced in the 2003-04 budget.
In terms of how private health insurance currently covers the cost of prostheses, as it stands, there is a list of items—known as ‘schedule 5: benefits payable in respect of surgically implanted prostheses, human tissue items and other medical devices list’—that health funds must fund for privately insured patients. Manufacturers or suppliers of prostheses must apply to the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing for the prostheses that they supply to be included on the list. The department subsequently assess the application against specific criteria. If a prosthesis is listed in schedule 5, private health insurance will cover the full cost of the prosthesis and there is no gap.
An expert committee, the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee, oversees the listing of prostheses in schedule 5. The committee comprises representatives of consumers, the medical profession, private hospitals, private health funds, prostheses manufacturers and the government. A frequent and quite justified complaint about the system is that each fund is required to notify each hospital which prostheses they will cover the cost of. The choice of prostheses, as we know, is generally made by the doctor—hopefully in consultation with the patient. The level of cover, though, is provided by the fund, and either the hospital or the patient is left to fund the gap.
Industry data reveals that in the year to June 2003, prostheses costs to the private health insurance industry were $546 million, up 24 per cent from the previous year, so you can tell this is a growing area of cost. The growth of new technologies makes prostheses the fastest growing sector of private health insurance cover and an area that makes the private health insurance funds keen to reel in. Three factors are driving the increase in prostheses costs for private health insurers. Firstly, the largest factor is the increase in utilisation. More people are using their private health cover to have, for example, cataract surgery or to have the hip replacement that they need. The government’s plan to have more people aged 65 and over take out private health insurance would, if it eventuated, add further pressure on the costs of utilisation. Secondly, many of these new technologies and new devices will generate cost savings because people require less time in hospital recuperating or require fewer replacements. As technology is developing, prosthetic knee devices, for example, have a longer life span so the likelihood of needing a replacement one is limited. Thirdly, but to a far lesser extent, is the increase in supplier costs.
In Labor’s view, the new process for the determination of which prostheses will be listed as ‘no gap’ or ‘gap’ and the pricing structure that will be assigned to each category under this legislation is untested and extremely complicated. There is nothing here that ensures that more than one product is listed in each ‘no gap’ category or that new technologies are considered as they become available. The likely consequence is—and this is the view of some in the sector—that only the oldest and the cheapest products will be listed as ‘no gap’. The current system for regulating prostheses, and particularly for evaluating their cost effectiveness, has been limited, and there is little by way of independent data on which to base decisions in the future. Nor is there anything to ensure that patients are provided with choice or that the savings are passed on to consumers, through a decreasing rate of premium increases, although that is the stated intent of the policy. In fact, the most likely outcome is that patients will have less choice or will pay more out-of-pocket costs for medical procedures involving prostheses.
My colleague Senator Moore will talk about the ‘hopeful’ legislation. I had to use that line; it is a beautiful line. This is very hopeful legislation, and during the inquiry we heard from many witnesses that they hoped that this would be the outcome that we would achieve. I spoke in the chamber last night about needing good data and good modelling on which to make decisions that are expensive and that impact on both public and private costs. I expressed a view about the legislation we were debating last night that making public policy requires good research and good data. This bill is in the same bucket as the aged care bill that we looked at last night that did not have very much data to support it.
I am afraid to say that, while the Howard government seemingly has a policy intent, the fact is that this legislation may very well not be able to deliver that policy intent. On the one hand, the government is championing private health insurance as being about choice but, sadly for consumers, this bill will limit choice and, in our view, increase out-of-pocket costs. The government is involving itself in an endless series of contradictions on health policy: it wants more people to take out health insurance but not to use it, it promises more choice and then joins with the private health insurers to limit that potential choice, it talks about the need to address the issues of healthy ageing but wants older Australians to pay more for their cataract surgery or their hip replacements, and it wants the savings from reining in private health insurance costs but does nothing to ensure that these are handed on either to consumers or to the budget through the 30 per cent rebate.
Labor recommended that this bill go to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to allow for public discussion on the implications of the bill. The report of that committee confirmed Labor’s fears with regard to choice for consumers. While there appear to be some steps in place to establish guidelines, codes of conduct and standard forms for doctors to assist with the provision of appropriate information to patients, Labor is not convinced that these processes are sufficiently established or tested. Given the level of hope that was expressed in that report and that will be expressed in this chamber, and given the level of uncertainty associated with the implementation and the medium-term effect of the bill, Labor moved a second reading amendment which called for a review of the bill after 1 July 2007. This is consistent with the view of a number of submissions to the Senate committee and underlines the department’s statements during the hearing which noted that the government has given a commitment to commence a review two years after full implementation of the new arrangements.
Labor’s amendment also called for the review to report in a timely manner, by 1 October 2007, for this review to be tabled by the minister and for the conduct of the review to not be unduly influenced by the private health insurance sector and to have strong representation from consumers. This amendment ensures that the issues associated with this bill that remain outstanding do remain on the table and that the appropriate checks and balances and evaluations are in place. In other words, we can be sure that we are enacting good health policy for the benefit of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-08,"—The National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005 aims to introduce some cost control into private health care and reduce cost pressures on health insurance premiums. The government has argued that the growing costs to health funds of covering prostheses and medical devices over the past 10 years have placed substantial upward pressure on private health insurance premiums, and it is certainly true that health insurance premiums have risen. They have risen on average by about seven per cent over the past four years—a rate two to three times the consumer price index. In April 2002, they rose by 6.9 per cent; in March 2003, 7.4 per cent; in March 2004, 7.82 per cent; and in March 2005, 7.96 per cent. In fact, health insurance fees have risen 30 per cent since 2001.
One thing that has been constant as far as private health insurance is concerned is the increase in premiums. It is also true that, following the government’s deregulation of prostheses in 2001, the total benefits paid for prostheses have risen rapidly. In 1989-90, 15 years ago, prostheses accounted for 1.7 per cent of total hospital benefits, whereas they now account for 12 per cent of hospital benefits. In the two years from 2001-02 to 2003-04, the growth in prostheses costs has been 29 per cent. Having let the price inflation horse bolt from the stable, as it were, it is certainly not before time that the government has looked at this issue.
This is a reasonably complex bill which has the potential to introduce some cost savings for the health insurance industry and, consequently, for people who pay health insurance premiums. But there are risks for consumers. There is nothing in this bill that will guarantee that any savings made by insurance funds will be handed on to consumers; there is nothing in this bill that will guarantee that a patient is informed about their out-of-pocket costs; and, of course, there is a great chance that the consumers—the patients themselves—will pay more.
It would seem to be that there is general agreement amongst the majority of groups that reform is needed in relation to current arrangements for the provision of private health insurance benefits for prostheses. The bill tackles that issue by essentially proposing the introduction of a system similar to that used by the PBS to address pricing of drugs. With that system, the PBS pays for the least expensive clinically effective drug and, if companies insist on charging more than the benchmark price for a particular drug, the patient has to bear that cost. Similarly, this bill will introduce gap and no gap lists of prostheses. Prosthetic items whose price is considered by an industry committee to fall outside a cost-effective range will end up on the gap list. The idea is that suppliers will be more likely to agree to lower prices than face the possibility that their device may end up on the gap list and become unattractive to patients and their doctors when compared to similar devices that would not carry a gap. These lower prices will mean savings for health insurance funds, and extra costs associated with the devices on the gap permitted list will be met by the patient, not by the health fund, adding to the savings the funds will make.
The question is: will private health insurance premiums stop rising at the phenomenal rates of the last few years? The relationship between private health insurance premium growth and prostheses has clearly been one of the driving forces behind the legislation. It is thought that the growth in prostheses alone is responsible for two per cent growth in private health insurance premiums each year. However, as I said, there is no guarantee that this bill will have any substantial impact on controlling the costs for prostheses or, if it does, that these savings will be passed on.
There are three main drivers for increasing costs. First, there is an overall increase in volume due to advances in surgical techniques and anaesthetics. Prostheses are now put into younger and older people than previously and they are available for more conditions. This is not necessarily a bad thing as the use of prostheses can mean improved quality of life, overall savings in health costs due to shorter hospital stays and reduced recovery time following surgery. Secondly, the cost of prostheses has also been driven up by new technologies, including the development of prostheses for conditions which used not to exist and ‘me too’ technologies that essentially do the same thing as older versions but cost a lot more. Thirdly, price inflation also has had a role to play in increasing the cost of prostheses.
As I said, this legislation only deals with the latter issues; therefore it may have a limited impact on reducing costs to health funds and subsequently a limited effect on keeping premiums down. The government’s own projections of savings to expenditure on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate from the effects of this bill are a very modest $24.9 million across the two years from 2005-07. The Parliamentary Library Bills Digest for this bill estimates that savings for 2005-06 represent less than one-half of one per cent of current expenditure on the rebate. Of course, there are many factors which impact on the premiums. The cost of prostheses is only one. Other factors are still likely to result in health insurance premium rises in the future.
There is concern about informed consent and out-of-pocket costs for patients. The new arrangements have the potential to substantially increase out-of-pocket costs for prostheses for privately insured individual consumers. I say ‘potential’ because we do not know how many of the roughly 9,000 items currently listed would end up on the gap permitted list. The more items that go onto the gap permitted list the greater the likelihood that people will face a gap. There is also a risk that allowing the introduction of gap permitted prostheses might lead to a differential quality of care based on ability to pay if prostheses that end up on the gap permitted list are of a higher standard than the non-gap prostheses.
At this point in time it is not known how many frequently used devices which would previously have been provided at no cost to privately insured consumers will attract that gap payment. It is assumed that the vast majority of prostheses will be on the no gap list. The government suggests it will be 80 per cent but, of course, that cannot be guaranteed. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one product with no gap for each procedure related to an MBS item. But, if patients choose to have other medical devices or prostheses, they will pay more.
Like legislative arrangements concerning other potential gaps, such as doctors or hospital costs, there are no legislative requirements to ensure informed financial consent. We are well aware of the many cases of people who believe that having private health insurance will give them cover for the cost of their treatment, only to find that, when they do go for treatment having made that decision, they are faced with substantial bills. The 2004 Private Health Insurance Ombudsman report states that consumers generally do not have a good understanding of how much it costs to be treated in a private hospital. If a health fund member finds they are not fully covered by their health insurance, the amount of money involved can come as an unpleasant surprise.
PHIAC statistics for the June quarter of 2004 showed that around 20 per cent of in-hospital medical services provided to patients involved out-of-pocket costs. That means a substantial minority of people are already facing out-of-pocket costs, and we can assume from the complaints made to the ombudsman that some of these people have not been well informed about these costs. The AMA has made strong statements that it is not the responsibility of doctors to ensure that patients are informed about the costs that flow to them because of the existence of the legislation. But the question is just whose responsibility it is. Hopefully, as part of a clinician’s decision-making process they will take into account the cost effectiveness of particular prostheses when deciding which is right for a patient. It is essential that doctors are well informed.
Failure to obtain informed consent can have substantial consequences for consumers and there is clearly good intent among industry stakeholders to ensure that patients are appropriately advised and informed of any potential gaps they may face. Given that there is no legislative requirement for independent monitoring or review of the adequacy of informed financial consent procedures following the introduction of these processes, it would seem important that there is this element in the new arrangements.
Independent review of the extent of out-of-pocket costs faced by consumers for their prostheses would be very valuable, particularly given experience with the PBS system and the high proportion of people facing premium charges for medications. The Democrats will support the Labor amendment that puts in place that review. We will also support the call for this legislation to cover prostheses implanted by a podiatric surgeons. I understand Senator Lees will move that amendment. As we have argued before, there is evidence that treatment outcomes for foot conditions treated by podiatrists and podiatric surgeons are in many cases better than when these conditions are treated by orthopaedic surgeons and other types of physicians. Podiatric surgeons may also provide a more cost-effective service than orthopaedic surgeons. Patients who wish to use the services of a podiatric surgeon should not be forced to use orthopaedic surgeons or pay out-of-pocket costs simply because their health insurance fund does not have coverage for a prostheses if it is implanted by a podiatric surgeon.
In conclusion, it is encouraging to see the government beginning to address the issue of cost control in the private sector. We hope that this is the first of many such measures along these lines. The 2004 OECD paper examining private health insurance in Australia reported that private funds do not exercise control over the quality, quantity or appropriateness of care provided and private health insurance has led to an overall increase in health utilisation as there are few limits on expenditure growth. If the government is to continue with its obsession with privatisation of health care, despite the plethora of evidence that the greater the degree of privatisation in health, the greater the cost of health care to the population as a whole, it at least has the responsibility to make sure that costs are contained within that sector.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-03-08,"—I was fortunate enough to be a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which the National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005 was referred to earlier this year. Until that time, ‘prostheses’ was but a term to me. I had heard about the legislation and had read up on it, but when I was given the opportunity to sit with this committee I became more aware of not only the number of people for whom this was an interesting point but also the number of members of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee who had prostheses themselves. They self-identified before the committee started, and I found that particularly interesting. I myself do not have any devices currently, so I can speak with openness on this topic.
In terms of the information we have had, my colleagues in the Senate have talked about the technical aspects of this bill. I want to concentrate on a few points which I think we need to consider when we are looking at passing this legislation. As Senator McLucas mentioned, I have referred to the committee as the ‘committee of hope’ because, whilst we had 12 submissions and a number of people gave evidence before the committee, the one common theme that we heard was that everybody really ‘hoped’ that this legislation would work. Everybody really hoped that there would be some containment of, some acknowledgment of and some improvement in the way this issue was being handled in our community. Reflecting that hope, there was also genuine agreement that what was happening currently was not good. We heard, for instance, from the Australian Private Hospitals Association, which said:
Reform of these existing arrangements is therefore not optional, it is essential.
We heard that it was absolutely critical that we as participants in this government looked effectively at the way legislation would be introduced so that there would be some real understanding of the way the budget would operate and so that the medical profession, the hospitals and all those people who had an interest in this area would be able to cooperate to ensure that we had the best possible system. In the submission from the Department of Health and Ageing—and this was also reflected in the explanatory memorandum to this bill—we heard about the issue of cost. Of course, that is important. The Department of Health and Ageing said:
Prostheses have been identified as one of the major cost drivers of health insurance premiums. Current rates of growth in prostheses costs are estimated to contribute around 2 per cent a year to total premium growth. There was an annual average 29 per cent increase in prostheses benefits paid in 2003-04 compared to 2000-01. Benefits paid in 2003-04 totalled over $647 million.
That is in payment to people who made genuine claims for surgical processes which included devices—and I hope to use that word for the rest of this speech. I only caught that one during the committee hearings. I think I would have used that word much more commonly if I had known that earlier. The expectation is that the new arrangements the changes that are before us are expected to make a significant contribution to reducing the pressure on health insurance premiums by limiting the rapid growth in benefits being paid. The anticipated savings are significant. I believe that they are almost essential in terms of where we are going as a community. But what worries me deeply is that the introduction of the legislation is based on hope. The actual details are not yet clear. In fact, Catholic Health Australia made that comment in their submission, which they followed up with evidence as witnesses to the committee. They said:
Not all of the detail has yet been worked out and we are yet to see what the outcome of the new arrangements will mean in terms of the extent of gap payments that consumers may face.
They went on to say:
Nevertheless we believe that the goodwill displayed by all parties to date and the consultative processes in place should provide comfort to Senate that the Bill should be supported.
I truly hope that the Senate can be comforted by those processes, but it always concerns me as a member of this place when we are asked to agree to legislation when the details are not clear and when we rely on the goodwill of all participants to achieve it. Certainly something that all the people who appeared before our committee shared was goodwill, because there was hope that these processes would operate. Nonetheless, it seems to be a precarious way to move through the process.
Up until now, people in the community having these surgical procedures could have confidence that their costs would be paid for any devices apropriately used in surgical procedures. The change is that there will now be gap payments in some cases. Gap payments are not new to the Australian community. As was submitted to our committee, gap payments are standard in so many parts of our medical system. The real issue here, though, is that up to now there has not been a gap payment for this procedure. Now there will be. We do not know how large the gap will be. That provides a great deal of concern for all those who are part of the industry and all those who feel that they will probably need a device in the future—and it probably concerns the minister. No-one wishes to make significant changes to legislation, including cost factors, without knowing exactly what the gap payments will be. I think that is something that should be more a reality than a hope.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-03-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to women.
I acknowledge, as Senator Patterson and others have today, that today is International Women’s Day, so there was no surprise that many of today’s questions related to the social and economic circumstances of women. My question to the minister today related to the government’s proposal to change the mechanism for setting the minimum wage, which protects the income of low-paid women. We were talking of nearly one million women—965,000—who are protected under state and federal minimum wage awards. What do we know about the pressures that are confronting these women?
First of all, we know the importance of the minimum wage and that a boost to minimum wages is the key to sustaining a decent standard of living for Australia’s growing number of part-time and casual workers. The majority of low-paid workers are women. Increasing the minimum wage is an important means of reducing the gap between male and female wages. Many figures were thrown around the chamber this afternoon about the bridging of that gap. But the reality is that women’s wages are significantly lower and as such are also a significant disincentive for many women with children to work, who also face high child-care costs and the loss of the family tax benefit as their income increases.
What is the government’s response? First of all, in December the federal government moved to delay the ACTU national wage case, with Mr Andrews arguing that the Industrial Relations Commission would be wiser if it waited until after the May budget before its hearings began. At the time Mr Andrews said, ‘It makes sense for the AIRC to delay its hearings on the national wage case, until it has all the available economic data at its disposal.’ I was very pleased today to hear that we have a $10 billion budget surplus, which means that the ACTU wage case could be considered, in all of its aspects, to be a fair and generous approach to the low-paid wages of Australians.
But Mr Andrews was not prepared to stay there. He also suggested that one of the Howard government’s options was to slash the minimum wage, by removing the AIRC from the process altogether. The AIRC currently complies with the legislative directive to maintain a safety net of minimum wages and conditions, according to living standards that are generally expected by the Australian community. As part of its safety net assessment, the AIRC currently takes into account average weekly earnings, the balance of payments, inflation and productivity. The current system also allows a range of organisations, including the Reserve Bank and the Productivity Commission, to participate in a wage case assessment.
The minimum wage set by the AIRC is designed to protect the wages and entitlements of Australia’s lowest paid workers. It also acts as a mechanism to limit the wage divide between Australia’s highest paid and lowest paid workers. Perhaps Senator Patterson has also decided to adopt the Business Council of Australia’s view that fairness in the relationship between employers and employees is not a public policy priority. That is certainly not what Labor thinks about this issue. Labor believes that the ACTU’s claim for a minimum wage increase of $26.60 a week is a very fair and justifiable claim. The case would lift the federal minimum wage from $12.30 to $13 per hour. It would also increase the federal minimum wage from $467.40 to $494 per week or in fact $24,370 to $25,757 per year. Labor believes that low-paid workers need a decent wage rise and that their needs and their concerns must be protected by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Women: Government Policies</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,6,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-03-08,"—In taking note of the answers of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women’s Issues, the opposition seem to be attempting to suggest that the position of women in Australia would be greatly assisted by some dramatic lift in the minimum wage, and they urge the government to support the ACTU’s position on lifting the minimum wage. The smallest amount of scrutiny and analysis of what Senator Stephens has just had to say will disclose that it is very hard to work out why lifting the minimum wage will necessarily lead to a closing of the gap in the wages between men and women. It would obviously benefit everybody who was on a minimum wage if the minimum wage were lifted. How it would benefit women vis-a-vis men is a little hard to determine. But it is worth making this point: the Howard government in the last nine years has specifically targeted the lifting of standards for all Australians as a way of assisting women as well as men. Raising the level of employment in the Australian community has been about lifting the capacity of women to find the work they need to lead independent lives, to be able to support families and to be able to make decisions that affect their own lives. Ensuring that interest rates remain relatively low has been about assisting women and their families to take out mortgages so that their position is improved.
The evidence of those measures is clear for anybody to observe at this point in time. As far as women in the work force are concerned, in January 2005 there were 4,422,200 women in employment. That is a lot of women. It represents a 4½ per cent increase in the number of women in the work force since 1996, when we took office—that is, there has been a 22.7 per cent increase in the number of women in the work force since March 1996. That is a tangible expression of the way that this government’s work has led to an improvement in the position of women.
Those opposite made a very thin case for some sort of change in policy and some kind of adjustment to the minimum wage that would somehow offer more benefits than those that have been delivered by this government. It is a pretty hard case to make. When we came to office the unemployment rate for women was 7.6 per cent; today it is 5.3 per cent. That is the most clear demonstration of how women have benefited under the policies of this government. Of course it will be possible to find some statistical basis on which to suggest there has been some lack of progress or some failure to achieve a target that might be set with respect to the position of women in Australian society. Of course it is always possible to find the dark lining in the silver cloud. Members of the opposition will do their best to find that dark lining, no doubt. But, if you look at the total picture—the support available to women as mothers, the position of women in the work force, the standard of living of Australian women compared with where they were nine years ago—if you look at any of those major indicators, it is perfectly clear that Australian women have benefited from the policies of the Howard government.
The number of women in senior positions in Australia is a further expression of that. We have heard from the minister about the record numbers of women ambassadors, high commissioners and permanent heads of our Public Service departments. That has not been through the application of some quota process; it has been by virtue of women being given the opportunity to demonstrate their talents, and those talents have led them into positions which I am pleased to say have benefited the Australian community.
The support that this government has given to women has been clear. A demonstration of that is available in the statistics which have measured the progress of women in the last nine years. I think it is fair enough for the opposition to try look at areas where they consider the progress has not been fast enough, but they cannot deny that progress has been real and substantial. Looking at the total picture, we see that women today have benefited from the policies implemented by this government over the last nine years.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Women: Government Policies</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,6,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2005-03-08,"—Reflecting on how these issues regarding women were canvassed in question time today, I think the critical issue that needs to be raised is the quality of this debate as a whole. Senator Humphries talks about the need to look at the total picture—that there have been substantial advances. To be frank, reflecting on the indicators that have been canvassed during this debate and during many of the discussions and reports in recent times, I think they themselves make you seriously concerned about the quality of this debate.
Government senators highlight changes in employment, but we have seen opinion pieces and articles, time after time now, highlighting the fact that it is not just employment itself but also the quality of employment that is very critical to women. If they cannot balance their work and family lives with employment that is suitable and that fits their needs, the problems facing women will continue. Many indicators suggest that, if anything, those problems have been becoming worse. This government’s mantra about flexibility in employment has really been about employer prerogative and flexibility for the employer, rather than women being able to make more appropriate choices about how they combine work and family.
This is why new catchphrases such as ‘baby strike’ have arisen. Why can’t we encourage young women these days to have children? Because our society is not providing them with the wherewithal to be able to do so. This is what is getting worse for the vast majority of Australian women. It is one thing for the government to talk about the number of women ambassadors and women in senior government appointments, but we need to look at the issues that the vast majority of Australian women face. The vast majority of the Australian women who work in the corporations that Senator Patterson highlighted today have made little, if any, progress in the representation of women within their ranks. The vast majority of Australian women do continue to suffer a significant wages gap.
During question time today I asked Senator Patterson and Senator Abetz if they would provide the indicator they were relying on for their claims that the wages gap was improving, because I am very clear and very sure that indicators measuring the deregulated enterprise bargaining that occurred under the Howard government were highlighting that the wages gap was going backwards. Like many commentators in this area, I am aware that there are many indicators of the wages gap. You need to carefully and quite analytically eliminate the factors from those indicators to know exactly what you are talking about. Senator Abetz stumbled for a while and then came up with the indicator he had actually been given so that we could at least trace the source of the particular indicator he was relying on.
His flippant disregard for the issue in referring to me as a ‘quota girl’ amused me significantly. I came into this place as the only female Labor representative from Victoria. I am very pleased that today that situation has changed significantly. But I did not come here as a quota girl. There were no quotas in relation to our parliamentary representation. I think that flippant remarks by Senator Abetz about such things discredit the whole day. Today is the day to celebrate International Women’s Day. It is not the day to have banal arguments about whether quotas are targets or targets are quotas or how we can ensure that appropriate representation of women is achieved in this place.
We are doing much better in parliament. Senator Patterson raised that point today. We are doing much better through a variety of different means and they seem to be working across political parties. I will be pleased to see that, in another generation or two, women will be much better represented, and they will be represented with a solid base and background in political participation within their parties that will make a difference to the policies we make in this place. They are the bases that have been established. That is what the work on International Women’s Day has been able to achieve.
Later this year I will be celebrating what I think Senator Faulkner alluded to in his notice of motion as the 30th year of International Women’s Day. Some of us have a careful and close regard for many of the indicators of women’s participation and involvement in society and the community and of their general wellbeing. The quality of the debate that has occurred here today, I must say, is insulting. It would be good to see a clear and frank discussion of valid indicators about women’s progress, not the flippant disregard that occurred in the discussion in question time today.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Women: Government Policies</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,6,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-03-08,"—It was interesting to hear comments on the quality of debate from the other side. In fact, the material which Senator Patterson in particular put on the record in question time this afternoon, and to which I will refer in this debate, is relevant to precisely the sorts of people to which Senator Collins was referring. I note in passing that Senator Collins is keen to assure the chamber that she did not enter the parliament under any arrangement concerning quotas or targets or both of the above. I am sure it is important to note that for the record. But it is undeniable that those opposite in the Australian Labor Party do support a quota system that is not supported on this side of the parliament. If senators on the other side want to walk away from that now then perhaps that is an internal party matter they want to pursue. But it is a matter of fact and a matter of record that that is an arrangement in that party’s organisation.
What I want to say this afternoon is that this government, for its entire term since 1996, has supported a policy of both opportunity and choice for women, and for precisely the sorts of women to whom Senator Collins referred. We are committed to providing a range of measures that assist women in all of the roles that they fulfil as they move through their lives. That is part of recognising that there are different needs in relation to education, families, work and retirement, all at different points in their lives and all at different levels of the community. We well know, over the last perhaps 18 months to two years, the extent of the debate in the community about the challenges of balancing work and family life, trying to determine where the balance actually lies, working out it means to be in a partnership trying to do that and all of those sorts of issues. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and particularly the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, have done some exceptional work in this regard. I think a number of members of the Senate have had an opportunity to examine that.
I will now look at some of the fundamentals that people need in order to work through their lives and deal with some of those issues. I will start with child care. In pure financial terms this government has spent and continues to spend more on child care than any of our predecessor Labor governments ever did. In fact, in the six years to 2003-04, that amounted to around $8.8 billion in child care in this country. I remember very early in my role in the Senate participating in a community affairs inquiry into child care, where changes which were proposed by the coalition government were meant to bring an end to child care as we know it. That was clearly not the case.
Clearly there are ongoing challenges. We addressed those in a number of our election policies last year. Those were election policies which the Australian constituency decided they preferred over the election policies presented in this area by the other side. We use the family tax benefit to assist families with children. Around two million families in Australia, who have 3.5 million of Australia’s children, benefit from that family tax benefit. Changes introduced in the 2004‑05 budget will enhance the level of support that is provided to most of those families. For example, there was the lump sum payment of $600 per child, which has been paid to families who receive or are eligible to receive family tax benefit A. There will be an ongoing $600 increase in the level of family tax benefit A payment per child. Also, from 1 July this year, secondary income earners who return to work after caring for a child will be able to keep the family tax benefit B received prior to their return to the work force. They are just a couple of examples. The chamber today discussed support for new mothers in the maternity payment of $3,000, which was introduced on 1 July last year. That payment assists with the costs associated with the birth or adoption of a new baby. That rate will increase from 1 July 2008.
Senator Humphries referred comprehensively to the participation of women in the work force as well. The government also pursues transition to work services particularly for parents, carers and mature aged people—overwhelmingly women, in this case—who want to return to or join the work force. That gives people guidance on possible career directions as well as help in areas like skill assessments, confidence and self-esteem issues. Whether it is career and training plans, information technology or access to training, it is all fundamental support for women who wish to continue in or return to the work force. They are baseline, important levels of support for people trying to achieve that family-work-life balance that we talked about. There is also a number of initiatives in relation to leadership.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2005-03-08,"—One of the phrases that often gets thrown around in debates like this is the ‘gender gap’, particularly in relation to issues to do with wage levels. One of the other gaps that is relevant to this debate is the gap between the rhetoric and the reality—the rhetoric of the government, which we have just heard two of the speakers from the government engage in, and the reality of what is facing workers in this country, particularly those who are low paid, those who are under awards and those who are relying on the minimum wage. In many of those cases they are women workers.
Senator Payne rattled off statistics about what this government has supposedly done to assist women to rejoin the work force as a matter of choice. The reality is that for many women it is not a matter of choice; it has become a matter of absolute necessity. In some cases they have had to return to the work force earlier than they would have otherwise wanted to because of the economic pressure, the financial pressure, on their families. Clearly, we all support choice, but it should be a choice that is able to be entered into freely, not one that is forced upon families, as we have increasingly seen under this government. The government talks about low interest rates. What it fails to mention is that if you look at the proportion of household income that has to be paid today on a home loan you will see that it has gone up substantially. That is also the case if you look at levels of credit card debt and at the pressures on families right across the board.
Senator Payne referred to what the government has done with the payment of the $600 baby bonus and the other announcements that were made prior to the election last year—the election bribery that it engaged in. What we know is that there are thousands and thousands of families across this country who have been hit with debts from Centrelink for the last two or three years because of the policies followed by this government. Many cases were drawn to my attention and to the attention of other members of parliament. Mothers were ringing up our offices saying, ‘I’ve just got this bill from Centrelink to repay a large amount of the family allowance.’ Those women were not ringing up to give plaudits to the government for their supposed assistance to them. They were very critical of the extreme financial pressure that they were facing.
I want to turn to one critical aspect of this whole debate, and that is the role of the minimum wage and this government’s approach. We have heard in recent times Minister Andrews, the Prime Minister and others talking up how, once they get control of this chamber, they are going to ram through their industrial relations policies, such as getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws. When you have a work force in this country, many of them women, who are in low-paid jobs, in casual employment—the vast majority are in casual employment—one of the only protections they have under the industrial relations system in this country is against unfair dismissal. That is going to disappear under this government after July.
One of the other protections they have is the right to an award rate of pay, a minimum rate of pay. I have had some experience of this, as have my colleagues Senator George Campbell and Senator Sherry in previous careers: going before the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire, and arguing for national wage increases, for increases in the minimum wage, for workers under awards. What I recall is that time after time, for year after year, the conservatives, the coalition parties, opposed every single one of those national wage increases. I recall the Treasurer, Mr Costello, then an advocate for the National Farmers Federation, getting up and opposing superannuation for award workers in this country, for many of the women and men on basic award rates of pay. He said that they were not entitled to superannuation, and now we hear this government trying to take the credit for increased superannuation coverage for workers. It was a Labor government that introduced it and it was coalition governments in the states and federally under Malcolm Fraser and subsequently under John Howard that opposed that time and time again.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-03-08,"—The matter I wish to raise in the context of this debate is indeed covered by the take note of answers motion that the Labor Party has moved. I wish to refer specifically to the issue of the maternity payment, which has been mentioned by a couple of speakers in this debate, but before I do I want to wish my female colleagues and all women in Australia a happy International Women’s Day.
We have had many debates about the maternity payment in this place. Honourable senators would be aware of the Democrat preference for a system of national, government funded, paid maternity leave, preferably for 14 weeks, as is the ILO standard, and certainly, under the bill that I have proposed, at at least the minimum rate. In the context of today’s debate and a question that I asked the minister—and that is relevant to International Women’s Day—is the fact that adoptive parents are not entitled to access the maternity payment if they adopt children who are older than 26 weeks. I do not mean to reflect upon a decision or a vote of the Senate, because we know that this debate was in full fling last night, but the government—and I commend them, as I did the minister today in question time—have ensured that adoptive parents can now access the baby bonus, albeit retrospectively. The baby bonus has been replaced by the maternity payment, but the same changes have not been made. That means that we still have a situation where adoptive parents are discriminated against unfairly because they cannot access the maternity payment if their child is more than 26 weeks old.
I asked about this issue today in question time. A number of senators have commented on the issue of the maternity payment, but I want to draw the Senate’s attention to one blatant, discriminatory fact. If you are an adoptive parent in Australia today and you adopt a child of more than 26 weeks you cannot get that vital government financial support to which you should be entitled and, indeed, to which, as of last night, you would have been entitled if it had been the baby bonus. I know it gets confusing, but that is what happens when you are dealing with retrospectivity in legislation and when the government makes poor policy changes even when it has been forewarned of such an issue.
I put on record today the fact that this is discriminatory and the fact that most adoptions that take place, particularly those from overseas, are of children of more than 26 weeks of age. I call again on the government and specifically the Minister for Family and Community Services to rectify this problem with the maternity payment, as they did last night for the baby bonus. I do thank Minister Coonan for her work on this issue.
International Women’s Day generally is a great opportunity for us to acknowledge how far we have come, and I do not deny that. Both major parties in this place talk about the achievements, but we also need to talk about and assess the campaigns that we have left to fight. There are a number of outstanding issues in society today confronting women. Yes, industrial relations reform is one of them. Yes, the gender wage gap, to which Senator Forshaw referred, is another—the inequity in terms of pay rates; the unequal pay rates for men and women for the same work.
Domestic violence is an outstanding issue. Unfortunately, the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program is due to run out in the middle of this year. I have heard no reports that it will be replaced or continued. I have looked at the forward estimates in relation to the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault and I cannot see that funding being anything but halved in future years. We have a range of issues, not the least of which is paternity and maternity leave. Let us not pretend that fobbing Australian women off with a $3,000 one-off payment is actually going to address the systematic disadvantage that women have in the work force—that is, women wanting to take time off at the birth of a child.
There are many other issues affecting Australian women. They are the ones we should be debating and discussing today in addition to celebrating our goals and achievements. I look forward to the day when we have better and perhaps proportional representation of women not just in this place but in executive power as well. I once again call on the government to end this blatant discrimination against adoptive parents with children over 26 weeks of age.

Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry

These Guidelines specify guidelines to be used by a delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in exercising powers under Part VA of the Act, such as requiring a person to provide information or documents in relation to a building industry investigation.
Clause 15 of these Guidelines specifies limitations on the use of the power to issue a notice. Paragraph (a) states that a power must only be used for building industry investigations, but must not be used for matters that are minor or petty. This reflects subsection 88AA(3) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (as amended). Questions may be raised as to whether a matter is ‘minor or petty’.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-03-08,"—It is International Women’s Day today. Many women are wearing the colours of green, white and violet to symbolise the achievements of women and to send a message to governments—not just here in Australia, but everywhere—that women’s issues matter. Today I would like to focus my comments on the lack of respect accorded to Australian women by this government which has been demonstrated in many ways, not least by its failure to address the needs of working women.
At present, women are paid over $16,000 less per year than men. That is the difference when we compare the total average wage of men and women. On average, women working full time are paid 15 per cent less than men working full time—earning an average of $150 less. Only about 12 per cent of women workers were able to benefit from the tax cuts which went to those earning over $52,000. Women form the majority of low paid and casual workers. Nearly 1.2 million women workers are in casual work, which means that they have no access to paid leave to look after families and no security of employment to offer as collateral—for example, for a housing loan.
The Howard government’s proposed industrial relations measures which it will force through the parliament after the July Senate changes are of enormous concern to women. We have already been given warning of the government’s punitive and merciless approach to low paid workers, most of them women, in its proposed—and I have to say cynically titled—Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003. Now the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its role in setting minimum wages is under attack by the government. We know that the Howard government has done woefully little to support working women and working parents. The government has signalled its disdain for the needs of working families and of the importance of family friendly workplaces.
At the recent federal election, the government did not even bother to put forward a work and family policy. Work and family issues appear to be beyond the comprehension of this government, despite the degree of lip-service that they endlessly repeat in defence of their poor policies. The evidence is certainly there: the Howard government have systematically white-anted the child-care programs that were built up under Labor, thereby reducing access to and the availability of quality child care. Working parents are meant to be accorded a higher priority for child-care places than nonworking parents but the Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that the parents of 174,500 children cannot find the child-care services that they require—that they need. So the government have chosen consistently to ignore the needs of working parents for quality community based care.
The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, is presently highlighting the pressures posed by the modern reality of paid work and family commitments and has warned that these pressures may well be the reason that fertility rates in Australia are at risk. These are very real issues and they are always ignored by the largely male right wing lobby group which likes to periodically raise the issue of abortion and suggest various methods of ‘punishment’ such as the abolition of Medicare funding, prolonged counselling and other penalties which might serve to deter or prevent women from having legal abortions. Don’t they realise that they are tackling the problem at the wrong end? Instead of applying financial penalties to women after an abortion, this government should in the first instance acknowledge women’s choice and seek actively to recognise the very real concerns, financial and other, that can force women to the decision to have an abortion.
Two years ago the issue of maternity leave in Australia received a great deal of attention, although not a lot of it by this government. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner then pointed out:
The absence of a national scheme [of paid maternity leave] means that Australian women will continue to return to work early and leave their children early, hardly in step with a so-called family-focused nation such as ours. Meanwhile women in all other OECD countries, except the United States, are able to remain at home for at least those first ... months.
The Sex Discrimination Commissioner said that it is the responsibility of the government to provide a comparable maternity leave scheme to those in other OECD countries, and urged this country ‘to commit to a national scheme of paid maternity leave as soon as possible’. Yet, despite the government’s alternative scheme of the maternity allowance to be phased in over some years, Australia’s embarrassing reservation to the maternity leave provision of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, remains.
The government’s disdain of women’s issues has been demonstrated by its downgrading of the Office of the Status of Women—relegated to another department from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and renamed the Office for Women—and by its cavalier approach to the funding of women’s organisations and programs. A prime example has been the campaign to combat violence against women, which has had a sorry history under the Howard government. Delays and lack of commitment have been displayed by the ‘borrowing’ of domestic violence program funding for the terrorism fridge magnets; the last-minute pulling out of the No Respect, No Relationship campaign and its substitution six months later by a watered-down campaign which was more palatable to the Prime Minister’s male advisers; and now the lack of ongoing funding after July 2005, or the failure to date to announce ongoing funding for the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program.
Indigenous women have been particularly badly served by this government, perhaps especially in its lack of commitment to initiatives to combat Indigenous family violence and to Indigenous health measures. Life expectancy for Indigenous women has actually decreased since 1996 and is now 62.8 years.
In education as well as in employment this government has disadvantaged women. In the science and mathematics fields women continue to battle against systems which traditionally enrol or employ far more males than females. In New South Wales a 2002 discussion paper on the placement process for selective high schools revealed that, of the students who applied, girls had a far lower acceptance rate than boys—19 per cent of the girls who applied were accepted as opposed to 24 per cent of the boys who applied. In Victoria selective high schools cater for about 32 per cent more boys than girls. Insufficient TAFE places have meant that about 20,000 women miss out on TAFE courses each year. We are desperately short of nurses and teachers, traditionally professions which have attracted women, yet thousands of students have failed to gain places in nursing and teacher training courses.
It is not surprising then that the research report on women’s lives, which was released today by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women’s Issues finds that women in general have become increasingly unhappy, lonely and unhealthy. Helen Kelleher, convenor of the Australian Women’s Health Network, pointed to the demands made on women, especially those who are sole parents. These women, she said, have ‘many, many things on their minds in terms of raising children and juggling custody issues, managing paid work and perhaps trying to further their education’.
Many of the gains which were made in the status of women’s issues to 1996 have been eroded by the coalition government since that time. The Howard government will not be able to continue to try to camouflage or talk around the deterioration of the living standards of women and families. Whilst I am yet to read the report which was released today entitled Women in Australia 2004, it is very clear that the numbers expressed in that document show a very disturbing picture of the trend. From my perspective, from having talked to my constituents and women around the country, that is their experience. Life is getting more difficult to handle, particularly with respect to the balance of work and family. Those pressures are getting greater. Certainly the prospect of relieving some of that pressure under the Howard government is nonexistent.
On a more personal note, I would like to dedicate today’s International Women’s Day to grandmothers. I would like to acknowledge the care that they have provided to their families, their children and their grandchildren for all their lives. I would also like to acknowledge those who continue to provide care for grandmothers as well. They are very special people in my heart, and my thoughts are with both of my grandmothers today.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-03-08,"—I am very pleased to rise today to speak on this matter of public importance largely because I consider that for women, in the continuum of time since their opportunities really began to open up—after, let us say, the mid-1950s—the present eight or nine years of the Howard government have been a time of opportunity and choice, which continues to expand. No-one denies that women play many roles as they move though their life span. They have different needs at different times of their lives, according to education, family, work and retirement. Certainly government policies, insofar as they can, under this government have endeavoured to provide help to women and families at various stages.
Addressing point (a), the decline in women’s wages compared with men’s wages, I would point out that under the coalition, since 1996, full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms—that is, after taking account of inflation—by $152 per week. This is a 21 per cent real increase and represents an annual rate of growth in real earnings of 2.2 per cent. Over this period, average weekly earnings for females have grown by more than 35 per cent compared with 34 per cent for men. While it is correct that the absolute gap between male and female earnings over this period has increased, the relativity of female earnings to male earnings has improved. It is important that these figures be viewed in the context of the prevalence of part-time working arrangements for women. Many women prefer part-time employment as it suits their domestic arrangements and they are able to fit in with their partner, their children and any other commitments they have, such as caring for elderly parents. Forty five per cent of female employment is part time compared to 15 per cent for men.
Contrasting that with the situation under the previous Labor government, women’s real earnings grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 per cent. The claim made by Senator Lundy that women’s earnings grew annually by 5.9 per cent under Labor and 4.6 per cent under the coalition are not about the rate of earnings; they are claims about the rate of inflation. In contrast to these claims, we need to consider the very real gains that have been made by women under this government.
Effective marginal tax rates may act as a barrier to increasing the participation of women and sole parents. The level of tax rates is not the only barrier to participation. But, if we are to consider tax rates, it would be well known to every Australian voter that prior to the A New Tax System, introduced by this government in 1998, many families were facing a marginal tax rate of 34c in the dollar and family payment withdrawal rates of 50c in the dollar. This government has significantly cut taxes through three stages of personal income tax cuts, which have benefited women along with everybody else.
On 1 July 2000, we introduced A New Tax System, which represented a major restructuring of the Australian tax system. It continued in the 2003-04 budget, with tax thresholds being further adjusted. The 2004-05 budget tax cuts are the third element of our tax reform. We will continue our reform of the income tax scales through increases in the income thresholds at which the top two tax rates start to apply. Over this time, this has meant that around 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay a marginal rate of tax no higher than 30 per cent. We also reduced the taper rate between the maximum and base rate of the family tax benefit to 20 per cent, which reduced effective marginal tax rates for low- to middle-income families. Compared with 1999, effective marginal tax rates for families have fallen from 84 per cent to 50 per cent—a real decrease in anyone’s terms.
As I said, the level of tax rates is not the only barrier to participation. When we look at the help that has been provided for sole parents and the help that we provide with the cost of raising children, around two million families with 3.5 million children have been assisted through the family tax benefit and the vast majority of Australian families with dependent children are now eligible to receive the family tax benefit. Not only is there a lump sum payment of $600 per child to parents eligible to receive it, but there will be an ongoing $600 increase in the level of family tax benefit part A payment per child. Returns from working have increased for many families with a reduction in the taper rate in part A and part B from 30 per cent to 20 per cent from 1 July 2004. From 1 July 2005, secondary income earners who return to work after caring for a child will be able to keep the family tax benefit part B that was received prior to their return to the work force. If that is not helping to increase participation rates, I would like to know what is—because more families will be able to keep more of their assistance as their family earnings increase, more families have become eligible for family tax benefit, and the family tax benefit part B income threshold has been increased so that secondary earners are now able to earn more income before their income affects their family tax benefit entitlement and they lose their family tax benefit part B entitlement. We are committed to increasing the maximum rate of family tax benefit part B by $300 from July 2005.
Tax rates are nondiscriminatory and it is important that women’s participation in the work force is increasing. In 1996, 49.6 per cent of Australian women were in employment. That figure has now risen to 53.6 per cent, with the strong growth of our economy. Since 1996, 479,300 jobs have been created, of which 339,000 are full-time, which reflects the diversity of the aspirations of Australian women. That equates to more than half the total number of created jobs. Not only that, but there has been remarkable growth in the employment of older women.
The proportion of 55- to 59-year-old women in paid work has risen from around 39 per cent to over 52 per cent in just over eight years, and even stronger growth has been achieved by women aged 60 to 64 years. With the ageing of the population, it is very important that older workers who want to stay in their jobs can do so to boost their retirement savings, and it is very gratifying to see that employers are accepting that older workers are able to stay on at their jobs. Transition to Work services have also helped those women who want to go back to work after raising their family to go back to work, and participants receive help and guidance on possible career directions.
So we have more jobs, higher earnings, better support for families and a tax system that allows Australians to retain more of the fruits of their labour. Surely this is about achieving a better balance between work and family. I do not have time to cover it in any great detail, but I do assure the Senate that access to and the affordability of child care has increased remarkably since the coalition came to office. Not only have we provided a better child-care rebate, we have provided extra help, such as extra outside school hours care places, more family day care places and generally increased child-care services—from 7,932 to 10,126, up 28 per cent.
I am delighted to say that the position of women has improved remarkably in that 50 year continuum that I spoke about, and many women these days are delighted at the choice they have, not only of occupation but also of the way they structure their family and work responsibilities. That has been provided by their own very hard-working endeavours and, to some extent, the far-sighted policies of this government, which has continued to give women a very fair go.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-03-08,"—I am very pleased on this International Women’s Day to speak on the matter of public importance put before the Senate by Senator Lundy. It gives us the opportunity to address some of the important issues and barriers facing Australian women at this time. International Women’s Day is obviously a day on which we celebrate the achievements of women in Australia and around the world and also recognise what is yet to be done both in Australia and around the world. I want to talk very briefly today about the issue of the government’s broader economic agenda across a range of portfolio areas and the way it has a differential gender impact. I want to talk about the government’s economic agenda and show, in some areas particularly, how it negatively impacts on women. The first point is in the area of their industrial relations reform.
We had, one might say, a rare moment of honesty from Senator Troeth, who acknowledged that in absolute terms there had been an increase in the differential between men’s and women’s pay. That is the case. It is the case in this country that in all the years since the original Industrial Relations Commission’s decision on equal pay in 1972—when some of us were not even at school and many of us were doing very different things to what we are doing now—we are still in the situation where Australian women earn on average $150 a week less than men. We know that Australia has done relatively well, despite the fact that in 2005 women still lag significantly behind their male fellow citizens. We know that one of the reasons why Australia has been able to address the gap between male and female earnings is our centralised wage fixation system. The fact is that if you look at where people are employed in Australia—in which sectors they are employed—women remain vastly overrepresented in low-paid jobs and part-time and casual employment, and that is one of the reasons why women’s earnings are not as good relative to men’s.
Of course, for women in those low-paid areas one of the main ways, and often the primary and only way, in which they get wage increases is through adjustments to award minimum wages. That is one of the primary ways in which the women of this country in low-paid work actually get better wages and conditions. So when this government talks about stripping away awards, when it starts to question the basis of the minimum wage, we should understand that it is talking about removing one of the mechanisms which has improved gender equity in this country. We should understand it is talking about removing institutions, laws and a regulatory framework which has advantaged women in Australia—particularly low-paid women and women with little economic clout. That is the effect of many of the government’s industrial relations reforms.
I also want to talk briefly in the time that I have allotted about the issue of work force participation, but first I will mention the issue of effective marginal tax rates. This is a particular issue for women. Women on various welfare benefits who move from the benefit into work often face very punishing effective marginal tax rates. These EMTRs sap the incentive to work, punish people for earning and clearly act as a barrier to the move from welfare to work, and this has particular relevance to women. This is not a new discussion. This is a discussion that has been had for many years. It is well documented that when you move off a benefit into part-time work you face very high effective marginal tax rates and in some situations it is in fact financially—in the short term, at least—less beneficial to move into work than to stay on your benefit. This is an issue the government has talked about for a long time. It has done very little to address these issues.
I note that when Minister Dutton, who is the Minister for Workforce Participation, gave a rather discursive interview on the priorities in his area in December last year he said that he was ‘keen to boost training opportunities for mothers returning to work’—and I will come to that later, given what has been recently announced and what Minister Abetz said to the Senate in question time. Minister Dutton also said:
We’ve got disincentives for middle-income earners in terms of childcare costs and effective tax rates ... We want to make sure we have a system that provides choices for parents—to stay at home and a choice to make it financially rewarding to return to work.
In other words, let us address the issue of the child-care supply problem, let us address the issue of child-care affordability and let us also address the effective marginal tax rates, which act as a barrier for the move from welfare to work.
As the Reserve Bank outlined earlier this month, welfare and tax reform have to be high on the economic agenda. The Governor of the Reserve Bank indicated that they are having an effect on labour force participation and, in his words, ‘they are holding our levels of participation down’. We say that is absolutely obvious to anybody who looks at those tax rates. That has a particular impact on women. This issue of the EMTRs has been so well documented over the nine years of this government as to have become notorious.
Unfortunately, although reform has been floated and promised and discussed we have had very little action. We have had very little reform. In fact, even with all the welfare to work policy leaks that the government engaged in prior to their cabinet strategy meeting where they discussed the work and welfare issues, it was clear that the government is again going to squib on trying to reform our tax and welfare system so as to move these marginal tax rates which act as a barrier to moving into the work force. I could be wrong. Minister Dutton or Minister Andrews may in fact announce a proper welfare reform policy that actually deals with some of these disincentives. But from what we have seen in the paper in the leaks that have come from the government it does not appear that this is high on the agenda.
We can say what is high on the agenda: coercion—the stick without much carrot. That is demonstrated across a range of areas but most relevantly today it is demonstrated in the area of sole parents. I said earlier that Minister Dutton said that training opportunities were one thing that he wanted to ensure were provided. That was a priority for him. What is the government’s plan so far for sole parents, the majority of whom are women? What is the government doing to actually support and encourage sole parents back into the work force? What are they doing to invest in the capacity of these sole parents—most of whom are women, although some are men—to engage in the work force? What we have so far is a program along the lines of Work for the Dole that has no mandated training component and which would require participation. People would participate in it but would not necessarily get trained.
If you recall, when Senator Abetz was asked about this issue today in question time he barely knew what was being discussed. He represents the Minister for Workforce Participation and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. This is a pilot that is being run out of that portfolio. I do not recall the minister in his answer mentioning any training that was going to be provided to sole parents who were prepared to participate in that pilot. Yet again, we see the government not being prepared to invest in sole parents. As I said, many of these people are women. If we are going to be serious about giving lone parents, the majority of whom are women, the skills and the capacity to move off welfare into work so that their futures and the futures of their families are better, we have to invest in supporting them. We have to invest in skills development, training and child care so as to ensure that women who want to engage in training or work and who are sole parents have access to affordable child care. Frankly, it is ludicrous to think that the position of many of these women will be improved simply by making it more difficult for them to continue to access the sole parent benefit without also investing in what they require in order to move from welfare to work.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-08,"—I apologise for not being here for the call earlier. I was outside at the women’s afternoon tea. The government have argued here in the chamber today that they have done great things for women since 1996, citing increased employment and a slight increase in average weekly earnings. Yet we all know that there remains a significant wage gap between men and women in Australia.
We still have one of the lowest female workplace participation rates in the OECD. Discrimination in the workplace based on pregnancy has increased. Australia is one of only two OECD countries without government funded paid maternity leave. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior positions, on boards and in politics and women as single parents and mature age women face very high levels of poverty. Australia has one of the lowest female work force participation rates in the OECD. A recent OECD report found that full-time participation for women aged between 25 and 54 in Australia was 20 per cent below the OECD average. That report also found that Australia has some of the least family friendly policies for working mothers in the developed world.
Improving women’s wages to close the gender pay gap is fundamental to women’s equality, since it increases women’s labour market attachment, financial independence and life choices. When we compare the full-time ordinary time earnings—which excludes overtime—on average women are paid 15 per cent less than men. Taking into account inflation, this gap has been reduced by a measly two per cent since 1996. The government has recently signalled changes to the industrial relations system, which we say could threaten the small closure of the gender pay gap and perhaps do worse. Both the Victorian and Western Australian state governments have undertaken a review of the gender pay gap. It is imperative that the federal government also initiates an inquiry into the gender pay gap which should consider closely their proposed workplace relations changes.
High effective tax rates also act as a disincentive to women entering the work force. Returning to work or taking on additional work results in some benefits being withdrawn and, together with the loss of health benefits and other concessions, the high effective marginal tax rate actually presents a disincentive to work, particularly when accompanied by high child-care costs. It impacts on single women but the highest proportion of income is lost by second earners in low-wage families—typically partnered women returning to work after having a child.
The impact of high effective marginal tax rates is that sole parents lose about 40 per cent of their earned income in taxes and benefits, and low-wage families lose almost 70 per cent—more than twice the amount of a high wage-earning family. The solution lies in not only welfare reform but also tax and labour market reform. On the one hand, the tax-free threshold, currently set at $6,000, is far too low. The Democrats argue there is a good case for raising it to $10,000 in order to boost low wage earners’ take-home pay. At the same time, the labour market needs to be overhauled to improve employment prospects for women.
Lack of child care is also a barrier to work force participation. In March 2004, more than 160,000 women were interested in working but had not looked for work because of a lack of access to affordable child care. The crises in child care are fourfold: shortage of places, funding, cost and wages. Child-care costs have increased 32 per cent over the past two years—more than six times the rate of inflation and around six times the rate of increase in government child-care benefits. The government’s lack of action in providing affordable and accessible child care is very obvious, with the demand for child care still running at unprecedented levels of unmet need.
Trying to find child care for babies aged two years and younger can be a nightmare for many parents who find themselves on long waiting lists. Of course, even if a spot does become available it may not suit the parents’ work hours, or it may require additional travel, meaning that children have to stay in child care longer to take into account additional travel time. In my home state, I recently met with a local group in the Port Phillip area who are campaigning for more child-care places. There, 1,600 children are waiting for places, and centres have closed down in inner Melbourne because of real estate values. There is much more profit in housing development than there is in child care. Affordable, quality child care is vital for women when making work and family choices. Instead of paying baby bonuses to wealthy stay-at-home mothers, we say that this government should invest in affordable and available out-of-school-hours care and vacation care for Australian children to enable women to participate equally.
In addition to the issues I have already mentioned, the government should also legislate for family friendly workplace practices, like enabling women to convert full-time jobs to part time once they return to the workplace after having children; introducing government-funded paid maternity leave at 14 weeks, paid at the minimum wage; and eliminating violence against women. All of these things impact on women’s workplace participation, financial independence and life choices.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2005-03-08,"—I remember what I was doing on the first International Women’s Day. I lived in Sydney, I had an outdoor toilet that had no light and lots of spiders, and my children were frightened by the spiders. So I fumigated the toilet, painted it and set up a new candleholder in it. That is how I spent my first International Women’s Day, but I do remember thinking at the time: this is my choice and isn’t it great that I have the choice? So, on this very significant day for women throughout the world, the question has to be asked: why are the Labor opposition refusing to look at the facts that are important to Australian women, whatever they are doing today or any other day? Our government have a policy of opportunity and, importantly, of choice for Australian women, and we remain strongly committed to policies that assist women in the myriad of roles that they fulfil throughout their lives.
Contrary to Senator Lundy’s suggestion of a decline in women’s wages compared with those of men, there has in fact been a real increase. Why does Senator Lundy continue to perpetrate untruths? Since our election in 1996, female total average weekly earnings have risen from around $450 to around $610, as at December 2004. Over this period, average weekly earnings for women have grown by more than 35 per cent. This compares to around 34 per cent for males. Senator Lundy, why don’t you want to celebrate these achievements on International Women’s Day today?
There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of women who choose to work part time—a choice that I was making on International Women’s Day 30 years ago. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of women who choose to work part time. They go to work when their children go to school, and they are home when the children come home. What a choice they make—and what a choice they are able to make. In fact, around 45 per cent of female employment is part time, compared with only 15 per cent of male employment. For many of those women, it is a choice that they are making. They do not want to work full time.
In addition, women’s earnings have increased as a proportion of men’s earnings, rising from about 83 per cent in February 1996 to almost 85 per cent today. This gap continues to close under this government. The claim that Senator Lundy has made, that women’s earnings grew annually by 5.9 per cent under Labor and 4.6 per cent under the coalition, is not a claim about the rate of earnings. On the contrary, it is a claim about the rate of inflation in Australia. Once Labor’s record on inflation and escalating prices is taken into account, the figure of 5.9 per cent which is claimed by the opposition shrinks to an amazing 0.6 per cent. What a disgraceful record for women in the Labor Party.
The recent unemployment figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal even more good news for women on this very special day. In my home state of South Australia, the Labor Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Stephanie Key, trumpeted the fact that the trend in the unemployment rate for women in South Australia fell below five per cent to 4.9 per cent in January 2005, and this put the unemployment rate for women in South Australia below the national average of 5.2 per cent. Of course, this figure, which is very good news for South Australian women, is in no way due to anything but the strong economy that the Howard government has presided over since its election. It is something that Senator Lundy’s state colleagues are only too happy to claim the credit for in South Australia. Perhaps Stephanie Key should pick up the phone and celebrate South Australia’s great record in employment with Senator Lundy.
But wait, there is even more good news for women today. Women’s participation in the work force has also risen with the Howard government’s election in 1996, when 49.6 per cent of Australian women were employed. With the strong growth in the Australian economy, this has risen to a clear majority of Australian women at work, with the figure currently standing at 53.6 per cent. That represents thousands of women re-entering the work force. Importantly, there has been significant growth in the employment of older women. According to the latest figures, the proportion of women in the 55- to 59-year-old age bracket in paid work has risen from 39 per cent to over 52 per cent in just over eight years during the term of the John Howard led government. Even stronger growth has been achieved by women aged 60 to 64 years, where the employment to population ratio for those women has grown from around 18 per cent to over 30 per cent. These figures are particularly pleasing because they show that older women are beginning to achieve financial independence, something that we are all pleased to see.
This government has significantly increased family benefits. Why is this important? Let me tell you. The $19.2 billion More Help for Families package follows upon substantial increases in assistance as part of the new tax system. The reduced family tax benefit, the FTB, and the taper rates applying from 1 July 2004 now allow many families to keep more of their assistance when their incomes increase. Prior to changes under that new tax system, many families faced marginal tax rates of 34c in the dollar and the family tax withdrawal rate stood at 50c in the dollar. This government, our government, the John Howard led government, has significantly cut taxes and in particular significant relief has been provided to all Australians—men, women and families—through the three stages of personal income tax cuts. The 2004-05 budget tax cuts are a third element of tax reform under this government.
Senator Lundy’s criticisms of child care are even more incredible. They would be laughable if they were not tragic.
—Tell that to my constituents who cannot get their kids into child care.
—Just have a listen, Senator Lundy, to the tragedy of what your government left. This government spends more on child care than any former Labor government ever did. In fact, $8.8 billion is now spent on child care.

Senator Coonan interjecting—

—Yes, $8.8 billion, Senator Coonan—an extraordinary amount of money and the largest amount of money ever spent by any federal government on child care. In actual dollar terms, in its first six years this government spent more than double, Senator Lundy, on child care than the former Labor government spent in its entire last six years in office. Senator Lundy, you should hang your head in shame. What is Senator Lundy on about? Let us get it straight. The number of government funded child-care places has risen from 306,500 to 561,900, an increase of 83 per cent. That is an extraordinary figure on this important day. (Time expired)

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-08,"—International Women’s Day is a time to celebrate the achievements of women and there have been many achievements of women, but they have not been achievements of this government. This government has failed to provide a national paid parental leave scheme, leaving Australia as one of only two OECD countries not to have such a scheme. This government has failed to address critical issues in child care: proper planning, affordable care, and decent wages for child-care workers. Instead, it wants to squander public funds on a tax rebate that will give the most funds to those who need it least.
This government has also undermined the Office of the Status of Women and ceased the production of a women’s budget statement. The government has promoted an industrial relations system that under the guise of flexibility has expanded casual work as a substitute for secure work with basic entitlements, prospects for advancement and decent wages. And it is women who are getting these insecure jobs with reduced entitlements. This government believes that those sole parents who are raising young children—as if the struggle to raise young children by themselves is not enough—should have new obligations enforced upon them whilst raising children alone and whilst they are caring for their young children.
Women do the bulk of the unpaid caring work in our society, whether it be looking after ill parents, children or those who are mentally ill or have a mental or physical disability, but we fail as a society to give the kind of support that we should and to recognise the contributions that these women make. The government has underfunded and cut services to public health, education and training, all vital services to women and their families. More and more people on low and middle incomes are being required to pay large payments for services that once were publicly funded. This puts pressure on women trying to manage weekly budgets and restricts their further choices.
We now also have an attack from conservative politicians on one of the most fundamental rights of every woman—that is, the right to control her own fertility. This right is critical to a woman’s health and her ability to control her life. The Prime Minister has failed to discourage this divisive public debate, which can serve no useful purpose other than to encourage those who would deny a woman the right to control her fertility, including the right to terminate a pregnancy. It is an absolutely absurd argument to try to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy she cannot or does not want to continue.
If only there was more to celebrate in this government’s actions. Instead, we are left to celebrate the work of many other millions of women across this country who continue to advocate for these changes, who continue to advocate for the rights of women and who continue to advocate for the government to take seriously their concerns and the issues that impact on their capacity to engage in public life, to engage in the work force and civil society. These issues should and can be addressed. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-03-08,"—International Women’s Day does provide us with an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women in this country. There are certainly many individuals who have achieved great things in this country, particularly women, no doubt and no less—for example, the women from Alice Springs who in the last fortnight won national awards for the outstanding work and contribution they have made to their community. But I think it is also a time for us to reflect on and look at the scorecard for the status of women in this country.
Just a couple of days ago, Minister Patterson tabled in New York a statement on the Beijing Commission on the Status of Women for the 49th session, or, as it is now commonly being called, Beijing Plus 10. It is a three-page document. What I want to do is make some comments about what is not in the document. There are a lot of statements in there that may look and sound fine in print, but if you look at what is not said and peel away some of the rhetoric then we really get to the truth. In the statement that was tabled in New York, this government says:
In Australia, we have made significant inroads across the Beijing Platform for Action’s 12 critical areas. … women have the same or better outcomes … in … education and health, and continue to make steady progress …
That is not the case. With regard to education, since 1996 the Howard government have slashed $5 billion from universities, and HECS fees have nearly doubled. Women now attending university will be paying an increase in their HECS debt, and of course, from this year, most of those women will incur a 25 per cent increase in their HECS payments. In last year’s budget there was no increase in funding above indexation for the 2.5 million children in government schools. There were no extra university places and there were no new TAFE places. So there are not enough TAFE or university places for women. In fact, over 20,000 women wanting to undertake further study are turned away each year.
With regard to health, this government has destroyed Medicare and bulk-billing. We know that women use Medicare services 50 per cent more than men, particularly during the years in which they opt to have children. Every year, 600,000 families, a third of them receiving payments from this government, also receive an average debt of $900. If everything was in fact bright and rosy in the garden in terms of women achieving the same or better outcomes in health, why is it then that, since 1996, the life expectancy of Indigenous women in this country has decreased significantly and is now 62.8 years?
This government also says that women’s participation in full-time and part-time employment has increased. Since 1996, the gap between men’s and women’s total average wage has grown by $91 a week. Australia lags behind all other OECD countries by not supporting maternity or paternity leave. The number of women in casual work has increased to 1.2 million, with no access to paid leave to look after their families while they are doing that work. Women’s earnings have significant implications for their immediate and long-term financial security which have not been addressed by this government. We know that 27 per cent of women aged between 25 and 54—the key child-bearing and child-rearing years, as I said—are in casual jobs and that women’s growing participation in the work force has contributed to massive increases in the tax revenue collected by this government. However, only around 12 per cent of women earn more than $52,000, leaving the tax cuts that were promised in last year’s budget out of reach for 90 per cent of working women. That was not said in the Beijing statement.
The statement by this government also says:
Australia attaches a high priority to combating domestic violence and sexual assault …
and:
Targeting family violence and child protection in Indigenous communities is a key priority.
What a joke! What an absolute joke! This statement does not talk about the $10 million last year that was taken out of money to prevent domestic violence—to pay for the security fridge magnets. This statement does not talk about the botched Partnerships Against Domestic Violence campaign or the No Respect, No Relationship program that was cancelled, rebadged, redesigned and then finally run in a less significant way.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-03-08,"—The Labor Party really know no shame. To come in here today and play fast and loose with the truth yet again, on International Women’s Day, is nothing but shameful. But it does not seem to matter to them; as long as I have been here, it has not mattered to them. I want to come back to the actual subjects that were raised by Senator Lundy in this MPI.
First of all, they claim that the federal government needs to ‘redress the decline in women’s wages compared with men’s over the life of the Howard government’. Just look at the facts, Senator Lundy; it would be a great start, I would put to you. Wages have increased by 21 per cent, at an annual growth rate of 2.2 per cent. Under the Labor Party it was 0.6 per cent. So why on earth would the Labor Party want to come in here and claim that there has been a decline in women’s wages compared with men’s? Women’s earnings as a proportion of men’s earnings have gone up from 83.2 per cent to 84.8 per cent. So, it does not matter which way you look at it: women’s earnings have actually gone up. But the Labor Party will come in here or go outside and say the reverse. It is simply untrue.
Part (2) of Senator Lundy’s MPI is:
(2) develop a solution to punishing effective marginal tax rates which act as a barrier to increasing the participation of women and sole parents in particular in paid work …
What a joke for the Labor Party to come in here and have the gall to talk about tax! They are the people who have taxed the living daylights out of every earner. Here we go once again: the facts do not substantiate the claim—

Senator Lundy interjecting—


Senator Crossin interjecting—

—and they scream like a bunch of banshees over there because they do not like the fact that prior to the new tax changes many families were facing a marginal tax rate of 34c in the dollar and a family payment withdrawal rate of 50c in the dollar. The government has significantly cut taxes. In particular, the government has provided significant tax relief to all Australians in three stages of personal income tax cuts. It is not one, not two but three stages, and the Labor Party come in here and ignore that today. How can they possibly be so blind? Is it any wonder no-one voted for them? But the fact of the matter is that the effective marginal tax rates have gone down, not up.
The third issue that Senator Lundy raised was that the federal government should increase access to affordable child care, and ensure that the supply and cost of child care makes child care available et cetera. Once again, they completely and utterly ignore the facts. The number of Australian government funded child-care places and services has increased, not declined. Child-care places have increased from 306,500 to 561,000, up 83 per cent—a mere 83 per cent—but, as Senator Ferris said a moment ago, the most important statistic that they carefully ignore is that in the six years to 2003-04 around $8.8 billion was spent on child care and that equates to more than double Labor’s spending in their last six years of office. But they come in here and completely ignore the truth. It happens day in and day out.
Let us have a look at women in the work force, for example. Since 1996 full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms. That is after taking account of inflation. They have increased by $153 a week. The Labor Party would have one think otherwise, but that is a 21 per cent real increase, as I said before, and that represents an annual increase of 2.2 per cent. Looking at women in jobs, since 1996—

Senator Crossin interjecting—


Senator Lundy interjecting—

—It is worth noting that they have not stopped screeching like a bunch of banshees since I started, because they simply cannot tell fact from fiction. They want to come in here and completely misrepresent the facts. Since 1996 women have benefited from the creation of 819,200 new jobs—53 per cent of the total of more than 1.5 million new jobs that have been created by this government. One would think that on International Women’s Day they could actually come in here and say, ‘Isn’t that fantastic to think that—
—But they’re casuals.
—Here we go. We have Senator Crossin over there once again whingeing, ‘But they’re casuals.’ The Labor Party just does not get it. There are a lot of women out there who have children and family responsibilities who actually want casual work, and the Labor Party cannot understand that. It cannot comprehend it. This additional employment for women is composed of 339,000 full-time jobs—do you want to go out there and repeat that, Senator Crossin?—and 479,300 part-time jobs because that in many cases is exactly what women want. It would be a really pleasant change for the Labor Party to come in here and actually tell the truth about what is happening with women in the work force, what is happening with child care and what is happening with tax rates instead of coming in here with this little litany of fibs.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-03-08,"—The proposed agenda that we have before us in this legislation has not suddenly appeared; there has been significant consultation over a long period with all the relevant stakeholders. The government has instituted a range of advisory groups that are linked to this legislation: clinical advisory groups, a prostheses and devices committee, a policy advisory group, and also people who are involved directly in the negotiations. These groups will play an intricate role in the development of good policy in the area. However, once again I am concerned about the fact that these things are still in train and we are yet to see the whole process actually working as we are looking at making changes to legislation.
One of the key things to come out in this debate—as well as in so many others in this field—is the need for accurate, relevant data. The hope is that, with the development of these various advisory bodies, there will be available data on which people can make budget decisions, on which they can make planning decisions and on which the community can be informed on this ever growing area; because people do agree that the use of prostheses is growing, the technology is developing, and there is a greater expectation that people will have good health and effective surgical procedures. The Department of Health and Ageing made a statement in their submission and when they were witnesses, and we quoted it in the committee report, but I think it deserves restatement. It focuses on the need for this data. It reads:
One of the things that will happen with this process is that we will have data that we have not had before. For a start we will have the data that the CAGs, the clinical advisory groups, have put together and their assessments of the actual products. Similarly, the benefit negotiators will actually be reaching benefit negotiating positions that will go as recommendations to the Prostheses and Devices Committee and then on to the minister. So we will be able to see the benefits being settled, and that will be publicly available. That data will become part of the publicly listed determination.
That particular process gives us confidence, because the idea that these processes will now be public and will be able to be debated is one of the really hopeful elements of the legislation.
One of the other issues that I wish to put on record—and I am sure my colleagues will be making more statements on this—is the core issue of informed financial consent. The government has acknowledged that this is a central part of the whole process, because with any procedure where people have to make decisions about payment, it is essential that everyone knows what is going on, what costs they will be liable for and who pays for what. It is of greatest concern, when you are talking about payment, that people do not know that they are liable for payment. Something has happened, they have no control, and suddenly they are landed with bills for which they were not prepared.
The government has acknowledged that this is a key issue, and another committee has been formed. I heard this afternoon that it is the Labor Party that is fond of forming committees. I think many people are fond of forming committees that actually work and cooperate. The informed financial consent committee has been established, and it includes all the stakeholders in this issue. The committee will work on how to best achieve a system—of course there will be times when things fall over; no system is perfect—so that we can have confidence that we are actually instituting a payment agenda where people are aware of their responsibilities.
During evidence to the committee, this issue was raised on numerous occasions—particularly by the AMA, who were strongly of the view that it should not be solely a doctor’s responsibility. I agree with that, and the AMA have gone a fair way down the track with advising their members about their responsibilities and the best way to talk with patients about financial responsibility. They have developed templates which they very proudly showed us on their web site; but, in terms of the bottom line, everybody involved in making decisions about health—particularly decisions about which bills will need to be paid—must know what is happening, where it is happening, who is paying and when it must be paid. I am quite hopeful that the informed financial consent committee will be able to come up with guidelines that people can accept and implement.
Any change of this nature must be subject to an effective review mechanism, and that has been discussed. The people on this side of the chamber were hoping for an early review so that the ongoing process could be established; nonetheless there has been acceptance by the government that there need to be significant review processes. Again, when you are implementing change, the best way to ensure that you are going to get it right and pick up things that may go wrong early—so that they do not become entrenched, so that hours of debate in this place are not wasted on something that could have been picked up early and agreement reached—is to implement an effective review process. We are calling for open review in the legislation that can be regularly seen so that change can be made quickly.
We know that this particular legislation is diving into the area of trust because the details have not been clearly defined as yet. However, we do know that all the key stakeholders who gave submissions—who came to our committee and talked about their desire to try to get this right—want to see this legislation implemented. They have already stated, as I said before, that what we had is not good enough and will not benefit the consumers of our country who need medical support. We believe that, provided the advisory groups are effectively implemented, provided the review process is put in place and provided there is genuine cooperation, we can move forward in this process.
As most people agree, there needs to be formal trust between doctor and patient. That must be the core area for decisions about what medical practice is implemented, what device is used or implanted. A patient requiring support must have the trust that their doctor will give them the best possible service. That is the best possible result for all of us. But, given that we are looking at a procedure where there will be some form of gap payment in the system, once there is informed financial consent, once people know what they are doing, once the stakeholders take their responsibilities and once the various advisory groups that the minister has implemented perform their role, this particular legislation, as we have been told by the people who came before our committee, should be given a go.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2005-03-08,"—As Senator Moore commented at the commencement of her speech, a number of committee members in the inquiry had a very definite interest in this area. They had prostheses. I must confess that I am one of those people—I have two hips and a knee. I have no concerns whatsoever about the procedures I had. I have no complaints about the surgeon. But I am unsure about whether this legislation will be effective. If one looks closely at the evidence given to the recent Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, one would see I am not alone in this. However, we on this side are supporting the legislation because clearly something needs to be done. The present situation is untenable.
The difficulty has been to find a system that will work more economically and more efficiently than the current one whilst also providing Australians with the capacity to choose the prostheses they need. I found the committee process in this instance to be most interesting. The more evidence I read or heard, the more convinced I became that the bill as drafted would not make the situation any better. It is for this reason that I join with colleagues on this side of the chamber in seeking an amendment to provide for an appropriate review of the process. I think that is very important.
The government is to be commended for agreeing to our recommendation. I was pleased to note that in the third reading of the bill in the other place it provided accordingly. The present requirements require health funds to cover the full cost of all surgically implanted prostheses and other medical devices on the government schedule. The funds are not permitted to apply a co-payment or gap for such prostheses items. This is, of course, good for the consumer. They pay no gap and generally they are able to access the prostheses of their choice. But costs to the health system in respect of prostheses are spiralling. We are told that benefit payments for prostheses are now 12 per cent of total hospital benefits. In 1990, they were less than two per cent. It is said that payments for prostheses by health funds under the current arrangements are now contributing in a significant way to increases in premiums.
I am a strong believer that patient choice must be maintained. It will be unacceptable if the changes initiated by this legislation lead to a removal of the capacity for each patient to choose the most suitable prostheses for their particular procedure. This will entirely depend on the surgeon they have and the recommendation he makes to them. But it is also clear that some reform must occur. Without attention it seems that the cost of provision of prostheses will continue to rise at unacceptable rates. We did not take oral evidence from consumer groups during the committee hearings but the points they made in their written submissions on the legislation reinforced my own concerns. One of the most potent points made by the Consumers’ Health Forum of Australia related to the very reason why many Australians maintain private health insurance. The simple fact is that they do so in order to ensure that they have choice—choice about where they are hospitalised and when they can access elective surgery and so forth. In particular I refer to a paragraph from the CHF submission:
Most health consumers do not have a good understanding of whether their private health insurance is adequate for their needs until it is put to the test, often by a hospitalisation or surgery, where too often they find out that large gaps are payable for the treatment recommended by their health care providers.
This is very much the case with prostheses. Not many of us think about providing for their cost until we reach the stage where our doctor tells us we need one. I have no doubt that there would be few young Australians who would, when taking out private insurance, consider whether they should adequately provide for prosthetic implantations at some stage of their lives.
Until now, of course, it has not mattered because private health funds have been obliged to fully fund the provision of the prosthesis of choice. But, after the passage of this bill, the issue will be a very real one. Yes, there will be at least one no gap prosthesis available for each procedure but, unlike now, it may not necessarily be the most appropriate one for a particular consumer. Here again, the consumer must be guided by their orthopaedic surgeon. Hopefully, that orthopaedic surgeon will recommend the most suitable prosthesis for the procedure they are about to have. As the Consumers Health Forum of Australia said:
The average health consumer would not be taking into consideration the contribution of the cost of prostheses to hospitalisations when making decisions about their private health insurance cover.
I share the fears expressed by the CHF. Consequently, we must ensure that these reforms do not result in the privately insured realising that they do not have cover for a required prosthesis only when the surgery is around the corner. Equally, we must not allow a situation to develop where the most clinically appropriate prosthesis is available to them only if they can afford a substantial gap payment—and that was the point that I was making earlier. That is absolutely vital.
The real risk here is that we are creating the possibility of an environment which is inconsistent with the concept we have come to know as ‘lifetime cover’. As soon as we create the option for an individual to leave out, for example, cover for prostheses, such an option will be taken up, especially by the young and healthy. So we must explain to the young and healthy, particularly young sportspeople probably, that having coverage for prostheses is vital. They will have much difficulty in relating to the concept that they might one day need such cover. The young who are lured into private health insurance through the advantages of lifetime cover can conceive that they might need to be hospitalised, might need physiotherapy and will need dental care, but an option of coverage for prostheses is quite a different thought process. This is most definitely a situation where those who opt for private health insurance should be able to adjust their coverage options without any significant penalty.
As I considered this bill, the more I read and the more I heard, the more I became concerned about the consequences. Only too often during the committee inquiry it was very much the case that those we heard from simply did not know. This is why an appropriate and effective review mechanism is such a critical part of this legislation. Without it, there are simply too many unknowns and we would not be providing appropriate protection for our constituents.
The stated objectives of the new arrangements are threefold: (1) to reduce pressure on premiums by limiting growth in payments made for prostheses; (2) to reduce the administrative burden on the industry; and (3) to provide contributors with more choice. There was little evidence supplied to us that any of these three aims would be achieved, except perhaps the reduction of the administrative burden, although I suspect an even larger burden may well be transferred elsewhere.
I refer to the evidence given to the committee inquiry by the Australian Private Hospitals Association in which they said:
… it is not completely clear how, or whether, the new arrangements will work to limit the rate of increase in health fund benefits in the near and medium term.
They also said they did not know ‘the degree to which utilisation, technology or price have led to the increasing benefit costs to health insurers’. Catholic Health Australia was of the view that there were other factors which might limit the impact which any downward pressure on the cost of prostheses arising from this legislation might have. The Medical Industry Association of Australia is far from convinced. In his evidence to the committee, their Director, Healthcare Access, Mr David Ross, said:
We believe that the outcomes of the reforms are uncertain. Like the Australian Consumers Association, we are sceptical of the capacity of these changes to bring about a long-term slowdown in premium increases. While we agree that these reforms are likely to place pressure on prosthesis prices, we believe that the real driver of expenditure is utilisation, which is not addressed by these measures.
I am also concerned about this proposition advanced by the MIAA in their submission:
High technology prostheses that cannot be commercially sustained are unlikely to remain available in the Australian healthcare environment.
That is another concern of mine—that some of these new prostheses are so expensive that they may not be available. They are being developed all the time and becoming more sophisticated. The MIAA say that Australians may be denied access to higher technology devices in circumstances where the gap payment which may be imposed will be larger than the market can bear, which is the point I just made. They are of the belief that this could be an unintended consequence of these reforms and therefore one that should be monitored. The MIAA were also of the belief that the reforms have the potential to impact on patient choice, both because some will not be able to afford the gap for the prosthesis they want and because some products may disappear from the marketplace. That is the concern I have with the cost of these prostheses.
I was somewhat surprised by the number and breadth of the doubts and concerns held by the APHA about the legislation. The APHA expressed concerns about the success or otherwise of the benefits negotiation process, the number of devices that will be affected by the gap, the magnitude of the gaps, the role to be played by private hospitals where informed consent has not been obtained, and, finally, the unhealthy practice of exclusionary policies offered by the funds.
Whilst the association was of the view that the current situation was even worse, their level of doubt about the proposed arrangements is a further cause for concern. The issue of exclusionary practices is not only a concern for the APHA. The Australian Consumers Association has a similar view and, I must say, so do I. The APHA is, in my view, correct in asserting:
… consumers do not have any objective means of assessing their risk of developing a particular condition and/or sustaining an injury and therefore cannot make an informed choice whether to sign up to a policy that excludes hospital treatment for a particular condition.
Again, that is a point I have made because it is vital that people have that information. Whilst this has been an issue in other areas prior to now, it has not been so in the case of prostheses, since all insurers have been required to provide no gap coverage for them. Under these new arrangements they will not be required to do so, if a member has elected not to be covered for the hospital procedure.
In summary: the submissions made and evidence given to the committee revealed some degree of hope but a much greater level of uncertainty about whether these reforms will be effective. The question must be asked whether in the long term there will be benefits to the system whilst keeping premiums under control and retaining patient choice of prostheses, and to me that is absolutely vital. The review mechanism and process is thus essential for a whole variety of reasons. It must ensure that the legislation does not create a roadblock for technological innovation of prostheses. Another of my fears is that that may well happen. It must ensure that Australians can access the most clinically appropriate prosthesis they need at the time. It should ensure that outdated technologies do not clog up the no gap list, especially at the expense of newer and more effective ones. An appropriate process must be put in place for removals from the list. As the CHF pointed out in their submission:
Without such a review, these obsolete prostheses may become the lowest cost sub-group of prostheses for a particular MBS item number and create a perverse cost incentive to use older technology, rather than relatively safer devices which require a gap payment.
That was the point I was making earlier: we must ensure that this does not happen. The review process must be rigorous in ensuring that the new arrangements are not abused to the detriment of the Australian consumer. It must ensure that adequate choice remains and that the impact on premiums is a positive one or, at the very least, one of containment. At all times, we must ensure that the most widely used prostheses, together with those which incorporate advances on such technologies, are included as no gap items on the schedule.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2005-03-08,"—I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2004 and I would like to go back to the stated objectives of this piece of legislation. In the explanatory memorandum there are three dot points:
reduce the pressure on the level of private health insurance premiums by limiting the growth in benefits for prostheses;
reduce the administrative burden on the industry; and
provide contributors with more choice in the provision of prostheses.
I will make some more comments on that last point as we get into committee because it is on the choice issue that I want to talk about podiatry and podiatric surgeons. First I will look generally at the aims of this piece of legislation. Some of the earlier speakers have also raised issues of proof of whether or not this is really going to happen or if we are going to have to wait and see what the process is. This is why I am pleased to see that the Labor Party’s amendment is already enshrined in the bill. It has come across from the House of Representatives. It will keep us looking at and reviewing this process and seeing whether or not we have results.
While private health insurance premiums may generally go down—we are not going to have a full range of options, a full suite of possibilities, for various prostheses; we are only going to have the basic model—across the board there might at least be some holding of increases. I cannot see private health insurance premiums coming down, but there might be some levelling. We have seen some significant increases and apparently some of that is due to this area. But for the individual whose medical specialist perhaps recommends an alternative or who wants the latest technology, the best available model of whatever the particular item is, they are going to have to pay and probably pay quite substantially. So the first aim—to reduce the pressure on the level of private health insurance premiums—is going to be achieved across the board at least in the very short term, but that is not going to do anything for those who are going to need an up-to-date or simply a different model or option if they ever need this kind of support.
On the issue of choice I think the ultimate way to ensure that we have choice is to make sure that all of those who are qualified in this area to perform procedures are actually able to do that. On this issue my primary concern is that we enhance choice if we include podiatric surgeons in the provision of prostheses and professional services. Surely we have to recognise the role of all health professionals. We went through this debate with the Medicare legislation a year or so ago when four of us on this side of the chamber were able to negotiate into Medicare, for those able to access enhanced primary care programs, the opportunity to access allied health professionals. This is often not just the very best outcome for the patient but it is also cost-effective and it helps us in Australia to cope with a growing problem—the shortage of specialists and the shortage of doctors generally, particularly those who specialised as GPs. Why don’t we include all of those people who are able to do the particular procedure or process or give whatever advice it is that we are looking for?
If the legislation were to go ahead as it is originally written, because of the way that the public hospital system in particular operates, it would simply not be possible to have the option of seeing a podiatrist and going through the processes that might ultimately be necessary by way of an operation and potentially the use of a prosthesis. Apparently in the public hospital system there is a set of guidelines or rules that generally discriminate and limit access. Through these amendments—and I will speak to them on an individual, one-by-one basis when we get to them—we want to reinforce both choice and the issue of cost. If we keep focusing on a few very scarce surgical resources and expect people to simply do more and more, cost will often become an issue, as will delays and waiting. If we are able to make sure that all of those who are able to perform these operations do so, then it will be better for all concerned.
Podiatric surgeons provide specific professional services and perform minor, mostly straightforward, surgical procedures on feet and toes. As I have stated, this really is a fairly simple set of amendments to make sure we enshrine, for private health insurance funds, the ability to provide benefits for in-hospital foot surgery performed by podiatric surgeons. The issue was raised with the Community Affairs Legislation Committee and, as we saw from the evidence there, it is simply not enough to just encourage, because it will not happen. If we just ask the private health funds to do it out of the goodness of their hearts, I do not think we will ever get there. I quote from page 5, paragraph 1.21 of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee’s report:
The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman commented that ‘many consumers might see the introduction of a patient gap for prostheses that would otherwise have been available with no gap, as a reduction in patient choice’.
In paragraph 1.36 it goes on to say:
Private insurance companies have indicated that they will not pay for these [prostheses] unless podiatric surgeons are specifically allowed for in the legislation … The ACPS applauds the intent of the Government in this matter but is nonetheless concerned that without specific legislative amendment to the Act the insurance industry will not comply with the intent of the Government.
The amendments simply cement in place what the government has indicated. As the ombudsman said in relation to patient choice, we cement in this choice if we make sure that this is catered for. Indeed, one of the recommendations of the Senate committee is:
... that the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman monitor the implementation of the new podiatric surgical cover provisions and report on progress in the Ombudsman’s annual State of the Health Funds report.
The committee also recommends in 1.45:
... that future reviews of private health insurance cover should consider whether benefits should be paid for the professional services of podiatric surgeons ...
I argue that we cannot leave it to the future intent but that, as we have such people already qualified, we should immediately give this opportunity. In relation to podiatric surgeons and prostheses, the committee report states on page 7:
Podiatric surgeons provide a specific professional service. They perform minor and mostly relatively straightforward surgical procedures on the feet and toes. Podiatric surgeons generally are qualified podiatrists, but they are licensed to provide their specialist and highly-skilled services on the basis of extensive relevant further experience and postgraduate training.
For those who are concerned that perhaps those that we are recommending be involved in this legislation are not qualified, that was one of the issues looked at by the committee and they found that most certainly these people are qualified in this area. The committee also notes:
As podiatric surgeons are not qualified medical practitioners, services provided by them are not eligible for Medicare benefits. In 2004, however, the Government amended the National Health Act to allow podiatric surgeons to receive private health insurance benefits notwithstanding their lack of Medicare eligibility.
The committee report goes on to quote the Minister for Health and Ageing’s second reading speech, in which he said:
There have been recent changes to health insurance legislation that enable members to access basic hospital accommodation and nursing care costs for services performed by accredited podiatrists. In those circumstances, I encourage health funds to cover the prostheses implanted by podiatric surgeons.
As we see from the committee evidence, the fact is that if it is only encouragement then it simply is not going to happen. In summary, I believe that we need to look at the two issues of choice and cost. Again, I suppose the proof will be in the results in years to come, but I believe that consumers will be facing lower, if not no, gap payments with podiatric surgeons and they will be given the additional opportunity and benefit of accessing other trained professionals.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PROSTHESES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-03-08,"—I want to thank all honourable senators for their contribution in the debate on the National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2004. I do have an interest in this bill since I think some of the initiatives were commenced when I was health minister, and I had a concern about the cost of private health insurance. One of the drivers of that was the use of very expensive prostheses without any consideration by those people who were using the prostheses. I will not go into the detail. The explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech clearly outline the goal and aim of this bill. I want to acknowledge the contribution of all stakeholders over a very long time who have contributed to the development of the new arrangements for the coverage of prostheses for consumers with private health insurance. I commend the bill to the Senate and hope that we will have some time to discuss Senator Allison’s amendment. I believe that tomorrow we will be discussing Senator Lees’s amendment when she has had time to consult with Minister Abbott. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The annual report of the Wet Tropics Management Authority concerns an incredibly important and unique area in my home state of Queensland that is best known for the Daintree rainforest but also covers areas further south of Cairns, right down to Townsville. This area is very significant in terms of its environmental value and is unique in a whole range of extraordinarily important ways. It is a particularly outstanding example of one of the major stages of earth’s evolutionary history. It also has significant cultural heritage values, although it is not listed for that reason as yet under the World Heritage Convention. Certainly I would support the proper listing in consultation with the many different groups of Indigenous people who still live in the World Heritage area.
Many times I have spoken in this chamber about the threat in particular to the Daintree rainforest and especially those areas that are not within the World Heritage area but are in the middle of it and surrounded by it—areas that were subdivided during the not particularly lamented Bjelke-Petersen era. Incredibly valuable ecological areas of rainforest were basically subdivided into suburban blocks. Many of those are still covered with rainforest but are still at risk of being cleared. I know the local shire council in particular and also the state government, and lately and belatedly the federal government, have been trying to ensure that those areas are protected.
This report talks about another environmentally significant region that was voluntarily acquired: 98 undeveloped lots of freehold land to the north of Russell Heads, located 45 kilometres south of Cairns. That is an area that was voluntarily acquired. It guaranteed the protection of freshwater swamp, and the complex sand dune system in the coastal lowlands of the World Heritage area has now been transferred into the Queensland national park. It is unfortunate that the ongoing battle over securing incredibly valuable areas in the Daintree has not been resolved. These are areas where literally the last remaining examples of species of plants in particular survive. Areas containing species that were thought to be extinct until being rediscovered recently are still at risk of being cleared just to put houses on them. It is ridiculous that that risk is still there. I am pleased that there has been some progress but, until it is absolutely locked in and guaranteed that those areas can no longer be cleared, I will certainly continue to raise concerns.
This report also mentions an application that is currently in place for a proposed construction by the Department of Main Roads in Queensland of a four-lane highway from Smithfield to Kuranda. This proposal has the potential to have a very significant impact on the World Heritage area, and it certainly causes me a lot of concern. I hope the authority does ensure that a proper look is given to that proposal. I mention also my concern about the ability of the authority in general to fulfil its tasks properly. It has an incredibly important role, not just in protecting the unique environmental assets of this area; let us not forget the incredibly important economic benefit it brings to Far North Queensland.
There are an immense number of threats that continue to apply to the wet tropics area, in part because of its popularity. It is a difficult balancing act, but we certainly do not want the authority underresourced, with uncertainty about funding or with uncertainty about how it is going to be able to operate in the future. That needs to be addressed. It is something I am watching closely. I also notice the seven-year review of the management plan is about to commence. That is also an issue that I believe is very important. It involves the local community—the local Indigenous people in particular—and also the wider Queensland and Australian community because it is an area, as its name implies, that is of world value and must be protected.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Wet Tropics Management Authority</title>,DOCUMENTS,23,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-08,"—I also wish to take note of the Wet Tropics Management Authority’s annual report. In doing so, I pay tribute to Lieutenant General John Grey, the chair of the authority, for his leadership in some difficult times. I also want to pay tribute to Russell Watkinson, the former CEO of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, for his stewardship of the authority over a number of years and the leadership that he showed in bringing the community together around the preservation of this environmental, economic and social asset that is important not only to the people of Far North Queensland but to all of us in Australia and, as Senator Bartlett has said, across the world, given its World Heritage status.
In my few comments tonight I want to focus on one particular area of the wet tropics that gets a lot of attention. In saying this, I want to be very clear that the wet tropics are not the Daintree. The wet tropics traverse an area from Paluma, just north of Townsville, almost to Cooktown. Whilst the national focus is always very much on the area north of the Daintree River, between the Daintree and the Bloomfield rivers, we must remember it is a much larger resource than the area that we focus on. The reason we focus on the area called the Daintree is what Senator Bartlett alluded to: the fact that, under the National Party government in the 1980s, under the stewardship of Russ Hinze, it was agreed to freehold a large tract of land, much of which had never been logged. This is incredibly significant lowland wetlands. It is an ecosystem not replicated anywhere in Australia, and very few places in the world have this type of ecosystem. But the Bjelke-Petersen government agreed to sell it off to Mr Quaid.
When Labor came into government subsequently, we started what we call the Daintree buyback process. I have to say that, irrespective of your politics, as soon as you get to this area you realise and you agree that that is the appropriate thing to do. Unfortunately, the policy adopted under the Hawke-Keating years has not been adopted by this government, although there is some sort of piecemeal or platitudinous acceptance that something has to happen. Everyone understands that you cannot have housing blocks of one hectare in a rainforest where a house and then the garage and then the dog and the cat will go. They do not live very well with the cassowary, I am afraid.
Unfortunately, during the election campaign of last year, the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party was very clearly defined. Labor committed to reinvesting $7 million, along with the state and with commitment from the Douglas Shire Council, to continue the program, to finish the job of buyback and to make sure that our contribution in a financial sense sat well with the planning instruments that the Douglas Shire Council had developed. Senator Meg Lees was involved in those discussions with the government at the same time.
I have to report to the Senate the disturbing events at a very large rally held in Port Douglas a couple of weeks before election day, when various parties put their position. Unfortunately, the local Liberal member could not be there. They sent somebody to videotape the event, which I thought was quite interesting. The Mayor of the Douglas Shire Council read out a letter that was sent to Senator Lees by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, which made a commitment that funds that were allocated to the buyback would not go through the Australian Rainforest Foundation. Unfortunately, at that same rally, a letter from Mr Entsch was read out that said that of course the money would go through the Australian Rainforest Foundation. I do not know what this government thinks about people in Far North Queensland, but to send two separate messages and to think we do not talk to each other is a bit silly. There was a lot of confusion and a lot of anger at that rally. It was a reflection on the duplicity of this government in its treatment of people in more far-flung areas. I commend the Queensland government for what they have done.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Order, Senator McLucas, your time has expired.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Wet Tropics Management Authority</title>,DOCUMENTS,23,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-08,"—I am actually about 10th on the list, Mr Acting Deputy President, but if no-one else is here I will jump up. I would not want others to miss out on their chance to speak.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—You’ve saved the day, Senator Bartlett.
—And I am sure Senator Conroy wants to hear me speak some more anyway.
—There is a serious misrepresentation taking place in this chamber. I think you should make him withdraw that defamatory remark, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—There is no point of order, Senator Conroy.
—I would like to speak on an issue that is probably of interest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Macdonald. It concerns the wool industry and particularly the debate and controversy at the moment about mulesing and the live export trade. Senators would be well aware, I expect, of my longstanding interest in animal welfare and animal rights issues. I have certainly spoken a lot about the live export trade for sheep, cattle and other livestock. But I have stayed out of publicly contributing to the mulesing debate for some time, even though I have a personal view, which would not surprise people, of being concerned with that practice. I felt that it was something I would leave up to public debate and the court of public opinion, if you like, in terms of the differing views expressed by animal welfare advocates versus some from the industry—and of course there are some in the industry who have moved away from mulesing already.
What has finally driven me to speak out in support of those people in a much more public sense, even though I have supported them privately, has been the very aggressive action taken by Australian Wool Innovation and, in recent times, the Australian government against People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is a US based animal rights organisation—particularly their decision to also undertake court action against Australian animal rights activists from Animal Liberation NSW. I should declare, although it is reasonably widely known, that I am a former office-bearer of Animal Liberation Queensland, which is a completely separate organisation. Nonetheless, I have an awareness of the people involved in Animal Liberation NSW, so I do not hide from that fact. I think it is totally unacceptable that people are being targeted deliberately by court action—by a body that gets a significant amount of government funds—just because they are expressing their views, views they have expressed for a long time, about the unacceptability of the practice of mulesing.
It is utterly counterproductive for parts of the wool industry—and I acknowledge that it is not all of the wool industry—to be spending money specifically targeting Australian activists who are simply expressing and have consistently expressed concern about this practice. The wool industry has publicly stated that it has agreed to phase out mulesing by the year 2010, which is in five years time. It is undertaking research into alternatives. The practice is sufficiently problematic that the industry itself has said it is going to stop it within five years, yet it is using the courts to try to silence people who are campaigning for it to stop now or are encouraging others to be aware of their concerns and not buy the product until it stops. I might add that that applies to the live export trade as well. I can understand why some wool growers are concerned about that—people’s livelihoods are involved. Naturally, some people react negatively to that.
Australian Wool Innovation were funded by government contributions of over $14 million in the last financial year, according to their annual report. They received over $42 million from the wool levy, which comes directly from wool growers themselves, as I understand it. That would be about 99 per cent of their income—a very small amount comes from royalties and sales of goods and services. So we have a body that receives over $14 million in government funding—I am not saying they are using that $14 million; I do not know where they are drawing money from or if they are getting donations for this purpose—using money specifically to conduct court action to try to silence people who are expressing concern. It is a very dangerous practice, and it is a misuse of the Trade Practices Act to try to sue people as has been done here. I have noted some statements by Mr McLachlan from Australian Wool Innovation which I have interpreted as him saying that he is doing this because he knows it will cost those organisations money and he wants them to chew up their money having to defend these things. I may have misinterpreted what I saw him reported to have said, but that is what it looked like to me—that much of his agenda was to try to silence and intimidate people and make them chew up their resources on legal action rather than on campaigning.
Last week, we had the extraordinary statement by Minister Truss suggesting that PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals—which is a very large organisation in the United States—gives aid and comfort to terrorists. I know that people get worked up about this debate, as they do with many other issues. People can say strong things occasionally. But for a government minister to specifically come out and accuse animal rights activists, particularly this organisation and by association Australians who are campaigning on this issue, of being tied to people who are giving aid and comfort to terrorists is totally unacceptable. A spokesperson for Minister Truss, according to one report that I have seen, has said: ‘The minister is comfortable with his position. We are not saying that there are deliberate links with terrorist related activities, but they are allegedly providing financial support, according to evidence before a US Senate committee, to one group, the Animal Liberation Front, that has been accused of so-called domestic terrorist threats.’
To use one allegation about one organisation before a Senate committee in the United States that has not been tested and then just throw in the blanket description of ‘aiding, abetting and comforting terrorists’ is taking the debate into the realm of the surreal. It really is getting utterly ridiculous when we get those sorts of over-the-top smear allegations—that they are in some way linked to terrorists—by a minister of the Australian government against an organisation like PETA and others that have been tied to them via the court action by the wool industry. It is the sort of smear by association that we have seen in other areas of this government but that I have not seen from Minister Truss in the past. He certainly makes strong statements sometimes about areas that he has views on, as we all do, but to make that sort of over-the-top smear is a new low for that particular minister. It is completely unacceptable.
I express my support for the people involved in animal liberation in New South Wales, some of whom I have known for quite a long period of time. They are people with very strong views and passions of their own. I do not necessarily agree with every view of theirs, but I certainly strongly support their right to express their views and put information on the public record about a practice which is controversial. It is sufficiently problematic that the wool industry itself has said that it will phase it out and some wool growers have already abandoned it and found alternatives. When it gets to the stage of government funded organisations misusing, in my view, the Trade Practices Act and of government ministers using unfounded smear by association with over-the-top labels like ‘terrorist’ against people that raise these concerns, it really is going too far. It is in those circumstances that I feel obliged to speak out in defence of people expressing these concerns.
There is no doubt a lot of suffering involved in mulesing, which for those that do not know involves cutting the skin away from the rear end of sheep to try to prevent flystrike. As has been rightly said, a sheep that is subject to blowfly strike is going to suffer a lot more than one that has been mulesed. The key is whether there are alternatives. I support the industry in funding research to find alternatives, I support those growers who have already shifted to other approaches and I support the overall decision to phase out mulesing. But I do not support using the courts, particularly if you are a taxpayer funded organisation, and I do not support Australians in particular but animal rights organisations in general being smeared in such a lazy and crude way by absurd allegations of links with terrorists when they are simply expressing concern about an action which quite clearly involves suffering for a large number of animals.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Wool Industry: Mulesing</title>,ADJOURNMENT,24,1
