"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Radiopharmaceutical Production Building No. 23 at Lucas Heights, NSW.
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation proposes the redevelopment of the radiopharmaceutical production building No. 23 at Lucas Heights in New South Wales. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is our national nuclear research and development organisation and is central to the nuclear expertise of Australia. It is a knowledge based organisation that specialises in the delivery of specific scientific products and services to government, industry, academia and other research organisations. The organisation is responsible for the operation of the national nuclear facilities of Australia. Two of these facilities—the high flux Australian reactor and the national medical cyclotron—produce radioisotopes for use in industry, medicine and research.
In 1997 the government agreed to replace the high flux Australian reactor, and the replacement research reactor is currently being constructed. It is expected to be commissioned in 2005-06 and will have a much greater production capacity for radioisotopes. The organisation commenced production of radioisotopes for use in nuclear medicine during the 1960s. Since then there has been a continuing growth in the use of nuclear medicine in Australia for diagnosis, therapy and the palliation of pain.
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is the main supplier of radioisotopes for nuclear medicine in Australia. It estimates that in 2002-03 around 500,000 Australians used its radioisotopes in the course of nuclear medicine procedures. The manufacture of radioisotopes is largely conducted in building 23, which is located adjacent to the high flux Australian reactor and close to the replacement research reactor. Building 23 has been subject to almost continuous modification and addition since construction began on it in 1959. It was planned as a research facility but has evolved into a full production facility. 
The present layout, facilities and services infrastructure reflect their incremental development. This has led to increasing occupational health and safety issues. Moreover, building 23 and its current production facilities are not capable of meeting projected needs. In short, building 23 and its current production facilities require upgrading to achieve best practice in meeting regulatory needs and future demands.
The proposed works comprise an extension to the north and east of the existing building 23 on three levels. The extension will comprise: modern quality controlled chemistry laboratories; service and instrumentation rooms; production clean room facilities; packaging and dispatch facilities; stores and component wash bays; amenities and support, including a new building entry, male and female locker rooms, bulk consumable and secure stores, maintenance areas, airlocks and building services plant rooms; associated roadwork extensions; and additional parking bays, landscaping, engineering and communication services.
The project is subject to the regulatory requirements of the Department of Health and Ageing in respect of radiological safety and the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. It is subject to the regulatory requirements of the Department of the Environment and Heritage in respect of environmental impact. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works is $17.9 million. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed. Subject to parliamentary and regulatory approvals, the construction will start towards the end of this year and be completed in 2005. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—The profession of arms is the oldest profession. Since the annals of history have recorded the exploits of great generals and military leaders, it has been clear that not every general and not every leader has had a system of military justice. However, even leaders such as Alexander the Great at Issus had a system whereby he did dispense certain justice in respect of his successful infantrymen against pillage. But that is not always the case. Saddam Hussein, who was the leader of the Iraqi defence forces, dispensed an aura of fear and repression in that country, basically because there was no system of justice. There was one particular incident that is of some relevance to the current debate. It is said that the chief of his defence force was sitting at a table considering military manoeuvres and he contradicted Saddam Hussein, who then pointed his finger at him, sent him out and had him shot.
That is not the case in this country. In chapter 3 of our Constitution we have a detailed system recognising the judicial power of the Commonwealth but, aside from that, in this country there is a system of military justice that has been accepted since the earliest days of Federation. Prior to Federation, there was one famous incident—namely that involving Breaker Morant in South Africa during the Boer War—which created controversy in this particular area. However, that has not been the case since, and we have established a very detailed, effective, fair and reasonable system of military justice. The legislation before the House improves it, modernises it and simplifies it in some respects, which I will deal with shortly. 
Let me make one further general comment. It is significant from another point of view that we do have an effective system of military justice. The debate earlier this year regarding the establishment of the International Criminal Court proceeded on the assumption that Australians and Australian serving men and women were excluded from the jurisdiction of that court by reason of the fact that we do have an effective system of military justice. The trigger for the jurisdiction of that court occurs only when such a system does not exist in relation to one of the offences that are listed in the Rome Treaty.
The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 creates various service offences and service tribunals. It vests service tribunals with jurisdiction to hear and try service offences and provides for the punishment of persons convicted of service offences. It also deals with such matters as the arrest, search, custody and investigation of service officers; establishes the office of Judge Advocate General; and deals with other procedural issues relating to the operation of the system of military justice.
It is important to reflect briefly on the categories of offences that are created by the Defence Force Discipline Act. Firstly, there are offences which are said to be peculiar to the defence forces, such as endangering morale, absence without leave and disobedience of command. Secondly, there are offences that are the same as or rather similar to civil offences but that apply only to service equipment, defence members or defence civilians. These include the destruction or unlawful possession of service property and dealing in narcotic goods. Another one of a similar nature which I, as a serving officer, a defending officer, in the Royal Australian Navy Reserve, had some familiarity with some years ago is hazarding a ship at sea. Finally, in this category of offences, the act imports offences directly from the general law. But certain very serious offences are not tried before service tribunals, so the act provides that offences like treason, murder, manslaughter and bigamy cannot be tried by a service tribunal without the consent of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.
The act, as I have mentioned, establishes a system of tribunals that deal with offenders and charges that have been brought before them. There is established what is called a convening authority, whose role it is to designate which of several tribunals will determine the guilt or innocence of the service personnel charged. Those tribunals can essentially be categorised into two types: discipline officers, who are ordinary serving officers who deal with more minor offences; and others, in particular a Defence Force magistrate and a court martial.
I recall being involved in a rather instructive court martial at the end of the RIMPAC exercises prior to the first Gulf War. The senior officers on a vessel, which was a gun ship in the Royal Australian Navy, were charged with hazarding the vessel following the conclusion of very successful exercises off Hawaii. As the ship proceeded back to her shore base around the main island, she turned too early and grounded on rocks. At that time, the vessel was under the charge of two junior officers, the senior officers having performed valiantly—indeed brilliantly, according to US reports—in the preceding exercises. Nonetheless, the senior officers were held accountable and a very detailed and extensive court martial occurred. They were taken from their ship and, sadly for them, they were unable to proceed to the gulf at that time as part of the major Australian contribution to the first Gulf War. 
The need for reform, which has led to the legislation now before the House, has two main sources. The first is certain decisions by the High Court of Australia in the late 1980s and early 1990s concerning the operation of the Defence Force military regime standing side by side with the civilian regime in chapter III of the Australian Constitution. The High Court, as we all know in this place, can be rather jealous of its jurisdiction, in particular in respect of the power and authority of those who administer the civilian judicature. Be that as it may, there were a number of decisions which led to the second source of this current legislation, namely the Abadee report. The inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Alan Abadee of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, a very distinguished judge with a long service record and a detailed knowledge of the operation of the system of military justice, led to a number of proposals for reform, some of which were put in place administratively, such as the removal from the convening authority of the power to appoint serving officers as members of a court martial and reposing that with the Judge Advocate General. But others could not be and were not put in place administratively. That has led to the need for legislation and, although it has been—it is fair to say—somewhat long in coming, it is now before the House. 
The effect of the legislation is to simplify and modernise the law in relation to Defence Force military justice. It effectively amends the Defence Force Discipline Act, the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act and certain aspects of the Evidence Act. Some of the amendments deal with the problems that arose out of High Court decisions. One of those in particular concerned the well-known decision in the Tracey case. In that case double jeopardy provisions, which meant that Tracey was possibly subject to both a military and a civilian offence, were struck down. That led to the need for a review of the operation of the statutes to which I have referred and hence to the legislation before the House. 
The legislation also establishes a Chief Judge Advocate, who will act as an assistant to the Judge Advocate General. It is not entirely clear from the terms of the legislation precisely what the Chief Judge Advocate will do, but there is no doubt that the Judge Advocate General has an extensive and comprehensive role in the discipline procedures that I have mentioned. A leader of the Judge Advocate, such as the Chief Judge Advocate, appears to have a particular usefulness in the current circumstances.
New tables of punishments are established. In relation to the cadets, the report from the year 2000—Cadets: the future—has been acted upon. That has led to the renaming of the cadet units. For example, the Naval cadets were formerly referred to as the Naval Reserve Cadets; they will now be named the Australian Navy Cadets. Likewise, we have the Australian Army Cadets instead of the Australian Army Corps Cadets, and we now have the Australian Air Force Cadets. There are home loan provisions to extend home loan assistance grants to those who have been unable to apply for such a grant, for varying reasons, within two years of retirement from the defence forces. There are also procedures that will amend—not substantially but technically—certain aspects of the evidentiary provisions in the operation of Defence Force military tribunals.
The opposition have really used this legislation not as an opportunity to attack the government's legislation before the House, which appears to be welcomed by the opposition—which is welcomed—but rather to attack the government for varying unrelated reasons. For example, the member for Cowan, who himself has a distinguished military record, took the opportunity to attack the government in relation to veterans' medals, which of course have nothing to do with the legislation before the House. We appreciate, of course, that the issue of veterans' medals is an important matter but, with the greatest respect, it has nothing to do with anything that is currently before the House. 
However, amongst other things it is important to address his suggestion that the government has failed to recognise that veterans' medals belong to veterans, not to the government of the day. I appreciate that he has a particular beef regarding the national servicemen's medal. I will be representing the Prime Minister at a public meeting in Sydney on Friday on that very matter, and I will be having something to say about it at that time. But let me assure those who are concerned about that issue that the government is listening and is proposing to ensure that the respect due to those who have served this country will be of the utmost degree.
The member for Denison used the debate as an opportunity—which again was utterly irrelevant to the question before the House—to attack the government over the decision in relation to the trials of Hicks and Habib. The member for Denison attacked the fact that these two gentlemen will be tried under a system of military justice in the United States established by presidential decree. He referred to the fact that members of the commission are to be appointed by the Secretary of Defense or his designate, that every member of the commission must be a military officer, that prosecutors are to be military officers, that the chief defense counsel is to be a military officer, that the detail defense counsel to assist Hicks's defence are to be military officers and that the accused must be represented at all times by the detail defense counsel.
With the greatest respect, that criticism does not present a true picture of what has happened in relation to the agreement that the government has reached with the United States government in respect of the prosecution of both Hicks and Habib. Of course, it must be said that, according to the advice of the government, neither man can be prosecuted under Australian law. But what the government has done is reach agreement with the United States government to ensure that the military justice procedures are fair and transparent whilst protecting relevant military interests.
For example, agreement has been reached that the United States authorities will not seek the death penalty in Mr Hicks's case. Likewise, agreement has been reached towards putting arrangements in place to transfer Mr Hicks, if convicted, to Australia to serve any penal sentence in this country in accordance with Australian and US law. Conversations between Mr Hicks and his lawyers, it has been agreed, will not be monitored by the US authorities and the prosecution in Mr Hicks's case does not intend to rely on evidence in the case in chief, which requires closed proceedings. Subject to any necessary security restrictions, Hicks's trial will be open, the media will be present and Australian officials may observe the proceedings. There will be a review panel and, in addition, Hicks will be entitled to retain civilian defence counsel. Although Habib, at this stage, has not been formally charged it has been indicated that, if and when that happens, the same procedures will apply to him. His lawyers have welcomed that information.
So, apart from introducing utterly irrelevant material to the debate, the member for Denison has failed to appreciate that what has in fact happened is that Habib and Hicks have the opportunity to be brought before a properly constituted tribunal; that measures to ensure a reasonably fair trial have been put in place, consistent with the limitations that occur in military conflict situations such as this; and that it is hoped that those trials will now proceed apace and that a proper and fair outcome will be achieved. 
There is only one other matter that I want to deal with in the context of this current debate. It raises a general issue regarding personnel because, at the end of the day, the whole purpose of military discipline is to ensure that a Defence Force contingent—an Army, Air Force or Navy contingent—operates effectively but also fairly. Australia currently has military operations in six centres around the world: in the Persian Gulf and Iraq, where there are some 800 personnel; in the Sinai and Palestine, where there are approximately 50 personnel; in East Timor, where there are approximately 1,000 military personnel; in the Solomons, where there are a little over 1,800 personnel; in Malaysia, where there are 120 personnel; and in the Arafura Sea and the Indian Ocean, where there are about 500 personnel.
One interesting aspect of the work that these important contingents do around the globe is that they operate in a military and civilian environment that is not only dedicated to maintaining the security and administrative regimen that this country wishes to put in place but which is also protecting the parts of the globe in which they find themselves. That is why it is of the utmost importance that there is in place a system—a military regime—such as that which has been proposed. I support the legislation.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I am very honoured to be speaking on this defence omnibus bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. This bill does a number of things, but, in particular, it makes a raft of minor changes to a dozen or so defence related acts, and I think the member for Wentworth completely missed this. It is amazing that when members of the government come into this place and are not happy with the debate, they start talking about relevance. We saw the relevance of the member for Wentworth. He was more interested in talking about his own background in the law industry. He started talking about the High Court, judges and the separation of powers, and he talked very little about what is actually contained in this bill. Not only that, but I think he has no idea of some of the changes contained in the bill to do with service medals and how that affects the service community—that is in direct relationship to this bill. What I would say to the member for Wentworth and members on the government side is that we will decide what is relevant in this debate and how we apply it. That is what we will do.
This is a very serious bill and it does a number of things. The Labor Party does support the changes in here. As I said, they are minor changes to a dozen or so defence related acts. They are important in terms of making the defence forces better in terms of dealing with veterans and a whole range of other issues. Particularly, I want to mention the increase in penalties for those people who would impersonate a returned veteran. I think this is something that is well supported right across the community, particularly in the veteran community. This bill also contains sections in relation to increasing penalties for those who would destroy or damage medals. I will talk about that in a minute.
In terms of those who would impersonate a returned veteran or soldier, I have to say that I find that quite disturbing. In my constituency we are not isolated from cases where this has happened. I know that, in Queensland, there have been a number of cases, and a couple of high profile ones. It appears to me, from talking to veterans that I know, that those who do impersonate do it in a number of forms. Most commonly, believe it or not, they impersonate Vietnam veterans. I am a good friend of the member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, and he would say to you that he finds it bizarre that someone would want to impersonate a Vietnam veteran, for all of the horrors that they witnessed and the way they were treated on their return to Australia. But it seems to be the case that there are some people out there who would pretend to be something that they are not. 
It is not only civilians who pretend to be something they are not. It also may be the case that a veteran might wear medals that they are not entitled to. That is also a bit disturbing and I find it an insult to other veterans. They have been awarded these decorations for their service to their country, for the services they provided and for their role in any particular theatre. That someone would either buy those medals or wear them inappropriately—and I think they do know what they are doing—I find disturbing, as I have said. Perhaps it would be more a case of that person being in need of some counselling or perhaps needing to visit a doctor in terms of what their problem may really be.
It is really unfair also for the families of those returned veterans, particularly in the case in Queensland that I mentioned earlier. It was discovered that one individual had impersonated a veteran, not for the decoration or the honour on Anzac Day and its ceremonies, but to actually defraud the government of some $60,000 worth of benefits that rightly belonged to a veteran. That person actually collected that money and I find that disgraceful. I am very pleased that the government has moved to increase the penalties for people who would do that. The increased penalties range from the current fines of $200 maximum to $3,300 and up, and up to six months' imprisonment. Of course, this would specifically exclude family members who wore medals on behalf of a family member.
This bill also increases the penalty for defacing or destroying defence medals or decorations, from a $200 penalty to a maximum penalty of $6,600 and the possibility of 12 months' imprisonment. I have to say that on this one I am uncertain, because, having spoken to veterans, the strong view is that the medals belong to them. As we heard yesterday from the member for Cowan, he earned his medals. They do not belong to the government; they belong to him. He should have the right—and I believe he does have the right—to do whatever he chooses with them, and any veteran has the right to do whatever they choose in terms of their own medals and decorations. They fought for their country. They were sent to war. It is not of their choosing what they do; they serve the government of the day and the minister of the day. When they receive these decorations later, if they choose as a matter of protest or for any other reason to destroy those medals or do something to those medals, my view is that that is their right.
In my opinion, it is a bit like the flag. I know a debate is going to be had in this place a little while into the future about penalties for people who might burn or destroy the flag. I love our flag, I love our country and I believe in our democracy, but one of the great strengths of our democracy is that people have the right sometimes to do things that are offensive. As long as they are not hurting anyone else in the process, if they choose to destroy their medals either as a protest or because they want to make a statement, I do not think we should prosecute them and maybe stick a veteran in jail who went and fought for democracy and for their country. We should not penalise them later down the track because they have made a decision that they might want to, as I said, destroy their medals or do whatever they choose with them. 
I think that same logic and that same ethic would apply to the flag. I would find it offensive that someone in this country, given the free and democratic institution that it is, could perhaps be jailed for deciding that they would burn the flag. It is just another form of protest. It is one of those great ironies, isn't it, that, in countries where there is no democracy, you cannot do that. They do not let you demonstrate. They do not let you exhibit your democratic rights. But, in democratic countries, we can do that. Sometimes we may do that against the symbol of that democracy. But isn't that the great and wonderful thing that we have in this country: people are entitled to do that and not be jailed for it or persecuted by the government. The government sometimes, I think, is a little overzealous in what it thinks it can direct people to do or not to do—or how to think. I think there are some important parts in the bill that should be acknowledged in terms of strengthening the act and strengthening penalties. But, as I have heard other speakers say on this, I am concerned about the strengthening of penalties in terms of defacing or destroying defence medals.
We are talking about medals and their particular relevance in this legislation. The whole program for the national service medal has been, I believe, an absolute disaster for the veteran community. The people who served under national service arrangements, whether they were drafted or volunteered, do deserve a medal. I do not have a view that they do not deserve them. I know they lobbied hard for over a decade to convince the government, and the government made a decision that the national service medal should be awarded. I have to say that I do have some reservations that we in this country may end up with too many medals. This is not just my view. I seek a fair bit of counsel from the very large veteran community, including Vietnam veterans, in my electorate to hear their views on this, and they are also concerned about this.
The last thing you want to do is to give a medal for everything, because that demeans and devalues the medals that our veterans have earned for bravery or for service to their country. I am not saying that the national service medal has any less value than any other medal; I would just be very cautious on how the government deals with the political and military side of medals, rather than just handing out a lot of medals because it looks good and you might get a few votes out of it. I am concerned about that and I know a lot of national service men and women have also been concerned about that.
What is more, I suppose, disturbing about the national service medals is the length of time it has taken for the government, after it made the announcement and got the political kudos for doing this, to actually deliver on its promise. For most applicants it has taken well over 12 months. They missed out on having those medals on Anzac Day. I understand that there is a backlog of some 40,000 medals yet to be issued. I find the sheer nature in which the government issued them completely inappropriate—I think that would be the correct way to put it.
I have made a very big issue of it in my electorate. If you do get a medal—any medal—then it is a significant event in your life and it should be celebrated in a public way. To have these medals mostly distributed directly to the veteran has left a lot of them with a bit of a sour taste, because they go to the mailbox and there it is. It does not seem to have the impact that they were expecting. In my community, where I have been made aware of veterans receiving the medal, I have organised public ceremonies. I have organised quite a few of those and they have been extremely successful. I also organise ceremonies for certificates of appreciation, which I think are relevant to the way that we treat our returned servicemen. 
There is the Australia Remembers program and Their Service Our Heritage, which is a program that was put together under Con Sciacca when he was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He is probably the most well-remembered and most loved minister for that portfolio. In fact, when I go around my electorate and talk to veterans, from time to time they ask me, `Is Con still the minister?' and I say, `Look, we're not actually in government at the moment.' The certificates of appreciation are extremely important. To me they hold a lot of weight for the people who receive them for the service that they gave to the country, and I do not post them out. I seek out applicants and try to get many people to apply so that they get what they are duly entitled to, and then I organise public ceremonies. I have organised 10 or more so far and they are usually attended by well over 100 people each time. It is a really great moment for them when they receive that bit of paper: the certificate that recognises their efforts. I did not realise at first just how significant that was. I do now realise, with the national service medal and these certificates, the significance not only of giving them that formal recognition but also the act of gathering them together and having them see their old mates. The coming together of that community is extremely important.
I certainly appreciate the government continuing to provide certificates of appreciation for the half-dozen or so theatres that Australia was involved in. What I would say to the government is: work as hard as you can to ensure that by Anzac Day next year all those who have applied and are entitled have received their medals. I do not think I need to go any further than to just say to the government and to the minister: make every effort to make sure that those medals are properly distributed to people in a timely manner so that they have them for Anzac Day. It is extremely important to them and extremely significant to them. The government would do well to make sure that it happens properly.
I also want to quickly mention our Vietnam veterans and their anger over their particular treatment in terms of the veterans of Long Tan. They are still being refused the right to wear their Vietnamese decorations, which they are justifiably entitled to wear. It is an entitlement that this government has refused to recognise. I find it disturbing that the government just refuses to act on this when there is definitely a public groundswell about this recognition. The government has the power. The former minister believed at the time that she did not have the power, but I can assure her that she did have the power at the time. The new minister, the member for Longman, definitely does have the power and should act to grant approval for the wearing of these medals so that they also can be worn on significant days such as Anzac Day and Vietnam Veterans Day. I understand, from talking to people in the veteran community, that they are going to do that anyway. So, whether this government wants to recognise them or not, they have recognised them themselves and the community will recognise them, regardless of what this government does.
That brings up the interesting point of whether, when we know they have already done it and we know they are going to do it—because they are telling you they are going to do it; they are giving you prior warning, Minister—they will be prosecuted under the act. That is what this bill means. There will be stiffer penalties and a possible jail term. I wonder if the government will then act on these Vietnam veterans. It would be interesting to see the minister and this government taking a Vietnam veteran to court and possibly, under the act, imprisoning them because they wear a decoration that they are entitled to wear but that the government will not recognise. I would be very interested to hear a response from the government on that particular issue. 
We have a lot of front-line troops. The previous speaker, the member for Wentworth, explained that a number of troops have been out in Afghanistan, Iraq, East Timor and in a whole range of areas for a number of peacekeeping missions. The government has a huge responsibility to our service men and women to look after them when we send them into these places to defend democracy and this whole world. But, when our veterans come back, the government has a huge responsibility to look after them, to make sure their entitlements are protected and to make sure they are protected in terms of military justice, financial justice if they are injured and counselling services if they come back with psychological problems. This government has a huge responsibility to do that.
I will not spend much time being too critical of the government on what it could do better but it certainly could do more. There has been a range of very public cases in terms of veterans' families not being properly or adequately looked after by this government. That disappoints me and I know it disappoints many in the veteran community.
The Labor Party is a supporter of our armed forces. I personally am a big supporter of our three defence forces. I want to put on the record today the issue of bullying in the forces. I know this has been a big problem for many years; it has been fairly well unspoken of and there were unwritten rules and laws. There is no longer any place for that in a modern Australian Defence Force. It is no longer tolerable or acceptable. Those past experiences—which I know of not only personally but also from colleagues—are no longer part of Defence Force life. The masculinity and the roughening or toughening up of men and women in the defence forces does not have to be through bullying.
Bullying used to be called the esprit de corps. It was about team building and teaching discipline. You can teach discipline, and you can have a very good and effective team, as we do now. Our defence forces are some of the best in the world. They are highly regarded by the US, by the British and by other forces around the world. They are not highly regarded because of the bullying or the practices that have gone on in the past. They are highly regarded for their skills, for their training, for their intellect, for their ability and for their capacity to deliver. That is what they are highly regarded for. That should be a focus of this government so that the reviews and the reports that have been written on this subject are acted on to ensure that we have a fair and equitable Defence Force which does not use kangaroo courts and in which military justice is fair, equitable and speedy.
I know of a particular case in East Timor where a soldier who was involved in an ambush returned fire and killed two people. He spent four years being investigated and is no longer an effective soldier. His career is over because he did his job. We need to be honest about what our defence forces and soldiers are trained to do. They have one purpose in life when they are sent into battle—that is, to kill the enemy. It sounds horrible when you say it, but that is what they are trained to do. It is very unfair that, when those circumstances take place, military justice takes four years to deal with the issue and ruins the career of a fine soldier. The soldiers do not choose to be in those places. They are put there by governments. They are there because we ask them to go there to protect us. We should be very conscious that, after they come back, these people need our support and assistance, not lengthy, delayed military justice systems. This bill goes some way to improving that, and I applaud that. That is why I support this bill and the changes in it.  
I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this bill. The changes in it are good. But, again, the government should look closely at a couple of sections in this bill which are unworkable and which may cause some problems in the end. If the government is serious about prosecuting veterans who impersonate others or wear medals they are not entitled to, I will be very interested to see what it does next Vietnam Veterans Day.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—I want to start by commenting on an issue raised by the member for Oxley—that is, public recognition of people who receive medals and, in particular, the national service medal. Some people who have given service like to keep that very private. The government, in issuing these medals, has given people a choice. If they want public recognition, as they deserve, it should be as a consequence of their choice. They have the opportunity to contact their federal member, as many people in my electorate have, to have a ceremony to celebrate publicly and openly. There are many people who served in Vietnam, and national servicemen in an earlier period who did not serve overseas, who would like to keep that service private. They do not want public recognition.
The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 makes a number of amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 with a flow-on of consequential amendments to related acts. Most of these amendments are either to clarify aspects of the act, to align it with the Criminal Code or simply to correct minor technical errors. The bill does, however, contain two major measures. The first of these is to implement recommendations made by the Abadee report regarding the judicial impartiality and independence of trial arrangements in the defence forces—that is, justice under the Defence Force Discipline Act, the DFDA. The second major measure increases the penalty applicable when a person falsely represents himself or herself as a returned service man or woman.
Let us look at the Abadee report for some background on the first of these measures. Brigadier the Hon. Mr Justice Abadee, a New South Wales Supreme Court judge and the Deputy Judge Advocate General, was commissioned by the Chief of the Defence Force to examine trial arrangements under the Defence Force Discipline Act, the DFDA. He was asked to determine whether these trial arrangements met current tests of judicial impartiality and independence. The report was presented to the Chief of the Defence Force in 1997, but the findings were not made public. However, although Brigadier Abadee's report was not made public, 48 recommendations that he made in the report were subsequently included in an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. That report, entitled Military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force, was tabled in June 1999. As indicated by the supporting speeches, both in this House and in the Senate, not only was there no dissenting report but also the joint standing committee report was fully supported by both government and opposition members on the inquiry. Of the 48 recommendations from the Abadee report examined by the inquiry, 39 were agreed to by the CDF.
One of Brigadier Abadee's major concerns was the perceived and actual unfairness inherent in the multiple roles played by the convening authority—that is, the chain of command—under the Defence Force Discipline Act. Under current arrangements in Defence Force disciplinary proceedings, the convening authority—an officer—has the power to determine whether there should be a trial, determine the nature of the tribunal, determine what charges will be laid, select the judge, select the jury and select the prosecutor. When the tribunal has brought in a verdict, this same authority—this same person who has made all these choices I have just mentioned—is then empowered to review the proceedings. 
Mr Deputy Speaker, just think about that list of powers and try to equate them to those of a normal court. The one authority has the power to decide if there will be a trial, what form of trial it will be and the charges to be laid. It chooses the judge, it chooses the jury and it chooses the prosecutor, and it then reviews the outcome. But there is even more. The presiding officer of the military tribunal is under the command of the convening authority who, having made the decision to prosecute, could be seen to have an interest in the outcome. A guilty verdict would of course justify the convening authority's decision to prosecute. This is not saying that justice under the DFDA is necessarily skewed, but I would like to quote the Judge Advocate General in his 1997 report. He said:
The recommendations in the Abadee report are based on a recognition of the importance of maintaining service discipline whilst, at the same time, paying proper regard to both the existence and appearance of a fair trial and independent system of trial.
What he recommended, and what is included in this bill, is eliminating the multiple roles of the convening authority—that is, the chain of command. The first step towards this is that the convening authority will still decide whether or not to lay charges and what charges are appropriate, but it will then have no further role in the proceedings. This means that the officer who convenes a court martial, or who refers a charge to a Defence Force magistrate for trial, then has no further role in selecting the judge, jury or magistrate for the case and no role in the subsequent review of the trial outcome. It eliminates the current multiple roles of the convening authority.
This step, this change in the process, makes another authority, the Judge Advocate General, responsible for nominating officers to act as judge advocates for the courts martial and for nominating officers as Defence Force magistrates for trials. He also appoints the president, the members and the reserve members of the courts martial. This means that the chain of command still decides if and what charges will be laid, but the Judge Advocate General appoints the court to hear these charges—a separation of power.
The second major change in the process is that the outcome of a court martial or Defence Force magistrate proceedings will no longer be reviewed by the same authority—the same chain of command—which decided to lay the charges in the first place; that is, the reviewing authority must be different. To ensure impartiality, any review of proceedings must be undertaken by an authority who has had no involvement in convening those proceedings. Not only must it be impartial; it must also be seen to be impartial. Discipline, of course, is essential in the defence forces, but good discipline is fair and impartial, and needs to be perceived as such. That is what we are talking about with these amendments. 
The position of Judge Advocate General, who will be responsible for appointing judge advocates and members of military tribunals, is a very senior reserve officer, invariably a judge of the Federal or Supreme Court. This bill provides for the establishment of the statutory position of Chief Judge Advocate to assist the Judge Advocate General in the administration of his or her powers, with certain conditions on the extent of the Judge Advocate General's power of delegation. The person appointed to the new position of Chief Judge Advocate must already be a member of the judge advocates panel. This means that he or she will be experienced in and familiar with both the Defence Force and the judicial system. Although such an appointment will be for a period of three years, the bill allows for the period to be extended. 
As I have already mentioned, the bill contains two major measures. The second one increases the penalty applicable when a person falsely represents himself or herself as a returned service man or woman. It increases the current fine of $200 to $3,300. I would like to support other members who have spoken in this debate, particularly the member for Dunkley who made a speech in June regarding people who pretend to have seen active service and wear medals that they did not earn. Referring to people who publicly wear medals to which they are not entitled, the member for Dunkley said:
... they seek to associate themselves with performance, great courage, chivalry and great service that our veterans provided to this nation. They are purporting to be something they are not and they are seeking to associate themselves with the deep reverence and respect the Australia community has for the veterans.
I agree with the member for Dunkley—I say that this is fraud against those who have served with valour. This is fraud against our community. 
Those who serve, or have served, in our defence forces make sacrifices and take risks to do so. They have stood to protect our country, our freedom and our democracy and they risked—and some have lost—lives and limbs in doing so. We, of course, honour and respect them. We watch them in Anzac Day marches every year with a sense of pride and sadness for those who are there and those who are not there. We turn out in our hundreds of thousands to dawn services to honour them. Why should cheats or the dishonourable be allowed to muscle in on that respect and honour? Their sham diminishes it. It is disrespectful to and a mockery of our genuine ex-service men and women and to the medals they rightfully wear with pride and respect.
Of course we are not talking about family members proudly wearing their relatives' medals in Anzac Day marches. A person wearing their mother's, grandfather's or uncle's medals on Anzac Day is honouring that person as well as the service and valour displayed by such veterans. They are not pretending to be them. Anyway, medals belonging to loved ones are correctly worn on the right breast. Only those awards and decorations awarded to a person by the Queen or the Governor-General, or approved foreign decorations can be worn by that person on the left breast.
As the explanatory memorandum to this bill says, the reasons the penalties are being increased are to:
	better reflect the gravity of these offences; 
	preserve the integrity of the medal awards system; and 
	deter behaviour such as representing oneself as a returned soldier, sailor or airman.
There are also a number of small amendments in this bill that simply clarify the act, bring old terminology up to date or align provisions with the Criminal Code. Let me give an example. Item 2 changes the description of a particular assault offence from `assaulting an inferior' to the much more current and appropriate description of `assaulting a subordinate'. Both descriptions mean assaulting a person of lower rank in the service, but the former description is couched in the language of a past age. We no longer talk about such people as inferiors—they are not—and this government is simply seeking to amend the act to reflect that. In the same vein, the names of our Cadet Corps are amended to make them more contemporary and reflect who and what these young people actually are. The Naval Reserve Cadets become the Australian Navy Cadets, the Australian Army Cadet Corps becomes the Australian Army Cadets, and the Air Training Corps becomes the Australian Air Force Cadets. 
Item 4 clarifies the operation of the fault element in the offence of `negligence' in performance of a duty. Its purpose is to make the act consistent with the Criminal Code in that the fault element of intent must apply to the offence. As the explanatory memorandum says, it is not intended that this particular offence should proscribe an act or omission that is simply the result of forgetfulness—the intent must be there.
Like much of this bill, item 9 is about fairness and justice not just happening as due course, or happening behind a veil of secrecy, but being seen to be done. It has to be part of the obvious, routine process. This amendment to the original legislation includes additional requirements for the cautioning and questioning of persons in custody. They must be cautioned in a language they can understand and, if possible, that cautioning should be tape recorded. If no recording can be made, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, which is an incentive for them to ensure that the right thing is done.
Of course we honour and respect our veterans. But we should not forget that with Iraq, and with Australia's important role in peacekeeping, many current members of our defence forces are already veterans, or will be, and also deserve that honour and respect. They should not have to wait until they leave the services to receive respect or justice. Discipline is obviously essential to the effectiveness of these services. If an order is given in combat, you have little time for argument. You certainly have no time for union meetings, sit-down strikes or arbitration—the enemy would probably get you before the meeting or strike was over anyway. But that does not mean that our defence personnel should not expect to have justice seen to be done.
Just because you can be tried under the Defence Force Discipline Act should not mean that you cannot expect a fair trial. Currently you cannot. In particular cases the process may be fair, but when the same authority—the same officer—charges you, appoints all the members of the court, is commanding officer of the presiding officer and, after all this, reviews the results of his or her creation then the perception and the reality is that that is blatantly open to abuse and injustice. Even if it is only a perception of injustice, it is a very real one.
I believe it is time to correct this perception. I believe justice is probably generally done, but I also believe our service people deserve more and that Australians want more for them. We are Australian; we believe in fair play. Justice must not only be done for our service personnel; it must also be seen to be done, just so we can be sure it is. I therefore commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I am pleased to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. The opposition is supporting the bill. But no-one should be under any illusions about the state of health of military justice in the defence forces. It is true to say that the government has been dragged kicking and screaming to this debate on military justice and bringing about changes. In the period of office of the Howard government, not one minister has made one ministerial statement about military justice. We have had three ministers—not one—and now there is a fourth. People have referred to the Abadee report which was brought down in 1995. On the Labor side we have had three spokespersons for defence. In the Senate two of them have initiated inquiries into military justice. 
In the first term of the Howard government, the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had three inquiries. Two were initiated by the coalition—one on expenditure and one on the loss of HMAS Sydney. The third was initiated by my colleague the honourable member for Brisbane in a Senate motion looking at military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force. In that inquiry we made 59 recommendations, including looking at the Abadee report. If I am frank with you, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran and members of the House, we made a serious error in that inquiry report. Although we agonised about recommending a director of military prosecutions, in the end we did not; we suggested that it should be looked at in a couple of years hence.
In the second term of the Howard government, issues arose over 3RAR. I will stand up in this House and say that I copped a lot of flak over that inquiry. Two things happened. One was that, as a way of defusing the issue, the government instituted the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force so that issues of harassment and bastardisation could be taken directly to the inspector-general. In the case of military justice and rough justice, we found that a whole range of systems were not working effectively, including equity officers. The government instituted that position. There has not been one public document from the inspector-general, appointed for some years now, about what complaints he has received, what actions he has taken and what action he has recommended to the Defence Force—not one. In its review of the Defence annual report, the Defence Subcommittee suggested that if the government were serious about that inspector-general's role then it was important that there be a section in that annual report that covered the activities of that office. I find it mightily disappointing—and I am sure the Australian people do too—that we can appoint an inspector-general to deal with these issues but there is nothing on the public record. I have to say it is typical of the way Defence is administered.
In the inquiry into rough justice, the Labor members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, for the first time in my experience, provided a dissenting report. The dissenting report went on to recommend the institution of a director of military prosecutions. I am pleased to say that that was supported by the Judge Advocate General. I said that the coalition has been brought kicking and screaming to this debate on military justice, and that is an example of it. But I am pleased to say that the government has seen the light and has accepted that we need an independent statutory office of a director of public prosecutions responsible for the laying of charges and prosecuting courts martial. I cannot say whether or not we have got that office yet. I think we have, but I am not sure, because there has been no announcement. I can guarantee you that there will not be one ministerial statement about it in this place.
If we think that that is the extent of the concerns, we are a long way from it. The honourable member for Oxley referred to a distinguished non-commissioned officer who served in East Timor. He said that the investigation into charges dragged on for four years. I am not sure of the extent of the time, but I can say that it was too long. There is no debate about the fact that it was too long. The way that person was treated was an utter disgrace, a shame. If you looked at the charges—and two were formally court-martialled—you saw that he was being charged with what was standard practice. The military police did not have the understanding or training to know that some of the allegations were about actions that were consistent with the practice of the ADF. Yet this non-commissioned officer was hung out to dry. Overwhelmingly, the charges that were investigated by the military police were frivolous to the extent that they reflected practice. 
We are told that nothing more needs to be done in military justice. When we were doing the report into rough justice, the Army military police, instead of reporting directly and solely to the commanding officer, were in fact formed into a battalion. So they were two-hatted. But the important point here is that they had an opportunity to go back to their battalion if they were caught in a bind. Indeed, if you look at the issues surrounding 3RAR—and I do not want to go over all of those—you will see that the investigative quality that was applied to them was of concern.
I mentioned that we on this side have had three spokespersons for defence. The member for Brisbane initiated the military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force. Senator Chris Evans has now instituted another inquiry looking at the suicide of a young private in training. It is very reassuring to have a press release from the Chief of Army about the investigations into that and what he proposes to do, but don't you think it might have been worth a press release from a minister or even a statement from a minister? What will it take for this government to front up and accept some ministerial responsibility and outline to the Australian people their concerns and what they propose to do about it?
It is a very funny thing: if there is a photo opportunity—if you can wrap the flag around yourself—you will always find the ministers; you will always find the government. But if it is stepping up to the plate to accept responsibility and to outline action that needs to be taken, you simply will not find them. I hope the new minister, who I have a regard for, will be different. But you will forgive me for saying the form ain't good on the government side.
In relation to the suicide of that young private, doesn't the heart of the issue go to harassment? Doesn't the heart of the issue go to bastardisation? Where is the inspector-general that we have appointed? No-one can say that the parents did not express concern. We cannot say that the ADF was oblivious to the fragility and the concern of the private and the concern his parents had for him and his wellbeing. So where were the equity officers? Where was the inspector-general of personnel that is supposed to be monitoring these things springing into action? Did anyone ever make a call? Was a lever pulled? Was the matter referred to him? If this inspector-general position is one of being deaf, dumb, mute, inactive and inert, then let us abolish it. Let us admit that there was a mistake. But can't someone put on the public record what went wrong here? Isn't that the role of the minister of the day?
I must say that I have real concerns about the way some of these boards of inquiry are conducted and proceed. I know that there are a number of cases in this report that the committee highlighted where millions of dollars were spent in boards of inquiry. I have pursued this matter by way of questions on notice. I thank in this case the minister for getting back to me informally and other ADF people for getting back to me about the longwall death. That is a board of inquiry that has gone on for more than 18 months, and hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars have been spent. It is all very well for us to have boards of inquiry. They are an integral part of the system. After all, we need to learn the lessons from any disaster or mishap. But we simply cannot afford to be wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money on long, drawn-out, procrastinating inquiries. They are independent and they need to be independent, but we do need to have a look at them. 
To wind up on the issue of military justice, soldiers, sailors and airmen serve this country, but they are entitled to justice. With what little I understand of the military justice system, I do understand that there is a tension between what you might say are the necessities and prerogatives of command in the ADF and providing justice. But we have to do better than we have done to date. If we want to recruit good young people into the ADF—as we do—then we have to get military justice right, and we are still a long way from getting to the finishing line in that. Again I say: after six or seven years, wouldn't it be nice to have a ministerial statement informing members of this House and the people at large about where the government is heading?
This is an omnibus bill in the defence area, and I would like to cover a few other things. You may recall that one of the proud boasts of the Howard government was that it was going to put more people into the sharp end. Let us see how they have done. The ADF now has 55,427 members, compared to 57,580 when Labor left office in 1996—there are fewer now than when we left office. For the first time since the Commonwealth has been responsible for defence, Department of Defence employees are costing more than soldiers, sailors and airmen in the ADF. In fact, there has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of senior executives in the Department of Defence over the last three years.
I support the idea of getting people out of one end and into the other, so putting all the resources into the sharp end, but what is actually happening? We are ballooning the top echelon of the Department of Defence. The coalition have been bigger backers of putting more senior public servants into the Department of Defence than any other government on record. It gets even better: for the 18,287 civilian employees there are now 128 senior executives and for the 55,427 members of the ADF there are 122 senior executives—for about 18,000 you get 128 but for about 55,000 you get 122—so there are more chiefs in the department than there are in the ADF.
Let us look at the current proposal. The current proposal, as you may recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that in the defence acquisitions area the coalition, having bumped up the then deputy secretary to permanent head level, are now going to take that out of the department and put in a senior executive from private enterprise. That sounds really good, as though it is a worthwhile move. But what is the message we are sending? We are going to be paying that executive hundreds of thousands of dollars—this is to attract a good one—so that person will be getting more money than the Chief of the Defence Force, Chief of Army, Chief of Navy or Chief of Air Force. So, if you are in charge of acquisitions under the coalition, you will be earning top dollars. You will be earning more than the people that I have mentioned—more than the Chief of Australian Theatre and more than the secretary of the whole defence department. As an individual you will be getting paid more than them. What sort of message does that send to the troops—the privates and airmen and sailors? I think it is a shocking picture.
Of course, why wouldn't they want to try to do something! Of the 20 largest defence projects that were being planned in 1996, none has been delivered. Two have been cancelled—the offshore patrol combatant acquisition and the Mulgara light surveillance reconnaissance vehicle—and the rest are a mere 85 years late! Remember the fanfare about the defence white paper? Now we are going to have a gap. We are going to get rid of all the F111s, the most superior aircraft in the region, and there is going to be at least a five-year gap until we get their replacements, and we do not even know what type and what particular model the replacements will be. 
I apologise to the Reserves, because I wanted to make a few comments about the Reserves and the way they have been so poorly treated. But I live in hope that, with all the changes to the Reserves, we could still have a ministerial statement so that the government could put everything into a package and tell the people of Australia, particularly the reservists, what exactly they are doing with them—and they have made heaps of changes. We are trying to extract out of them what the reserve ready reaction force is actually going to do.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—It is a pleasure to rise to make my contribution on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. This bill has three basic parts. The first part deals with military discipline and the second part deals with the way in which medals and decorations and also claims about membership of the services shall be dealt with. In the third part there are some changes to the way in which the cadet corps of Australia is dealt with; it makes amendments to modernise some of the titles and references to the cadet corps. The parliament would be aware of an inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Abadee into discipline in the defence services. It is interesting to note that following that report the Judge Advocate General, in his 1997 annual report, said of that inquiry:
The recommendations in the Abadee report are based on a recognition of the importance of maintaining service discipline whilst, at the same time, paying proper regard to both the existence and appearance of a fair trial and independent system of trial. ... The most important recommendations relate to the multiple roles presently vested in the Convening Authority. The first of those roles is concerned with the decision to lay charges and the selection of appropriate charges. However the Convening Authority also appoints the Judge Advocate and the members of the court or the Defence Force Magistrate. It is my firm view that Command influence should cease at the point at which charges are laid. In the light of present day concerns for an independent trial in disciplinary procedures and the experience in other military jurisdictions, I regard it as essential that both the Judge Advocate and members of the court or the Defence Force Magistrate be appointed by an authority other than the Convening Authority. If the reforms presently under consideration are implemented these functions will be vested in the Judge Advocate General.
That was the statement of the Judge Advocate General, and today we are seeing passing through the parliament changes that bring into function the disciplinary roles and amendments relating to the convening authorities. Under this program, where a charge is referred to a convening authority it may direct that the charge not be proceeded with, it may refer the charge to trial or it may convene a court martial. This opens up a wide range of opportunities for disciplinary action and, to some degree, brings about the prospect of civil jurisdiction being applied to matters relating to defence—for instance, matters of complex fraud and items that would be properly dealt with in a civil court can be dealt with in a civil court. The procedure, as best I see it, fulfils the government's commitments and offers a clearer and fairer approach to military discipline. It recognises in difficult circumstances the need for command to be confident that its instructions will be followed, but at the same time it maintains a proper protection for in-service personnel to be protected against abuse or be able to take actions to defend themselves if circumstances arise that call for such action. Various changes to the act are clearly set out, and the recommendations of the Deputy Judge Advocate General's 1997 report are implemented almost in their entirety. 
There are changes to the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that former defence personnel wear only those decorations and medals to which they are entitled. This is really directed at the prospect of there being people who, for their own advantage, do wear decorations to which they are not entitled. I think we have a very appropriate piece of legislation here. Having been to many Anzac Day celebrations, I hear after the event claims muttered about the entitlement of various individuals to wear decorations. There is always the claim that certain individuals are overstating their achievements. There are major measures in the bill to change the penalty provisions for a person falsely claiming to be a returned soldier, sailor or airman or for wearing a medal or decoration to which they are not entitled. In the first instance—and this is serious—the government is proposing that from a fine of $200 there should now be a maximum penalty of $3,300 or six months imprisonment for making those false claims.
It is very clear in the Defence Act that, of course, relatives or family members are entitled to wear the medals or decorations of service persons who are deceased or are incapable of wearing their medals or decorations. This in no way impinges upon the tradition that we have—and it is tradition that young Australians are extremely proud of—of wearing, usually on the right side of the chest, the medals of our forebears. The penalty for destroying or defacing a medal or decoration will increase from $200 to a maximum fine of $6,600 or 12 months imprisonment. I think it is a perfectly reasonable proposition that the destruction of valuable property for any reason whatsoever should be penalised in this manner.
I have been told that there have been a number of successful prosecutions where the nominal penalty of $200 has been applied, but the government feels there is a need—and I must say it is strongly endorsed, as I understand it, through the whole length and breadth of the returned services community—to impose a stricter regime in this area. In my view and in the view of the government it is most desirable that these measures be introduced before Anzac Day 2004 so that the government's intentions can be carried through at that time.
There has been a wide-ranging debate about medals and decorations. I understand the wish of all people—whether they are reservists or in national service—to have their service recognised, and I think that is appropriate. The government have taken strong action, sometimes against advice, to recognise either reservists or national service personnel. However, I have held the view for some time that an appropriate way we could have dealt with this matter—unfortunately, we have moved past it now—would have been to introduce a medal for a member of the Defence Force service. That would entitle a person to wear a medal indicating that they had served the prerequisite induction period and become a member of the Defence Force service, and it would apply to both people who enter as permanents and those who do not. In that way we could remove some of the unnecessary discrimination that permanent serving members feel when they have to wait a set period of time before being entitled to any recognition of their period of service to their country.
I know that some would say that that is an American way of doing things—and, yes, that is true: it is—but it would solve many of the problems that we have now created for ourselves with various categories and sections of the defence community claiming this or that right. I think the entitlement could be applied to a wide range of people and could resolve many of the categorisation problems that have confronted us over a period of time, and, in addition to their eligibility for membership of the Defence Force, it would allow us to acknowledge people's national service—at home or overseas—and the role of reservists. 
The final remarks I wish to make are directed towards the cadets. I am absolutely delighted that this government has chosen to resurrect the significance of the cadet scheme throughout Australian schools. It has been most successful, and young people everywhere who are involved in the cadets are most enthusiastic. A number of schools in my electorate have cadet corps, and I cannot too strongly commend the cadets at Oakhill College and Baulkham Hills High School, where they parade regularly. They are proud to be members of a corps, their officers are committed and focused and the results being gained in attitude and outlook are highly significant. I want to encourage the government to continue expanding the cadet scheme around Australia. It is most valuable in the training and the further education of young people.
Another provision in the bill is that the Army Cadets, the Naval Reserve Cadets and the Air Training Corps should be renamed, respectively, the Australian Army Cadets, the Australian Navy Cadets and the Australian Air Force Cadets. I think they are much more appropriate descriptions of the actions and service undertaken by the various elements of the Australian service cadet scheme. I want to commend the government for making these changes and to encourage the government to do more for our young people.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I wish to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. This bill makes a number of minor changes to defence related acts. I will be addressing some of these changes and also raising some items which I believe this bill could have and should have addressed. In relation to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, a 1997 report by the defence Deputy Judge Advocate General and a subsequent internal review found various problems with the military justice system and recommended, amongst other things, the creation of the office of Director of Military Prosecutions. To date, no Director of Military Prosecutions has been appointed. I ask the government if they intend to make the appointment and, if so, when, and what they are going to do about that recommendation.
The need for a Director of Military Prosecutions has been demonstrated time and time again over the course of this parliament. Members might recall a series of investigations into the serious allegation of sexual assault of a sailor on the HMAS Arunta at the beginning of last year. It was only after political pressure from the Labor Party that this allegation was investigated. The Labor Party was concerned about the integrity of the process within the Navy for handling criminal allegations within its own ranks. I remind you that it was Labor's close scrutiny of the military justice system that led to changes to the Navy inquiry regulations. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence can take no credit whatsoever for this. The creation of a statutory independent position of Director of Military Prosecutions will ensure that the highest standard of justice and impartiality is available to our troops. The need for this new position was agreed to by Labor in a minority report of the government stacked Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in April 2001. 
I will now move on to the inclusion in this bill of section 80B, which creates an offence of improper use of service medals. This is very significant as the false representation of oneself to be a returned serviceman or servicewoman, in my view, should carry significant penalties. Therefore, the increasing of penalties if a person is convicted of misrepresentation from $200 or six months imprisonment, or both, to $3,300 or six months imprisonment, or both, is welcome.
I am concerned in relation to the destroying or defacing of service decorations if in fact we are talking about the serviceperson themselves carrying out that act. People take an enormous risk to earn these medals, and I think they should own them personally. If they believe they need to do something to them, I do not think they should be penalised for that. But where someone steals someone's medals and then deliberately defaces them, when they are caught they should be dealt with in the harshest possible terms. I am reminded of a lady who I spoke to last week at a morning tea in Wilson. Her husband passed away some years ago, and some individuals broke into her home and stole his medals. They were found discarded up the road, but the ribbons were in tatters and she was obviously very distraught. If those sorts of people are caught, they need to be dealt with in the absolutely harshest possible terms. They do not appreciate, half the time, the heartache they cause and the damage they do to people's lives when they conduct this sort of activity.
The amendment to the Defence Force home loan is overdue. However, the provision of a subsidy on the interest of an $80,000 home loan is not realistic in 2003; $80,000 is not enough to buy a home. Therefore, ex-service personnel will have to either have a substantial amount of money saved or take a second home loan in order to buy a property. We really need to address that; $80,000 is just ridiculous.
In recent times, there has been a greater use of reserve forces personnel in overseas conflicts. Reservists have been deployed alongside regular forces personnel in Bougainville, East Timor, the gulf and, most recently, Iraq. These people have regular jobs outside of the defence forces. They take leave from these jobs to fight alongside full-time defence personnel and they take the same risks. I commend all our defence personnel, both regular and reservists, for their involvement in the defence of Australia at home and overseas. However, I am very concerned that reservists do not have access to the same entitlements as regular Defence Force personnel. Reservists who fight overseas are not eligible for Defence Force personnel home loans nor, as I understand it, are they eligible for the health care available to regular Defence Force personnel. This is an area that must be looked at as a priority. It needs to be addressed so that personnel, whether regular or reservists, are dealt with in an equitable way. Reservists fighting overseas are subject to the same combat conditions as regular Defence Force personnel, take the same risks and are subject to the same exposure to chemicals et cetera. Therefore, it seems to me that they should be treated equally in relation to benefits.
In my electorate I have a number of RSL sub-branches—Belmont, Victoria Park, South Perth, Carlisle, Rivervale, Cannington and Manning, to name just a few. The members of these sub-branches perform a sterling job looking after veterans in the community, and they really need to be commended. I am sure that they will welcome this legislation because it will bring some benefit and peace of mind to them. I welcome the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and commend it to the House.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in supporting the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and taking the opportunity that this omnibus bill provides to us to talk more broadly on a range of defence matters. I am particularly pleased to follow the member for Swan, and I agree with the comments that he has made this morning in relation to the specifics of the bill. I followed with interest the comments last night and earlier today on this side of the House. The member for Cowan, a Vietnam veteran, talked with great authority and integrity on matters to do with medals and the provisions in the bill dealing with those things. 
The member for Denison last night put the argument very forthrightly on behalf of those who have some interest in civil liberties and human rights in respect of the Australian citizens Hicks and Habib held in Guantanamo Bay. I have a private member's motion on the Notice Paper dealing with this matter and it strikes me as not just peculiar but a disgrace that we have allowed two Australian citizens to be held virtually without any rights, to be held at the sole discretion of the President of the United States for a period of something now exceeding two years, to be held in conditions that Nazi war criminals were not subjected to, and to be denied the rights that even Nazi war criminals were afforded. That will forever blight our history in this parliament. I think the comments made by the member for Denison should be read by all members of the parliament.
Particularly I want to acknowledge the contribution of the member for Chifley, who more than anybody in this parliament deserves credit for the initiatives in military justice that this bill proposes. As Deputy Chair and a very active member of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, he has been extremely committed and diligent in pursuing the rights of service personnel to proper judicial process. This bill in no small measure is a result of the work which he has done over many years. I think it is a great credit to him and an indication of what you can do sometimes in this parliament through committee work.
At a time when security issues are so prominent in the public mind, it is a matter of concern that this government wishes to garner the greatest amount of political spin it can without providing the substance that is needed. Our defence forces deserve much better than this government has provided. There has been a litany of incompetence and mismanagement since this government was elected in 1996. It likes the tabloid press release, it likes the spin to be right, but, when it comes to actually performing and to delivering the goods in the most critical of areas for a national parliament, it fails miserably. 
The government released with great fanfare their 2000 white paper and referred in it to a quite extensive program to acquire a substantial amount of new platforms and equipment. I was interested therefore in the assessment of our current defence budget conducted by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, and what it had to say about this government's management of that budget. Bear in mind that ASPI is an organisation that is basically independent. We might quibble from time to time on both sides of the House as to members appointed to its board, but I think it is fair to say it has a decent cross-section of good, intellectually capable security analysts. ASPI said this in its look at the current defence budget:
Only two budgets out from the 2000 White Paper the much lauded 10-year program of capital investment set out in the Government's Defence Capability Plan (DCP) looks decidedly shaky: $210 million worth of spending has been deferred over the last two years and another $642 million `rescheduled' from the next four. 
That is $850 million that the government have not been able to keep on track just two years into a 10-year program. What is it going to be like five years into the 10-year program? The program has only just started and they are already $850 million off track. Why are they off track? Because they have not been able to properly administer their own program because they have been too concerned about the public spin, they have been too concerned about talking about `children overboard' and they been too concerned about talking about border security, when in fact they should have been concerned about at least implementing their own program. If they cannot get it right in the first 24 months of a 120-month program, I think it augurs badly for the future. But sadly that is the position the government have put us in.
But it does not stop there. The government have managed to pay over $800 million for 40-year-old Seasprite helicopters that we do not even have yet. We are not going to have them until some time next year, but they forked out the money up front. Not content with forking out the money up front, they paid $31 million to service the helicopters on a service contract. So we have spent $31 million to service helicopters that we have already paid for but we are not going to get until next year. This is supposed to be good project management! They purchased torpedoes for our Collins class submarines that were too heavy. They purchased torpedoes that did not fit in the submarines, so we, as Australian taxpayers, then had to spend a couple of hundred million dollars to alter the submarines to fit—
—Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I rise on a point of order. Just to aid the member for Brisbane so he does not mislead the House, I inform him that in fact the Seasprites have been received into service.
 (Ms Corcoran)—Your point of order—
—I am happy to stand corrected if they are now in service. That is obviously a fairly recent addition. The minister might like to tell us exactly when they entered service. The government have also committed, without any program of evaluation, $US150 million to the Joint Strike Fighter program—something I spoke about recently in the parliament. It is extraordinarily pre-emptive, in that the program for evaluation of that platform was only beginning when they closed it. The other companies that were involved in the bidding were totally surprised. British Aerospace found out the program had been concluded when a journalist rang them up, and the French consortium that were planning to bid for the project knew nothing of it. The person heading up their bid got off the plane in Canberra on the morning that the government announced they had made their decision. He was supposed to be here to head up a bidding program for four years. On the day he got here to set up he found out the government had already made up their mind on what will be the single most important acquisition for defence purposes to be made in the next decade. The normal processes of evaluation had been cast aside by this government in the most important acquisition we will make. Not only is it important; it will be the single most costly acquisition in Australian defence history.
This is a big-ticket item, by any definition, and this government has decided on the outcome without any evaluation process. The proof of that, of course, is that the other companies involved in the bidding have packed up and gone home. The French have no desire to participate any more in our acquisition program and the British Aerospace bid, of course, is no longer on foot, because the government has determined the outcome. The JSF may turn out to be an extremely good asset for our purposes or it may not. The simple fact is that none of us knows. That is why we have exhaustive investigative processes when we go about acquiring these sorts of platforms for our Defence Force. But the government has dispensed with all that. 
It is interesting to note that, at the moment, the JSF has a few weight problems and it looks like they are not going to get a vertical variant of the aircraft because it is too heavy to take off in vertical configuration. It is also interesting to note that the United States Navy have cut their order of JSFs by 400. All is not rosy in the JSF program, yet we have committed to it years out from the delivery of any aircraft; and, in that process, we have also decided that we will retire early our F111s, presumably to be replaced by the JSF—the Joint Strike Fighter—which is yet to be in operation, and I think it will be 2012 or 2015 at the earliest before we get the aircraft. This is another case of terrible mismanagement.
There is one other example that I will mention, although there are others that I could refer to, and that is the decision the Howard government made not long after it was elected in June 1996 to buy some AGM142 missiles for the F111. These are not expected to be fitted to the aircraft until 2005—nine years after they ordered them. Why? Because they have not been able to make the modifications to the F111s that were required. These are not things that competent governments do in the management of defence. But it should not be too much of a surprise because, if you look over the period that this government has been in office, it has managed to have four secretaries of the department and four defence ministers in just five years. There is no continuity amongst the most senior people, either here in the parliament or across at Russell. Thankfully, those in uniform have maintained the usual consistency of position and high standard. I suspect that without the professionalism of our defence forces—those at Russell and throughout the defence community—we would be in an even worse position.
One of the specific areas that this bill before us touches on is the question of medals and their misuse. I want to refer to one area of the medals issue that has troubled me since I first learnt about it some years ago: the medals associated with the Battle of Long Tan. As all of us know, the Battle of Long Tan was an occasion during the Vietnam War in which a comparatively small force of Australians was ambushed by a very large force of both regular Vietnamese soldiers and Vietcong. In the face of quite overbearing odds, the Australians were able to extricate themselves and, indeed, do the job required of them incredibly well. There were comparatively few casualties, although I think it was the single incident that created more casualties for Australia than any other. During the course of that battle, Australian troops came under heavy fire and some of the company commanders were killed early in the battle. That required NCOs and junior officers to take on responsibilities that they would not normally have had to carry out.
Sadly, when it came to recognising what were amongst the most heroic deeds of that war, the medals for which they were recommended were downgraded. This fact only came to light after the 30-year rule allowed the disclosure of the documents, so it has only been in the last few years that we have known the true story of what happened. In spite of my repeated efforts and those of other members on this side of the House, including the member for Cowan, to have this matter dealt with, the government has refused to reconsider the matter. I want to refer to a question I asked when this first came to my attention in December 1999. I asked the then minister: 
Is it a fact that, following the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966, (a) Lt Col. Harry Smith, who commanded D Company 6 RAR during the battle, recommended the Military Cross be awarded to two of his platoon commanders, (b) these recommendations were not acted on, (c) mentioned in dispatches (MID) awards were provided to these platoon commanders rather than a Military Cross and (d) MID awards were also provided to soldiers who did a good job sorting mail in the Vung Tau Post Office.
That question, I have to say, is rhetorical: every one of those statements is true. Those soldiers were recommended for a Military Cross, a deservedly higher order, because of their bravery in the fiercest battle of the Vietnam War involving Australian soldiers. What did they end up getting? They got a much lesser award: Mentioned in Dispatches. Just to rub salt into the wound, the very medals list that had their MIDs on it also had a Mentioned in Dispatches for the postal clerk in Vung Tau. Their bravery on the battlefield, in the fiercest fight that Australians faced in the Vietnam War, was regarded by the hierarchy at the time as worthy of nothing more than what the postal clerk in Vung Tau received. I am happy enough for the postal clerk in Vung Tau to get a Mentioned in Dispatches. I guess he did a good job, but I do not know. What I do know is that those people who were in the middle of that battle at Long Tan deserved higher recognition. But it gets worse. I also asked the minister:
Did the Battle Commander receive a Distinguished Service Cross—
in fact, he got a Distinguished Service Order—
with a citation that referred ... to the Battle, even though he was not physically present at the Battle.
So whilst the soldiers in the thick of it were awarded Mentioned in Dispatches, the Battle Commander, who was not even there, managed to pick up a Distinguished Service Order. I also asked the minister:
Did the Brigadier who was the Task Force Commander also receive a mention for personal direction of the Battle in his Distinguished Service Order.
So the brigadier, who was not actually anywhere near where the bullets were fired, got a Distinguished Service Order. I asked:
What were the facts that led to the findings that the (a) Battalion Commander was involved in the Battle and (b) Task Force Commander directed the Battle.
The minister of the day, Mr Scott, answered that question by saying:
I do not know to which report you are referring giving the facts which led to the findings that the (a) Battalion Commander was involved in the Battle and (b) Task Force Commander directed the Battle.
He did not know where that came from. That is a reassuring sentiment to pass on to those Vietnam vets. But it really does offend when I look at the last part of that question. I asked these three questions in 1999:
During the Battle, did the Battalion Commander send a message to the armoured relief force en route to the Battle, to return two vehicles to a Col Joy and Little Patty Task Force Concert to pick him up and to halt the relief column and wait for him at the river Suoi Da Bang ... If so, was that order countermanded by the A Company Commander who forced the Armoured Commander to proceed and relieve the situation at the Battle area.
Finally, I asked:
Did the Battalion Commander finally arrive at the Battle site when the battle was over and after the last shot had been fired and was it only at this point that he actually took command of the scene. 
I have it on the authority of a number of the troops who were in that battle that that is exactly what transpired. In spite of the fact that the most senior officer in the battlefield recommended that honours be provided to his platoon commanders, they were downgraded and this government has refused to deal with it. What did the minister say in answer to the last three questions to which I have just referred? He replied:
The information requested is available from the Australian War Memorial Series 95 War Diaries of the Units involved in the Battle of Long Tan.
That is fantastic, Minister! It is not surprising that most of the Vietnam vets involved in that battle who know about those questions and answers were outraged by them. One wrote to the minister at the time and asked the question that perplexes all of them, and I must say bewilders me. He said:
My request to you, Mr Scott, is: please explain why it is that the subject of the awards made following the battle of Long Tan, Australian, Imperial, American and South Vietnamese, appear to be causing such a state of denial and obfuscation in government and departmental circles more than 30 years after the event.
It is a puzzling question. I have referred here to the Australian and Imperial medals that have not been provided to those troops who clearly deserve them. I must say it does grate to know that those in the battle who were recommended for a Military Cross and did not receive one had to watch while people who were at the Little Pattie and Col Joye concert got one. That is an interesting turn of events, but that is what happened and this government has ignored it. This is something the facts of which have only been publicly known since 1996, 30 years after the battle. In spite of repeated efforts by the troops concerned, by me and by other members in this place, this government has refused to address that issue.
This bill deals with medals and how they are to be handled after they are issued. There is a more fundamental and important question that needs to be addressed and that is: who gets medals and in what circumstances do they get them? There are all manner of people now saying that you should get a medal just because you enlisted. That is a debate for another day.
—What are your thoughts?
—That is a debate for another day. I know this: those brave and decent soldiers in the battle of Long Tan, who were there because a government sent them there, have been deserted by the government—and, as it turns out, a government of the same political persuasion. I hope that the minister has listened to some of what I have said about the Long Tan battle and that there may actually be some take-up of it. It is long overdue that those involved receive their proper recognition and that it is put right. It is a clear case of injustice and the sooner it is fixed, the better will be the outcome.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—In summing up the debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, I want to begin by thanking all of those on both sides of the House who have participated in the debate. It has been a wide ranging debate, albeit that many of the comments that have been made, particularly by those who sit opposite, were not necessarily on the legislation. In particular, I would like to thank the member for Dunkley and the member for Herbert for their very supportive comments in relation to the improper use of service medals and decorations and other initiatives contained within the bill. As the member for Herbert notes, the bill will be appreciated not only by senior officers and men and women of Australia's mighty Defence Force, as he put it, but also by the veteran community generally. 
The improper use of a service decoration and falsely representing service personnel are demeaning and dishonourable to serving and former members of the Defence Force. Our veteran community and serving personnel are held in the highest esteem by our community today. Their service and sacrifice deserves strong protection from those who wrongly claim to have the same honour and respect. Therefore, the increase in penalties for such behaviour will send a clear message to offenders that it will not be tolerated by this government. As my predecessor, the member for Hughes, outlined in her speech introducing this bill, the other initiatives will implement recommendations made by Brigadier Abadee in relation to the military discipline system to ensure the application of contemporary standards of judicial independence and impartiality.
I welcome the comments made by members in support of these initiatives. The member for Dunkley pointed out that these initiatives recognise the government's ongoing commitment to the Australian defence organisation and service personnel. In particular, those initiatives that modernise the nomenclature of the Cadet Corps recognise the government's commitment to our young people by reinforcing their potential service in the Australian Defence Force. As the member for Herbert pointed out, the Australian Defence Force has been subject to close scrutiny over the past three to four years and its standing in the community has risen immensely as a result of operational successes.
I would like to address a couple of the comments made in the debate by those who sit opposite, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, and I thank you for your contribution. The members for Cowan, Swan and Oxley raised comments and concerns regarding the prosecution of veterans for dealing with medals or service decorations that they own themselves—in other words, destroying their own service decorations. I should point out to those members opposite that this is not a change to the legislation in any way, shape or form; only the penalties are affected. Therefore the law remains in place, as it has for a very long period of time. There has never been a prosecution and, dare I say, there never will be a prosecution for someone destroying something they own themselves. It is when people wish to make a demonstration of their dislike for particular government policies generally or campaigns and they use something that is not theirs and destroy it—medals and decorations in this particular case—that it is totally inappropriate. The intent of the amendment is only to increase the penalty for the practices that are unlawful, deceitful and disrespectful to our veterans and serving personnel. Prosecutional discretion would be exercised in relation to personnel who are making some sort of a statement with property of their own.
I also thank the member for Denison for his very supportive comments in respect of the government's endeavours through this legislation to modernise the military justice system. As the member for Denison noted, the intent of the amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act seek to inculcate in defence an independent, arm's-length system of military justice in which the Australia Defence Force and the Australian community can be proud. I thank him for those comments.
I have a couple of other quick comments to ensure that the record is correct. The member for Swan pointed out that the Director of Military Prosecutions is yet to be established. I can assure the member for Swan that, in fact, the position of Director of Military Prosecutions is in place and functioning. He has an office in Sydney and I have met with him. That position was established earlier in the year, so I am glad to be able to clear that up on your behalf. The member for Chifley was also very critical of the Inspector-General of the ADF, suggesting that he is, amongst other things, inept, impotent and obviously not working, given the tragic death of Private Williams. This is fundamentally incorrect. It is a misunderstanding of the role of the Inspector-General. He is there to oversee the military justice system and he reports directly to the CDF. He is independent of the standard chain of command and that provides another layer of protection to our defence personnel. It gives clear vision to the rest of the public that not only is Defence in fact very serious about maintaining the highest standards of discipline but also that, when prosecutions are necessary and investigations are in place, there is visibility to family, associated friends and members who may be interested in the wider issue of defence disciplinary matters. 
This is an important bill that goes to underpinning the roles and the respect that this community holds for the award system and the commitment that defence personnel have played and, may I say, continue to play to this day. I am sure that this bill will be welcomed by the veterans and the general defence community.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-11-27,"—The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2002 seeks to ensure that eligible members of a local government body do not suffer any penalty arising from their decision to stand as candidates for election to either the House of Representatives or to the Senate—that is, that local councillors do not have to resign their positions in order to be candidates for federal office. The amendment inserts new subsections in section 327 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide that a state or territory law has no effect on the extent to which that law discriminates against a member of a local government body who has been, is or is to be nominated or declared as a candidate in an election for the House of Representatives or the Senate.
I am sure that honourable members are familiar with the background to this move. The Queensland Local Government and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2001 was subsequently found to be invalid by the Queensland Supreme Court, primarily on the grounds that it was inconsistent with sections 163, 164 and 327(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The aforementioned amendment act sought to declare vacant the position of any local councillor who was a candidate for state or federal elections. I do not propose to cover that ground in any great detail except to note that it was controversial at the time and a number of legal commentators were opposed to the decision of the Queensland Supreme Court.
Many cogent arguments exist on both sides. Those opposed include the prominent lawyer and academic, Anne Twomey, who commented in the periodical Constitutional Law and Policy Review: 
It is a general principle, frequently applied, that people who hold high statutory or elective office must resign from that office before running for a different elective office. This prevents people from using the mantle of one office, unfairly, to get elected to another office. It also avoids any conflict of interest, where a person's campaign may conflict with his or her duties of office.
Another argument put is that, whilst sitting members of state and territory parliaments are prevented from becoming members of the federal parliament, why should similar rules not apply to the elected members of local government? With such controversy surrounding the Queensland Supreme Court decision, the bill before us seeks to apply that decision across Australia and instil some degree of certainty to the issue.
At first sight the bill appears worthy enough but, on closer reading and investigation into this whole issue of the eligibility of Australians to stand for the federal parliament, it is quite clear that this bill really does not go to the nub of the issue. Indeed, it misses the mark so widely that I wonder why it was introduced at all. The bigger issue concerns section 44 of the Constitution. This bill does not provide certainty or clarity to the eligibility of local councillors who seek to run for federal parliament. As the explanatory memorandum to the bill tells us:
The amendment to the Electoral Act should in no way be considered to remove or alter any existing Constitutional barriers to qualifying for standing for election. The onus is on all intending candidates and specifically, members of a local government body, to ensure that they Constitutionally qualify for election.
I note that the Australian Electoral Commission warns prospective election candidates, and states:
... such positions as councillors and employees of local government, and members of the governing bodies and the employees of statutory authorities, could be at risk of disqualification, depending on their particular circumstances.
That disqualification, contained in section 44, and subsection (iv) particularly, of the Constitution, is one which strikes a particular chord with me. Section 44(iv) states:
Any person who ... holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth ... shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.
This section strikes a particular chord with me because this matter was raised during the Cunningham by-election campaign last year. As I was an employee of the University of Wollongong, questions were asked as to whether this was a so-called `office of profit' under the Crown. Section 44(iv) has rarely been tested in court, although the High Court did invalidate the election of the then member for Wills in 1992 because he was a teacher on leave without pay, and the current member for Lindsay in 1996 because she was an Air Force officer at the time she nominated.
The real point here is about what constitutes an office of profit under the Crown. This bill unfortunately does not address that issue. In my own case, I have a legal opinion which says that my situation as an employee of an Australian university is not caught up by section 44(iv). But this provision nevertheless excludes public servants and others, such as those on pensions, from running for federal office. This is a rather ludicrous and undemocratic situation in this day and age.
The issue which now faces the House in considering this bill is the unusual situation which it creates, for the bill seeks to prevent discrimination against local councillors standing for federal parliament while there remains uncertainty about whether or not they hold an office of profit under the Crown. That uncertainty is recognised by the Australian Electoral Commission, as I have outlined, and it is certainly recognised by the Liberal Party, as shown by Senator Nick Minchin's evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in 1997, when he said: 
At one stage, after all our candidates had bulk nominated—
that is, for the previous federal election—
we received some advice that any connection with local government might well constitute an office of profit.
The senator's party then went about ensuring that its candidates resigned from their local government positions before renominating. I note that not all parties or individuals follow the path the Liberals took back in 1997. According to the Bills Digest and the current Parliamentary Handbook, the current member for Chifley was elected to the federal parliament in 1984 but remained an alderman on Blacktown City Council until 1987 and was deputy mayor until 1985.
So where do local government councillors stand on this matter? Whose advice should they take? Why does this ambiguity remain? It appears that the bill before us seeks to protect the candidacy of people who may well be constitutionally disqualified. The real issue here is to determine once and for all what section 44 means. That is what the government should be doing instead of this piece of patch-up legislation, no matter how well intentioned it is.
My Greens colleague in the other place, Senator Bob Brown, has been trying to get this matter settled for a number of years. He has done this via the Constitution Alteration (Right To Stand For Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill, which was first introduced in 1998 and was again brought before the Senate in May this year. Senator Brown has been trying for good reason. As every election approaches, 1½ million teachers, posties and other public servants in this country who might like to stand for federal parliament have to decide whether it is worth resigning their jobs in order to do so. Many decide that it is not, and as a result our parliament and our democracy is the less for it.
In addition, Australian citizens who are also citizens of another country—that is, they have dual citizenship—have to go to great lengths to repudiate that second citizenship if they want to nominate for election here. Section 44 is the problem. It stops anyone who holds a so-called `office of profit under the Crown' or who is a citizen of another country—that is, they have dual citizenship—nominating for this parliament. That dual citizen component prevents another five million or so Australians from standing for parliament. It undoubtedly limits the cultural diversity of this place.
There is also a question mark over pensioners who may arguably have an office of profit under the Crown and may therefore not be able to stand for office. That includes disability pensioners, old age pensioners and, indeed, unemployment benefit recipients and recipients of other benefits. Should they be forced to give up their pensions and unemployment benefits for the weeks and months of an election campaign? Of course not. Should they be disqualified from standing? Of course not.
There are between five and seven million Australians who, under the current constitutional provision, cannot stand for their own parliament, because the Constitution was written in the 1890s. We are now in the first decade of the 21st century. Things have moved on a great deal since the 1890s. Our nation has changed—and is changing—and our constitution needs to change with it. Just as we need to move towards becoming a republic, so we need to deal with the `office of profit' issue. We need leadership from this government, and referendums must be put to the people on these matters. 
It is clear that section 44 deprives the federal parliament of a huge pool of talented potential politicians. At every recent election it has caused trouble and expense as someone unwittingly falls foul of the Constitution. Everyone agrees that section 44 should be changed. All parties supported a Greens motion in the Senate to that effect in October 1996 and called on the then government to bring forward a proposal for constitutional amendment. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, reporting on the 1996 election, recommended:
that at an appropriate time, such as in conjunction with the next Federal election—
which would have taken place in 1998—
a referendum be held on a) applying the `office of profit' disqualification in section 44(iv) from the start of an MP's term, rather than from the time of nomination—
so this would not catch up people with nominations—
and b) deleting section 44(i) on `foreign allegiance' and otherwise amending the Constitution to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament.
That was recommendation 39, which was very sensible and reasonable. Then the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined in detail sections 44(i) and 44(iv) of the Constitution and recommended that a referendum be held to amend them. The government's response to those recommendations has been supportive. It states:
Subject to the qualifications outlined below, the government would support amendments of subsections 44(i) and (iv) of the Constitution to overcome the shortcomings identified by the Committee.
It went on to say:
... it accepts that constitutional and legislative action is the only realistic way in which to overcome these shortcomings.
That quotation is from the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which was titled Aspects of section 44 of the Constitution. However, no bill for a referendum has been forthcoming. Instead, we now have the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2002, which fiddles around the edges of the central problem. It deals only with local government councillors, not with the millions perhaps covered by the office-of-profit sword of Damocles. 
In summary, I feel it is an extraordinarily important component of an egalitarian country that no-one should be deprived of the ability to stand for his or her parliament and to represent his or her people. We are proud of our democracy and must ensure that it is truly democratic. This bill represents a missed opportunity. It does not solve the section 44 problem, and the advice from the Australian Electoral Commission stands: prospective candidates for federal parliament who hold a position as a local government councillor may not be able to take up a seat in this place. The government must address this issue and not leave it hanging out there unresolved.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (MEMBERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—The Supreme Court of Queensland, in the decision of the Local Government Association of Queensland and the state of Queensland, recently held invalid section 224A of the Queensland Local Government Act 1993 in its 2001 amendment, which provided: 
A councillor ceases to be a councillor if—
	...	...	...
(b) under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 ... section 176, the councillor is declared to be a candidate for an election.
The majority of the Supreme Court acting on a referral or, as it is sometimes called, a `remitter' from the High Court, where the action had been commenced because it raised a constitutional question, held that the state parliament did not have the legislative power to enact such a law and struck it down pursuant to section 109 of the Constitution.
It might have been thought that that decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland was sufficient to end the matter and that there was no further need for this parliament to act and clarify any pre-existing situation relating either to Queensland or to the right of local government members anywhere across this country to stand for federal parliamentary office. However, there were two queries arising from the decision which has led to the need for this legislation and given rise to some further concerns. The first was that the Queensland decision does not prevent any other state or territory from trying to pass a law similar to that which was enacted in Queensland. That would leave the Commonwealth or another party, such as a local government representative body, to have to launch a similar action along the lines of that launched by the Local Government Association of Queensland, which is both expensive and, one would have thought, inexpedient. 
The second related reason is that the Queensland Supreme Court judgment has been called into question. There have been a couple of interesting academic comments, one by Anne Twomey in particular, who has criticised the decision and the reasons for it. She said that the law was characterised as one relating to the conduct of federal elections because it imposed a burden on candidates for federal office. Ms Twomey commented that it is difficult to see how a law that simply decrees that a councillor ceases to be a councillor if he or she nominates for federal office imposes any such burden. On the other hand, it is fair to say that it is a burden on any person, in this case a local councillor, who wishes to nominate for federal office, to undergo and suffer the concern that he or she may lose their office simply because they nominate for federal office. However, one other point that Ms Twomey made was that the principle frequently applied is that people who hold high statutory or elective office should resign from that office before running for a different elective office. This either prevents people from using the mantle of one office unfairly to get elected to another or avoids any potential conflict of interest, or apparent conflict of interest, in relation to the use of the office or any facilities in respect of it.
I take the view that the legislation ought to be supported because basically it grounds a fundamental principle relating to representation in this place—that is, that we should encourage as many people as we can in this country, especially those who have experience in local government, to stand for federal parliament. We just heard from the member for Cunningham that he is looking for an extension, by referendum, of section 44 of the Constitution. By that, he means a referendum that would substantially limit the scope of that provision which disqualifies anybody holding an office of profit under the Crown from standing for federal parliament. With respect to him, it is far better to focus on precisely what this piece of legislation proposes to do. The legislation meets the criticism that he put forward against it. It actually confers a right to stand for federal parliament—`a privilege' is probably a better way to put it—upon anybody who is a member of a local authority anywhere across this country.  
I would encourage that because it seems to me that those who have experience in local government are more likely to contribute as elected representatives in this parliament. They are more likely to do so because they have the experience, albeit at local level, of representing ordinary people and their concerns through the planning processes and through the local legislative processes and hence understand what government is all about. They therefore serve an apprenticeship, if I can put it that way, that would qualify them and give them experience before they come into this place. That might sound a little pragmatic and a little expedient for those who are more concerned about the precise legal concerns relating to the operation of this particular piece of legislation, but there are some other arguments for the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2002 which I briefly want to address.
It is fair to say that this parliament should have exclusive control over the qualifications for federal office, subject, of course, to the Constitution—in this case it is section 44 which deals with it. It seems to me, therefore, that the bill is appropriate for us to consider, notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland, because it ought to be for this parliament to state clearly through the relevant electoral laws the qualifications and limitations upon those who stand for office.
Also, we should be declaring for, not against, increasing the pool of talent available for this place and protecting the diversity of choice for members of parliament. The member for Cunningham, who spoke just before me, appeared to take a contrary view. With the greatest respect to him, I suspect his views may be coloured somewhat by his own experience and the difficulties that he obviously faced. He referred quite frankly in this place to the fact that he had had to seek legal advice about his own position in relation to section 44. I have already spoken about the fact that local council experience gives a prospective candidate not only a legitimate track record—not an unfair advantage—but also the potential to make a contribution in this parliament that enhances the place and improves the level of representation of those who elect him or her.
As for concerns about the abuse of the resources of local government, I do think there is a basis for the appropriate parliamentary committee giving some thought to protecting against such abuse—not indiscriminately restricting the ability of councillors to become candidates but rather ensuring that when they stand they do not get any unfair or unequal advantage in coming to this place.
At the end of the day, voters should be trusted to decide whether it is right for a local councillor to stand for office or any other tier of government. It might be said against the legislation that it is ironic that similar laws do not apply to state parliamentarians. But the difference is obvious: a state parliamentarian already is a representative in a parliament; it would be absurd to elect a state parliamentarian to another parliament—namely, this parliament. That same disqualification does not arise in relation to local government, which, in truth, is not a parliament at all.
I respectfully support the legislation. I urge the department to give careful consideration to my recommendation that administrative procedures be put in place to ensure that members of local authorities do not unfairly access facilities in standing for federal parliament. But apart from that—and those matters can be sorted out through administrative measures—the legislation is a valuable and important addition to those provisions which determine the qualifications for and limitations upon those who stand for public office.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2003-11-27,"—Local government is a perfect learning environment for a political future and a great introduction to the political arena whilst serving a community. There is no doubt that council is the closest form of government to the local community. For many people, local council is the first place to approach for a range of issues, including lodging development applications, concerns about local roads, parks, amenities, small business development, major industry development—a whole host of areas that people who serve in local government are exposed to.
In the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2002 and in the amendment of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, eligible members of a local government body do not suffer any penalty arising from their decision to stand as a candidate for election to either the House of Representatives or the Senate. To preclude people from standing as a candidate if they do not resign from council is a travesty. These people currently serving on local councils—some have aspirations for federal politics—are a valuable resource and should not be penalised by us legislating and preventing them from remaining in local government whilst they stand as a candidate for a federal seat.
The amendment passed by the Queensland state government to the Queensland Local Government Act 1993 is nothing more than discriminatory and is a discouragement for local councillors to stand as candidates. But the discrimination is done by the state Labor government in Queensland purely to ensure that they are not threatened in any election. It ensures that anyone that gets any profile, who is doing a reasonably good job or who is doing a good job in local government will be precluded should they not resign from council. It is there purely as a measure to allow the Queensland state government every opportunity to stay in power. Theirs is really a discriminatory bill.
Basically, we should be encouraging our local representatives and community members to continue to represent their communities and continue to give of themselves. Local governments spend a great deal of time lobbying state and federal governments for assistance in providing services to their residents in areas such as health, rural doctors, public liability, salinity, environmental issues, development issues, roads and aviation industries, just to name a few. Councils throughout my electorate have strived to work hard in developing their communities to attract investment, and I have many examples of these throughout the Riverina.
The work is being undertaken by councils. For example, Wagga Wagga City Council were recently instrumental in assisting me to attract a Telstra Cellnet call centre to the area, providing an economic boost of between 250 and 300 jobs and $20 million over two years. This is a wonderful example of the crucial role that is played by local government in securing employment, working in conjunction with both the state and federal government. This is where the experience is gained. It is these skills that we want to encourage. We want to encourage these people into the federal arena.
Mayors and councils have lobbied the state government for better conditions for local police, nurses and doctors. More specifically, let us look at what Hay Shire Council are doing. Hay Shire Council have been very proactive in determining how to get a local doctor to assist the one existing doctor in the area of Hay. It is an area of rural need and isolation. They have paid out an enormous amount of money and have done an enormous amount of lobbying to ensure that they are providing services to their community. This is an invaluable role that they play. Should somebody from the Hay community want to stand for state or federal government, one of those people could obviously come from local government—someone who has had the experience and who feels the need to go further to ensure that the needs of isolated rural communities are heard and addressed. 
Other assistance comes from places such as Cootamundra Shire Council. When Shepherds Woolskins was closing down, the council did all that they could to support that industry and assist it to stay there, because 80 jobs were at risk. Those jobs at Shepherds Woolskins have subsequently been lost, but the council worked extraordinarily hard, with Mayor Paul Braybooks meeting with creditors in a bid to rescue that business. Again, these experiences give people valuable expertise.
All local councils throughout the region are working hard to promote their towns and regions to tourists both locally and internationally. The work carried out by these councils in promoting their regions has a positive effect on New South Wales and the Commonwealth, boosting the appeal of our tourism industry domestically and internationally. Again, these are vital issues that people need to have expertise in. They need to develop these roles in local government and certainly in local industries.
Temora Shire Council recently established a committee to prepare a submission in relation to the release of the federal government's AusLink green paper. The general manager, Gary Lavelle, recommended that council make a submission stating: `It is an extremely important green paper and I think it is an opportunity for us to push our views and achieve something positive for our community.' The views of local councils are critical and assist governments in their decision making. Yet the Queensland government would seek to exclude these people from any possibility of extending those decision-making powers into the federal arena in the future. This is just not right.
The mayors of Wagga Wagga, Dubbo and Tamworth met in Wagga Wagga recently to join forces in fighting for the continuation of services in rural health. The trio worked together to fight for benefits and differential Medicare rebates in rural Australia, which are federal issues. The three mayors and their respective councils have agreed that the best way to ensure that federal and state governments listen to the concerns of regional Australia is to use collective weight. Again, this is a very good example of being able to prepare oneself for an introduction to state and federal politics.
In the Riverina electorate the mayors and I represent about 150,000 people. All of those mayors and local government representatives lobby the state and federal governments on issues of concern. Currently, Mayor of Leeton Joe Burns is at loggerheads with the state government about the closure of the Murrumbidgee College of Agriculture. That will see a loss of about 34 jobs. It will also see students moved, part way through their courses, to another town further north in order to finish the courses that they are doing. The Mayor of Leeton is doing an extraordinary job in arguing against the state Labor government on the relocation. Basically, council have put together petitions and activities that will bring this to the attention of the state government, and they are looking to resolve this issue.
Mayors and councillors have driven the agenda on drought assistance, water management, regional airline policies, urban salinity and access to New South Wales Police radio networks. Aside from those issues, they also involve themselves in a host of state and federal discussions. Temora Shire Council purchased a medical centre from a local doctor who was scaling down his services. That step was taken by Temora council to preserve medical services and to ensure that obstetric services at Temora and District Hospital were maintained. Temora Shire Council, like many councils in Australia—especially where it concerns their individual shires—has taken an interest in the issue of genetically modified crops. All of these issues are in the state and federal political arenas. Yet even though they have this experience, we would like see local councils excluded. Of course the Queensland government wants to see them excluded, because they represent a threat to Labor controlled state governments. This attitude of the Queensland government is clearly wrong and could spill over into the New South Wales government. 
Hay Shire Council, as I have mentioned before, has committed itself to the redevelopment of Hay Hospital. That has followed extensive consultation with the state government. It is something that it should be very proud of. Griffith City Council is being very vocal about the retention of its hospital services, after Griffith Hospital was downgraded by the New South Wales government. The council has been very proactive on the issue of health and on ways of attracting doctors to the region.
An enormous amount of expertise and quality of performance has been developed in all of these local governments. I have raised a number of issues that local councils in my electorate of Riverina, and indeed throughout the country, deal with on a regular basis. These issues provide a perfect base for anyone wishing to serve their community as a federal representative. Those elected to council have a wide range of experience across a huge spectrum of issues, probably across a greater spectrum of issues than the majority of people who currently sit in this House or the Senate deal with. Those elected to council should be able to put that expertise and experience to great use in order to benefit communities right across Australia. As I said, they are in the perfect introduction and training ground for the role of a federal member, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. To exclude these people is to exclude great experience and great knowledge from this House—knowledge and experience that would make for better policy decisions in the future.
Not only does this legislation passed by the Queensland government remove valuable experience from local government; it also burdens councils and ratepayers with costly by-elections if a councillor decides to stand for a federal seat. We saw this happen when Senator Heffernan had to resign as the Shire President of Junee Shire in 1993 when he contested the seat of Riverina. A by-election was held, and when Senator Heffernan was not successful in attaining that seat he had to stand for the next council election to return to the council of Junee. He was consequently elected back to that seat, but it cost the ratepayers of Junee Shire an enormous amount of money, when they really wanted Senator Heffernan to stay as shire president and he should have been allowed to stay in that role.
The priority of members of the Australian Local Government Association for 2003 is to improve the number of doctors in regional areas by extensive lobbying in both state and federal government areas. The role of local government has certainly changed, with state governments and at times federal governments putting more responsibility on local councils without providing them with the additional resources in order to cope with that. At the same time, we want to exclude them and preclude them from having any future in federal government. As I said before, that is a travesty of justice. 
My time as a councillor and as a deputy mayor served me well and provided me with fantastic grounding due to the issues that a local community raises. There is no government closer to the community, let me tell you, than local government, and there is no harder form of government. I was asked by schoolchildren, `Which is the harder: being a federal politician and the member for Riverina or being the Deputy Mayor of Wagga Wagga City Council?' Without doubt and without equivocation I responded that it is much harder to be the Deputy Mayor of Wagga Wagga City Council than it is to be the member for Riverina, because local government is closest to the people and certainly has greater knowledge and aspect of community ill feeling and concern. My time in local government certainly gave me the confidence to chair meetings, to raise issues of public importance and to get the courage to lobby state governments on community issues. It led me to decide that the voices of rural and regional people were clearly not being heard in the state and federal scenes at the time. I decided that I would like to try and put my voice at a federal level in order to bring better benefits for the people of Riverina, the community in which I live, work and want to continue to live.
I served as a councillor on Wagga Wagga City Council from 1991 and as deputy mayor from 1995 prior to entering federal parliament in 1998. Not only did it provide me with invaluable experience and a wealth of knowledge to call on; it also provided me with many opportunities to learn more about my community and how best to represent their issues of concern. Invaluable contacts and lifelong friendships and associations can be yet another positive of service to local government.
To force a councillor to resign if they choose to run as a candidate for a federal seat eliminates a brilliant pool of potential talent for the federal arena. That could be seen as a threat to some people in the House, but it should not be seen as such. It should be of appeal that communities want better qualified people with hands-on experience to represent them in this House. This amendment by the Queensland government serves to disadvantage the very communities we are elected to represent. It can cause an expensive by-election, as I have indicated. If unsuccessful as a candidate, not only has a community lost the representative on a federal level, they have also lost the talents of a great local councillor. That talent is then lost, perhaps forever, to the community. Most people, if they have caused a by-election, would feel that they could hardly stand for re-election in the future because it is simply not right, so that talent would be lost to that local community.
The intimate knowledge of a community that is gained while serving in local government is, as I have suggested, critical. It allows a representative to understand the many issues associated with a community. During my time in local government I learnt much about my local community. That is what has seen me strive forward against adversity at times in this House and has given me the ability and the courage of conviction to stand and represent my community in the federal arena. If you have the courage of conviction to stand and represent your community against the neighbour to whom you have to live next door for the rest of your life, then you certainly have the courage of conviction to stand in this House with people who are not your neighbours and who, on leaving this House, you perhaps will never see again. Serving at the local government level does give you strong courage of conviction and strength of character in order to represent your community. 
I am a strong advocate of the need for candidates to be across many issues before they enter parliament. There are no better representatives than the grassroots representatives that enter parliament. In my electorate of Riverina the issues are varied, as they are in many electorates. Concerns include jobs, drought, global trade markets, water, the environment, roads, the citrus and rice industries, free trade, vesting industries, development of tourism, telecommunications and much more. Local councillors are intimately involved in all of these things. My time spent on council, as I said, gave me the most enormous benefit and background. When I started in this House I was able to start at a running pace rather than spending four or five years learning. I had already done that and I was prepared to stand and be counted.
Many good members of this House have previously served in local government. They make an enormous contribution and are seen to be outstanding. The Speaker of the House, Neil Andrew, served as a councillor. The Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, served as a councillor and as Deputy Mayor of Greater Taree City Council. The Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Warren Truss, was a very active member of Kingaroy Shire Council from early 1976. He was certainly in district local government and was a president of a district local government association as well. The former minister for regional services, Wilson Tuckey, was a councillor in Carnarvon and certainly has made a colourful contribution to this House. Senator Ian Macdonald has served as a councillor, Senator Stephen Conroy has served as a councillor, the member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, was a councillor on Liverpool City Council and mayor from 1991 to 1994, prior to entering this parliament. I really wonder if he would have liked to have been excluded from being able to stand in this House. The member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson, served as a councillor of Coburg. The member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor, was a member of Colac City Council. The member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, served on Cessnock City Council and also served as a deputy mayor of Cessnock. All of these people, being here now, might be keen to change the rule of law. I think they would have a far different feeling if they were standing for the first time and were going to be excluded from serving the community that they were obviously passionate about. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (MEMBERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—I would like to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2002 today because I have an abiding interest in its content, as I am sure have many other members of this House, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie. It is understood, given the current state of both houses of this parliament, that there are 20 members on this side of the parliament that have had some background experience in local government. I understand that 16 are in the Liberal Party and four are in the National Party. So there is a vast array of local government experience amongst representatives of both houses of this parliament.
Before I go into the specific details of this bill, I would like to outline the reason why this amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act has been brought into the House. It has come about as a result of an amendment to a section of the Queensland Local Government Act 1993:
224A Councillor ceases to be councillor on becoming candidate for an Australian Parliament
The reason that this needs to be clarified is that we do not necessarily want states and territories dictating to the Commonwealth who can be candidates for federal parliament. As we have already heard from the member for Hume, there is an ability for this state legislation to be somewhat discriminatory in terms of members being entitled to sit in federal parliament, yet the same principles do not seem to apply at a state level. This legislation is necessary because it helps clarify the law in this situation. Should this ever be taken to higher courts on challenge, at least the Commonwealth has done its job by outlining and amending the law so that it clarifies it before the courts so that we will not see the courts using some form of creativity in their own interpretation of what the act states and putting their own spin on it. We want to tell the courts how to interpret the law, rather than the courts telling the federal government how it should enact the law. This is what this bill purports to do, and I am very pleased that it is before the House today. 
What I do not know is whether the opposition supports this. That would probably make a fair difference as to how we address it. What we do know is that the minor parties have an interest in this legislation. In 1998 Senator Bob Brown introduced the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill 1998. In his second reading speech, he remarked on the restrictions caused by `office of profit' and said:
This situation is discriminatory, and it deprives the federal parliament of a huge pool of talented potential politicians, including every public servant. At every recent election it has caused trouble and expense as someone unwittingly falls foul of the constitution.
From that we may assume, hopefully correctly, that the Greens in the Senate support this bill. We also understand that the only senator that has local government experience outside the major parties is Senator Lyn Allison of the Democrats. It would be interesting to know her views; I do not. So I hope the passage of this bill will be seamless, but its contents will certainly be seen as an amendment that is required.
The Queensland legislation sought to disqualify any sitting local government member upon nomination. `Upon nomination' is a critical point, because the pitfall of that is that if somebody has not resigned from their local government authority upon nomination then they fall foul of section 44 in part IV of the Constitution. As a result, their position could be challenged. As it currently stands—and I will give my and others' experience on this, and I believe it is also the experience of your honourable self, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie—the legal advice is generally clear on this matter: if you are a local government member, you may face a challenge to your validity to be a member because you have contravened section 44, because it may well be seen that you have benefited under the terms of the Constitution in an office of profit under the Crown. Interestingly, some local government authorities, particularly in the past, have never paid their councillors. For example, a former member for Griffith, Mr Graeme McDougall, who was a member of Brisbane City Council, told me that on coming to this parliament his salary on Brisbane City Council was very similar to that of a federal member of parliament's—so they pay their councillors very well in Queensland. However, my experience in Western Australia as a member of Belmont City Council, for example, was that we were paid very little or nothing at all. We had some phone charges paid and some cards printed and a few other little matters provided. But that has gradually changed and we now see that councillors in Western Australia receive sitting fees and greater reimbursements for such things as mobile phones and laptop computers. 
But even before there was any financial element present for some of the other states, the fact that the state government had divested to it from the federal government the control and management of local government in their states meant that the local government minister of any state could actually sack a councillor—or a council, as it seems. It appeared that there was a sort of master-servant relationship in the state government's authority over the local government body and, as a result, that again brought to attention section 44 of the Constitution, which later I will address further because it is still a sticking point.
The provisions passed by the Queensland government, which provided that councillors upon nomination had to stand aside or vacate their positions, eventually brought the Local Government Association of Queensland to express a great deal of unhappiness about the new law, believing it unfairly discriminated against local councillors. In the Queensland Supreme Court they successfully challenged the provision relating to federal candidacy after having the case remitted down from the High Court. The Commonwealth government intervened in the case, arguing that the Queensland provision was invalid. The Supreme Court agreed and it unanimously—I repeat, unanimously—held that this was because it was inconsistent with sections 163, 164 and 327(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The majority also held that the state parliament did not have the legislative power to enact such a law.
That is good—that has dealt with the Queensland situation—but any other state or territory in Australia could enact similar legislation which would require expensive challenges and eventually end up in the High Court if the Supreme Court decision is not taken as held. However, despite the successes of having the law struck down, the Commonwealth does remain concerned over the control of qualification for and disqualification from federal office. This was because, firstly, the Queensland Supreme Court decision does not affect any other state or territory and, secondly, the reasons for the Queensland Supreme Court judgment have been called into question—there is a fair bit of dialogue on the decision and ultimately it could end up in the highest court in the land.
The member for Hume listed a number of members of this House and of the Senate who have been local government councillors, and I will add another. Previous minister for workplace relations and Leader of the House Peter Reith was a councillor in his local area before entering federal politics. I have already mentioned Graeme McDougall from Queensland, but in Western Australia there are a large number of people at both the state and federal levels who have given service to local government. For example, at the state government level—as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie—people like Michelle Roberts, who was a Perth City councillor, is now a minister with the state government in Western Australia. Alannah McTiernan is in the same position: she was a local government member and is now a minister in the government of Western Australia. We know that previous local government minister for Western Australia Paul Omodei was also a councillor.
So, particularly in my state, generally the history is that people who serve on local government ascend to state government office rather than federal government office. But we know in this House that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, and I were both councillors: I was with the City of Belmont; you were with the City of South Perth. It has already been mentioned that Wilson Tuckey was a councillor for the town of Carnarvon and that Senator Alan Eggleston, who is currently in the federal Senate, was the mayor of Port Hedland. We could go further and mention the raft of people who have served in this capacity. 
The problem is that, when you nominate for federal election, you are in a very grey area, as I have already stated. Do you resign on nomination or do you resign once the election is called? Again, that is subject to legal opinion. Before I ran for the 1996 election I received two pieces of legal opinion from the Liberal Party which stated that two eminent QCs had suggested that it was inadvisable to remain a councillor, and I had to resign from Belmont City Council. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, also had to resign from the South Perth Council because you were concerned about the same issue. We know that Senator Eggleston did the same thing and resigned from the Port Hedland City Council because he was concerned about the legal advice that suggested he might be challenged at some time, perhaps later.
The problem with the legislation as it stands is that it is not certain. It places you in a position where your candidacy could be called to question. But the problem also—and this is what this amendment addresses—is that, while we have been talking about people who have been successful in this House and in the Senate, how about the person who nominates for federal preselection and does not win? They have to resign from the council and this leaves a vacancy in the council ranks. Quite often, depending on the timing of it, there is a local by-election—which, as has been mentioned by other members, causes a great deal of expense to the ratepayers of that area as well as some uncertainty—and it seems as if you are abrogating your responsibility or is seen as deserting the ratepayers who elected you in the first place. That certainly causes a problem.
Another problem is one that affected a councillor of whom you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie. Andrew Murfin, who was a councillor with the City of Perth and then with the City of Belmont, had some view that he would run for federal office and so resigned from the Belmont City Council with that in mind. After being elected in the previous May's council elections he knew it would cause some grief that, as he was still a councillor, his nomination for federal parliament would cause a by-election. That in itself is an issue that suggests we should support this legislation.
I want to go back to section 44 of the Constitution. It says:
Any person who—
	...	...	...
Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth ...
What this legislation does not do—and this is an important point—is that it does not, naturally, amend the Constitution and it does not clarify the situation in relation to section 44 of the Constitution. It does not do that because the only way you can alter the Constitution is by referendum. In the previous parliament I was, as the member for Swan, a member of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We studied section 44 of the Constitution and looked at both office of profit and the ability for non-Australians to stand for federal parliament. We made a number of recommendations, and a number of those have been adopted. But the problem is that, unless there is a referendum to amend the Constitution, there can be no certainty in either of these cases.
As a result, this deals with states and activist courts, but it does not deal with the uncertainty of the Constitution. It must be made very clear that, on realising that they are going to be a candidate for federal parliament, a councillor in local government who has any concerns about section 44 of the Constitution and the office of profit would be well advised to stand aside; they would eventually have to stand aside in any case. This legislation, versus the Queensland legislation, allows them to continue to be a councillor until the election is imminent or has been called, and nomination does not disqualify them. That really puts them in a similar position to candidates at a state level. For example, if a person wishes to run for state parliament, they do not necessarily have to resign from the council; they can stand aside. For example, a schoolteacher in Western Australia would not have to resign his job because he is working for the state government; he could stand aside until the election has been held and he has found out whether he has won or lost. At the federal level, because of the constitutional provisions, it is very advisable that, ultimately, anyone who believes they have a chance of winning a seat in this House or the Senate resign from the council they are on. 
This bill does not address the problems of somebody who is nominated to fill, for example, a casual Senate vacancy. It does not have the provisions and times of nomination and does not say when to stand aside. That is possibly one of the flaws of this amendment and it could be addressed. However, the bill has opened up a large number of questions. It allows and encourages people who wish to stand for this great institution, which we are honoured to represent, to do so with a great deal more certainty. As I have already said, it cuts out the ability of the states to manipulate the system and, ultimately, encourages a greater talent pool to stand for the highest office in this country, which I am sure many people would like to do.
In conclusion, I support the bill. I think it is a necessary bill. It is a bill that was to be introduced before the proroguing of the previous parliament. A draft of it was before the Senate at that stage. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Prevention of Discrimination Against Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2001 was not presented. It was printed, but it was not presented and read, so it did not go any further. This bill addresses that. It is a timely bill and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (MEMBERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—At the outset, I would like to thank those members who have participated in this important debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Members of Local Government Bodies) Bill 2002 for their respective contributions. I believe the Australian people would be greatly heartened by the fact that members on both sides of the House have strongly supported this bill, which does, in effect, assert the right of the federal government and the federal parliament to determine those who stand for Commonwealth electoral office.
This bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to ensure that members of a local government body do not suffer any penalty arising from their decision to stand as a candidate for election to either the Senate or the House of Representatives. The amendment is necessary following the enactment of section 224A(b) of the Queensland Local Government Act 1993, which purported to declare vacant the office of a local councillor at the point of his or her nomination as a candidate in a federal election. This really is a quite bizarre situation. It is one thing for any state parliament to legislate with respect to the eligibility and qualifications of candidates for state electoral office, but I think most Australians believe that the Commonwealth parliament, and not state parliaments, ought to set the rules and regulations for those people who are able to stand for election to the Commonwealth parliament. 
The Queensland Court of Appeal ruled in November 2001 that section 224A(b) was beyond the legislative competence of the Queensland parliament. It is reassuring to see that the Queensland Court of Appeal has taken an approach in interpreting the law which is consistent with what most Australians would want to see. Some people might ask why this amendment is necessary, given the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. The clear response to that is that this amendment is necessary to reinforce the authority of the Commonwealth to legislate exhaustively, subject of course to the Australian Constitution, on qualifications for election to the Commonwealth parliament.
Some of the speakers in this debate spoke very strongly with respect to the right of the Commonwealth parliament to make the appropriate decisions in relation to these matters. It was interesting that the member for Banks pointed out that 19 per cent of the members of the House of Representatives and the other place have local government experience. The government was particularly pleased when the member for Banks announced that the opposition supported the bill. As the member for Banks is undoubtedly correct, it is for the Commonwealth to set the rules for election to the parliament. We welcome the comments made by the member for Banks and the opposition's support. Local government is an important training ground for politicians at other levels, and there should not be any impediments—certainly not impediments imposed by state legislature—to their standing for election.
The member for Blair pointed out, quite correctly, that it was shameful for the Queensland government to penalise councillors seeking election. He praised the work done by local councils and mayors in his electorate. Much of his electorate used to be in the electorate of Fisher and I know there is wonderful work carried out by those local authorities and the people elected to serve on them. In my own electorate, on the Sunshine Coast, we have got the Caloundra City Council and the Maroochy Shire Council, and I value the strong working relationship that I have with councillors on both of those councils. I suspect that members right around the chamber, regardless of political affiliation, would agree with the sentiments that I express, insofar as, generally speaking, they would have good relationships with local authorities.
I am very pleased to be able to add my endorsement to the praise given by the member for Blair to the hard work done by local councils. Participation in federal politics by local councillors ought to be fostered and encouraged and not penalised. I suspect that the Queensland government are really looking at their own electoral prospects and, probably perceiving that a large number of candidates standing for the Liberal Party and The Nationals would come out of local government, feel that if they are able to shut these quite desirable and able candidates out of the electoral field it will make it easier for their own members to be elected. But above and beyond the question of party politics is the important issue—namely, that the Commonwealth parliament and not state parliaments ought to determine eligibility for standing for the Commonwealth parliament.
The member for Riverina pointed out that local councillors are a valuable resource and she said that the Queensland law is discriminatory and politically motivated. She related the work done in her electorate by local councils. I think the member for Riverina herself came out of local government and she certainly is a very able member of this place. The member for Went-worth, who was quite an erudite barrister in his earlier manifestation, discussed the Queensland Supreme Court judgment and pointed out the merits of local council experience for potential members of parliament. The member for Canning emphasised that 20 members of the parliament have local council experience and he said that it is not for state governments to dictate to the Commonwealth parliament who can be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate. In summing up, I can say that this is one of those happy pieces of legislation where everyone on both sides of the House agrees with the sentiments of it. I want to commend those members who have spoken and thank them for their support. I ask the House to pass the bill.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—The legislation before the parliament today is a rerun of legislation put to the parliament and rejected in the Senate some months ago. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]seeks to radically alter the existing arrangements in Australia with respect to media ownership laws. In particular it seeks to substantially water down the requirements limiting cross-media ownership in Australia and to eliminate the restrictions on foreign ownership of Australian media. We have had this debate before. These matters were debated at length in this House and in the Senate earlier in the year. The government is now putting what is in effect the same legislation to the parliament, with the aim of creating a double dissolution trigger by having the bill rejected again in the Senate in the same form in which it was rejected on the previous occasion on which it was debated.
The original bill that was put to the parliament, by the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, proposed to effectively remove all existing forms of regulation of cross-media ownership and foreign ownership of Australian media. It proposed to impose a safeguard regime of editorial separation and certificates associated with mergers or acquisitions in the media sphere, designed to ensure in theory that, although one owner might own two outlets, the outlets would continue to function separately and independently of each other and would more or less compete with each other and would certainly not run the same line or merge their activities.
The bill has been substantially changed and I will turn to those changes in a minute, but I wish to make some observations about the origins of the bill and the original content of the bill. Senator Alston, the then communications minister, was initially unable to obtain even his own party room support for his proposals and had particular difficulty obtaining support from The Nationals for his proposed abolition of cross-media ownership and foreign ownership rules. There were a number of stumbles in the process of eventually even getting the bill into the parliament and, in the wake of the parliamentary debate and committee consideration of the legislation, a number of amendments have been accepted by the government. Unfortunately, however, the government has decided both to persist with the bill and, extraordinarily, to persist with its editorial separation regime, which is the fig leaf that is provided within the bill to, in a sense, guarantee notional protection of diversity of media ownership and diversity of public debate in Australia in spite of the effect of the provisions of the bill. 
The editorial separation regime provides that the Australian Broadcasting Authority must issue a certificate where there is a merger or an acquisition involving media organisations that would otherwise be in breach of the cross-media ownership laws. Only upon the issue of such a certificate, which designates that there is an appropriate level of separation between the editorial activities of both organisations, do the cross-media ownership laws cease to have effect and the merger or acquisition is able to proceed. It is the kind of thing that looks vaguely plausible for about 30 seconds but, when you start to think about how media organisations actually operate and how the real world of business actually operates, it is clear that it is nothing but a fig leaf and would have no significant impact in protecting diversity of media ownership, diversity of public opinion and diversity of employment opportunities for Australian journalists.
In effect, we would have a public servant or a statutory body issuing certificates to media organisations after scrutinising their organisational arrangements—the way their editorial processes work, the flowcharts, the organisational charts, who is responsible for what, how news is gathered, how comment is analysed and put together and how material is broadcast or published in newspapers. All of these things would in theory be subject to a process of analysis and scrutiny by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Of course, this would be a one-off event and there is no adequate provision whatsoever for any return to the issue should there subsequently be a change to the arrangements. For example, when the Murdoch empire acquired the Herald and Weekly Times, it acquired two newspapers in Melbourne—the Herald and the Sun—and, of course, these two newspapers subsequently merged.
If something of that kind were to occur under the editorial separation regime, there is no effective way that a subsequent event can be dealt with after the editorial separation certificate has been issued, because you are dealing with commercial realities. You are dealing with businesses that have taken over other businesses—merged—and all their processes and activities have been merged together and a demerger would simply be unrealistic. So the system of editorial separation is purely a fig leaf designed to present a facade of regulatory involvement in order to protect the integrity of Australian public debate and the diversity of media ownership.
But not only is it ineffective and transparently a cosmetic exercise designed to assuage concern in the community about the excessive concentration of media ownership; it also contains within it the seeds of a very significant threat to the freedom of the press. The Australian Press Council is not renowned as a radical or interventionist body. In my view, it has a history of being a very cautious and conservative organisation. But early last year it felt sufficiently concerned about these proposals to write to the minister indicating that, in its view, the editorial separation regime in the cross-media ownership repeal laws that the government was seeking to put forward did, in fact, constitute a very severe threat to freedom of the press.
The reason for that is that, although the provisions regarding the issue of editorial separation certificates would inevitably be ineffective in guaranteeing genuine media diversity and genuine diversity of media ownership in Australia, they would provide a very useful mechanism for a future malevolent government seeking to harass or intimidate a particular media organisation that was critical of that government. It would open up the prospect of the government of the day, through a tame Australian Broadcasting Authority, deliberately hounding and harassing a particular media outlet or media organisation, using these mechanisms as a means to put pressure on that media organisation. 
These things might sound fanciful but if you look around the world at areas where media is under threat—where you have authoritarian governments that are interfering in the media or intimidating the media—methods of licensing are almost invariably the first things that governments that seek to intimidate or interfere in the freedom of the press choose to use in order to achieve their aims. So any regulatory device that provides an excuse or a mechanism for a government to interfere in the day-to-day running of a media organisation would provide that potential for a future government. I make no claim that the Howard government will seek to use the provisions in the bill in this regard. It is conceivable that it might, but I certainly make no accusation against the current government. None of us can see into the future and I believe that the Press Council is absolutely correct in rejecting these provisions as containing within them the seeds of a threat to the freedom of the media in the future.
As I indicated, the government has substantially amended the legislation since it was originally presented to this House some time ago. Initially, it was amended to provide that it is not permissible to own any more than two of the three types of media outlet—radio stations, television stations and newspapers—in the same market, whereas the original legislation allowed open slather; you could own all three if you so desired and if you obtained the editorial separation certificates. The government moved to amend the legislation to make it only two out of three in regional markets—from memory that was in about October last year. More recently, in the debate in the Senate, the government decided to amend it to only two out of three in all markets—metropolitan and regional.
This of course is a tacit and very powerful admission by the government that there is still a need for cross-media ownership regulation in this country. This is something that the minister was denying all the way through and it is something that all the arguments the government was putting were based on—namely, that the days of any need for cross-media ownership regulation had gone, that the market and the emerging technologies would deliver sufficient diversity and competition, and that what really mattered was diversity within media organisations not between them. That argument has been shot out of the water by the government's own action in conceding that it is still necessary and appropriate to regulate cross-media ownership in Australia and to prevent any one proprietor from owning all three forms of mainstream media—television, radio and newspapers—in the one market.
So there is a tacit admission by the government, in the amended form of legislation that is now back before the parliament, that there is a need for cross-media ownership regulation and that the editorial separation regime that was put in place in the legislation, and which is still there, is not sufficiently effective to ensure that genuine diversity of media ownership and diversity of public debate—public discourse—can be guaranteed in the way that the government originally argued.
The issue underneath all of this is the Senate amendment which the government ultimately rejected and which is the reason why the bill is back before this chamber today. One amendment, moved by Senator Harradine and supported by the minor party senators and the Labor Party, got to the very heart of this bill and to the very heart of the government's intentions. That amendment provided that ownership of a newspaper and a television station in the one market would continue to be prohibited. 
The two out of three provision that the government has backed away from does not preclude the ownership of a TV station and a newspaper in the one market but ownership of both of those and a radio station. It is entirely open for an existing newspaper or TV station proprietor to acquire the other form of media without breaching the government's proposals. Senator Harradine's amendment in contrast said directly that you are not allowed to own both a newspaper and a TV station. That got to the absolute heart of the issue and to the nub of why the government is pursuing this legislation. The bill that got through the Senate contained about three-quarters of the proposed deregulation and reform that the government was supporting, but the government still rejected the amendment. Why? The net effect of the bill that passed the Senate was to take radio out of cross-media ownership altogether—so anybody can own a radio station—to reduce the scope of the cross-media ownership laws dramatically to that newspaper and TV in one market parameter and to eliminate all restrictions on foreign ownership of Australian media. The bulk of the government's original reform package was accepted by the Senate but one crucial point was not: the capacity of a media proprietor to own both a newspaper and a television station in a metropolitan market.
Why did the government choose not to proceed with the bill when it got three-quarters of its agenda? Why did the government decide that the bill was no longer of any value? The answer is very simple: the key media proprietors, in particular PBL and News Ltd, have made it very plain that they would rather have no change than the bill that passed through the Senate; the bill does not suit their interests. Radio stations are of relatively minor significance to major media empires. They could conceivably acquire the odd radio network here and there perhaps, but the real issue is newspapers and television. Because the bill was amended in a form that precludes News Ltd from buying a TV network and PBL from buying a newspaper, particularly Fairfax, it is no longer of any interest to them.
The bill is a bit negative because it proposes to allow foreign competition. It proposes to expose organisations like PBL, which have been able to luxuriate in a nicely protected restricted local market, to foreign competition, so they do not like it. That message, no doubt, was conveyed to the government and Senator Alston. Lo and behold, the opportunity to get three-quarters of the government's reform agenda to get substantial deregulation and liberalisation of our media ownership rules through was abandoned by the government. Their real agenda and real reasons for putting this legislation to the parliament in the first place were completely exposed.
This debate is ultimately all about something that is of fundamental importance for all Australians. Not everybody is excited about the debate; not everybody is interested in it. It does not figure.
—I am excited.
—The member for Lowe is definitely excited about the debate—there is no argument about that. There are many Australians who are barely aware that the debate is occurring. But it is of fundamental importance to them, because the health of our democracy depends on diversity of media ownership, on there being a diversity of voices in public debate and on there being a good range of different forms of media and different players in the media market who are competing vigorously and who are owned by different organisations and different people. That is fundamental to the health of any genuine democracy. 
We have a highly concentrated media industry in this country. There are about half-a-dozen major players in the commercial media in Australia—realistically, only five. If this bill proceeds and is passed it will allow five or six media organisations to shrink to three. Three giant media organisations, courtesy of the merging of the various interests that will flow from the abolition of these regulations, will completely dominate our commercial media, airwaves, newsprint and public debate. We will have a very small number of gatekeepers in the process of public debate in this country. If this bill passes it will have a profoundly negative impact on Australian democracy.
If you have a particular cause, issue or point of view that you as a citizen or an interest group wish to pursue in our community to influence public opinion or change government policy, it is almost impossible to do that without significant exposure in the media. There are only a very small number of choices. There are only a very small number of organisations that control our media and a very small number of media organisations that employ journalists. This bill will severely restrict not only the options for people seeking to get a point of view across to the Australian community but also the employment alternatives for Australian journalists.
The government responds by arguing that we are entering into a new world in media. We are seeing the proliferation of a vast variety of new forms of media: the Internet and digitisation—all sorts of things are occurring. In a narrow sense, that is correct. We are seeing the very early stages of major change in how we communicate with each other, particularly on a mass audience basis. But we are at a very early stage of this process and there is no question that today, and for the short-to medium-term future, the old traditional media and the players in that media continue to dominate overwhelmingly. Although there are web sites and other mechanisms of communication emerging, they are very tiny, on the fringes and have very minor impact in public debate and very limited influence now and for the likely short- to medium-term future.
—Don't you read Crikey?
—Why don't you try to cite two other examples? Yes, I do occasionally read Crikey and I am one of probably 0.1 percent of the Australian population that does. The established media—newspapers, television and radio—still totally dominate our media and the process of public opinion formation. But, more importantly, the Howard government that in this debate is saying that a thousand flowers are blooming and we have all this new media digitisation and Internet is the same government that put in place a ramshackle, antiquated regime governing the introduction of digital television. This is profoundly hobbling, shackling and retarding the development of digital television in Australia so that it is a very slow and painful process that is going nowhere fast.
It is the same government that has been asleep at the wheel on broadband and has overseen a situation where Australia is now 19th in the developed world in access to broadband—we are way behind comparable countries like Canada and the United States. So, on the one hand, the Howard government is saying that we can get rid of the rules about media ownership because there are all these new media mechanisms emerging but, on the other hand, we are falling behind the rest of the world because of the Howard government's inability to encourage and foster and enable these new forms of media to flourish. 
It is ironic that the Howard government puts forward the view that the brave new world is upon us in one debate while, at the same time, it is proposing to hand over to the United States all effective control of our capacity to regulate local content in our media; effectively saying to people, `Don't worry; we'll still have our local content rules.' On the one hand in this debate the Howard government is essentially saying: `Look, TV's old hat. Don't worry; Kerry Packer's days are numbered. His enormous power and influence in public debates is going to disappear; there are all these new media.' But on the other hand, in the debate about the free trade agreement negotiations with the United States and local content rules, the Howard government is effectively saying to people, `Look, it doesn't matter if we sign away our right to regulate local content in new forms of media to the United States. It doesn't matter if we abandon any future capacity to regulate local content in new forms of media because we'll still have the local content rules on free-to-air television.' Both of those pictures cannot be accurate.
The real story is that we are going to see very substantial change, but it will take some time to emerge. But what the Howard government is proposing to do with the local content rules is to give up forever our capacity to regulate. What it is proposing to do with cross-media ownership rules is abandon an existing regime of regulation on the basis of a speculative assessment about where the future lies for media in this country and where public opinion formation is going to occur.
There are various other amendments included in the new version of the bill which are essentially a direct reflection of amendments that were agreed to by the government during the course of the bill's discussion in the Senate. Most of these do not really make much fundamental difference to the bill. They include, for example, obligations on media companies which hold a cross-media exception to disclose that holding in certain circumstances; prohibition on certain restrictive contracts which would prevent a particular program format being adopted by a commercial broadcasting outlet after it has been sold; an amendment which requires a minimum of four separately owned media groups to exist in regional Australia and five in capital cities; and various other amendments which ultimately are not, in most cases, particularly objectionable but really do not get to the essence of this bill.
The bill has been re-introduced in the form that was approved by the House but ultimately rejected by the Senate to ensure that it stands as a potential double dissolution trigger should it again be rejected by the Senate. As a result of adding all of these amendments, it is now something of a dog's breakfast and it has lost the clarity and simplicity that it had, without losing the malevolent element of substantially diminishing the diversity of media ownership in this country and substantially undermining the health and strength of our democratic system as a result.
Finally I will make some observations on the other aspect of the bill which has attracted a good deal less debate and comment than the cross-media ownership laws—that is, the proposal to remove restrictions on foreign ownership. Labor is broadly supportive of the government's aim in this regard. We believe that it is appropriate to allow full competition from foreign investors in the media but that there is a need for some safeguards. Unfortunately, the government has failed even to pick up on some of these issues where safeguards are required. 
What particularly concerns us most is to ensure that, no matter who owns an Australian media outlet, the activity that is inherent in the production and dissemination of media occurs in Australia. We have no problem with CanWest effectively owning Channel 10. They have done a good job; Channel 10 has thrived in recent years. What we do want to make sure of is that Channel 10 is still, in effect, an Australian media outlet—that it is not just being run out of some international city and essentially being streamed to Australia and repeated. We want to make sure that the staff—the journalists, the technical and camera people, and the staff who produce and run things—are Australian, that they do their work in Australia and that we have a serious media industry. Technology is increasingly opening up the possibility for parts of media production activities to occur in the market where it is being disseminated. So, although we are supportive of the idea of getting rid of the foreign media ownership restrictions, we believe that there is a need for some safeguards to ensure that the jobs, skills and other activities that are involved in media remain in Australia—precisely as has happened in the Channel 10 situation. We are disappointed that the government has failed to include some provisions along those lines.
We also believe that it is entirely appropriate to remove the current restriction on new foreign owned newspapers being established in Australia. That can be done with a sweep of the Treasurer's pen. There is no legislative restriction on that. There is nothing to stop the New York Times, for example, setting up an Australian newspaper to compete with the Advertiser in Adelaide. The only thing that stops it happening is the Treasurer's guidelines connected with the way the Foreign Investment Review Board conducts its business—and the Treasurer makes decisions based on those recommendations.
We are quite happy with the relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions. More competition, new entrants and greater diversity would almost inevitably flow from that. For that reason, we do not, in a broad sense, reject that part of the bill, but we do believe that the government has gone about it in the wrong way. It has taken an open slather approach when a slightly more cautious approach would have been entirely appropriate. We do not mind if there is an increase in foreign ownership in our media, provided that the jobs, the activity, the content and the skills remain Australian. I do not believe that any Australian would be critical of CanWest's stewardship of Channel 10, and I think that stands as a good illustration that what matters is where the work occurs, where the activity occurs, where the output occurs and who does it. Provided that is Australian, I do not believe that it is a problem if it is owned by a foreign investor. But, unfortunately, the government has not even been able to manage to get that right in the legislation.
In conclusion, Labor again reject this legislation. We again emphatically oppose the government's attempt to unwind the protection of media diversity in this country. The media landscape is changing—that is without question—and there will come a time when there will be a need to reconsider how we regulate our media. There is no doubt about that. But, while it has its antiquated digital TV regime that restricts new competition, while broadband is languishing, while the traditional media still completely dominate our process of public opinion formation and public debate, there is no question that now is not the time to be reconsidering these matters. The government is simply seeking to do the bidding of the major media moguls to enable them to increase their power, their concentration of ownership and their dominance in public debate at the expense of other voices. That is unacceptable. It is a serious threat to the health of our democracy. It is a serious threat to the functioning of our democratic system. Diversity of media ownership and diversity of voice in public debate are fundamental to the health of our democracy. Labor will continue to stand absolutely firm and solid in support of that principle. ",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This is an important bill because it heralds, for the first time in a significant period, an opportunity for the Australian media marketplace to be brought up to date. In many respects, the world we live in today is changing rapidly. I know it and the people in my constituency on the Gold Coast know it. It is common knowledge across Australia that the world and the pace of change are accelerating from day to day; yet we have just heard from the shadow minister for communications a lecture about the way in which, in some way, the regulatory framework that applies to media should remain the same as it has been for the past 10, 15 or 20 years.
If government is to do its job effectively—if the government is to ensure that the regulatory framework that applies in a rapidly changing environment is a regulatory framework that continues to encourage investment, provide incentives for new capital ventures and provide adequate safeguards, taking into account new mediums—then we need to ensure that our regulatory framework, not only for media but more broadly, is reflective of current conditions. In this vein, the changes proposed to the media ownership structure in the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] are thoughtful, considered and comprehensive.
We heard the shadow minister speak at length about how this bill, if it is passed, will be the beginning of the end for not only the Australian media sector but also Australian democracy as we know it. I was a little concerned, hearing his comments, that he would go to such extraordinary lengths to try to promote or raise fear in the Australian community about what the consequences of this bill will be. The reality is that the consequences, as they have been put forward by the shadow minister, are far wide of the mark. This bill seeks to recognise the fact that in Australia today and indeed throughout the world there are a plethora of new mediums—for example, the Internet, digital television, digital radio and analog systems—becoming available on almost, it seems at times, a daily basis.
I heard the shadow minister speak about how, if people in this day and age want to be opinion makers, they have to rely on the mainstream media. I disagree completely. Certainly that continues to be a way in which a traditional path is used to influence opinion, but the fact is that it is easier today than it has ever been at any point in history to influence public opinion through the technologies that are now available. We see examples of this on a daily basis. By way of analogy I would highlight what is often referred to as a growing problem, whereby several hundred teenagers will congregate and go to a party or something like that. I admit that that is on a small scale, but that sort of mass communication does not exist because of newspapers, skywriting or something like that; it happens because there is an increasing use of new technology. I use that analogy to show that, in this day and age, there are opportunities to use technologies to influence public opinion in ways that never existed previously—and that is just one example. 
Australians will always rely on the traditional major forms of commercial media, be they television, radio or newspapers. But increasingly we are turning to other forms of media, such as the Internet, and to other outside mainstream sources of media. I highlighted the crikey.com site which people are turning to as an alternative source of media. At the crikey.com site there are many examples of things happening in politics, things for which people traditionally always turned to the major papers or to the news on radio and television. This is no longer the case. While the shadow minister may believe that only two or three people happen to look at crikey.com, I think quite to the contrary. I know that those with an interest in politics—be they journalists or people in the general public—often turn to a source such as crikey.com to obtain information on politics. It highlights the way in which people's views are changing and that people now are more willing to turn to a variety of sources to make an informed opinion.
Contrary to the shadow minister's assertion, I do not believe that Australians form their views by what they see, hear and read alone—by reading newspapers, watching TV and listening to the radio. Australians are quite an intelligent group and like to make informed decisions based on all the available sources.
This bill ensures that we promote opportunities for new investment in these technologies. There have been many instances in the past where, as a result of our regulatory framework, there has been a level of disinterest in investment. It has been a deterrent to new capital investment in technology and investment by overseas operators in the Australian media marketplace. The ALP pretends to be concerned about media diversity. The most important aspect of this bill is the removal of foreign ownership restrictions, which will result in a situation whereby we can actively promote media diversity by allowing outside operators—those external to Australia—to buy into the Australian marketplace so that Australians are exposed to an increased number of media sources.
It comes down to the fact—and this has been referred to by the shadow minister—that there is a concentration of media ownership in the hands of only a few players in Australia. If this bill is passed, the removal of the foreign ownership restrictions will provide an opportunity to ensure that in the future there is appropriate scope for foreign operators to come into the Australian market. That will start to water down the concentration of media ownership in the hands of a couple of people and a couple of companies. As a consequence of this bill we address one of the primary things that the ALP said they were specifically concerned about.
What we will do is create a greater diversity of sources, more opportunities for Australians to hear a variety of voices and more opportunities for Australians to have a variety of sources within their own specific town or city. No longer will there be a stranglehold of two or three media proprietors; it will be able to be opened up to a variety of media proprietors. They have said in the past that our foreign restrictions and our regulatory regime were a disincentive to come into this country. This bill is good news for all Australians because it means that foreign operators who want to come into Australia will have the opportunity to do so.
The ALP has raised concerns about the removal of cross-media ownership restrictions. Let us turn to that and look closely at exactly what is being proposed. The government went to the last election highlighting our commitment to reforming not only the foreign ownership which I have spoken about but also the cross-media restrictions. We were elected—I know this pains the ALP—on the basis not only of this policy but of a variety of policies. This bill fulfils yet another Howard government election commitment. This bill also signals that this government is prepared to take on board constructive criticism from the opposition. I heard the shadow minister talking about how the government was to be chastised because it took on board not only comments from the Senate but also some of the recommendations of the Senate inquiry looking at the bill and have incorporated them into the bill. I am pleased and proud of the fact that we have listened to those comments and incorporated them into the bill to make it a better bill. The new framework that will apply should the bill be passed will not be 100 per cent what the government sought but will reflect what we believe to be the legitimate concerns that were put forward by opposition members. 
As I mentioned, there are a number of regulations that apply with respect to foreign and cross-media ownership. This bill will remove a number of those restrictions, repeal restrictions that have meant that there have not been opportunities to have access to capital, increase the pool of potential media operators and act as a safeguard on media concentration. The proposed changes will not affect the existing limits that are contained within the Broadcasting Services Act with respect to audience reach and the maximum numbers of commercial broadcasting licences that can be controlled in the same licence area. In addition to that, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will play an important role in determining whether or not a merger is anticompetitive. I want to really stress this point: historically, media regulation in this country has been put to the side of the general principles of merger control that exist in this country—for example, the Trade Practices Act.
The government is seeking to look forward and to recognise that with technological change the antiquated regulations that exist in this country will no longer remain up to date. It wants to remove the media specific rules and say that what will apply will be the general rules that apply to mergers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—as well as the ABA—will play an important role in this regard. This bill will authorise the ABA to grant cross-media exemption certificates upon application. The ABA will need to maintain a register of exemption certificates which have been issued and which are active. This is to be publicly available.
Media proprietors who are holders of exemption certificates will not be in breach of cross-media rules in relation to the media entities which they control provided that the conditions of the certificates are satisfied, that they satisfy the separately controlled newspaper test and that an unacceptable three-way control situation does not exist. That ties in with specific concerns raised by the Senate committee about a situation arising whereby, in theory, a proprietor might own all three forms of media—that is, TV, newspaper and radio. Linking control of more than one associated newspaper to continuing exemption from the cross-media rules will ensure that a cross-media exemption certificate holder will not over time be able to control both or all of the newspapers in a licence area. Certificates will become active when a person assumes control of two media entities in a way that would otherwise have breached the cross-media rules. This will ensure that there is diversity of opinion, as I spoke about with regard to foreign ownership. 
As a government we recognise the need to ensure that media owners do not exploit their co-ownership of media organisations in a way that would prevent those organisations from exercising separate editorial judgments. Because of this concern, this bill provides for a transparent and effective test to ensure that there is separate editorial decision making and that cross-controlled media organisations have separate decision-making processes. An exemption certificate can be issued only if the ABA is satisfied that the conditions included in the application will meet the objective of editorial separation for the media operations concerned. This objective is that separate editorial decision-making responsibilities must be maintained with regard to each of the media operations. 
There are three mandatory tests which safeguard against this, and they are all contained within the legislation. These tests help to promote that culture of diversity and ensure that adequate safeguards and protections are afforded to the Australian people so that we can continue to attract new investment without our regulatory regime being a deterrent. The three tests are: that there be separate editorial policies; that there be separate editorial news management, news compilation processes and news-gathering and interpretation capabilities; and that there be appropriate organisational charts to reflect the fact that there is a separation between the various aspects of the editorial policy.
This bill is an important first step to fulfilling this government's promise to the Australian people to institute a forward-looking approach to the regulation of media. It is a bill that is not exactly what the government wanted, but it appropriately takes into account concerns that have been raised in the Senate. We have incorporated those, and we have ensured that, should this bill be passed, the Australian people will have access to a greater diversity of sources of media. The Australian people will have in place appropriate safeguards when it comes to editorial policy. In addition to that, our regulatory regime will no longer be a deterrent to investment in new media. In a new world that incorporates various limbs of technology, it is important that the regulatory framework keeps pace.
The ALP does not put forward a position that provides a regulatory framework that keeps pace with technological change. They are hamstrung and anchored to the traditional cross-media ownership and foreign ownership rules. This bill will ensure that those traditional rules are set aside so that the framework that will provide adequate safeguards for the Australian people into the future is also one that promotes diversity and investment.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I cannot get to the dispatch box fast enough. With great respect to the new member for Moncrieff, we have just listened to a monumental triumph for sophistry in toeing the government line on what this legislation is all about. I hope that the member for Moncrieff stays here instead of leaving the chamber, because I would like to respond to some of the things he said. Basically, his contribution to this very serious debate, which is crucial to the public interest and crucial to the future of our democracy, seemed to focus on the response by the shadow minister for communications, my colleague Lindsay Tanner. 
The member for Moncrieff claimed that the Labor Party pretend that we believe in media diversity. The fact is we do believe in media diversity. Tomorrow the member for Moncrieff, like many other Australians, will open up a newspaper or listen to a radio, and tomorrow night he will watch a free-to-air news broadcast. That, in the main, is where people get their news and information, and that is what affects the way they think and ultimately the way they vote. That is how serious it is. The media is crucial to a democracy. The member for Moncrieff knows it; the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts knows it; and the Prime Minister definitely knows it. The bill before us today is potentially a double dissolution trigger. It is a very serious piece of legislation. I had to sit here and listen to the new minister for communications on 5 November—when he introduced this bill and made his second reading speech—make reference to all this New-Age media, with no reference whatsoever to what the real agenda of this bill is. 
At the last election, Senator Alston claimed that he went to the people of Australia explaining that he would reform Australia's media laws. He loved to refer to our media laws as being in the Stone Age. But do you think that Senator Alston, the Prime Minister, or any member of the government frontbench explained what the real agenda of this bill was? Do you think that the Australian people were informed that this is all about freeing up the traditional media—the old media? As I have just said, it is monumental sophistry to keep talking about this New-Age media. Yes, people are using New-Age media. Yes, people are looking at the Internet and they are getting their news and information from other sources, but overwhelmingly at this time in Australia, and indeed the world, people are relying on radio stations, they are relying on newspapers, and they are relying on free-to-air television to get their news and information. That is critical.
I take great pride in rising to strongly oppose the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. In a debate that would be funny if it were not such a tragedy, the Prime Minister; the current minister for communications, the member for Tangney; his predecessor, Senator Alston; and every member of the government has run the preposterous line that this bill is about modernising Australia's media and untying the legislative straightjacket. It is not. This bill is all about giving Mr Packer what he has always dreamed of—that is, Fairfax—and giving Mr Murdoch and his companies a television network in Australia.
I will be the last person standing in this House fighting that, and I will fight it all the way up to the next election. That is not because I have anything against Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch. I got off the topic when I experienced an interjection in another debate yesterday, and I made it quite plain that both Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch have made a contribution to this country. But I am concerned about the consequences of this bill. If the government had shown some honesty and embraced the Harradine amendment that went to the Senate in June, there would have been changes to media laws and there would have been competition. The member for Moncrieff talked about the legislation allowing more competition. If the member for Moncrieff is so keen to allow further competition, why won't he, the minister, the Prime Minister and the government change our foreign media ownership laws so that we can provide some real competition to Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch? That would be in the public interest. That would be good for democracy.
The Howard government claims that, because many Australians access the Internet or have pay television in their homes, it is safe or desirable to allow one or two media moguls to buy up television stations, radio stations and newspapers in the same area. That deliberately ignores two fundamental points obvious to anyone who believes media diversity is important and should be protected. As I said, a vast majority of Australians rely on old media—a newspaper, a free-to-air television program or a radio news bulletin—for their information. Most news or information web sites Australians visit, such as ninemsn or Fairfax, are owned and controlled by the old media players. This also applies to Foxtel, which is 50 per cent owned by Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer; Telstra owns the rest. 
As I said, this is not an attack on Mr Packer or Mr Murdoch. I am fighting the attack on our democracy. I am fighting for the public interest. It is a nonsense to read Minister Williams's contributions to this debate and also Senator Alston's contribution from when he first introduced the bill. When they talk about preserving the public interest, it is laughable. They have no understanding of what the public interest, the common good, is. Their understanding of public interest is to reward our most powerful media players, who have such important influence over the news and information that are fed to us on a daily basis.
This bill will destroy diversity of reporting and opinion in Australia, because one owner will be allowed to dominate the bulk of old media in the one market area. That will inevitably lead to that person consolidating and rationalising to fewer newsrooms, fewer editors, fewer journalists and tighter control on what is broadcast. How can this be in the public interest? How can this be good for Australia's democracy? In my view this is a scandalous attack on Australia's fourth estate. It is an attack on journalism and an attempt to reward the largest media owners, at the expense of diversity of opinion and Australia's democracy. It presents a victory for self-interest over public interest and is a perfect example of what Australians detest most about politicians—that is, their desire to pander to the most powerful for their own cheap political gain. That is what this is all about. We are heading for a double dissolution election, and you can be sure the Prime Minister will expect uniform editorial support for the re-election of the Howard government when the election is ultimately called. You can be sure of that.
I was outraged the other day when I heard, in a BBC interview, Mr Murdoch making it quite plain that he is considering whether to support Mr Blair. I have no problem with Mr Murdoch having an opinion and having it expressed in one of his newspapers. But, if you want to look at the most blatant example of the influence that he has over his editors in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, have a look at the uniform editorial support in News Ltd's papers for Mr Bush, Mr Blair and our own Prime Minister over the war in Iraq. It is fine for Mr Murdoch to have an opinion, but I, along with my wife, was amongst 400,000 people who marched against the Iraq war in the streets of Sydney. I cannot believe that not one of the editors employed by News Ltd thought we should not be involved in that conflict without the blessing of the United Nations Security Council. Yet I could not find that opinion anywhere in any of the editorials in our News Ltd newspapers.
News Ltd has about two-thirds of the metropolitan dailies, three-quarters of the Sunday newspapers, one-half of the suburban newspapers and one-quarter of the regional newspapers, not to mention interests in pay television, and so it goes on and on. I did not see any of the editors in that family of media companies speaking out against their bosses—and I can understand that; that is human nature. I am not criticising those people, because he who pays the piper calls the tune. But what an outrageous assault it is on our democracy. How can we allow Mr Murdoch to tell the BBC audience he will decide whether Mr Blair gets re-elected, any more than we would allow him to say he will decide whether Mr Howard is re-elected Prime Minister or Simon Crean is elected as Prime Minister at the next election? I think that is outrageous. There is no doubt that those people who own the media companies have influence. 
On that very topic, I invite members of the government to look at the contribution by the member for Calare, Peter Andren, to the debate in this House on this very important legislation. He has made a number of speeches about this, and he knows what he is talking about because he worked for a very long time in the media—he was employed by Mr Packer. To give you an example, the member for Calare said in this House on 26 June this year, quoting from his own speech during the second reading debate:
`A few years later I worked at Channel 9, where Kerry Packer exerted a direct and at times hands-on influence on the content of news bulletins'—
as a producer, I was personally involved in several of those events—
`particularly at politically sensitive times—almost invariably sensitive to conservative political interests. I can remember several occasions when Mr Packer exercised a direct influence over editorial policy. It is a nonsense to suggest that that sort of influence would not be exerted across a stable of media interests if it were deemed politically expedient, as was the case during the 1975 federal election campaign.'
That is brutally honest of the member for Calare. He also said in his speech during the second reading debate, inter alia:
Let me share with the House some of my media experiences that go back to the late 1960s, when I first joined Channel 7 Sydney, which was then owned by the Fairfax organisation, along with 2GB. For much of my time as a reporter, I was not based at the Epping studios; I was working out of the Channel 7 office in the Herald building on Broadway in downtown Sydney. Next door was the office of 2GB. Part of my duties was to wander around to the Sydney Morning Herald or the Sun news desk and pick up the `blacks', as they were called—the carbon copy of the Sun or Herald news copy that had been filed by the Fairfax reporters. This was taken back to the office and sent by an early version of the fax machine to Epping, where it would become the basis for the reporter or newsreader voiceover of television stories. Other stories were rewritten and used as read-only TV stories. The same process was followed by the 2GB reporter next door; the only difference was that the bulletin was read from a radio studio within the Macquarie news office in the Herald building. The Sydney Sun'slead story became the Macquarie news lead story on the hour during the week, with the Sun-Herald and Herald providing the stories at the weekend. Not only was the Fairfax editorial material being used by the other two media but there was a direct and daily link between senior Fairfax executives and the news editor at Channel 7.
That is very relevant to the comments that are being made by members of the government about the so-called certificates of exemption of our cross-media ownership rules—or what I call the blank cheques—that can be issued by the head of the ABA, Professor David Flint, that well-known apologist for the government. It is amazing that the government could expect us to swallow that somehow or other, magically, Professor David Flint could separate a newsroom from its owner. That is impossible.
The ABA, a government authority, potentially interfering in our democracy is just outrageous, particularly someone like Professor David Flint, who on innumerable occasions—because he is a media tart himself—has rushed to the defence of the Prime Minister, the member for Warringah and other senior members of the government. You only have to go back to earlier this week, when there was a letter in the Daily Telegraph from Professor Flint, apologising for and explaining the unsportsmanlike behaviour of our Prime Minister at the Rugby World Cup final—his surliness in presenting the medals—as being quite out of character. Why is Professor Flint writing to a News Ltd paper? He is on record anyhow as saying we should abolish our cross-media ownership rules. I am telling you, when we get into government, Professor Flint's head is going to roll because quite plainly he is not defending the public interest. 
—He will be too old!
—Don't you bet on that. It is scandalous. What we are seeing with this bill is, as I have said, a triumph of self-interest over the public interest. The repeal of the existing cross-media rules will replace diversity with domination; that is what it will do. Australia's cross-media ownership rules were introduced in 1987 to prohibit a person owning television networks and newspapers in the same market. This has guaranteed reasonable levels of diversity in Australia, and Australians accept the status quo. So, if Australians accept the status quo, how can the government allow the status quo to remain and yet allow our two most powerful commercial media owners to own even more of the media? If this bill were passed, Mr Packer could buy Fairfax. Fairfax, for those who do not know, is the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Financial Review—very influential newspapers—and a very significant force in Australia. Mr Murdoch, who has a stranglehold on print media—and don't forget his interest with Mr Packer in pay TV—could potentially buy Channel 7 or Channel 10. I ask again and again and again: how is that in the public interest?
At the moment, people are getting their news and information mainly from the traditional sources—the old media. That is what this bill has always been about but it was never explained to the people of Australia. When a double dissolution election is called by the Prime Minister in the second half of next year—after he presents a generous budget and is throwing money around like a man with no arms—do you think he will explain to the people of Australia that this bill will mean the Packer family can own Fairfax, in addition to everything else they already own, and Mr Murdoch will be allowed to buy a television network, when quite plainly anyone employed by either of those families is expected to toe the line of their boss? That is human nature, as I said. That is why I feel so strongly about this issue. 
I do not care what people's politics are. The people of Australia have to understand that I do not care how they vote. What I do care about is the future of our democracy, because the media is absolutely vital to our democracy. How can you allow Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch to have more control over the government and the opposition? That is what this bill is all about. It is outrageous—
—You have got an audience.
—I am pleased I have got an audience. I hope that the people understand that I am sick of the sophistry, the humbug and the cant that we hear every day. Mr Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, if you and the government had been honest you would have accepted the honourable amend-ments put forward by Senator Harradine, which would have made changes which would have been acceptable to us but which would have prevented Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch from increasing their stranglehold on commercial media in Australia today. That is against a background of the government continually attacking the public broadcaster and suggesting that people should take out subscriptions to the ABC. (Time expired)

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I understand why the member for Lowe wants to continue his remarks, because what he says is correct. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] will indeed attack our democracy at its very heart. I stand and support much of what has been said in this debate, particularly from the member for Lowe and the member for Melbourne. The member for Melbourne effectively said that this bill on cross-media ownership would be a very dangerous bill if passed, and the member for Lowe was saying that when he was wanting to continue his remarks. I can understand his passion in wanting to continue, because this is a significant bill. 
Labor's chief concern with this bill lies with its repeal of our existing cross-media rules. These rules were introduced in 1987 and 1988 to prohibit the ownership by a proprietor of any more than one television station, newspaper or radio station in the same area. Paul Keating said at the time that media proprietors could either be `queens of the screen' or `princes of print'. He said it very well, because he understood the need to divide ownership on those grounds. 
In the few minutes I have left before question time, I think it is very interesting to look at comments about media ownership that were made by government members during their time here. I will start with the member for Hinkler. In 1995, he moved a private member's motion. It said that the House:
... views with concern the tendency to centralising of the electronic media ...
In his contribution he went on to say:
Somewhere, some time, the Australian community must take a stand on the centralising of media control. ... A quick scan of the Australian media landscape should put a decided chill through the veins of all lovers of freedom, cultural diversity and a well informed society, as bulwarks against oppression. 
That is what the member for Hinkler said in 1995. What did the member for Moreton, now Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, say in 1996? He said:
We are very well aware the diversity needed in public debate in this country through the media is sadly lacking. 
He also said `Labor's legacy'—he blamed us—`which this government has inherited has meant media ownership has become heavily concentrated. Diversity has all but disappeared ...' But what does the government want to do? A frontbencher of the government said that in 1996, but now of course we have not heard a word from that minister with respect to this bill about centralising media ownership. 
As late as February 2000, he also said:
The convergence of the various media outlets means that cross-media ownership rules, as they currently exist in this country, are fast becoming redundant. The owners of various media want rights and access to other forms of media, but if they want those rights they should exercise some real responsibility. 
Again, he is reflecting a view that media ownership should not be centralised any further. Where is that minister now with respect to this matter? He is nowhere to be seen.
My last comments will be to alert the chamber to what the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the member for Bradfield, said in 1997. We know he lost his membership to the ALP. He got rid of that. We know he lost his earring. He got rid of that. Obviously, he has also lost his commitment to stopping the centralisation of media ownership. In 1997 he said:
I am quite confident that most of my constituents will not support further concentration. 
In a column in his local newspaper, he also said:
A proprietor with considerable domestic political agenda controlling a television station and a newspaper in both Sydney and Melbourne, not to mention all the other outlet's for credible business commentary is not a legacy we wish to leave upon our children.
That is what the minister for education said about cross-media ownership and the centralisation of media in 1997. He went on to say many other things, reflecting that there should not be any further media ownership concentration. But what has happened? We have heard nothing from the minister for education. He is sitting there laughing away. We have not heard a word from him on the concentration of media ownership since he has been on the front bench, nor have we heard anything on this issue from the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. Those two frontbench members made their views clear when they were backbenchers. They did not want to see further concentration of media ownership, but they have not said a word in this debate about the concentration of media ownership rules. They are sitting there now laughing away. They have no concern about the concentration of media ownership that is going to occur if we allow this bill to pass.
There has been absolute hypocrisy on the part of this government. When the minister for education was on the backbench, he said that he would stand the Prime Minister up on cross-media ownership rules. He said, `I will oppose the Prime Minister on this view.' That was when he was a backbencher, but what has happened now? Here he sits on the front bench, and he has no concern now for what was once a philosophical view that he shared with the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. That is the reality. They again show their hypocrisy and their failure on this matter. 
—Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101A. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Burke will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—To the extent that vulnerable workers are allowed to do anything collective under the Howard government's vicious industrial relations laws, they breathed a collective sigh of relief with the departure of the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, now the Minister for Health and Ageing. They were under the misapprehension that, with the arrival of the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, life would be just a little easier for them. Sadly, their optimism was unfounded, because the current minister for workplace relations is proceeding with each and every one of the dozen bills that have been introduced into this parliament by his predecessors, Peter Reith and the current minister for health, the member for Warringah.
I am advised that the government has engaged the services of George Orwell as a consultant to help them name some of these bills. We recall that George Orwell wrote Nineteen Eighty-Fourand spoke at length about the `ministry of love', which in fact was a ministry full of hatred. He spoke about the `ministry of truth', which contained a pack of lies. And so it is with George Orwell's penmanship in relation to various bills that are being sponsored through this parliament by the present minister. At the outset I refer to the unfair dismissal bill, which George Orwell redrafted to be named `the fair dismissal bill'. The fair dismissal bill, which is now a double dissolution trigger, allows employers with fewer than 20 employees to sack vulnerable workers without any recourse to unfair dismissal procedures. This fair dismissal bill is the first of the Orwellian titled bills that are being sponsored by this minister and the Howard government. 
We move on to the fair termination bill. What does George Orwell's fair termination bill do? It allows employers to sack casual workers without any remedy or recourse to unfair dismissal procedures. Then there is another beauty—George Orwell really was excelling himself when he got to this one—called the `protecting the low paid bill'. What do you think the protecting the low paid bill might embrace? It embraces a proposal that would make it much harder for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to grant pay rises to the most vulnerable, lowest paid workers in this country. That is George Orwell's idea of protecting the low paid. More particularly, it is John Howard's idea of protecting the low paid: slashing their wages and working conditions, and pulling away the safety net designed to protect low-paid workers and the conditions that, for over 100 years, have built up through the good work of Labor governments and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I draw the attention of the House to the views of the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations on this bill that this minister, of all ministers, is sponsoring. It made a submission opposing the protecting the low paid bill, and it stated:
The payment of a just wage is not only important in maintaining the dignity of the individual person, but also in maintaining a just socio-economic system.
You would think that this minister, of all ministers, would take some notice of the Catholic Commission for Employment Relations. He has done so on other occasions but not on this occasion. I have asked him to withdraw this vicious bill that would tear away at the safety net of the most vulnerable workers in Australia, and he has refused to do so. So he is batting on and, like Pontius Pilate, washing his hands. But worse: he is batting on with this legislation with a zealousness rarely displayed by his predecessor, the minister for health.
In total, without going through the whole list of Orwellian bills, there are a dozen bills in the parliament being sponsored by this minister that constitute the failed second wave legislation of 1999 broken up into bite-sized pieces. These dirty dozen bills would make life even more difficult for the most vulnerable people in Australia. The bills would make these people's capacity to be represented by trade unions in this country almost impossible, and they would withdraw any remaining right on the part of these vulnerable workers to organise themselves collectively and to bargain collectively.
That is a dozen bills, but there is a 13th bill: the notorious building industry bill. I think that one is called the `building industry improvement bill'. It applies the entire second wave of 1999 legislation to one industry—the building industry. Effectively, it withdraws the right to strike and the right to bargain collectively. When the former minister was asked whether he had any idea in mind of extending this bill to other industries, he said, `I would be stupid not to look at that.' This is the stalking horse for all other industries. It is the failed second wave of industrial relations legislation put into one industry. If it were passed, it would spread to other industries—acknowledged already by the minister who said that he would be stupid if he did not do it.
That is 13 bills. You would think that would be enough—but, no, it is not enough for this government and it is not enough for this minister. The bills that I have listed to date are the ones that this minister has inherited from previous ministers, but the last bill is all his own vicious, nasty work. It is the Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003—George Orwell is back again! What do you reckon `better bargaining' might actually constitute? 
Opposition members—No bargaining!
—No bargaining whatsoever. It actually constitutes the removal, from the working men and women of this country, of the right to take industrial action. It makes it possible for any third party to go along to the Industrial Relations Commission and say, about an actual or prospective industrial action, `This could significantly affect me and, on that basis, I am applying to the Industrial Relations Commission to suspend the bargaining period, thereby making industrial action unlawful.' This applies to every working Australian, but the second reading speech homes in on the real target. The second reading speech, drafted by this minister, says the legislation is especially targeted at the caring professions, and nominates health, community services and education. So this minister is saying that health professionals, hospital workers, aged care workers, child-care workers, teachers and academics covered by federal awards will no longer have any bargaining capacity in negotiations with their employers to maintain and improve their wages and their working conditions.
This bill is the most vicious bill that has been introduced into this parliament in the industrial relations arena since the 1996 first wave of legislation. It is sponsored by a man who presents himself as meek and mild, who presents himself as having a social conscience, who presents himself as someone who is concerned with social justice in this country—and he wants to remove the bargaining capacity of these carers, these workers. But why? Why has this government got such a set against nurses in this country? Most decent thinking people in Australia regard nurses as angels—they have them up on a pedestal—but not this government, because it is specifically targeting nurses with this vicious legislation.
The minister's predecessor, now the Minister for Health and Ageing, has already said, in September of this year, that it is his belief that rural nurses should be paid less than city nurses. So they are targeting nurses again. I just do not get it. In the minds of this government, what is wrong with nurses? Minister Abbott says that rural nurses should be paid less than city nurses. Do they not understand that it is already difficult to attract nurses into rural and regional Australia? They want to reduce their pay compared with that of city nurses, making that problem even worse. Further than that, it is just unfair. But one thing that the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and current Minister for Health and Ageing has in common with the Treasurer is that the Treasurer believes that workers in rural and regional Australia should be paid less—and not just nurses and teachers; he believes that everyone in regional Australia should be paid less. So we have got a unity ticket: the current minister for workplace relations, the former minister for workplace relations and the Treasurer all believe that some or all workers in rural and regional Australia should be paid less than their city counterparts.
But of course this targeting of nurses just points to the lack of commitment of this government to the entire health system in this country. We do not need to debate at length here its commitment to tear Medicare right apart, to take a scalpel to Medicare, but of course the people who deliver Medicare, especially in rural and regional Australia—the nurses—are the subject of this vicious antiworker legislation. The truth is this government hates Medicare, it hates unions and it hates collective bargaining. 
A few weeks ago the Prime Minister addressed the 20th anniversary meeting of the Business Council of Australia and, when asked about the greatest achievements that he has presided over as Prime Minister, right up the top he said that the private sector work force in this country is now unionised only to the extent of 18 per cent. He was proud of his achievement in orchestrating a decline in union membership to constitute 18 per cent of the private sector work force. But, when you add those private sector workers who are in trade unions to public sector workers who are in trade unions, you get 1.8 million Australians—1.8 million proud working Australians who independently and proudly have joined a trade union in this country because they want to be represented by a trade union, they want the right to bargain collectively and they want to be protected against this government's vicious legislation. What other organisation in this country can boast 1.8 million proud members? None. The great trade union movement alone can boast that. So when the Prime Minister tries to talk it down and say it is only 18 per cent of the work force, we say it is 1.8 million proud working Australians, proud members of a trade union—union proud, union strong. 
Labor are proud of our links with the trade union movement and we will reverse this government's vicious industrial relations legislation. In government, Labor will re-empower working Australians to bargain collectively. We will restore the right to bargain collectively which has been removed or substantially weakened by this government. We will, upon taking government, abolish Australian workplace agreements. They will go in the first weeks of a Labor government and we will abolish the outfit that is charged by this government with the responsibility of spreading Australian workplace agreements—the weakest form of contract in this country—to all places, including to schools, where they have most recently been promoting AWAs. I refer of course to the Employment Advocate and the Office of the Employment Advocate. Just as we will abolish Australian workplace agreements, so too will we abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate. 
Labor in government will re-empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to act as a strong, independent umpire. When disputes cannot be settled between parties, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be given back the capacity to arbitrate to settle those disputes. Labor in government will require the parties to bargain in good faith. There is now no good faith bargaining requirement in the government's legislation. It was removed. What has the consequence been? Lockouts. A number of members know about this. The member for Chisholm, for example, had a lockout in her electorate that ran for at least 17 weeks, with health failing on the part of the people who were locked out. It was a vicious lockout that did not need to occur, but such lockouts can occur under this government's industrial relations legislation because there is no requirement to bargain in good faith. Labor will require the parties to bargain in good faith.
Labor will improve the balance between work and family life. Labor will provide 14 weeks of paid maternity leave. Labor will provide women returning to the work force after having a baby with the right to request to return to work on a part-time basis so that they can balance work and family responsibilities, and that request shall not be unreasonably refused by employers. We will address the problem of the casualisation of this work force. We will stop the use of casualisation to bargain down the wages and conditions of vulnerable Australians, a trend that even the Employment Advocate, Mr Jonathan Hamburger, says has gone too far. We will take Australians out of the race to the bottom—off the low road to low skills and low wages. Labor will take working Australians—vulnerable Australians—up the high road to high skills and high wages by getting them into education and vocational training so that they have the skills—and, together with their representative trade unions, a decent amount of bargaining power—to achieve decent wages and conditions in this country. We will do that to fulfil Labor's vision of a prosperous, fair, tolerant and compassionate Australia.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—There is some irony in the fact that the Australian Labor Party has an MPI today about jobs because, as I said earlier, the only thing that is motivating the minds of the members of the Australian Labor Party today is who is going to have the job of Leader of the Opposition next week. That and whether or not the member for Rankin and others will still be on the front bench is the central focus of their efforts at the present time.
Having raised the issue of jobs this gives me the opportunity to indicate what this government has done in comparison to the Australian Labor Party in terms of jobs. The reality is that, under this government, there have been more jobs and higher wages. Let me take the House to the data, in comparison to the wild rhetoric of the member for Rankin. Since the coalition came to government, almost 1.3 million jobs have been created in Australia. On top of that, we have an unemployment rate in Australia today of 5.6 per cent. Unemployment in Australia has not been lower than it is today in 22 years. We have created 1.3 million jobs and have brought the unemployment rate down to 5.6 per cent.
Not only have more jobs been created whilst the Liberal and National parties have been in government; there have also been higher wages. Let me compare the increase in real wages in Australia from 1985 to 1996 under the Australian Labor Party and from 1996 to 2003 under the coalition. The increase in real wages for full-time employees in Australia under the Australian Labor Party was just $12. By comparison, since 1996 we have seen an increase in real wages for full-time employees in Australia of some $92. Through its economic and other policies, this government has delivered more jobs and higher wages and therefore more security for Australian families.
This is the proud record of this government and much of it has been achieved through substantial economic and structural reform which has been opposed at every step of the way by the Australian Labor Party in opposition. Indeed, they are still opposing the further reform that this government wants to bring about because we have at the present time a historic opportunity to lock in lower unemployment in this country than we have had over the past decade or so. But who is standing in our way? It is none other than the members of the Australian Labor Party.
I was interested to hear a speech delivered by the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Greg Combet, just a week ago in Melbourne. I was present when Mr Combet delivered the speech, and I would like to quote from it. He said:
So just briefly, consider the last 10 years or so:
	GDP growth averaging over 4% a year; 
	$200 billion extra to the economy in real terms; 
	growth far outstripping the G7 and OECD averages; 
	an extra 1.8 million jobs added to the workforce;  
	employment growing at an average of 2.2% per year compared to an OECD average of 1.1%; 
	nearly 1 million women entering the workforce over the last 10 years; 
	productivity growth exceeding 2% a year, each year over 10 years—a historic performance never seen before in our economy—
these are Mr Combet's words, not mine—
	low inflation and interest rates—inflation's remained at an average low of 2.5% a year over 10 years, the highest interest rate we've had since 1993 has been 7.5%, thirteen rate cuts since that time and 11 rate rises including last week's 25 basis point increase; 
	profits of 233%—growth in profits in real terms over the last 10 years, 233% in real terms, 13.5% year on year 
	earnings have increased, which is something positive amongst it all as well—they've increased by about 4.2% a year and we have moved ahead of the UK, ahead of France, of Germany, Japan and Sweden in income per capita in this country—a great performance.
That was the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions listing the economic performance that this government has overseen over the last 10 years, and he talks about a massive increase in jobs in Australia—an increase, as I said earlier, that has also involved an increase in wages. Indeed, Mr Combet went on to say that the interest of the unions these days, in terms of industrial action, was not so much about wages themselves. I will not quote in more detail from his speech but perhaps I could commend it to members of the opposition, who can find it on the ACTU's webpage if they are interested.
What this reinforces, and what Mr Combet was saying—not what the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, the finance minister or I as a minister in this government was saying, but what the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was saying—is that this government has presided over a period of more jobs and higher wages. That, of course, has led to greater security for Australian families. That is why this government has pursued workplace relations reforms. Reform is not an end in itself. It is for a purpose. That is why we have further bills, which are being held up by the Australian Labor Party in this parliament. The central objective of this government has been to build a more prosperous and secure Australia so that all Australians can reap the benefits with more jobs, higher wages and better standards of living. We believe that all Australians should share in this nation's prosperity, and those benefits are not just financial. Having a job is vital to a person's dignity and wellbeing and to the wellbeing of their families.
So these measures and the structural reform that this government has brought about have led to real outcomes for ordinary Australian men and women and their families. And what do we hear? We hear wild rhetoric from the member for Rankin railing against this prosperity. In addition to general unemployment coming down, we have seen youth unemployment halved and long-term unemployment cut by two-thirds in this country. So not only do more Australians have jobs but also they are being paid higher wages. The reality is that there is more that we can do and there is more that we want to do. Part of that is about continuing the structural reform in Australia.
The OECD, when looking at Australia earlier this year, said that the Australian economy is prospering as it is and we have been able to enable the creation of those jobs partly because of the structural reform that this government has driven in terms of Australia's future. The Chairman of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, said in a speech just a couple of months ago that part of the reason we have been able to have this economic development in Australia is that this government has brought about structural reform in terms of its programs and policies. So these are real advantages for ordinary Australians—real advantages that we are committed to continuing to implement in this country. 
The honourable member talked about workers and about those who are on low pay. The reality is that, for those who are on low pay, we have brought about some real gains. On 19 November, the Newcastle Herald had the headline, `Working class top gainers in wages'. I know the honourable member for Dobell is interested in that particular area of Australia. The constituents that he represents are a little south of Newcastle, but nonetheless it is an important part of Australia and he knows that, if you look at the actual increase in the minimum wages being paid, what this government has brought about is a real, definite and sustainable increase for the ordinary men and women living in his electorate and other parts of Australia. This is something that was reflected in that headline from the Newcastle Herald, which is a newspaper that does not always necessarily comment favourably about everything that this government does. But, once again, this is a reflection of the current reality.
In terms of its membership, I think the frontbench of the Labor Party represents about 80 per cent union membership, compared to an overall union membership in Australia of just 23 per cent today. If you go to the private sector, only 17 per cent of people employed in the private sector in Australia are members of a union today. The reality is that people in Australia are leaving the unions in droves because they no longer represent the aspirations of ordinary Australians. Yet we find a Labor Party which is entirely dominated, and still dominated today, by the union bosses. They have no independence from the point of view of the union bosses at the present time. No wonder they stand in the way of this reform which we have been trying to bring about in Australia.
In addition to helping the low paid, there are other measures that this government has taken for workers. Just recently, through our efforts to bring 350,000 of the lowest paid workers in Victoria into the federal industrial relations system, we have been able to provide an opportunity for them to gain from that. The minister for workplace relations in Victoria, Rob Hulls, actually commended not only me but also the government on bringing about this change. It is something that no doubt the member who I believe will follow me in this debate would also commend us on. I am looking forward to his party in the Senate facilitating the passage of that bill before the end of next week, because, if it does not, I will be saying clearly to those 350,000 workers in Victoria that what is holding up any change so far as their situation is concerned is the Australian Labor Party. We have done everything we can in relation to that. So, once again, if you look at the measures that this government is taking, they are measures that are about creating more jobs. They are about creating the circumstances in which more jobs can be created in this country and in which Australians can share in the prosperity through higher wages.
The honourable member for Rankin mentioned the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003, another of the bills which the Labor Party is standing in the way of in terms of reform in this place. If you look at what that bill does, it proposes that the object of the Workplace Relations Act be amended to specify the needs of the low paid as a primary focus in adjusting the safety net. So here we have a bill which invites a consideration of the needs of the low paid as the primary focus in adjusting the safety net in Australia, yet this is a bill which we have the Australian Labor Party railing against. In introducing this bill, the government is demonstrating its ongoing commitment to maintaining a safety net of minimum wages and conditions for low-paid employees as well as enhancing the employment prospects for the low paid, low skilled and unemployed. 
The member for Rankin talks about Australian workplace agreements and says that the Labor Party in government will abolish Australian workplace agreements. What we had today from the member for Rankin was a promise to the people of Australia, who want more flexibility and choice in their workplace relations, that, if Labor are elected, they would reregulate the area of industrial relations in Australia. They would reregulate not only the areas in which people are now free to have choice and flexibility in their workplaces but also, in fact, the areas that have not been regulated before.
So the choice is quite stark for the Australian people. It is a choice between reregulation and overregulation: taking away freedom of choice, taking away flexibility and taking away the very structural changes that have enabled more jobs to be created and higher wages to flow as a result of that. It is the choice of wiping all that away by electing the Australian Labor Party to government or continuing the process of reform and, by doing that, locking in lower unemployment in Australia from something close to 11 per cent—as the honourable member opposite will recall, when the Labor Party was in government, when Paul Keating gave us the recession we had to have—down to a figure of 5.6 per cent—
—Thirteen years of misery, and now we've had seven years of misery.
—If there is any indication of how out of touch the Australian Labor Party is, it is the honourable member opposite saying that we have had seven years of misery. If 1.3 million extra jobs, an unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent, a real increase in wages of $92 compared to $12 under the Australian Labor Party represent misery then I suspect the Australian people will want more of that. The reality is that this government is delivering higher wages and more jobs. If the Australian Labor Party would simply get out of the way, we could do more of that for the prosperity and the security of all Australians and their families.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations: Workers' Entitlements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I think the minister has it wrong when he says that we are somehow churlish about the falling unemployment rate. The fact is that anyone in this country and everyone in this chamber, on all sides, would support any drop in the unemployment rate in this nation. So I do not think that is the nub of the argument and I do not think that is the central theme of what should be discussed here. That is not the case. I think the proposition that has been put by the minister is that somehow, because unemployment has dropped, we should take an axe to laws that have been in this country for a century; we should take an axe to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; we should remove the powers of the commission to preside over industrial disputes; and we should remove the powers of people to lawfully withdraw their labour. They are the things we are discussing today and the minister fails to acknowledge that.
I think it is fair to say that what we have found now is that this minister is clearly following in the tradition of his predecessor in looking to attack the unions in this country. They of course are a proxy for what is really being attacked today. What is really being attacked by the industrial relations bills that have been introduced in this House in this term, are ordinary Australian working families. The objective of this government is to assault ordinary working families and effectively to deny them entitlements and the laws to protect their interests in the workplace, whether it be at the workplace or whether it be the ability of the commission to preside over matters. I think that is where the minister has it wrong. 
Of course the Secretary of the ACTU would acknowledge it if there were improvements because of the reduction in the unemployment rate, as he should. Why is that a surprise to the minister? Because the minister does not expect that. He expects that somehow we would be mean and tricky with the truth. He expects us not to acknowledge good news when it arrives. The fact is that we would of course welcome the drop in the unemployment rate. We would welcome that and we always will. What we do not accept is the minister and this government looking to attack ordinary working people.
The member for Rankin raised the issue very clearly when he said that there have been 12 industrial relations bills in this place and all of them have been about either stymieing the lawful rights of unions to represent working people in this country or, indeed, about attacking workers directly. I think there has been that veil of deceit by this government. They hope that they can attack unions and keep saying, `Vilify unions' and `Keep attacking unions.' They have not really exposed the fact that their real objective is to attack ordinary working people.
Let us remember some of the bills that have been introduced and rejected by the Senate and by the Labor Party this term. I go to the bill that was referred to by the minister in his own address. He said that somehow the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill 2003 is a great thing for the low paid. Let us talk about the implications of that bill if passed. Effectively that would mean that the Industrial Relations Commission would have to have regard to whether low-paid people should be given the safety net adjustment in a national wage case. That is, whether in fact the commission should provide the lowest paid in this country—arguably people on or below the poverty line—with an annual increase in their pay packet. That is what this minister is providing if he introduces that bill, and he wants it to be passed. That in fact would be the outcome of the legislation if it were enacted.
Let us not forget what this government is about. It is about directly attacking working people, but not just those on the building sites and the maritime workers; it is about the lowest paid people in this country—the people who quite often are not organised collectively and who are in non-unionised workplaces. They are vulnerable and that is why we have laws and that is why we have an industrial relations commission. What has happened in the last seven years in this chamber is that the government has looked to whittle away the entitlements of ordinary working families and it has done so by attacking the unions and their right to bargain, and by attacking the Industrial Relations Commission and its right to preside over industrial matters in its capacity to ensure that there is genuine bargaining between parties. Indeed, on occasion the veil slips and they directly attack ordinary Australian working people. It is the case that, unlike the ACTU Secretary and this side of the House, this government peddles untruths. It peddles lies and it does so openly.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Burke will withdraw that comment. 
—I am happy to withdraw the fact that I said `lies'. But I am happy to say, and I think you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that some of the titles of these bills are extraordinary. If it were not that the effects were so tragic, the titles of these bills would be laughable. I will start with the one that always used to baffle me: the one on Australian workplace agreements. The minister has talked about Australian workplace agreements. The government will do anything to impose Australian workplace agreements. They will even get vice-chancellors in a room and tell them that they are not going to get funding unless there are Australian workplace agreements at universities. They will do anything to do it.
What is so `Australian' about Australian workplace agreements? They were not around for a century. They were not around before their introduction by this government in 1996. They are not historically intrinsic to the Australian industrial relations system. Australian workplace agreements are not Australian. Why are they `workplace'? How can they be `workplace'? They are individual. They are individual and non-Australian. What about `agreements'? Are they agreements? I do not know where the minister has been but I can tell you this: if you ask most people who have signed up to an Australian workplace agreement they will tell you it was not with agreement. They were told, `Sign this or you're sacked,' `Sign this or you won't get an increase,' or, `Sign this or you won't get the job.' Is that an agreement? That to me is not an agreement. So they are not Australian, they are not workplace and they surely are not agreements. If the minister knew what went on in the workplace, rather than what went on in this chamber, he would understand that. But he does not understand—or perhaps he does understand. He understands that those titles are about confusing the electorate. They are about lying to the people of Australia by inverting the intention of the bill.
When they say `Australian workplace agreements' we know what they are talking about; they are talking about the reverse of workplace agreements. The bill to stop genuine bargaining is called `genuine bargaining'. The bill to stop the rights of employees who have been terminated is called the `fair termination' bill. The transmission of business bill, which did not get as much press as some of the others, will provide power to the commission. There is a turn-up for the books—allowing the commission to have power! Why would they want it to have power? The government want the commission to have power to ensure that there is no transmission of a business. So if company A's ownership changes, those workers may not have their agreements or awards applied to them. The transmission of business bill is about not transmitting the business to ensure those employees are protected.
As we have heard, and as has been anticipated in this place and was referred to by the member for Rankin, we have a bill—and I do not know the title of the bill; I cannot wait to find out what it is going to be—that will allow third parties to stop lawful action by intervening in a matter in which they are not even affected and by stopping a bargaining period notice.
It really does concern me that these things are taking place. I raise these things—that is, the way this government misleads people by these outrageous contradictory titles of acts—not to get laughs. There is no room for laughter in this area. These bills, if passed, will mean that there will be no entitlements for many working people. There will be no rights to bargain collectively at the workplace, and certainly there will be very limited rights to bargain collectively. There will be no capacity for the Industrial Relations Commission to preside over disputes between parties—that is, the umpire will not be allowed to blow the whistle. The government's solution is to take the whistle off the umpire. That is what it is about. It is about reducing people's rights, attacking unions and, in the end and most tragically, attacking the hardworking Australian families of this nation. The most important element to any productive society is their work force.  
I should not be surprised that this political party in power wants to do these things. In many ways it has always had an antiunion view. Comparing this government with previous conservative governments shows how extreme it is in relation to this area. All governments previous to this Howard government—all the conservative parties in government—supported the industrial relations system and supported a system that was at least fair.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2003-11-27,"—If ever I heard some waffle and meaningless rhetoric, I heard it today.
—You can't handle the truth!
—I can handle the truth and I can handle it very well. I will give the honourable member plenty of truth before I am finished. The rhetoric we heard today was meaningless. It was not based on examples. It was just an attack on the government for a perceived assault on the unions. The trouble with the Labor Party is that it has lost touch with its unions. Frankly, the Australian work force has lost faith in unions. If awards and unionism were the be-all and end-all, why is it that only 23 per cent of the Australian work force now subscribe to unions? That is not even a quarter. When it comes to private employment, only 17 per cent of employees think it is worth being members of a union.
Let me take you to the great city of Gladstone in my electorate. Gladstone is an intelligent city; it is a cutting-edge city. It is the powerhouse of Queensland. It has 12 per cent of Australia's exports going through its port. One of our major plants in Gladstone decided to seek from its employees a direction on whether they wanted to have workplace agreements or to stay under awards. They said, `How about we have a secret ballot type referendum in the plant?' The unions went into overdrive. The Electrical Trades Union put up a tent at the gate and cars were stopped from coming into the plant—all that sort of stuff. On the day of the ballot the employees in that plant voted 83 to 17 per cent for workplace agreements. That was a free, open, secret ballot.
The trouble is the attitude of the ALP and the unions. It is of some concern to the Labor Party in Central Queensland that Gladstone continues to reject them. I will tell you why: they treat the employees of those plants in Gladstone as blue-collar yobbos. They are not. They are well-trained, intelligent, cutting-edge people who have sufficient faith in themselves and their abilities to negotiate, either individually or collectively, with their employers to get a fair deal with workplace agreements. The average wage in Gladstone is well above that of the rest of the states. If workplace agreements were not working, why would there be such prosperity in a town that rejects the award by a factor of 83 to 17?
The other thing I want to talk about today is why the ALP would even consider putting this subject up for debate, because it lays bare its own atrocious record. It is a stupefying argument from a party which almost drove Australia and Australian workers to the poorhouse. The Howard government is delivering better pay and conditions for Australians, and we have actually put more money back into their pockets. We have done this despite the mountain of debt that was left by the Hawke and Keating governments. We have paid back $63 billion of the $96 billion debt that they left. That is saving Australia about $4.9 billion every year in interest payments. 
Let me make a few comparisons of the record prior to and since 1996. Since 1996, household wealth has increased by 55 per cent, while under the ALP it went up by 2.5 per cent per annum. The government has a firm hold on inflation. For nearly the whole time since 1996, except for the glitch with the GST, inflation has stayed under three per cent, and currently it is at 2.6 per cent. What do you think that means for the average worker? Are you saying that the average worker has been grievously treated by this government? During the ALP's term of office, the average inflation rate was 5.2 per cent. In other words, average workers lost twice as much through inflation under the Labor government than under this government. 
The MPI is about working Australians, and under this government there have been more working Australians than ever before. We have created 1.3 million jobs. In my electorate, the dole queues have shrunk by 35 per cent. I know that because I monitor this very carefully. Industrial disputes are at a historic low. This must be of interest too, because you are saying this is a dreadful government that is forcing the workers to the barricades. How do you explain that when, during the 12-year period between 1984 and 1996, 192 working days per 1,000 employees were lost through strike action, but since this government came to power—or since the first set of figures were produced in March 1997—we have lost a mere 61 working days? In other words, there was more industrial disputation over conditions, pay and the like under the 12 years of Labor than there have been under the seven years of this government. It is a very interesting analogy, isn't it? There were three times as many disputes. Doesn't that say something about what the workers think about the ALP?
The crowning glory for the average Australian worker is the money that is being put back into his pocket. Whether or not he is in a union, whether or not he is under an award and whether or not he is under a workplace agreement, it is what gets put back into his pocket that counts. We did not con people and say, `We're going to give you l-a-w law tax cuts.' Talk about Orwellian statements. If ever there was an Orwellian statement in this parliament in the last two decades, it was the l-a-w law tax cuts. But we have delivered real tax cuts—substantial tax cuts. Not only that, in the last budget we took up the thresholds to reflect where working people were going. The $20,000 threshold went to $21,600, the 42 per cent threshold went from $50,000 to $52,000, and the 47 per cent threshold went from $60,000 to $62,500. For the average worker, I would have thought that that was a pretty good increase.
The other interesting thing is to look at the unemployment rate under Labor and compare it with the rate under this government. It got up to 10.9 per cent under Labor, and currently it is at 5.6 per cent—nearly half the rate under Labor and the best for 22 years. The member for Burke says, `We all celebrate that.' If you celebrate it, you would acknowledge that it would not have come about in an atmosphere in which the government is grinding workers to the ground, like you are trying to put forward. You would not have record employment of Australians—9.6 million—and you would not have 6.9 million in full-time employment. Interestingly in the last 12 months, 80 per cent of new jobs have been full-time jobs. As I said earlier, 1.3 million jobs have been created since this government came to power. So under Labor, the unemployment rate was 10.9 per cent, one million people were unemployed, 330,000 were long-term unemployed and youth unemployment was at 34.5 per cent. Who was really grinding the Australian worker, or the potential Australian worker, into the ground? I loved the speech that the minister made, but time will not permit me to quote it. Greg Combet's speech— 
—Thank God for that.
—You do not want to hear from Greg Combet again? That is unusual. I must drop him a note about that.
—I think he was more worried that you were just going to read it.
—Yes, I suppose it is a problem; I cannot read it in the time available. But the minister's analysis of Greg Combet's speech says it all. You know the truth about it. You know that this was just a rhetorical debate today. You had no substance to your case, and you know that what little case you did have flies in the face of the evidence.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I want to return to some of the comments I was making before question time in relation to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I was indicating that there were some brave hearts—at least one, anyway. There were some brave and courageous backbenchers, now frontbenchers, opposed to the centralisation of ownership of media outlets in this country. I made reference to a number of people but, given that the member for Hinkler has just finished, I thought I would start with him and indicate that he held such a view in 1995. I quote: 
Somewhere, sometime, the Australian community must take a stand on the centralising of media control ... A quick scan of the Australian media landscape should put a decided chill through the veins of all lovers of freedom, cultural diversity and a well informed society, as bulwarks against oppression.
That was the member for Hinkler in 1995. Where is he today on the bill in relation to this matter? Where is he in defending the diversity of media ownership? He has left the chamber; he is not even here to listen to the debate. He has not entered into the debate and he is certainly not supporting what he said in 1995, when he rejected the notion that we should be centralising the media. It does worry me that without any acknowledgement or public declaration that I can find he certainly seems to have changed his tune on whether in fact there should be a centralisation of media ownership.
It is probably more disturbing that there are two frontbenchers in this position. One is the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the member for Moreton, who opposed media centralisation in 1996. The minister, then a backbencher, said: 
Another factor is media operators in this country are greatly disconnected with the community they should ideally be serving. 
He says this means that a greater diversity of ownership is a very good thing. He went on to say:
Labor's legacy—
he was obviously referring to previous Labor governments—
which this government has inherited, has meant ownership has become heavily concentrated. Diversity has all but disappeared;
If that was his view in 1996, why is it that he actually wants to centralise further what he was complaining about in 1996? We have not heard the member for Moreton, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, make any comment about his change or the reasons for his change to a position where he is now supporting what is clearly the centralisation of media ownership. Where is he? He is not in the chamber and he has not made any comment publicly.
But my favourite quote for the week, although it is alarming, is from the Minister for Education, Science and Training—Brave-heart. In 1997, on his resolve to oppose the Howard plan—this is a good one—he said that it had:
... strengthened after the response I've had from my electorate.
That is what he said in 1997. He went on to say that the government should consider:
... first and foremost the public interest served by diversity of editorial opinion, content and plurality of outlet.
Clearly, the member for Bradfield, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, was concerned about the concentration of media ownership. What is he doing today? He is not entering the debate, but you can be assured that when this bill is put to the vote he is going to be voting for a greater concentration of media ownership in this country, having said as a backbencher that he was opposed to not only further concentration but to the current position. This begs the question: what has changed? What has changed the minds of two frontbenchers of the Howard government in relation to this matter and that of a backbencher who was accusing me of being Orwellian? He is clearly now taking a different position on media ownership laws
What has changed? I do not know why they have changed their minds but, clearly, they may have felt the intimidation that could occur when large media proprietors are upset with people opposing further control by them of the media. That is one concern I have. If there is even a perception that frontbenchers of this government have reversed their position on media ownership because they are fearful of getting bad press from those media proprietors then that concerns me and it should concern everybody in this country. 
So I would like, at the very least, the Minister for Education, Science and Training—Braveheart—and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs to come into this chamber. If they are going to support the bill, fine, but they should tell this place why and tell the Australian community too. The Minister for Education, Science and Training should tell his electorate, to whom he seems to have paid proper regard in 1997, why he has changed his position on media ownership laws and why he and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs will be voting for this bill.
I think it is rank hypocrisy of this government—its frontbenchers and a few backbenchers that we know of—to change its position but not explain to anybody why. I think it should be a concern, because at the very heart of democracy it is clear that we need diverse media ownership. The danger with centralising media outlets is that fewer people control what people listen to, what people watch and what people read. That is the danger with concentration. This government has not argued openly and honestly why it would support the new proposition which I referred to before question time. I went to the detail of why in question time. I am posing a lot of questions. I have heard no answers from this government in relation to this issue. I think it is about time it showed the country and this place some respect and answered the question as to why it has changed its position on the concentration of media ownership in this country.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-11-27,"—The purpose of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is to remove controls on the foreign ownership of Australian media and to allow the Australian Broadcasting Authority to issue exemption certificates in respect of the cross-media ownership rules. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 was originally introduced into this House in March last year. The bill was subject to 48 amendments in the Senate, six of which were rejected by this House. The Senate insisted upon those amendments and the bill was laid aside by the House in June this year.
Whilst I was considering my contribution to this debate, I found a fascinating web site, at www.xmedia.org.au, which includes a lot information about the challenges of Australia's already overly concentrated media ownership. I urge honourable members to check the site out. For example, on the site we are informed that on 7 November of this year the International Federation of Journalists, the IFJ—the global organisation of journalists representing more than half a million journalists world wide—called on the Australian government to withdraw amendments to Australia's cross-media ownership laws, arguing that Australia cannot afford a further concentration of media interests. The IFJ's general secretary in Brussels, Aidan White, said:
Australia already has one of the most concentrated media industries in the world and should be examining ways to expand media diversity, not contract it.
He went on to point out:
The Murdoch owned News Corporation controls nearly 70 per cent of metropolitan newspapers measured by circulation. The Fairfax group controls virtually all the others.
White concluded by saying:
Two's too few when it comes to media ownership. The Australian Government needs to change tack and act to develop more healthy media diversity in Australia ... 
Indeed, as we have just heard from the member for Burke, a number of the members of this government, including prominent ministers, apparently once agreed with this opinion, although we have not heard a lot out of the member for Bradfield, the current Minister for Education, Science and Training, on this subject in the past couple of months.
But the member for Bradfield is quoted extensively on the aforementioned web site. He was apparently once quite an outspoken supporter of cross-media ownership laws. Lately it seems the minister for education has learned to keep his mouth shut. In a column entitled `A question of moral courage' in the North Shore Times in 1997, the member for Bradfield is reported as writing:
A proprietor with a considerable domestic political agenda controlling a television station and a newspaper in both Sydney and Melbourne, not to mention all the outlets for credible business commentary, is not a legacy we should wish to leave our children.
Indeed, wise words from the member for Bradfield and current minister for education. It is a shame he has not had the courage to act on them.
In the Australian on 12 May 1997, the minister commented on James Packer's appearance on Packer's Nine Network to sell his case to own Fairfax. The minister said:
One of the nation's most powerful and wealthiest individuals can quite legitimately use their media resources to put their message across whenever they like. If that message can be put across not only on the Nine network but also through the Financial Review, Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age...then you do question whether that always serves the public interest.
In the Financial Review on the same day, back in 1997, the member for Bradfield was quoted as saying:
I have no concern at all about Mr [Kerry] Packer gaining control of Fairfax. My concern is if he does that, without relinquishing some of his other media assets. The average Australian feels uncomfortable with the concentration of media ownership.
That is it in a nutshell. Australians do feel uncomfortable with the concentration of media ownership in this country. But apparently the minister for education is no longer concerned with how the average Australian feels about this.
Finally, on 5 June 1997—obviously 1997 was a good year for the member for Bradfield with regard to directing his mind to media ownership—he was quoted in the Financial Review as saying that the government should consider `first and foremost the public interest, served by diversity of editorial opinion, content and plurality of outlet'. Tragically, the public interest has fallen by the wayside for this government. The new Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts recently commented on the government's plans to introduce this bill on Inside Businesson 2 November. The question was asked by Alan Kohler of the new minister:
How would you feel if, for example, Sunraysia Television, which owns STW9 in Perth, merged with the `West Australian'? Would you feel the media diversity in Perth would have diminished?
The minister responded as follows:
I think what we need to do is to take measures that will promote investment, promote competition, but ensure that there is a diversity of opinion and diversity of material available. The diversity is particularly important in the news and current affairs areas of course. Steps that would result in restrictions on diversity should generally not be favoured.
I could not agree more. Alan Kohler asked whether or not the minister thought this bill might be a problem in this way. One would have certainly thought so. The new minister gave in some ways a predictable response and refused to demonstrate any commitment whatsoever to the importance of diversity in media ownership. He said: 
Well, I think there will be a lot of further discussion in relation to that bill, I'm sure, before it's disposed of one way or the other in the Senate. I haven't had that opportunity that my predecessor had of been involved in the previous discussions. I am anxious to talk to those who have an interest in this subject.
Sadly, nothing definite on this important issue has come from our new communications minister. I was interested to read a paper released this week by Associate Professor Chris Nash, the Director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney. The paper, entitled `Freedom of the press in Australia', was released on 26 November. Associate Professor Nash writes on the subject of concentration of media ownership:
Since the middle of the twentieth century Australia has had a concentration of media ownership almost without parallel in liberal democracies. News Ltd dominates the newspaper market with over 75% of metropolitan circulation, competing with Fairfax publications in Sydney and Melbourne and shifting ownership of the Canberra Times. A small number of companies control the commercial radio and television networks. In radio particularly there has been a rapid shift to networked programming, especially of news content, and in all media there is an increased concentration of supply of international news from corporate stablemates or syndicates, facilitated by new information technologies. While it is true to say that the internet provides an almost endless supply of alternative sources of news and information, its effective penetration is limited to the small numbers of people seeking alternatives from the mainstream media. In the 2001 election campaign, for example, only 9 percent of the electorate used the internet to get information about the election and of these more than half did so only once or twice (Bean and McAllister 2002).
The cross-media ownership rules introduced by the Labor Government in 1987 prohibit the control of more than one of a commercial television licence or a newspaper or a commercial radio licence in the same market. The current Coalition government has been seeking to liberalise these rules since 1996, without success to date. The corporations controlling the media outlets are multi-national conglomerates with interests in a range of industries nationally and internationally. While the two most prominent owner families, Murdoch and Packer, are generally perceived to affect the broad political orientation of their outlets, the extent of editorial interference by media owners is much reduced from the situation of decades ago. In all private media corporations, there has been a shift to greater influence for financial institutions, as shareholders or bankers, whose fiduciary interest and responsibility lie in the level of profit, not the public role of the media.
The major pressure on editors these days is for cost cutting and income maximisation to deliver `shareholder value'. Cost cutting limits the resources available to journalists to investigate and report, and maximises the use of syndicated material across corporate mastheads and markets (Davis, 2000). Income maximisation leads to the targeting of affluent audiences to the exclusion of less affluent ones, and the tendency to constitute audiences as consumers rather than citizens (Hallin, 1995). Away from the hard news and current affairs content areas, it tends to promote the mix of editorial content with advertisements or product promotion—so-called `advertorial'—which is particularly prevalent in print and television magazine content, and indirectly in the supplements of the metropolitan newspapers.
Associate Professor Nash talks about the impact on journalists, who are severely restricted in their choice of employers when media ownership is too concentrated. He says:
The ultimate impact on journalists ... is the severe restriction on choice of employers—if you want to work in the industry you have to make sure you keep out of conflict with your few potential employers, whether it be on professional, political, industrial or personal grounds. 
	...	...	...
At the same time as commercial and financial pressures have been increasing in the private sector, public broadcasting has endured sustained cost cutting. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation estimates that it has suffered a 25% reduction in real funding from government since the mid-1980s, and the latest round of cuts has seen the axing of programs in core areas—
such as school education. He continues:
The Special Broadcasting Service, with a mission to address Australian audiences in their full cultural and ethnic diversity, is increasingly dependent on advertising revenue, minimising any opportunity the broadcaster might want to take to diversify its television programming away from the highly educated, English-speaking, affluent audiences it currently attracts. The Minister for Communications is now reported to be circulating the idea that the ABC should seek subscription funding, similar to the Public Broadcasting Service in the United States, which would mean in effect the dispossession of the ABC as the national broadcaster to community broadcasting status. This contrasts with the positive or deliberative role of press freedom that is recognised in some European countries (Jones, 2002).
Professor Nash concludes by stating:
In short, the Australian constitutional framework for freedom of the press is weaker than in other liberal democracies, the commercial pressures are strong and the legislative and financial impact of recent national governments on public media alternatives has been detrimental.
It is crucial that the federal government back off from altering our crucially important cross-media ownership laws. The battle to save these laws has major implications for Australian democracy, as the government's own ministers have acknowledged. I urge the Senate to stand firm on this issue. The Australian public will be grateful to them for doing so. The fact that the present government are even attempting to enact a law to see Australia's media become even more concentrated than it already is is about this government doing their mates a favour and has nothing to do with serving the Australian public at large.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-11-27,"—Thank heavens for the crossbench, because from where else would this debate this afternoon find sufficient speakers on an afternoon of such drama. I must say I am surprised not to see the member for Hinkler appear in this debate. The scarcity of speakers on the list is interesting, given a bill of such import. As we know, this piece of legislation, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2], is the amended version of a bill laid aside by the government in June this year. That original bill was subject to 48 amendments in the Senate, six of which were rejected by the government when it returned to this House. This reintroduced bill contains all those amendments agreed to by both houses, but crucially there is no inclusion of the amendment on which the original bill foundered—the Harradine or so-called Packer-Murdoch amendment.
There are significant changes in this bill compared with the original, especially around material of local significance. Item lAA of schedule 2 inserts a new section, 43A, which will ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Authority requires regional aggregated commercial television broadcasting licensees to broadcast minimum levels of material of local significance, including local news. Item 1AB in the same schedule applies the same requirement to metropolitan commercial broadcasting licensees, which brings us to developments in the media industry in recent days, namely the formation of a jointly owned service company by 2UE Sydney owner Southern Cross Broadcasting and 2GB/2CH owner Macquarie Radio Network. It is proposed that this so-called service company will provide news, sales, technical support and production services to all three stations. While the very act we are here amending states that one group cannot control more than two radio stations in the same market, we have here a move to create an entity that will effectively deliver the same news services to competing licensees. I note that two of 2UE's broadcasters, Mr Laws and Mr Carlton, have commented publicly on not only the absurdity of this but indeed, as I would suggest, their dismay at this development. While not affecting actual ownership of the licences, which would breach the act, I argue that the common editorial output will have the same effect that outright control of those licences by one owner would have. 
It is vital to consider this development in the light of the amendments we are debating here, which allegedly seek to quarantine radio editorial independence in each of the newspaper, television and radio newsrooms held by a common owner under a relaxed ownership regime. As a former metropolitan and regional television and radio producer and editor, I have outlined in earlier speeches on this legislation why such a separation is in reality impossible. In the case of the 2UE/2GB joint news plan, while the joint venture might be presented as a stand-alone that does not contravene the ABA ownership limits or regulations, the spirit and intent of the act—if this government and the ABA are serious—has certainly been broken.
It is interesting to note that 2UE and the proposed Sydney Radio Services will be collocated at Pyrmont. This is a very cosy arrangement for a supposedly independent company providing services, including news, to two competing companies. I am sure the operators of two Orange FM stations—2GZ FM and Star FM, which are owned by DMG—and AM station 1089, owned by AMI, would be very interested in collocating their news and other services in Orange, as indeed would be other operators in regional Australia who are all on the lookout for cost savings. But the fact is such mergers are completely at odds with the very amendments the government is trying to introduce here with its dilution of cross-media ownership—or at least it wants to give that impression.
It stands to reason—and this is backed up by the expert advice I have got today—that, if it is considered necessary to require editorial separation for commonly owned media operations in a licence area in order to maintain editorial and news separation, then it should also be necessary for individual licensees to maintain that editorial and news separation. The 2UE/2GB/2CH plan compromises the editorial independence of all three licensees and makes a mockery of competition in news—and other more commercial activities like advertising. It also narrows the variety of voices, stories, opinions et cetera available to the three audiences. It is a cynical interpretation of the act, which currently requires a licensee to `contribute to the provision of an adequate and comprehensive range of broadcasting services in that licence area'. In the 2UE/2GB case, the `contribution' becomes a collegiate product by a supply company jointly owned by the licensees. While the 2UE/2GB arrangement might not be in technical breach of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, it has the potential to negate one of the objects of the act, which is the promotion of `a diverse range of radio and television services offering entertainment, education and information'. This objective is spelt out even more clearly in the standard conditions of the commercial radio broadcasting licence, one of which states:
... the licensee will provide a service that, when considered together with other broadcasting services available in the licence area of the licence (including another service operated by the licensee) contributes to the provision of an adequate and comprehensive range of broadcasting services in that licence area. 
I have long argued that the pre-1992 broadcasting laws requiring each licensee to provide `adequate and comprehensive' news and other local services in their licence areas should be restored. In the absence of that, the licensees should be required to run stand-alone newsrooms. How would the public react if Murdoch and Fairfax or Packer established a joint company to provide copy, stories, video or new media to their various media outlets? Indeed, if multiple licensees in a licence area were all to outsource their news to a single entity, then it stands to reason that diversity would be reduced by the same degree that would occur if the licences were commonly owned with a pooled news capacity. What indeed would stop the sale of the 2GB/2UE joint service company to another media operator? This arrangement, as I understand it, was designed by former Packer man Sam Chisholm to sidestep existing broadcast laws, not these amendments that are supposedly going to protect the listening public from the very outcome that Southern Cross and Macquarie are hoping to achieve by their newsroom merger.
If the 2GB/2UE model were to be adopted widely, it would have significant implications for regional Australia, where commercial radio markets typically have only two owners with a licence. Orange is one such market in my electorate. There are 18 such markets, including places like Dubbo, Newcastle, Wollongong, Bundaberg and Townsville, to name a few. It would also open the way for a return to something that occurred when I first went to Orange in the late 1970s and which occurred when I worked for Channel 7 Sydney in the sixties: newspaper companies could start to provide news services to broadcasting licensees and thus completely bypass the alleged intent of these cross-media controls. We would see a return to the brave old world of the fifties and sixties when the Seven and Nine networks and radio stations and newspapers were all part of two large media conglomerates with common editorial content.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I raise in the adjournment debate the case of Ms Cynthia Talato and her treatment by Australia Post management at the Sydney West Letters Facility at Strathfield. It appears that Ms Talato has been discriminated against on the grounds of her sex, her race and her recent election to the position of Divisional Vice-President, Affirmative Action, within the CEPU communications division. Australia Post management at SWLF seem to have waged a campaign to have Ms Talato removed from the Strathfield based facility because of her union links and the fact that the predominantly female, and largely Filipina, work force look to her for advice. Management have gone to extraordinary lengths to move her back to the Sydney Parcel Centre at Clyde against her wishes.
As an employee of Australia Post for over 20 years, Ms Talato has, for the past three years and nine months, been a member of the support team at the Strathfield facility. This body consisted of three union nominated representatives and three nominated by management. Its role was to support the 52 newly formed teams operating at the facility. Prior to her appointment to the support team on 6 January 2000, Ms Talato was employed in an AO4 position at Parcels and Logistics at the Sydney Parcel Centre at Clyde. 
From 6 January 2000 to 19 September 2003, Ms Talato acted in an AO5—B class—position unattached at the Sydney West Letters Facility. This was in recognition of the higher duties that followed her appointment to the support team. On 21 August 2003, following Ms Talato's election to the position in the union as vice-president, a decision was taken by Australia Post to disband the support team, claiming the decision was due to the cost involved. At this stage it was necessary to reassign the nominated members of the team to new roles as they were all technically unattached while working on the support team.
The other two union nominated members, Mr Peter Psomas and Mr Zoran Ristevski, were reassigned to attached positions within the Sydney West Letters Facility. Ms Talato, on the other hand, was not offered a position at Strathfield. In fact, she was informed that she would not be considered for three AO4 positions that she was amply qualified to hold. It is alleged that management then attempted to coerce staff holding AO5 and AO6 positions to take up these positions on a higher level of pay to ensure Ms Talato could not be considered. Upon returning from a three-week period of sick leave, a new position was `created' for Ms Talato at Clyde: she suddenly became a project officer AO5.
Whether people are Filipino, whether they are women and whether they belong to or are actively involved in a union, employers have no right to discriminate against them. I am appalled that in an area of work activity where many Filipinos from my electorate are engaged there does appear to be a blatant case of discrimination against Ms Talato (1) as a woman and (2) because she held a union position. I think that is totally unacceptable in this day and age. I hope Australia Post management will look at this case again and reconsider it. If not, I regret to say that I will be forced to progress the matter to HREOC—the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Workplace Relations: Workers' Entitlements</title>,Adjournment,18,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—This week in parliament we have had some bills relating to the Commonwealth funding of state primary and secondary education. We all appreciate the importance of education to the life opportunities of the youth of Australia. It is significant that this week in the parliament we have had the youth of Australia debating issues that are important to them. Their schooling is very important to their life opportunities, and it is most important that the Commonwealth government involve itself at the national level on a strategic basis in the education of every Australian child. That has been given expression through the bills that come through this parliament allocating funds for educational purposes.
I want to raise a matter today which is of deep concern to me, and it relates to a school in my electorate. Some time ago, the principal of Corio Bay Senior College came to me seeking support for a program to encourage young mothers to return to school to complete their education. The principal was successful in rallying the community behind this proposal and day care facilities were established at the school which have enabled these young mothers to return to school. The school is in the process of setting up a permanent child-care facility. This year eight places were secured. In 2004 the school aimed to have 12 to 15 places. Eventually 30 places would be offered. The school employs a support worker for the young women to ensure their transition back to school is a smooth one. The support worker runs additional programs which develop parenting skills and assist with the organisational aspects of having a family and studying at school. The students and the mothers appreciate the child-care facilities being on-site and in a secure location.
The program is linked to the Best Start program, which is about breaking the cycle of disadvantage for these young women. It is disturbing that two weeks ago the principal, Stephen Boyle, received a letter from Senator Patterson saying that the funding application for this program had been rejected—even though this program has been highly recommended, it has been through the evaluative procedures for 15 months and a similar program in Western Australia seems to have received funding. The government can spend a billion dollars on a war in Iraq and it can spend $100 million on useless advertising, yet it cannot find the dollars to fund a worthwhile program for young mothers seeking to go back to school.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I have pleasure in rising to support the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment Bill 2003. It is a pleasure for me because, as shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, I see this as a small but positive step for an Indigenous community. It is doubly a pleasure for me because it is about an Indigenous community in my own constituency, and a group of people and an area of land which I know very well. I have been representing it, with only a slight hiatus, for the last 15 years. There has been a lot of progress made in those 15 years and this is another step that will be of value to them.
The legislation that is before us represents a modest set of amendments to the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act. It deals with three issues. As I say, they are modest amendments, but in two instances they are useful in making more efficient the activities of the Wreck Bay council, which is the council of the Indigenous community who are the owners of the Aboriginal land in the Jervis Bay territory. The third area involves a minor consequential amendment to the ATSIC-ATSIS split.
The first of the amendments reduces the quorum required for reconvened general meetings to 40 members. The Wreck Bay council has advised that it has experienced difficulties in securing the required quorum at general meetings, through which the council elects its membership and executive, and sets the annual budget and transacts business. There are currently 257 members of the Wreck Bay council and, at the moment, under the act the quorum is 129, which has proved virtually impossible to meet. Section 26A provides for a diminished quorum of members in the case of a reconvened annual general meeting where the initial AGM has failed due to there being no quorum. The council has advised that these numbers are unworkable. It is rarely possible to achieve attendance of more than 50 to 60.
There are three reasons why I support this proposition. Firstly, the council have requested it and, in my view, they are a legitimately representative body. Secondly, the 50 per cent attendance requirement, particularly at a reconvened meeting where adequate notice has been given, is much too high. I do not consider that the quorum being set at 40 out of 257 for a reconvened meeting is unreasonably low—every member of parliament is a member of organisations which have comparable quorums—provided adequate notice is given. It is a community in which the giving of notice is not complex and where the knowledge of such a meeting, particularly if there is anything controversial, spreads very quickly.
The second amendment extends the period of receipt of council by-laws by the minister from seven to 21 days. Section 52A(10) of the land grant act provides the council with the power to make by-laws that govern matters of concern to the people of the Wreck Bay community such as cultural activities, management, access, development and use of Aboriginal land, declaration of sacred or significant sites, control of visitors, and hunting, shooting and fishing on Aboriginal land. At the moment the section requires that the council provide the minister administering the land grant act with a copy of any by-law that it has made within seven days of making it. The proposed amendments will extend this period to 21 days, which is a more realistic timetable in which to comply with what is otherwise a reasonable requirement. The third amendment enables the registrar of the council to be an APS employee within an agency rather than an officer of ATSIC. It is merely a procedural point. I understand why the government requires it, but it is of no consequence to the local community which I represent. 
In my capacity as local member, I have consulted with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. I received a letter from its general manager, Reuben Ardler, on 17 September with the following comments. He said:
The proposed changes to the Aboriginal Land Grant act relating to the Quorum and the presentation of By-Laws to the Minister were requested by the Council to allow effective management.
In my discussions on previous visits to Wreck Bay the issue of the quorum was raised with me. The by-law issue had not previously been raised with me, but I can see the merit in it. It has the support of the community council, and I am pleased to support it.
Not this particular amendment but the core which it is amending—the land grant at Jervis Bay—is quite an important initiative. For those who do not know, the Jervis Bay Territory is located near Nowra on the south-east coast of New South Wales. It is a Commonwealth territory. For the Jervis Bay Territory to be represented in the parliament, it needs to be a member of a seat of one of the territories. Since it was created it has always been in the seat of Fraser. I have had the honour of representing it as a senator and as a member of the House of Representatives, and I have visited the community on about 50 occasions over those 15 years. 
Approximately 92 per cent of the Jervis Bay Territory has already been granted as Aboriginal land under the land grant act, and the remaining eight per cent is currently the subject of a claim under the act. This granting of land was done in two stages. The first grant was in 1987 and commenced on 15 January 1987. This allowed for an initial grant of 403 hectares of the Jervis Bay Territory—including, most importantly then, the Wreck Bay village—to the local community. There was a further grant in 1995, which commenced on 29 September 1995. This allowed for the existing Jervis Bay National Park and the Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens—now known as the Booderee National Park and the Booderee Botanic Gardens—to be granted to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community. 
Those core changes, which I was proud to be associated with as a member of the previous government that made those decisions and as a representative of the community, have fundamentally changed the lives of people in Wreck Bay. These changes have opened up a lot of economic and employment opportunities, and have given a lot more pride to the community. The preservation of the effective Indigenous management of that land by the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council is something which I support strongly in principle as shadow minister and which, on the ground as a local member, I have found to be a very important issue on behalf of a small but significant constituency of mine. I am pleased, therefore, to support the legislation.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND GRANT (JERVIS BAY TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—I rise today, as one of the portfolio ministers in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, to thank the member for Fraser for his and the opposition's support for the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment Bill 2003. This is part of an ongoing ambition of the government's to keep the power to determine the destiny of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people firmly in their own hands. This form of empowerment means that these modifications to the act have been supported by the relevant community council—the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. I think these three changes to the Aboriginal land grant act are very straightforward, and it is good that there is all-round support for them.  
An ongoing commitment of the government's is to assist in the achievement of positive outcomes for the administration of legislation for the benefit of the Indigenous members—the original people—of our nation. It is important that they find the dignity that we seek to ensure through these sorts of measures. In fact, in a number of cases the council requested these particular amendments. 
The three changes, which were outlined in the member for Fraser's contribution and in the second reading speech, seek to modify the quorum requirements for the meetings of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. They extend the period of time by which the by-laws are presented to the minister and allow the office of Registrar of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to be filled by an Australian Public Service officer within my portfolio. 
The original act was passed in 1986. It was to enable the small but nevertheless now very successful Aboriginal community in the Jervis Bay Territory near Nowra to hold freehold land. The act established the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, which held title to the land. The council have passed on the opportunity—indeed, they have shown great gusto in seizing that opportunity—and a vibrant community now exists at Wreck Bay. They have established themselves in that area, which has also become a popular tourist attraction. 
This act requires a register of members to be established. At present, the council has some 257 members. General meetings are to be held on a regular basis. The need to modify the quorum is about ensuring the good flow of decision making. The present quorum levels are somewhat excessive in the practical running of this organisation, and we hope that this bill will rectify the problem to a large degree by allowing the quorum to be satisfied if 40 members are present. The community council have shown themselves to be capable and active. On that basis, we are happy to back their judgment through this legislation.
By facilitating the holding of reconvened general meetings with less members, the bill will enhance the operation of the council. We believe important business will therefore be able to be transacted without the need to postpone meetings. It has been a cause of frustration when the larger quorum requirement has meant that important business has had to be put off. Because of the vibrant, popular tourist attraction situation that the community now enjoys, obviously we do not want to see decisions that could be made being put off to a later date.
The bill also extends, from seven days to 21 days, the period in which by-laws made by the council have to be presented to the minister. This is designed to enhance the operations of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council by giving them more time to prepare the documentation to the minister and to consult with any further interested parties to ensure the requirements of the legislation have been met. Finally, the registrar of the council, through the passing of this bill, will be appointed from any APS agency within the Indigenous Affairs portfolio. This will accommodate the transfer of functions from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services. 
The bill reflects the government's commitment to achieve positive outcomes in the administration of the land grant act, and it is all about benefit for Indigenous Australians within our community. It is to give them the strength and encouragement to feel confident and connected to the nation that they have nurtured for so many tens of thousands of years. I commend the bill to the House.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—Our Constitution is a living document. As a living document, it was designed to be amended at various times throughout the history of this country. As our culture, lifestyle and needs as a society change, our Constitution also needs to be changed. So I support constitutional reform. It is interesting that this particular piece of constitutional reform has been put forward by a Prime Minister who has a history of obstructing constitutional reform, a person who I think would describe himself as a conservative person who generally does not embrace change but would rather see the status quo maintained.
The last issue of constitutional reform that we looked at was appointing an Australian head of state. The Prime Minister was vehement in his opposition to that reform, a reform that I believe would have taken us into the 21st century as a nation that was prepared to look to the future and move forward. So it is interesting that, on this particular occasion, it is our Prime Minister who is embracing this reform. You have to question why, all of a sudden, a man who has made a profession out of not accepting reform, a man who has always opposed reform, is now prepared to push the reform of section 57 of the Constitution.
I would argue strongly that this is happening for political reasons. I think the Prime Minister was quite honest in the speech he made to parliament, when he said that this was being done to push through those pieces of legislation that had been blocked in the Senate. This brings us to looking at the role of the Senate and its function. I have spoken to people in the community and the electorate I represent here in this parliament. They rather like the idea that the Senate has the ability to review legislation and, at times, step in and block legislation.
We have provisions in section 57 for a double dissolution. It is important to note that over the years there has only ever been one joint sitting of parliament following a double dissolution. There have been six double dissolutions. The joint sitting was in 1974. In 1951 the legislation the government went to the people with was passed because the government had a majority in the Senate and were able to facilitate the passage of the legislation through the Senate.
The government, and the Prime Minister in particular, have put forward a proposal that would disenfranchise a number of people who voted for the Senate. It is common knowledge that there is a difference between the way people vote in the House of Representatives and the Senate. People do that because they look at the issues, think about the issues and use the Senate as a safeguard. 
The proposal put forward by the Prime Minister is that, once the House of Representatives has passed a bill, if the Senate rejects and fails to pass the bill or passes the bill with amendments which the House does not agree with, then at least three months after the date on which the Senate acted or failed to act the House of Representatives will again pass the bill. If the Senate then again rejects the bill, fails to pass the bill or passes the bill with amendments to which the House does not agree, the Prime Minister will ask the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of the houses of parliament. If an absolute majority of the members and senators agrees to that legislation, then it can receive royal assent.
I oppose that particular option unconditionally because I believe that the people I represent in this parliament—and I do not say this lightly—do not support that position. To go to the Australian people with that proposal would not be the right action by the government, because they would not receive support. This would not be a successful referendum, and the people of Australia would certainly point out to the government that they do not agree with this option.
The second option put forward by the government has more merit. It allows for a joint sitting of parliament after an ordinary election. That would work to ensure that the views of the Australian people were considered. The Australian people would know that, by voting in a certain way, they would in fact be facilitating legislation that had previously been rejected.
We on this side of the House cannot agree to that particular proposal unless the government looks at including in it a mechanism that would prevent the blocking of supply in the Senate. I think that is very important for good government and very important for the way we function as a nation. It will deliver certainty to government and it will ensure that a government can actually facilitate its program. The other issue on this side of House is fixed four-year terms. We have a fixed four-year term in New South Wales—the state that I come from—and it works very well.
—I was part of the cabinet that brought it in.
—Yes. We also have it at local government level, and it works very well. It delivers certainty. It allows government to plan and it stops opportunism—the calling of opportunistic elections. I can understand why this Prime Minister would oppose that. He is probably the most opportunistic Prime Minister that we have ever had in this country—and one that seeks to divide our communities and use that division to promote his causes.
If you are in a situation where you have a fixed four-year term, you cannot exploit situations to your benefit to the same extent. If a government has a fixed four-year term, it has the ability to go to the people with its policies. It then has time to implement those policies, and the people of Australia have time to consider the success of the government and the policies that it has implemented. Finally, in that last period of government, the government and the opposition can put their policies and proposals to the Australian people and they can give their vision of where they would like to see Australia go. It is a much sounder approach to government. It is an approach that is in place in New South Wales and Victoria. It is a system that I believe would deliver good government to the people of Australia. It is a system which already delivers good government to the people of New South Wales and Victoria. 
The Leader of the Opposition put forward a proposal in the House that, if you are having constitutional reform, it should not stop with section 57; you need to consider all areas of the Constitution that need to be updated and you need to look at it holistically. His suggestion was that we have a joint parliamentary committee that would be involved in this process of constitutional review. I think that would have been a very good path for this parliament to go down. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister refused to allow that to happen—which once again puts in question his real commitment to constitutional reform, as opposed to political expediency.
Any reform needs to be driven by the people. It should not be reform that is driven by a political party or the executive of the government, reform that is just about ensuring that they can have unlimited power and can force through reforms that suit their political agenda. Rather, reform to the Constitution should be about ensuring that the Constitution continues to be—as described in the executive summary, which I am sure that the Prime Minister had input into—the `bedrock of stable democratic government in this country', as it has been for over 100 years. If that is to continue it has to be a document that is not a political document but, rather, a document that the political system is built on, a document that the Australian people can trust, a working document.
The number of times that the Constitution has actually been amended is very small. Unless the government can come up with a proposal that will have bipartisan support then it has absolutely no way of getting this particular referendum supported by the Australian people. This government will not negotiate with people. It has shown that its approach to dealing with this side of the House is to ignore and refuse to discuss issues, and this is a prime example of it.
If the Prime Minister were genuine about wanting to reform section 57 of the Constitution, he would be looking at setting up a joint parliamentary committee. He would recognise that the Senate is a place of checks and balances and that the people of Australia vote the way they do when it comes to the Senate because they see that the Senate operates in a way to ensure that the government cannot just push through legislation that they do not support.
It is very important to note that the Prime Minister said that the legislative agenda of the government has been blocked. It is interesting to note that most pieces of legislation have passed—important legislation as well. The GST legislation was passed; the first two sales of parts of Telstra were passed. The government is getting through its agenda. The Labor government were in power for 13 years and at no stage did they have a majority in the Senate. What needs to happen is negotiation. We on this side of the House do embrace reform. We would look at reform of section 57, but we need to ensure that it is not done just for reasons of political expediency and that that reform is accompanied by a change to a fixed four-year term of parliament and includes the removal of the power of the Senate to block supply.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I too would like to make a comment on the paper before us, Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution. I have to say at the outset that I am a little bit sad that we are having this debate so late in the parliamentary session because I feel sure that, if that had not occurred, there would have been more people speaking on it. But with the business arising in both houses at the end of a session it makes it more difficult for a lot of our speakers to come forward. I am sorry they have not because what they should be doing is having a good look at this paper, Resolving deadlocks. I know it is only a discussion paper but when you read it very thoroughly you come up with different interpretations of what the intention is truly about. 
We as a nation have come a long way since Federation. But after reading the Constitution I believe our founding fathers truly understood the nature of politicians. The Senate, as we are continually informed, was set up as a state house. It is important in the debate that we are having at the moment, I believe, to quote from a very important chapter of this paper—that is, chapter 3, on page 19. The discussion paper said, and I want to have this on the record:
It was envisaged—
that is, when the Constitution was first drawn up—
that if the Senate was to use its authority to block legislation it would be doing so in its capacity as a states' house, representing state interests. 
Indeed, it was particularly important to the larger colonies of New South Wales and Victoria that a deadlock provision be put in place to prevent the smaller states exercising disproportionate influence on issues that affected the population at large.
It is very important to remember that, because some of the points that I am going to raise in this particular discussion in taking note of this paper refer to that. Section 57, we are told, was the most debated clause of the 1897 Sydney convention. Since 1901, a double dissolution election has under this particular section of our Constitution, section 57, been invoked six times. I know that previous speakers in this debate have referred to it, but only once—in 1974—was a joint sitting convened to pass bills blocked by the Senate. Of course, we all remember that refusal to pass supply. Section 57 itself was not capable of resolving any deadlocks at that time dealing with supply. So, if we are really looking for assistance in resolving disagreements between the House of Representatives and the Senate, let us look at fixed terms and the overall composition of the Senate. I will refer to the issue of fixed terms later. The previous speaker, my colleague the member for Shortland, referred to that as well, and I made a comment at the time that I was part of the New South Wales government when we looked at changing our terms so it became more definite for the public. Fixed four-year terms do work, and they work well.
I want to refer to the composition of our Senate. I know that my colleague the whip, the member for Franklin, coming from Tasmania, may not agree with me, but I am afraid this is how I feel, and I believe these are comments that must be made. In 1901 we had six senators elected from our six states; in other words, we had 36 people in the Senate. In 1943 this was increased to 10 senators for each state; that is, 60 senators. In 1975 this increased to 64 senators because we added two each from the territories: the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.
 In 1984 we increased to 12 senators from each state plus the four from the territories; in other words, our present 76 senators. I personally believe—and I put this forward in the context of this debate—that it is section 24 of our Constitution that needs to be changed. That section requires the number of members in the House of Representatives to be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators. We know and cherish the one vote, one value system. As that has been in place for many years now, we have seen that the House of Representatives does change in numbers. When the House of Representatives increases, it reaches the stage where the Senate must too. That is why I come back to that clause of our Constitution. That has to be looked at as well.
Our Senate will continue to increase in numbers and we will see a reduction of quotas required. This only stands to reason. Our present population is some 20 million. As the number of voters increases so our House of Representatives one vote, one value will increase and therefore—referring to that section of our Constitution I mentioned previously—we will see the number of senators increase. I want to talk about quotas and the Senate's structure. You do not have to be a mathematician to realise that, if you have a smaller number of senators, you have a greater quota. From 1949 to 1983, 16.67 of the vote at a half Senate election was required to elect a senator, or if they had a double dissolution then 9.09 per cent of the vote was required. Now, with 12 senators, the quota is 14.29 per cent, or if it was a double dissolution then 7.69 per cent. I am emphasising those figures because, being a House of Representatives member, when I contest elections I have to get a majority from 80,000 to 90,000 voters to be elected. So it seems quite extraordinary to me that there are 12 senators being elected based on that particular quota. 
I, like many of my colleagues—and I mean this sincerely—have a great problem explaining to our new settlers who become Australians citizens and even to young people who come of age and are able to register to vote that the state of Tasmania has the same number of senators, 12, as the state of New South Wales. I acknowledge that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, are from the state of Tasmania, as is my whip the member for Franklin, who is in attendance. When you talk to students, as we all do when we go around to our schools, about the composition of parliaments—how they are made up and how they come together—it is difficult to answer someone who puts their hand up and says: `Miss, didn't you tell us there are 12 senators in Tasmania? Well, why in New South Wales have we got 12 senators?' Then you have got to go through what happened with the Constitution; how it was first formed and how the Senate was originally going to be the states' house.
We have come a long way from that. In fact, the ACT will probably say that, as a territory, it has a greater population than Tasmania—or nearly so—and yet it has two senators. The two senators from Canberra will probably tell you that they are representing their people very well indeed, but we do have that problem of all the states having 12 senators. I might add to my Tasmanian colleagues that New South Wales does have a population in excess of six million. I thought I would just throw that in.
I acknowledge that we have to have a diversity of views, but to have it in such disproportion—as we do in this case—is very hard to understand. This discussion paper has stated that the proposals, or options 1 and 2, are: `not meant to replace but rather to supplement the existing mechanism'. I certainly believe that we can and should perhaps take action to bring our Constitution up to modern Australia's way of thinking, but it must not be amended or changed just because the government of the day—of either political persuasion—believe they have a God given right to have all their bills agreed to. Governments of both political persuasions have had to work with a Senate that they did not control for nearly every election since 1961 bar two, and they of course were the 1975 election and the 1977 election. Out of 20 elections since 1961 there have been only two occasions when the government in the House of Representatives had the numbers to `control the Senate'. When you look back at our nation over the last 40 years, you realise that it did not come to a standstill. I have lived those 40 years well and truly and, believe it or not, the sun rose every morning and it set every night. We have continued to govern in this nation. But looking back at that part of history, it was a coalition controlled Senate that rejected, between 1972 and 1975, 93 government bills of the then Whitlam government. I might add—and statistics will show you this—that those 93 rejected government bills amounted to 25 more rejections than the total number of rejections in the first 71 years of the Senate's history. They are quite extraordinary figures; nevertheless they are fact. 
It is really only the Liberal coalition that has ever blocked supply. If, from this inquiry, a decision is taken to amend section 57 and steps are not taken to address the Senate's power to block supply then what has really caused constitutional crisis in the past will repeat itself in the future. I would like to put on record—particularly for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the member for Lindsay, because I read her contribution to this debate as well and she omitted to touch once on the question of blocking supply—that I believe it is important to think about those points. I have never believed the cant coming from the coalition government that, by amending or rejecting a bill in the Senate, we are rejecting the Australian voters who have elected the government to office.
We really have, as our head of government in this nation, a Prime Minister not a dictator. Even the minor parties elected to the Senate under our current system—and changing or amending section 57 will not change this—are elected, as is the opposition of either political persuasion, to represent a particular group of Australians. In representing that particular group of Australians, they believe that when they are rejecting or amending a bill they are doing it truthfully and honestly. They are not doing it `to go against the voters of Australia'. Our Prime Minister Howard has stated more than once, particularly when he was sitting on the opposition benches, that the mandate view of politics is rubbish. He may not have it said it in those terms, but many a time he got up and said, `Don't talk about mandate; it is a will we are representing here as well in being opposition'. So thinking you are elected with a mandate to govern is not always correct.
I think the story has changed—and it has certainly changed with the then opposition shifting to the government benches. I can understand why. But I do not believe that we now should lie down to the whim of any particular group of people who feel that the time is right to keep the political pundits from focusing on a particular course of action and to turn a blind eye to everything else.
I do agree that there are people of goodwill who sincerely believe that change eventually must come. I am probably one of those. We cannot forever stay in a vacuum; but, more importantly, we must never change for the sake of change. As the old clich goes, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. If we are going to look in one direction—I repeat in the limited time I have left to me—we must look in more directions. I am particularly concerned that this discussion paper will be continually projected as the be-all and end-all. I do not believe it is. I do not believe, the way both models are being put together, that it is workable. We in the Labor Party have stated that we look favourably at reform, provided it is a very broad, conciliatory type of reform, and to working together to achieve that.
I repeat: I do not believe that we can change section 57 of the Constitution without realistically looking at the numbers in the Senate. I am not one of those people who believe we should have a single house of parliament. I believe that the Senate does a very important job; but I do not believe that, because they have amended something or have not passed a particular bill, it is going to stop the world. As I have said, we have seen it happen in the last 40 years when the people in the House of Representatives have not controlled the Senate, and we have seen that this nation has progressed forward. 
I say to those who have put this paper together: let us go one step further before we take that massive step—or even put this out as a referendum. And I wish them well, because if we look at history we do not have much chance of getting a referendum up; therefore we may not have the opportunity of getting this up. Let us put it out wisely, let us give more consideration to it, and, more importantly, let us look at the long-term ramifications. If we were to amend one particular section of our Constitution without looking at the very pertinent topic of the Senate's power to block supply, then we as legislators would be criticised for not taking that action. More importantly, we would be criticised for repeating the sins of the past. Let us look wisely, let us look well and let us have a lot more discussion about it.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—I call the honourable member for Bundaberg. I am sorry—the member for Hinkler.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2003-11-27,"—I accept the new electorate's name with great honour. I would like to start where the previous speaker left off. I think that section 57 is a very important part of our Constitution. As the member for Prospect said, and as we all know, it was one of the most fiercely debated issues in the constitutional conventions leading up to Federation. The reason for that is that we had—as we still have today—three reasonably dominant states and three states of lesser population; so in a federation there would always be a danger that the three larger states could gang up on the three smaller ones. The composition of the Senate, which was originally six per state, later 10 per state and, more recently, 12 per state, was designed to keep that balance.
I for one am offended; in fact, I am outraged that we pick on Tasmania every time and say that, because Tasmania is of a lesser population and the number of senators on a quota basis is infinitely fewer than that of New South Wales, somehow there is some fault there. I do not accept that proposition. I accept that Tasmania came into the federation on a very clear understanding, and the fact that we have moved on 102 years does not make the reality of that any less.
If we want a precedent or a parallel, we only have to look at the American constitution. There has been no move in the American constitution to give more senators to the large states on the east or west coasts at the expense of the inland states. There are still two senators per state, regardless of population. Our Constitution, with the Senate and the House of Representatives, was modelled largely on that, albeit within our system of government we use the Westminster procedures.
The Senate was put in place for two reasons. The first reason was for it to be a states house, a guarantee that the large states did not ever gang up on the small ones, and to be fair, as the previous speaker said, there were also checks and balances to ensure that the small states did not overexert their authority. The second purpose of setting up the Senate and the purpose it has exercised most, especially over the last 75 years or so, was for it to be a house of review—a check and balance on the House of Representatives. We should always remember that the House of Representatives is made up of single-constituency seats and members elected by the people. It is the people's house. It is modelled on the House of Commons and on the American House of Representatives. It is modelled as being a people's house—a one-vote, one-value house. And it is the house that governs the country; in the Westminster system the government is chosen from the people's house. 
The one thing the Senate was never meant to be was a parallel chamber to the House of Representatives. That was never intended by the founding fathers, but in reality that is what it has become, especially over the last decade or so. It has become a parallel chamber, exerting almost as much influence as the House of Representatives itself. I believe that it has gone from being a check-and-balance house, a house of review, to one that exercises its authority—for example, by not accepting bills if they are not in by certain dates and refusing point-blank to accept certain budget bills. Previous speakers have said that the Senate has only ever blocked supply on a few occasions; I accept that. But, when a government goes to an election seeking a mandate and then tries to implement that, obviously the money measures in the budget bills are an integral part of that, so you are frustrating a government's budget—and I am not talking about amending it here and there.
I give the example of the PBS. No-one wants to see the cost of the PBS increase. I do not want to see the pensioners of my electorate pay another dollar for their medicines. I do not want to see the full-paying pharmacy customers paying another $6 or so for their prescriptions. None of us wants that. But we also know that we live in a world where new drugs are coming onto the market every day, that we want Australians to have the very best health care—we are amongst the best in the world and we want to retain that position—and that the cost of drugs is increasing by at least 14 per cent per year. As you can see, even without taking the compounding factor into account, that means that drugs are going to double in price every seven years or so. If that is the case then the Senate, in frustrating that for nearly a full term of the parliament, is putting that whole system in jeopardy. If a government is acting responsibly and keeping the various buckets of money for education, health, roads, foreign affairs, agriculture and so on in balance and the Senate frustrates money going into the health bucket, so to speak, then, if we cannot provide drugs to people who desperately need them, the Senate has a lot to answer for. I use that as only one illustration.
What we also see is that, every time there is a crystal clear issue that we have debated in one form or another in both houses over a period of time, the Senate has an inquiry—they have a Friday inquiry, they have a full inquiry. We are talking today about an inquiry that all the commentators are saying may well be a total waste of money because the government's negotiations with the Democrats over the MedicarePlus bill are not complete—yet the Senate has gone ahead with an inquiry. I think the Senate has shown that it wants to be a parallel house, but where it cannot get its own way it wants to be obstructionist. When that occurs, you have got to ask: is the original intent of the Senate being fulfilled? I do not think it is.
I am quite comfortable with both propositions. I like the Prime Minister's proposition, although I have reservations. After a bill has been rejected once and rejected again three months later, I would have a further cooling-off period of another six months. There should be about 12 months from the initiation of a bill to when a joint sitting is held so that there is absolute certainty that the public and both houses of the parliament have adequate time to debate, understand and review the issue. I cannot see why a joint sitting, after a period like this and a number of rejections, could not be put in place.
The Lavarch model puts another covenant on that. The Lavarch model says that any bills that have met the double dissolution requirement as at the time of the dissolution of the previous parliament can be matters for consideration by a joint sitting of the new parliament. I am comfortable with that as well. That says to the public, `If you like what the previous government has done in policy terms and if you like the bills that have been racked up and haven't been passed, then if you re-elect that government you give them the opportunity to have those bills passed by a joint sitting of both houses.' That is a perfectly reasonable proposition; the public have the safety valve of an election to express their displeasure. Obviously if the public felt that the bills that were racked up for consideration after the election were in some way unfair, draconian or not in keeping with the government's original mandate or the spirit of what they said, then they do not re-elect the government. It is pretty simple stuff. 
We Australians need to think of our country in a modern, electronic world. We have to be able to react quickly to changing events and circumstances and to changing social and economic matters. We need to have not only a framework of governance but also the mechanisms of governance in harmony with a modern electronic world. To have the double dissolution provision that we have today, which requires a long, drawn out period and then a special election purely to pass the government's bills, is stretching the elastic a bit too far. The principles enunciated in the Howard and Lavarch suggestions are pretty good.
In conclusion, I want to come back to where I started. I reiterate that I do not think Tasmania or the Northern Territory should be penalised because their quota divided by the number of senators is any different from the other states. If we have a genuine federation, we have to respect the smallest and the largest. Coming back to what the house of the people and the house of review is all about, let us take ourselves back to the early part of last century when the House of Lords was frustrating the House of Commons in Westminster. That was a very interesting scenario because obviously the House of Commons was the people's house—it governed; the government was always formed from the House of Commons—but the Lords was, at this particular period, frustrating the will of the government. Of course the lords were not elected or even appointed in those days.
As I understand it, King George V threatened to create sufficient lords to make sure it passed. Even the king, the head of state, recognised that the people's house was being frustrated, and he was prepared to do something about it. We are in a different circumstance here and now. As I said, we have moved on to an electronic age in which our mechanisms of governance have to react quickly to world situations for the sake of Australia. We must have checks and balances, but I think section 57 does require greater attention. I would welcome it being put to the Australian people as a test of their view on whether we should have some more efficient way of breaking deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Debate (on motion by Mr Quick) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—The inquiry of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires has been an interesting one. Being the deputy chair of this committee, which took evidence for seven months, was a very worthwhile exercise. The bushfire inquiry started in some hostile circumstances when the federal government was out to find scapegoats. During the launch of the inquiry, the chairman was pre-empting the findings with federal criticism of the capacities of the states. I believe it is not in the best interests of the country to assign blame for those fires, or any fires. Those fires could well have happened anyway and, although there can be changes in responses, it is doubtful whether—because of the drought conditions, the higher than average temperatures and the lower than average rainfall at that time—anything would have made any difference. We can add to that the work that had not been done by a whole host of bodies, including some individuals, to eliminate the fuel loads in the days before the fires. So I do not think it serves any good purpose to try and lay blame in any one quarter, because we are all culpable in some way or another. 
I know the opposition has been pursuing the goal, since early 2002, of having a national strategy put in place using a lot of the knowledge gained from past fires. This had not been done, so the federal government had some liability there too after saying that they were going down that path. I believe that, from now on, we need to keep the response to the A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires report as bipartisan as possible so that many of the very good recommendations can be put in place. The COAG inquiry is starting, and hopefully that will pick up some of the recommendations. I believe that the members of the now disbanded committee which put out this report will be meeting with the officials of the COAG committee next week to pass on as much knowledge as possible, in the hope that we can assist in the ongoing development of a national strategy.
Within this committee we had some excellent discussions. It was very tough at times. There were a lot of difficulties, but the chairman and I were able to keep the committee going forward and we achieved a very good report in the end. The paper presented to the committee by Nic Gellie was very helpful in pointing out some bottom line problems. One point is that the major fires come around every 10 or 15 years, meaning that few people get experience in developing skills of strategic and local fire assessment. This leaves gaps in local understanding of ecosystems, terrain, fire, fire weather and short- and long-term climate patterns. This knowledge is vital to fashion more appropriate fire strategies to cope with specific fires. Nic Gellie pointed out:
... decisions are now made in fire control centres, remote from the fireground, which often complicate, slow, and frustrate flexible and prompt decision-making. Groups of people isolated from the fire ground, and its myriad of small rapid changes brought about changes in fire weather, fuels, terrain, and success or failure of fire suppression crews, cannot respond effectively and efficiently to rapidly changing scenarios. Decision-making then becomes reactive and loses momentum in pre-emptive planning and creating opportunities to limit overall threats of a fire.
Local people on the ground begin to lose confidence. People are pulled out of a fire because the imperative is that firefighter safety comes first and, without concrete knowledge, it is important to err on the side of caution.
We must start looking at changes to how we deal with fire and land management, how we look at training and how we approach developing a national strategy that takes into account local knowledge. Tasmania is getting to the stage of having highly integrated public land management and fire management, and sophisticated planning is being employed in implementing strategic mosaic burns to meet both fuel reduction objectives and community expectations on the environment. One should remember that Hobart is one of the driest capitals in Australia, drier than Launceston in the north and also drier than Melbourne and Sydney; people do not always associate dryness with the wonderful city of Hobart. Because of the weather pattern in January and February, Hobart is very vulnerable to fire. Last season it was very vulnerable to a very large fire on the outskirts of my electorate, which could have quite easily entered the city and done some of the damage we saw occur in Canberra. It was probably a change of weather that saved us last year. 
Training goes on all the time at the local level, and equipment is being phased in that has multiple uses and is interchangeable within various services called on to fight fires. In Tasmania, national parks, the forestry commission and the fire service itself all are training management operators. Everyone is trained along the same lines and all the equipment is interchangeable. That is not the case in the rest of Australia. Regular audits of local equipment and ability are also part of our strategy, so that when it comes to an emergency we know what we have. You really need to have those audits in place. It must be known where assistance can be obtained and how long it will take to get it into the fight to suppress a fire. That is very important information.
I think the telling points that need to be addressed are on land management. Over the last 50 years the management of land in Australia has been gradually changing. People's aspirations are becoming greater and in the last 20 years or so this has developed into clashes between environmental views and traditional land management practices. Change has to occur, but what, how and at what level? What do we have to take into account in future fire periods, and what knowledge have we gained from the past?
Evidence to the committee from the wider community proved that fuel reduction burning was a very contentious issue. Discussions even threw up a perception that people did not like so much smoke throughout the summer, and I heard that Government House here once asked that no burning off be done because they had several garden parties set up. Because of the need to reduce fuel—and that can only be done during certain times of year under certain conditions; as borne out by the evidence to the committee—it is impossible to fit fuel reduction burns around events. There are only so many days to do the burn-offs, only so many days to do that fire reduction, and those days will have to be used. Our community will have to come to the conclusion that those days will be the days on which that burning is undertaken.
We may all have to put up with some smoke during our activities to ensure that our communities are safe. There can be no ifs or buts—smoke is a part of our summer nowadays. The argument is that hazard reduction burning is seen by some parts of the community as the main tool for fire prevention, whereas others have equally strong views that the practice ought to be either abandoned or severely restricted on environmental grounds because of the possibility of unwanted wildfires and urban sensitivities.
We also have a situation where some communities' attitudes have moved to accepting greater areas of our forests, bushlands and wilderness being set aside in national parks. These increased areas, along with members of the community stridently opposing broadscale hazard reduction burning, have made it extremely difficult for land managers, firefighters and the community to strike an appropriate balance between ensuring environmental outcomes that protect biodiversity and other environmental values and initiating measures to reduce loads on a sustainable scale to protect property and life. So there is an underlying basic conflict that needs to be understood and resolved by those in local areas as well as those who tend to criticise from afar. 
Other issues come into the long-term planning for fire prevention. These include planning considerations in local government. Past planning practices have allowed housing developments in inappropriate areas with individual property owners being permitted poor choices in the design of buildings and materials used in the construction of those buildings. Even the legal system in some states has made it difficult for local government to refuse to allow developments in sensitive and fire prone areas at the urban-bush interface.
Public education needs to be addressed too. Those seeking a rural lifestyle may be unfamiliar with the demands of living in a rural environment and the need to adequately prepare their properties for the eventuality of a bushfire. Many landowners are not doing enough to protect their properties at the urban interface, and this is putting others at risk. So crunch time is coming again, and recommendations raised in the report must be taken on board soon to prevent another tremendous fire season.
Recommendation 25 seeks to have the Commonwealth ensure that the Council of Australian Governments seek the adoption by all states and territories of multi-agency protocols and agreements for fire management, similar to those that apply in Tasmania between the groups that I mentioned earlier. This is vital for the development of a national strategy. Recommendation 26 continues with this. It seeks to get the Emergency Management Australia group to initiate a process involving the Australasian Fire Authorities Council and the Australasian Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations to review the coordination of cross-border firefighting arrangements and interstate deployment of firefighting resources. This has to be undertaken before the season gets under way. Recommendation 29 recommends that it is important that the Commonwealth commit funding for aerial firefighting beyond the 2003-04 season. We have to have greater flexibility with aerial firefighting equipment, and long-term contracts are necessary in this area to have the equipment on stand-by.
Recommendations 13, 14 and 15 are also important to ensure that we get agreements from the states on burning targets to some benchmark level that is seen as adequate to protect property, life and the environment. These recommendations include a national database that identifies fuel reduction areas, along with a database to be developed by the CRC to reach a national standard of fire mapping to actively map the extent, intensity, spread and overall pattern of prescribed fires and wildfires in Australia. People will be able to pick up a map on the computer and look to see where fires and mosaic burns have occurred over the last 10 years and make judgments about those.
Recommendation 16 talks of smoke modelling by the bushfire CRC to try to acknowledge community concern about smoke pollution so that we can do the best we can to keep smoke away from urban areas. That is not always possible, and I think education on why that smoke is there needs to be undertaken.
There are many other recommendations in this report, and they all need consideration by the COAG and the federal government. The report needs to see the light of day very regularly over the next few months—and maybe over the next year or so—so that discussions can continue and the conclusions and recommendations of this report can fit into real policy decisions and basic changes to the Australian context.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Recent Australian Bushfires Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—As the then minister responsible for national disaster relief arrangements, I had great pleasure in issuing the terms of reference and implementing a select committee of the House of Representatives, one that represented all the parties represented in that House. It is with great pleasure that I stand today to participate in this debate and to congratulate those who participated in the work of the Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires to produce this very comprehensive report. 
There has been some comment, even from the member for Lyons, that there was some politics involved in this issue. The only politics that has arisen throughout this debate is from those who claim there was politics involved. The select committee was fully representative on a party political basis, and the politics came from those who wished to defend the mistakes they had made—particularly the premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, who forbade their agencies to attend. The excuse given was that they were all too busy, but they attended every public hearing of the committee. They were there, all dressed up in their suits or uniforms, listening in but not prepared to assist the committee with the expertise they might have brought to the inquiry.
There are aspects of this matter that need to be identified. The fundamental issues come down to two words: suppression or prevention. What purpose should we follow? Where should the major expenditure of government be? Should it be putting out your house after it has burnt down, hosing down the ashes? Should it be trying to put helicopters in the air when there is so much smoke they cannot fly? Or should it be implementing policies, practised historically in Australia by the Aboriginal people, of keeping fuel loads down to a level below where wildfire of almost nuclear proportions can develop?
I have heard many arguments over time. As soon as there is a fire somewhere, the media want to focus on who lit it. It might have been lit by natural causes, of course, such as lightning. But let us say it was lit by a careless smoker or—unfortunately, but frequently—by children who have a fascination with matches. It might have been lit by a careless worker using an angle grinder on a bad day. But the fact of life is that those fires would go nowhere if there were not adequate fuel to sustain them. I have said to many a journalist: `Go home tonight, put some 50 millimetre logs in your barbecue or lounge room fireplace and try to light them with a cigarette butt. If you like, go and get the angle grinder and try to light them. You can't.' We have to realise that there are no fires without fuel.
Prevention is a better solution than burying four or six people around Australia and wiping out 400 houses in Canberra alone. Let us look to history to find out how this might be done. Deputy Speaker Adams might be interested in what Abel Janz Tasman wrote in his logbook in 1642 when he was at the north end of Storm Bay, Tasmania. He talked about massive trees and went on to say:
... the country was covered with trees; but so thinly scattered, that one might see everywhere to a great distance amongst them ... Several of the trees were much burnt at the foot ...
That was the forest that people say we are supposed to protect. But it is not the forest today. I could go on.
In Western Australia in January it gets a bit hot; it is not exactly the time you would light fires. But William de Vlamingh, commander of the Dutch ship Nijptang during January in 1697 at the Swan River recorded:
No men were seen but they observed many smokes ... 
The Aboriginals were burning in January with safety. Why? Because they burnt all the time, as recorded by Governor Phillip, when he wrote in 1788:
... and they—
the Aborigines—
are seldom seen without fire, or a piece of wood on fire, which they carry with them from place to place, and in their canoes.
	...	...	...
The natives always make their fire, if not before their own huts, at the root of a gumtree, which burns very freely and they never put a fire out when they leave the place.
That is the history of it. That is not criticism; that is the way they managed. And they never got killed in bushfires because the bushfires never had the fuel. This is interesting because it is a matter of history. I have an interesting extract of an article published on the American ABC News web site on 18 August 2000. It reads:
With wildfires raging out of control in 13 Western states, Rex Wahl has seen enough. Like a peace-loving homesteader who finally reaches for his six-shooter, the influential environmentalist has unholstered his chain saw. Wahl is ready to cut down trees to save the forest.
There is an environmentalist looking out for the environment. I could go on to explain that he saw massive destruction of 200 homes in a fire near his place. The article is interesting because it talks about history. It went on:
A century ago ... healthy conifer forests sprouted 25 to 70 mature trees per acre. Lush meadows filled the gaps.
	...	...	...
 Today's forests stand in cadaverous contrast. After a century of fire suppression, as many as 850 spindly trees per acre clog the same forests. More than half stand dead, starved for sunlight and strangled by insects that bore into them.
I can take the member for Lyons to parts of the great forests of Tasmania where he will see that the dead trees are in predominance. Prevention requires us to go back to history.
Four years ago I was the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. Back in 1988 I read of the devastation of Yellowstone National Park. It still has not recovered. The fires got so hot that they burnt a metre into the ground, as happened in the Snowy area. The trees in the Snowy area are not growing back; there is no soil there for them to grow on. It was burnt out.
But I called a ministerial council—and for the information of members there were two Liberal ministers present, one representing the ACT. I had them briefed by Australian firefighters who had been to America and seen the devastation—the damage to the environment, private property and human life and the huge costs involved for the taxpayer. I got them briefed by one of the leading firefighters, who told them that it was all going to happen in Australia. When I asked them as federal minister—and there has been some reference to us taking the lead in a national strategy—what they thought they should do about it, they said, `We had better put out a press release.' I said, `Is that press release going to have some reference to prevention?' There was deathly silence around the table, then someone said, `Are you talking about cutting down the odd tree?' I said, `That may be part of it.' Their response was, `If we have to touch one tree, we will not do it.' There are an awful lot of dead trees now, and it was a deliberate decision by the state ministers at the time not to do anything. 
What was going on in New South Wales? The National Parks and Wildlife Service were taking over all of the declared national parks, immediately going in, as this report identifies, ripping up the old forestry roads, which were apparently a symbol of past decadence, pulling out the bridges and making it impossible to get the normal suppression measures of a water tanker and maybe a piece of earthmoving equipment in to address the fires when they started. Furthermore, they had an absolutely deliberate opposition to hazard reduction, which is highlighted as the first recommendation of the McLean committee and others that have been conducted in recent times. They deliberately opposed doing it. In their own report they identified that they were down to doing hazard reduction on 0.5 per cent of the area under management per annum, whilst in the remaining areas of New South Wales forest still under the management of state forests hazard reduction was being done on 15 per cent a year.
We have people like Koperberg, who is put up as some sort of hero but is never seen near a fire—he is just a television man—getting up on the 7.30 Report with Kerry O'Brien, saying that it was impossible to do 85,000 hectares of hazard reduction a year and hinting that that was one per cent of New South Wales, as though there is no Sydney and all of New South Wales is covered in trees. That is blatant misrepresentation when you are talking about life and death and massive environmental destruction.
In the last two fire years state forests have had negligible fires within their area of responsibility. The National Parks and Wildlife Service have had millions of hectares burnt. What does that tell us? You cannot say it is not a fact. It is a fact. Of course, notwithstanding the sneering at me and others for trying to raise these issues four years ago, I was consequently accused one day by the state minister—who for a change came out instead of leaving it, as usual, to his minions, Koperberg and, I think, Gilbert, who as public servants should be out there putting out or preventing fires, not being television identities—of wanting to bituminise the forests of New South Wales. What a load of silly rubbish, when I was standing up and warning all Australians that the tragedy that has now occurred was imminent.
In frustration, I eventually put myself on the Laurie Oakes show one Sunday morning and I made these predictions—and I had a look at a copy of that particular interview just the other day. The next day I was attacked throughout Australia in the print media, and the Sydney Morning Herald went as far as to say—quoting, I think, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is a great expert in all these matters, run by a guitar player who, I guess, has some connection with wood; he has it in his guitar—that Australian native trees were naturally fire retardant, to which I replied, `Does that mean we can spread woodchips on future fires to put them out?'
This raises another issue, about which I have corresponded with the Press Council. Does the Australian media have a duty of care? For that matter, did the National Parks and Wildlife Service have a duty of care? Why did Koperberg pull his barrister down in, I think it was, Batemans Bay during the recent coronial inquiry when his barrister started to get up national parks and wildlife witnesses as to what they had done? There is a duty of care, and it goes well beyond firefighters. It goes to the people who live reasonably close to forests, such as the people here in Canberra. Does the media have a responsibility not to be carried along by guitar playing greenies but to put some proper substance into these debates so that people know their homes and lives are at risk? 
I found it outrageous that I was attacked in that way—as I was attacked when I came out after the fires here and said that there should be an inquiry. I was told that I was insensitive, that I had made some insensitive remarks. That report was made on the ABC and, when we asked them to give us evidence, they apologised and withdrew the remark. But that did not stop every other journalist, or the Labor Party in the House of Representatives the other day, making this allegation. When I challenged the member for Canberra to produce evidence, she produced a couple of transcripts that had no such insensitive remarks in them.
It is not an issue for politics; it is an issue of life and death. It is an issue of environmental destruction. This report and its recommendations, if followed, will assist considerably. It is just a pity that it was not seen as the penultimate document, with proper contribution from the state agencies in New South Wales and Victoria. More importantly, they have to work through the issues of prevention. You can have as many helicopters and as many firefighting appliances as you like but, if you have not reduced the fuel load, they will be ineffective when, as occurred in Canberra, the energy released by the fire is equivalent to one of the nuclear devices dropped on Japan. That is what it was. Those houses did not burn; they were blown up. Anyone who visited the area after the fire could see just that, particularly when you saw some houses left standing and others destroyed. They are the issues—and it is very important that the recommendations in this report be considered.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Recent Australian Bushfires Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I rise to speak in support of the report on the recent Australian bushfires. The House of Representatives Select Committee inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires was one of a number of inquiries conducted by state and federal authorities into those devastating events. There was the ACT McLeod inquiry and also a coronial inquiry in the ACT. In Victoria, there was the Auditor-General's inquiry and the Esplin inquiry. In New South Wales, there was a joint select committee on the 2001-02 bushfires, and a coronial inquiry has also been completed. At the national level, two inquiries have been conducted—the one we are debating today and the national inquiry on bushfire management, prevalence and mitigation being conducted in cooperation between the Commonwealth, states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG.
If the member for O'Connor would like to stay, in a little while I intend to refer to the ex-minister and make some remarks about his involvement. I also want to refer to what I felt were the political implications of the inquiry. It is something that one felt. Not a lot had to be said, but you felt that there were some political implications. Previous members of the committee from the ALP side have already emphasised that, and I indicate that that was also my feeling. The member for Canberra has indicated that she was concerned about the minister arriving in Canberra on 19 January and making some statements relating to the bushfire at what was a very inappropriate time when there was a lot of tension and a lot of emotion and the people were feeling very vulnerable. At times such as those, it is a good idea for politicians to get out of the way and let the firefighters get on with the job.
Another story that I picked up during the inquiry was that the minister's plane, while in Jindabyne, actually blocked a fuel tanker and the firefighting plane could not be refuelled for over an hour. Obviously I do not blame the minister for that—he was not the pilot; he did not park the plane. But it shows us that in times of crisis when we cannot make a contribution—we could have had a look too if we had wanted to get in the way—it is a good idea for us to stay out of the way until the firefighters have done their job and we can make an assessment. Other members of the committee have also indicated their concern. The member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor, said: 
Despite the overt political circumstance of this committee's establishment and, on occasions, its overt political manipulation, Labor members stuck with the task in order to keep faith with the people and communities around Australia ...
We did that in spite of some tension and in spite of some bullying tactics from the government side when we tried to raise particular issues. The member for Lyons also took the same view. He felt that there was an overly political tone because of the antics of the then minister. That was certainly the view we had, but we stuck with the job. In the long run, I think there were some people on the government side who helped very much to get the committee on track and made a good contribution. They took a moderate approach. We then felt we were able, with our additional comments, to support the recommendations.
I recall quite clearly the first day of inspections of the damage caused by the Canberra fires. As one who had only seen the effects on TV, it was certainly an eye-opener. We were forewarned. The committee was advised that people giving evidence were very emotionally affected by the fires, because of their life-threatening experiences—which at that stage we were not aware of—the loss of their family homes and the devastation of the surrounding countryside with extensive damage to flora and fauna. Clear evidence was given to the committee by the local firefighters that, in their view, the fires should have been attacked earlier, before they got well established, and that the mechanical and aerial resources should have been brought into play a lot earlier than they were.
As land management authorities did not give evidence to this inquiry, for various reasons, these genuine criticisms were not able to be fully tested. However, media reports indicated that the New South Wales Rural Fire Service had evidence that these fires had, within hours of ignition, on 8 January, become too dangerous to fight directly. I think it is significant that, in spite of the intensity of the fires—which are probably the worst we have seen in our lifetimes—there was no loss of life amongst the firefighters themselves. There was, unfortunately, loss of life, as we all know. This is in marked contrast to other fires around Australia, where there has been loss of life amongst the firefighters. Maybe the caution that was exhibited, and which has been criticised, was of some benefit in saving lives. Neither that evidence nor the media reports have been put to the inquiry, but they will be tested in the New South Wales Rural Fire Service evidence to the inquiry set up under the Council of Australian Governments. I believe that is in the process of commencing now, with appropriate people being appointed to that inquiry.
To come to some broad conclusions about the Canberra fires, it may be useful to look at evidence presented by organisations that were not directly affected by the Canberra fires themselves but were very much involved in the bushfire scene. I think that is important, because you have people who know what they are talking about but who are removed from the emotion involved in what were obviously very devastating effects for the people directly involved. One submission I would like to refer to was made by the Blue Mountains Conservation Society. I would like to refer to two points made in that submission. It said:
Lightning and arson are the two main causes of wildfire. Fires arising from these causes can not be prevented, but watchfulness of all in areas of risk can reduce the severity. 
The submission also made the point:
 A major risk factor contributing to the impact on people and property is that of granting development consent in high and extreme bushfire risk areas. This could be addressed immediately, preventing further building in such areas.
I think this is a very good point. Councils and other authorities have allowed residential developments in high-bushfire-risk areas. Another factor which has come though quite clearly—and which, I believe, was the major factor behind the fires—was the hotter, drier weather that we were experiencing at the time. Although this may be cyclical climate change due to global warming, leading to more frequent El Nino events, the federal and state governments share equal responsibility for not improving the control of these changes. As the submission says:
This must be addressed urgently, and by all Australian governments as any change will be over the long term.
Another important point made in this submission was about the lack of education and preparedness of the communities in general, which contributed to the severity of the impact. For example, in the Canberra fires, most residents were not adequately prepared to protect their homes or gardens and did not maintain them to reduce fire spread. Homes were not fitted with well-known and acceptable measures to assist in risk management. Furthermore, too many residents were not insured, contributing to financial impact. One of the issues with the fires was that most of the damage was done not by the fires moving past the buildings but, rather, from the embers getting into the buildings. In many cases the homes were destroyed after the fire had passed by. The argument was put that, had people been allowed to stay in their homes, most or many of the houses would have been saved. Where people did stay in their houses, they were able to fight the fires and no houses were actually lost. That is an interesting point that came out in this inquiry.
The other point made in the Blue Mountains Conservation Society's submission is based on a paper prepared by Stuart James for the rural fire service in the Blue Mountains district. The submission states that Stuart James found that hazard reduction burns are of limited effectiveness. I noticed the member for O'Connor previously speaking in this debate. He used the example of how the Aboriginals operated 100 years ago. I think we have to be prepared to recognise that things have changed since then and what may or may not have been effective in those days is not necessarily effective today. I think we have to be prepared to accept modern views and modern technology. Referring once again to Stuart James's report, in relation to hazard reduction burns, the submission stated:
The studies found that there was significant difference in results in dry and wet climatic cycles, with greater success in dry cycles. Effectiveness also depended on the aspect, and on the degree of shading of the ground and understorey. There is also a correlation between understorey heights and burn result ...
The submission also says:
Hazard reduction, other than by fire, eg slashing, mowing and thinning of vegetation, near the assets being protected will provide better protection for those assets than burning in remote areas. 
They are just some of the conflicting issues that we were confronted with. I would like to refer, once again—to give a broad approach to this inquiry—to some comments made by the CSIRO, which we all accept as being an authority on this issue. The CSIRO submission said: 
The severity of the recent fires was related to a combination of factors including the generally high fuel loads, the prolonged drought, and the weather conditions experienced during and after the fire ignition events (mostly lightning strikes and ember spotting). CSIRO has no data to definitively attribute cause, or link effect, to the various individual factors.
Further, the submission says:
The combination of fuel loads, drought, daily weather and fire ignition conditions on the worst days were a 1-20 to 1-30 year event. Canberra was experiencing a 1-10 year drought, could expect lightning storms of this nature in about 1-20 years and experiences about 3 days per year of similar extreme weather conditions. The need to understand what happened and to plan for future events is thus an urgent priority.
We have to learn something out of this; it is no good trying to apportion blame. A lot of good information has been provided. The Labor Party were happy, with some reservations, to support the conclusions of the report. We probably have to look at all of the reports that have come down. There is no doubt that those responsible for determining future policies on land management and fire prevention will have the benefit of evidence and conclusions presented to all these inquiries that I have mentioned and will not have to rely on any one particular inquiry which may have a political bent or may not have been able to hear all the participants in the bushfire field.
Finally, I thank the committee secretariat and staff for their dedication and work in putting this report together. Can I also say how impressed I was, as I am sure we all were, by the residents of Canberra and the surrounding areas who made submissions to the inquiry. We were also impressed by their commitment to the environment and to fighting bushfires generally.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Recent Australian Bushfires Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NATS,2003-11-27,"—Unfortunately, with my duties, I did not get to a lot of the hearings of the committee. But, having grown up on the lower Clarence River in northern New South Wales, I cut my teeth on bushfires and I think that, given my family background, I know quite a bit about the problems associated with bushfires, particularly in New South Wales. My family first went to the lower Clarence in 1889. My great-grandfather was involved in some of the very early management of the land in that area and probably some of the clearing, which is now criticised too, for farming. As I was growing up, my grandfather gave me a lot of advice on what needed to be done to manage the land, particularly the land we owned privately that was forested land.
If you go back through the history of Australia, you will soon realise that fire has always been a part of our environment. The fact is that if you look at the diaries of the old explorers—which people tend not to do at the present time—you will find that most of the countryside was in fact open grazing country. That was what the explorers reported as they went across it. In hindsight, the reasons for that are quite clear—the regularity with which fires, including wildfires from lightning strikes, went through the landscape, and its management by the Aborigines. And then of course most of the young trees were killed off. There were not the great forests that we have in certain areas today. In fact, in many areas of my electorate, particularly above Grafton, when Europeans first settled that area—including the Baryulgil Station, which was the big grazing station of the upper Clarence—they did not settle it because there were trees to clear but because it was open grazing country. That same country today, because it has been locked up and is no longer grazing country, is forest. Those forests have grown in the last 30 years because of the changes to land management. 
So land management is at the core of this problem. I am disappointed that the states have played a game here, and the reason for it is quite clear. The fact is that they are the managers of the public land in their areas and they can clearly see that they have a problem, but they are not addressing it. The problem is that they have so much public land they cannot manage it. If they try to manage it in the way that is in the best interests of the whole landscape, it is going to cost them a lot of money—and that is the real reason why they will not participate in this debate. It is the real reason why they are not engaging with a problem that is a real problem for the whole community.
My great-grandfather said that he learnt very quickly from the Aborigines, probably just from observing them, that the way to keep fuel under control was to use their method of management. Their method of management was not on par for the environment, by the way; it was for food. They used fire to get food, but in the process of course fires went right across the landscape. Much of our flora in particular has evolved through fire and would not exist if the landscape had not had fires through it. So it is something we have to come to terms with.
During my youth, even though much of the land was what we call crown land, it was either forest land managed by Forestry or, in many instances, leasehold land. Even the forest land was given grazing rights. There were grazing rights given over the crown land as well. On a very cool, clear autumn or spring day, I would see, especially as a young person going to school, fires rising. We used to call them horseback fires—and that is exactly what they were, because the graziers who had the lease on this land would take that opportunity to reduce the fuel. They knew that, if they did not reduce the fuel, they would have trouble later on in the hotter months of the year when they could get wildfires running through those areas.
I think it was Commissioner Koperberg who said, in an interview last year, `There's only a short window of opportunity.' That is absolutely right. There are very few days of the year when it is optimum to reduce this fuel. How was it done in the past? It was done in the past by the people on the ground. Hundreds of little lessees and property owners—and Forestry, and I will come back to that in a minute—took that opportunity to burn off little sections and keep the fuel down. It is only in recent years that that management has changed. I can recall the complaints, even in my area, by new settlers about the smoke in the springtime caused by these people reducing fuel. The new settlers said they came for the clear skies of the North Coast of New South Wales. Those clear skies can get awfully black at Christmas time if you do not have a bit of smoke in the autumn and the spring. You have to manage that properly.
When I was minister for forests in New South Wales, there was a whole section of the Forestry Commission whose job it was to reduce fuel. The section was run by one of the deputy commissioners of forests, Mr Roy Free. They had two fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters, and at the optimum time of the year they would drop incendiaries along the ridge lines to try and reduce some of this fuel, because that was in the best interests of the forests and of the flora and fauna of the forests.
We have this argument at the present time which has developed over the last decade and a half or so from extreme environmentalist groups who say that the only way to manage the land is to lock it all up and make sure that it is not affected at all—just put a fence around it and walk away from it. That is where we are getting into trouble. It does not matter whether you live in rural New South Wales or other parts of rural Australia or in the northern suburbs of Sydney—the risk is the same. When I fly over the northern suburbs of Sydney coming into the airport, I look down and say, `There is a disaster waiting to happen,' because my knowledge of fire is that it does not matter which way the wind is blowing—fire always goes uphill. I can assure you that those people who are living on the edges of those gullies in northern Sydney are sitting on a tinder box that will erupt one day. It is just a matter of when it will happen. 
It used to be the role in life of the Forestry Commission to reduce the fuel, but many of these areas have now been turned over to National Parks, and National Parks has a different attitude to this. I think that it is fair to say that the Premier of New South Wales would like to see himself with a place in history. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that he has a bit of an ego, and he certainly has a panache, I suppose, in certain ways for history—and certainly American history. But, unfortunately and ironically, I think in many ways he will be remembered in history as the Premier who caused the problems in New South Wales with the management of public land.
When I first went into the New South Wales house, Bob Carr was the Minister for the Environment and was responsible for national parks. He was in the Wran government in those days. Again, I do not think it is any exaggeration to say he is deep green. That is fine, but I think that the argument is flawed. I believe the argument is flawed because there is a report by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales which clearly shows that the majority of the fauna on the public land of New South Wales is in the forest areas that have been disturbed. Why is that? I think it is fairly obvious. It is because there is more food for the animals in a mixed growth forest. Koalas do not eat the leaves of old trees; they eat those of young trees. They eat young, nutrient-rich leaves. I have been in the bush all my life and I have seen them. They enjoy those. So the argument that you lock these areas up in the interests of flora and fauna is flawed. I think our grandchildren will judge us on that because, quite frankly, it is wrong.
The other issue is that when you have reduction burns in autumn or spring they are slow, cool fires. The fire probably will get no more than a metre off the ground because of the time of year, especially if you keep the fuel down to a reasonable level. This allows the animals and birds to escape. How do koalas try to escape from fires? They go up trees. That is their escape mechanism. But when you get these extremely hot, savage fires in the summertime and koalas go up the trees the fire gets them because you have an explosion throughout a eucalypt forest. 
I do not know whether anyone has ever seen the crown fires that can happen in a eucalypt forest. They are frightening because on a very hot day, with temperatures around 42 or 43 degrees and humidity of 20 per cent, you get this big fire. The eucalyptus gases from the leaves explode and the fire just runs across the tops of the trees. It is a frightening sight—it travels at enormous speed. In that instance the birds and animals, and the trees for that matter, do not stand a chance. I can take you to areas on the North Coast where a very hot fire went through some 20 years ago. The trees still have not grown back because of the heat of the fire at the time, although they will eventually.
The argument that you lock these areas up and that somehow this enhances the environment is quite wrong. I think we have to look very closely at the way we have been managing our public lands. There is plenty of experience out there in the community if we are prepared to use it—if we are prepared to listen to how these people manage the land. I am sure there is plenty of evidence, if we are prepared to look at it in an objective way, to show the best way to manage the land. 
As far as the built environment and the horrific fires around Canberra which triggered this particular report are concerned—although they were not the first: there were horrific fires in Sydney in 1993-94—I believe there is an enormous problem with planning. If you are going to build close to bushland in Australia, you have to be aware of the risks. I know many people love to build a house in the middle of the bush and say: `Isn't this a magnificent area to live in?' It is, until it turns nasty.
There is plenty of evidence around the edges of our cities, and in some instances in rural areas, where people have built in inappropriate areas. To take advantage of the environment, they have even built verandas and areas of their houses out into the trees. As I said, it is a wonderful aesthetic environment while the climate is benign but, as soon as the climate turns against you, you are in huge trouble. There are many issues with planning where the local governments in particular—in New South Wales they are charged with the responsibility of planning—need to look very closely at some of the planning issues associated with the risks from these horrific fires.
Fire will always be with us. That is part of Australia. Even if we reduce the fuel, it does not completely eliminate the problem of fire. In the area where I live, on the North Coast of New South Wales—a relatively high rainfall area for a country like Australia which does not get a lot of rain—there are some years when the fuel cannot be reduced, because it is too wet. So we do get a build-up of fuel, even in the best managed areas, and in those circumstances there can be some fairly severe fires. Of course, the more years it is left, the greater the risk. If we have a look at the United States of America, in the last four or five years—I was there in recent times—they have changed their ideas dramatically. There were areas in California, in particular, that had not been burnt in 30 or 40 years; and, all of a sudden, they have got horrendous trouble on their hands and a tremendous loss of property and life. Australia really is in the same situation.
As I have said, I did not get to a lot of the committee meetings, but I have read through the report and I think it is a comprehensive one. I just hope that people are prepared to look at it. I hope they put aside the politics involved and the fact that, in many instances, they have fenced themselves into a corner in the state scene. It is now going to be a very expensive exercise to try to manage public land, but that is absolutely no reason to ignore it.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—One of the most incredible experiences, not just in my own electorate during last summer's bushfires but during the extensive days of public hearings and going through the numerous written submissions—in fact, there were more than 200 submissions from my electorate—was seeing the usual, and justified, cynicism that so many Australian people have about government and reports actually dissipate.
When I was travelling around my electorate during last summer's bushfires, there was, admittedly, little I could do. I was not a volunteer firefighter. But what I could do was travel around the hundreds of burnt hectares in my electorate and speak to the people who were at the coalface of the fires, fighting the fires and doing things like preparing meals for the firefighters. These volunteers left their businesses, their farms and their places. I spoke to these people because, at the end of the day, the people I trust the most are those ordinary Australians who live not just in my electorate but in other parts of the country. They may not say much, they may not be at the front of powerful lobby groups but, through their actions and their generosity with their time, they contribute so much to our communities, particularly in the country, and have a very positive benefit for our standard of living.  
As I travelled around the fire-affected areas, they said to me: `Sophie, we need an inquiry. We need the federal government to get involved. We are sick to death of being told that we do not have degrees and we cannot fight fires properly. We are sick to death of state departments not adequately managing the land next to our properties. We have to spend hundreds of hours and a significant amount of financial resources dealing with things like feral animals and noxious weeds, and yet we have seen, over years and over decades, the build-up of forest fuel. We have just had enough.' Those of us who represent country electorates know that country people are used to adverse situations and natural disasters, and they are very patient. Sometimes I think they are too patient with respect to government action. And they have just had enough. Armed with that request and after consulting my other colleagues—including the member for Eden-Monaro, whose electorate was similarly affected through last summer's bushfires—and once, eventually, after much discussion, the federal committee was announced and appointed, I was very honoured to serve on the House of Representative Select Committee into the Recent Australian Bushfires.
Others who have been in this place longer than I have commented that this was one of the most difficult committees, if not the most difficult committee, they had served on in terms of the number of submissions, the hours of accepting evidence, the field trips and the general difficulty in reaching consensus on 59 very comprehensive recommendations. The difficulty, and let us not mince words about this, in reaching consensus on these 59 recommendations stemmed from the fact that state governments of all persuasions—but it just so happens that we currently have state governments who are all Labor governments—came under criticism.
Much of the report was based on the evidence of volunteers—people who have had to deal on a daytoday, season-to-season basis with these bureaucrats, people who have seen the systems of management of fires and crown land change and who were not afraid to speak. Unlike public servants in Victoria and New South Wales who were, disgracefully, gagged, these people owed nothing to anyone. I can understand some of my federal colleagues from the other side of the House not being prepared to be overtly critical of their state colleagues, even though they knew in their hearts that what these people were saying and what the recommendations have ended up saying was true. The over 500 pages of the report have said that it is pleasing—
—Committees should not be used for party political processes.
—It is not surprising that we have some members on the other side being upset.
—I am not being upset.
—Truth often hurts.
—The member for Chisholm has a city electorate. Let me remind her that she is fortunate that her constituents did not suffer the economic and environmental devastation of not just the last fire season but several seasons. It is very difficult at times for federal Labor members to be overtly critical of their state colleagues— 
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! The member for Chisholm!
—but it was pleasing that, in spite of some of their reservations, in spite of some of the difficulties they may have had, particularly with the state minister, Mr Haermeyer—but everyone is having difficulty with him at the moment, including many of his own state colleagues—the federal Labor Party members on the committee supported the 59 recommendations. At this point, it is convenient that the member for Chisholm is deciding not to hear that her federal colleagues supported the 59 recommendations—which is of course at odds with the Victorian government, which very conveniently brushed aside the recommendations.
The wonderful thing about this report is that everyone who sat on the committee, those who gave evidence and the thousands of people who have read it know that this is the voice of the people. If I have to trust anyone at all, it is not going to be the bureaucrats in state or federal departments; it is going to be my people on the ground who know how to fight a fire, who have fought them for decades and who do it, quite thanklessly at times, in the face of the bureaucracy and without any financial reward. It is to those people I would particularly like to say thank you. Thank you for putting aside for a moment that well-earned cynicism about what governments can do and about whether governments will listen to you. It is particularly touching and very humbling for me that you trusted me to work in Canberra to produce something that gave you a voice and gave you an opportunity to finally be heard.
The response to this very substantial inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires and the report, A nation charred: report on the inquiry into bushfires,has been absolutely tremendous. The report has already been read by a significant number of those who submitted their own thoughts to the committee and who gave oral evidence, and they are very pleased indeed. They share my concern, of course, to see that implementation of these recommendations is carried out as quickly as possible. Obviously these 59 recommendations will not be implemented overnight, but the onus is on all of us who understand that these things can easily be swept under the carpet and only brought to the fore with another major disaster, through our respective parliaments and political parties, to put party politics aside and do what the people of this nation have requested of us.
You only need to look at the majority of the submissions to see that, from one end of the continent to the other, people were speaking with one voice. From one end of the continent to the other, we heard that there has been a change in fighting fires, that there is not as aggressive an attack when a fire begins. We saw some very tragic evidence here in Canberra that the fires could have been prevented had there been an aggressive attack in the first instance in the rural areas of the ACT. That not only saddens me but also angers me, because there are innocent citizens out there who have suffered economically and emotionally and many families right across my electorate of Indi, and over the border in Eden-Monaro, will never recover financially. And why?
Of course we cannot control fires, but what we can control is the management of them. What we can control are the fuel loads. These people have suffered due to stupid and ill-conceived government policies—policies which parties on both sides have adopted from time to time. I feel very strongly and very passionately about our key responsibilities as legislators, members of parliament and representatives of the people to at least diminish the burden on those people of ill-conceived government policy. 
One of the most remarkable things I observed during the course of this very extensive inquiry was the guidance and chairmanship of the member for Eden-Monaro. I admired—and could only hope to emulate—his absolute patience and resilience through many meetings. I commented once before that, on one occasion, my patience was rather tried—and I suspect his was tried significantly more—when, for over 45 minutes, we debated the inclusion or exclusion of one word, and it was not one of those seminal words like `not'. At the end of the day, when looking at the final report, it was not a particularly seminal word, but I suppose we do need to go through a baptism of fire at times—and that was certainly mine.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his guidance in the lead-up to the committee actually being established, during the committee's deliberations and afterwards. I know he is as passionate as I am about this over 400-page report, its recommendations and the obligations we have to the Australian people who took the time to speak to us and to write to us—particularly those who, after having gone through drought and fires, took time out from rebuilding their lives and their businesses to give us their very unique insights.
There was also an extraordinary job done by the secretariat. The number of submissions that kept on flooding in was quite extraordinary. At one stage I did not believe that we would end up tabling the report by the allocated date, but the secretariat worked miracles. They worked wonders and they all worked extremely hard. The draft report that was produced was absolutely excellent and is a credit to them. I am sure I will sit on many inquiries over the course of this parliament—and perhaps, if the people of Indi decide to return me as their federal member, subsequent parliaments—but I doubt whether there will be too many other inquiries of the intensity of this inquiry or too many other inquiries which are as important to my electorate as this particular inquiry and report have been.
I again thank those volunteers in my electorate who gave of their time during the fires and gave of their time to give us evidence in the inquiry. I will work with them and with my parliamentary colleagues to ensure that we reverse the trend of ill-conceived policy ideas that have resulted in the destruction of the environment and the economic devastation of so many rural areas.
I thoroughly commend this report. For those members of parliament who dwell in the city and for whom bushfires are but a mere news clipping—and I am sure some of them would have gotten bored seeing bushfires raging in northeast Victoria for approximately 60 days last summer—I commend this to them. Perhaps they can understand the soul and the spirit of country Australia and country Victoria. It is not good enough just to pretend to latch on to our identity, which is so linked to the Australian bush, when it suits you politically. You actually have to help country people when it matters.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Recent Australian Bushfires Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-11-27,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak at some length about the A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires report. As a new member of this House, this was the first opportunity I had to sit on a committee and to find out about the committee process and how committees operate. I am sure there are many people out there in the community who really do not understand the importance of the committee process in the federal parliament. As a librarian archivist, I was aware of a lot of material produced by this parliament and a lot of reports. You see the end outcome, the 400 or 500 pages of the report, but you do not realise the amount of work that goes into producing such a report—over 500 submissions and thousands and thousands of pages that are a supplement to the report. As the previous speaker, the member for Indi, said, a lot of people—a lot of volunteers, a lot of ordinary Australians—have put a lot of effort into this report. I think it is quite unique. That is one of the most important values of this whole process, both in getting that information from the community and allowing the community the voice to put forward their views to the federal parliament. I think that was an important issue in regard to this bushfire report. 
The whole issue of bushfires is very hot, very heated, very emotional. We have seen with the previous speaker, the member for Indi, the emotion that surrounds this issue. This committee gave a lot of the people who had really been affected—who were scarred both physically and emotionally, and whose properties were affected by the recent bushfires that occurred earlier this year and the ones that occurred during the summer of 200102—the opportunity, where many of them had not had the opportunity, to present their views to politicians, to the parliament. That was the great thing about this committee—it was very open and gave the public the opportunity to present that information.
We are all very aware that the inquiry was, unfortunately, politicised. Various state governments decided not to submit information to the committee. I was dismayed by that. It is unfortunate. As the Greens member on this committee, when I was selected for the committee I immediately visited the local rural fire service in my electorate and spoke to some of the people there. I was given a detailed briefing on how they deal with bushfires. It was very impressive. In my electorate covering the Illawarra, we have had to deal with bushfires for a long period now. We had disastrous bushfires back in 1968. A large number of houses were lost and property destroyed and damaged. Since 1968, there have been great efforts on the part of the firefighting authorities in the Illawarra, the various state government bureaucracies and—dare I say it—the federal government to come up with management plans which deal on an ongoing basis with bushfires, which put in place hazard reduction and which identify areas in our local area that should not be burned or should be burned or whatever. 
So I was quite surprised when I spoke with the local firefighters and some of the local volunteers, that they were quite happy. They felt that they had in train a pretty good process. They were working at local, state and federal level with volunteers and they had a pretty good idea of the way forward for dealing with bushfires in the Illawarra area. As I said, we are used to bushfires. So when we did have bushfires in the summer of 200102, a lot of them were contained. Because there had been hazard reduction, there was in place a good network of volunteers and a good network of state government authorities working together to minimise the impact on the local environment.
Having said that, I have realised from the many submissions I listened to regarding this report that we cannot really stop bushfires. Bushfires are horrendous and horrific, and they do run out of control despite all the best efforts by volunteers and by state and federal government authorities to minimise the hazards. It is a very complicated issue. In urban areas such as my own electorate of Cunningham we need to deal with it environmentally, in management terms and financially. But in areas such as the Illawarra I saw that a good process had been put in place. Obviously that happened very early in the piece for me—within the first few weeks of my being on the committee. I, like many members of the committee, such as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, went out to various parts of Australia and looked at the situation beyond my own electorate. I went to places such as Tasmania, Western Australia, northern Victoria and western New South Wales, and the situation was very different. We found areas where there were no management structures really in place. There were old-fashioned ways of dealing with fires. Maybe there is a need for change there. There were not necessarily the resources there to back up and assist those volunteers or to give them clear direction so that they could identify areas which needed to be conserved, areas which could be subject to hazard reduction and areas which needed to be part of a more detailed hazard reduction zone management plan. We found that there were a lot of different ways of managing the bushfire hazard throughout Australia. 
I was most of all impressed with Tasmania and the way in which Tasmania has a very well-coordinated way of dealing with bushfire hazards. What was most telling was what I saw on the front page of a Tasmanian paper which was issued the day before a massive fire event was due. That front page basically told people to stay at home and prepare for the fire. That is in stark contrast to the recent news we have had of the fires over in America, where I understand there are mandatory evacuations and we have seen thousands of properties destroyed. But in Tasmania we were taken into the bush and we saw houses on the sides of hills, surrounded by trees and bush, that had survived the fire. The reason they had survived was that the state had put in good plans and the volunteers and local residents were aware of how to deal with the bushfire hazard on a regular, almost daily, basis. They were prepared to defend their properties. They had in place water and knew the various procedures needed. They were supported by the volunteers, the state government authorities and the federal government when it was needed. In those instances they were able to defend their properties, whether there had been hazard reduction or not.
That was a great example of the fact that bushfires can be managed—but they cannot be stopped. Bushfires and wildfires do run out of control, but they can be managed. Prevention is very important, and we all agree that we need to prevent major disasters. However, we cannot always do that. The other information we received, which was from meteorologists, was that global warming is occurring. They clearly said that the greenhouse effect is taking place, that the weather in Australia is getting hotter and that the fires are getting hotter and more frequent, so unfortunately in the future we can look forward to more disastrous bushfires. Having accepted that the weather is not getting any better we now realise, with reports such as this—with all the information that is coming in, with the reports that are being gathered and with the investigations throughout the country—that the way forward is to have more information, better planning, better maps, better scientific data and better coordination between all those firefighting authorities to better plan and manage bushfires when they come so that we can minimise the impact on local properties, minimise the loss of life and minimise the trauma and terror that people go through.
We had major bushfires in the Illawarra in 1968. I was only a young child then, so I did not really have any perception of the sheer horror of a bushfire. But during this year I was shown a videotape, taken by a local resident from Darkes Forest in my electorate, of the bushfires when they came through in Christmas of 2001. You saw the terror and horror of a bushfire coming through a property. In that instance, the man kept videotaping throughout the incident. You saw the flames coming. You saw all the people running around, getting the children, getting inside, preparing for the fire front and getting the hoses out. The volunteer firefighters were there helping them. There was a lot of screaming and shouting, a lot of smoke, a lot of ember attacks and a lot of fire around. All of a sudden the fire front came, and within a minute it was almost gone. It was very quick.  
Then there was the cleaning up afterwards—making sure that the ember attacks and the fires did not catch. Fifteen minutes after the fire had gone through, you saw the people finally saying, `We've survived. We've protected most of our property.' They did their best with the help of the firefighters and with the help of knowing how to deal with fire on their property. Seeing that video was a very telling experience for me. I realised what a horror it was and the fact that, in many instances, we will not be able to stop bushfires. But we have to prepare. There is no doubt that we have to be better prepared.
Within this report, a lot of the over 50 recommendations deal with the issue of better preparing for and managing the bushfire hazard that we face almost on an annual basis in this country. I really do commend and support a lot of those recommendations that go to the heart of things such as better communication, better assistance for our volunteer firefighters, more money to support their work and more money to support aerial firefighting. I fully support a lot of those issues. However, I did put in a dissenting report to this committee's report. The dissent was mainly concerned with the need to consider the environmental impacts of what we are doing.
At a late stage in the work of the committee we received a report from Nick Gellie on various aspects and the way forward in dealing with bushfires. I really welcomed that report because in that Mr Gellie, a fire ecologist, said that, basically, in any area of Australia—urban areas or whatever—you might have areas where you need to set up specific zones to protect property, and that might cover about 20 per cent of the land. Hazard protection zones need to be set up, and that is very evident in my electorate of Cunningham, which is an urban electorate. We need hazard reduction. We need fire prevention zones set up. That could cover up to 20 per cent of the land. Perhaps 20 to 30 per cent of any area has overwhelming environmental values which need to be protected and which may never be subject to burning. That is just the reality. The other 50 or 60 per cent of the land will most likely be subject to some sort of hazard reduction regime. I have said repeatedly to people that the Greens are not opposed to hazard reduction. What we want, and what this report really does reinforce and in many ways support, is a more scientific, coordinated approach. If that takes place, we will better serve the people of Australia.
I could go on, but I will not. I welcome the report. I thank all my fellow members of the committee. We had a lot of good, heated discussions during the course of forming this report, and I found it very interesting to be a member of this committee. I learned a lot from being on the committee. I also thank the parliamentary staff who assisted us, who kept the show on the road and who put all the submissions together so that we were all given copies of all the submissions. We were kept up to date and knew exactly what was happening, where we were going and what parts of Australia we were dealing with. The result of their hard work, and that of all the members of the committee, is seen in this report. Of course, you can also see it by going to the web site. There you can see the over 500 submissions by members of the public dealing with this issue. It is an important issue, and we all recognise that. It is an emotional issue, it is a hot issue, and it is something which I am sure we will be talking about in this place for many years to come.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—As a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires, I am pleased to be able to join in this debate and say that it really was one of the most extraordinary experiences that I have been through as a member of parliament. As my colleagues and I went around to various places for the hearings, there was only one reaction that we felt, and that was growing anger. The anger was because so many people who had given so much time, mainly as volunteers, and who were prepared to come to the inquiry were pouring out their hearts to us about the problems that they had had—and in many cases the devastation of their lives—and the fact that it appeared that we were the first people who were prepared to really listen to their point of view. It was most moving, and I think all members of the inquiry came away with a much better understanding of just what bushfires can do to people and, more importantly, how we might approach them better in the future.
In the limited time I have, I would like to give special credit to the chairman, the member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn. I think he did an outstanding job in chairing this inquiry under a lot of pressure. He put a huge amount of work into it and, in a very short period of time, he has, with the committee's support, produced an excellent report—A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires. I would suggest that it is probably the best reference there is in Australia right now on bushfires. It contains a lot of information and I think it has brought together all the relevant views of the best minds in Australia on what really happened in those devastating bushfires and how we might better manage in the future. So I give full marks to the member for Eden-Monaro. I think it was one of those outstanding efforts that are never fully recognised, but I think it should be on the record.
Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as you know, we had an amazing response to this inquiry wherever we went. I have said how angry I became listening to what people said. However, many people were prepared to come before the committee and tell it as they saw it. They brought forward their experience—in many cases decades of experience—on handling bushfires. As we know, fire is a natural part of the Australian landscape. It is something that has been around for many thousands of years, and there are records that show that Aboriginal communities knew how to manage it. In fact, I have read a local report which talks about the Grampians in my electorate. In that report an early European settler wrote that he came across Aborigines doing controlled burning in the 1840s. The words he used were that they displayed `astonishing skill' in managing fire. I think that is something that people often overlook nowadays; but it is not something new as fire has been managed, and we still have to continue to do that. 
Two things came through very clearly. One is that there has been insufficient fuel reduction in recent times. That led to a build-up of combustible material which clearly made those fires far more intense. The second point is that the way the fighting of the fires was managed showed a very cautious approach, for want of a better term, which clearly allowed the fires to do a lot more damage than they otherwise might have. One illustration of the extent of that damage is that it was estimated that the amount of timber burned in the fires earlier this year is the equivalent of 40 years of logging. A lot of people in the community seem to be against logging on public land, but they were surprisingly silent when it came to talking about the fact that the equivalent of 40 years of logging just went up in smoke. 
I think that is a point that the wider community ought to be taking on board. I guess what it really shows is that there is a growing gap in the community—and that is the overriding message that comes through—between those who have had the practical experience and those with a theoretical approach; or, to put it another way, in many cases there is a gap between city and country thinking on the question of bushfires. My real concern is that, if we do not take note of the report, the recommendations and the findings, we will be destined to repeat this mistake when another serious bushfire season comes along, as it surely will. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Does the member for Wannon wish to seek leave to continue his remarks at a later date?
—I do.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Recent Australian Bushfires Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—The inquiry of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires has been an interesting one. Being the deputy chair of this committee, which took evidence for seven months, was a very worthwhile exercise. The bushfire inquiry started in some hostile circumstances when the federal government was out to find scapegoats. During the launch of the inquiry, the chairman was pre-empting the findings with federal criticism of the capacities of the states. I believe it is not in the best interests of the country to assign blame for those fires, or any fires. Those fires could well have happened anyway and, although there can be changes in responses, it is doubtful whether—because of the drought conditions, the higher than average temperatures and the lower than average rainfall at that time—anything would have made any difference. We can add to that the work that had not been done by a whole host of bodies, including some individuals, to eliminate the fuel loads in the days before the fires. So I do not think it serves any good purpose to try and lay blame in any one quarter, because we are all culpable in some way or another. 
I know the opposition has been pursuing the goal, since early 2002, of having a national strategy put in place using a lot of the knowledge gained from past fires. This had not been done, so the federal government had some liability there too after saying that they were going down that path. I believe that, from now on, we need to keep the response to the A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires report as bipartisan as possible so that many of the very good recommendations can be put in place. The COAG inquiry is starting, and hopefully that will pick up some of the recommendations. I believe that the members of the now disbanded committee which put out this report will be meeting with the officials of the COAG committee next week to pass on as much knowledge as possible, in the hope that we can assist in the ongoing development of a national strategy.
Within this committee we had some excellent discussions. It was very tough at times. There were a lot of difficulties, but the chairman and I were able to keep the committee going forward and we achieved a very good report in the end. The paper presented to the committee by Nic Gellie was very helpful in pointing out some bottom line problems. One point is that the major fires come around every 10 or 15 years, meaning that few people get experience in developing skills of strategic and local fire assessment. This leaves gaps in local understanding of ecosystems, terrain, fire, fire weather and short- and long-term climate patterns. This knowledge is vital to fashion more appropriate fire strategies to cope with specific fires. Nic Gellie pointed out:
... decisions are now made in fire control centres, remote from the fireground, which often complicate, slow, and frustrate flexible and prompt decision-making. Groups of people isolated from the fire ground, and its myriad of small rapid changes brought about changes in fire weather, fuels, terrain, and success or failure of fire suppression crews, cannot respond effectively and efficiently to rapidly changing scenarios. Decision-making then becomes reactive and loses momentum in pre-emptive planning and creating opportunities to limit overall threats of a fire.
Local people on the ground begin to lose confidence. People are pulled out of a fire because the imperative is that firefighter safety comes first and, without concrete knowledge, it is important to err on the side of caution.
We must start looking at changes to how we deal with fire and land management, how we look at training and how we approach developing a national strategy that takes into account local knowledge. Tasmania is getting to the stage of having highly integrated public land management and fire management, and sophisticated planning is being employed in implementing strategic mosaic burns to meet both fuel reduction objectives and community expectations on the environment. One should remember that Hobart is one of the driest capitals in Australia, drier than Launceston in the north and also drier than Melbourne and Sydney; people do not always associate dryness with the wonderful city of Hobart. Because of the weather pattern in January and February, Hobart is very vulnerable to fire. Last season it was very vulnerable to a very large fire on the outskirts of my electorate, which could have quite easily entered the city and done some of the damage we saw occur in Canberra. It was probably a change of weather that saved us last year. 
Training goes on all the time at the local level, and equipment is being phased in that has multiple uses and is interchangeable within various services called on to fight fires. In Tasmania, national parks, the forestry commission and the fire service itself all are training management operators. Everyone is trained along the same lines and all the equipment is interchangeable. That is not the case in the rest of Australia. Regular audits of local equipment and ability are also part of our strategy, so that when it comes to an emergency we know what we have. You really need to have those audits in place. It must be known where assistance can be obtained and how long it will take to get it into the fight to suppress a fire. That is very important information.
I think the telling points that need to be addressed are on land management. Over the last 50 years the management of land in Australia has been gradually changing. People's aspirations are becoming greater and in the last 20 years or so this has developed into clashes between environmental views and traditional land management practices. Change has to occur, but what, how and at what level? What do we have to take into account in future fire periods, and what knowledge have we gained from the past?
Evidence to the committee from the wider community proved that fuel reduction burning was a very contentious issue. Discussions even threw up a perception that people did not like so much smoke throughout the summer, and I heard that Government House here once asked that no burning off be done because they had several garden parties set up. Because of the need to reduce fuel—and that can only be done during certain times of year under certain conditions; as borne out by the evidence to the committee—it is impossible to fit fuel reduction burns around events. There are only so many days to do the burn-offs, only so many days to do that fire reduction, and those days will have to be used. Our community will have to come to the conclusion that those days will be the days on which that burning is undertaken.
We may all have to put up with some smoke during our activities to ensure that our communities are safe. There can be no ifs or buts—smoke is a part of our summer nowadays. The argument is that hazard reduction burning is seen by some parts of the community as the main tool for fire prevention, whereas others have equally strong views that the practice ought to be either abandoned or severely restricted on environmental grounds because of the possibility of unwanted wildfires and urban sensitivities.
We also have a situation where some communities' attitudes have moved to accepting greater areas of our forests, bushlands and wilderness being set aside in national parks. These increased areas, along with members of the community stridently opposing broadscale hazard reduction burning, have made it extremely difficult for land managers, firefighters and the community to strike an appropriate balance between ensuring environmental outcomes that protect biodiversity and other environmental values and initiating measures to reduce loads on a sustainable scale to protect property and life. So there is an underlying basic conflict that needs to be understood and resolved by those in local areas as well as those who tend to criticise from afar. 
Other issues come into the long-term planning for fire prevention. These include planning considerations in local government. Past planning practices have allowed housing developments in inappropriate areas with individual property owners being permitted poor choices in the design of buildings and materials used in the construction of those buildings. Even the legal system in some states has made it difficult for local government to refuse to allow developments in sensitive and fire prone areas at the urban-bush interface.
Public education needs to be addressed too. Those seeking a rural lifestyle may be unfamiliar with the demands of living in a rural environment and the need to adequately prepare their properties for the eventuality of a bushfire. Many landowners are not doing enough to protect their properties at the urban interface, and this is putting others at risk. So crunch time is coming again, and recommendations raised in the report must be taken on board soon to prevent another tremendous fire season.
Recommendation 25 seeks to have the Commonwealth ensure that the Council of Australian Governments seek the adoption by all states and territories of multi-agency protocols and agreements for fire management, similar to those that apply in Tasmania between the groups that I mentioned earlier. This is vital for the development of a national strategy. Recommendation 26 continues with this. It seeks to get the Emergency Management Australia group to initiate a process involving the Australasian Fire Authorities Council and the Australasian Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations to review the coordination of cross-border firefighting arrangements and interstate deployment of firefighting resources. This has to be undertaken before the season gets under way. Recommendation 29 recommends that it is important that the Commonwealth commit funding for aerial firefighting beyond the 2003-04 season. We have to have greater flexibility with aerial firefighting equipment, and long-term contracts are necessary in this area to have the equipment on stand-by.
Recommendations 13, 14 and 15 are also important to ensure that we get agreements from the states on burning targets to some benchmark level that is seen as adequate to protect property, life and the environment. These recommendations include a national database that identifies fuel reduction areas, along with a database to be developed by the CRC to reach a national standard of fire mapping to actively map the extent, intensity, spread and overall pattern of prescribed fires and wildfires in Australia. People will be able to pick up a map on the computer and look to see where fires and mosaic burns have occurred over the last 10 years and make judgments about those.
Recommendation 16 talks of smoke modelling by the bushfire CRC to try to acknowledge community concern about smoke pollution so that we can do the best we can to keep smoke away from urban areas. That is not always possible, and I think education on why that smoke is there needs to be undertaken.
There are many other recommendations in this report, and they all need consideration by the COAG and the federal government. The report needs to see the light of day very regularly over the next few months—and maybe over the next year or so—so that discussions can continue and the conclusions and recommendations of this report can fit into real policy decisions and basic changes to the Australian context.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—As the then minister responsible for national disaster relief arrangements, I had great pleasure in issuing the terms of reference and implementing a select committee of the House of Representatives, one that represented all the parties represented in that House. It is with great pleasure that I stand today to participate in this debate and to congratulate those who participated in the work of the Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires to produce this very comprehensive report. 
There has been some comment, even from the member for Lyons, that there was some politics involved in this issue. The only politics that has arisen throughout this debate is from those who claim there was politics involved. The select committee was fully representative on a party political basis, and the politics came from those who wished to defend the mistakes they had made—particularly the premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, who forbade their agencies to attend. The excuse given was that they were all too busy, but they attended every public hearing of the committee. They were there, all dressed up in their suits or uniforms, listening in but not prepared to assist the committee with the expertise they might have brought to the inquiry.
There are aspects of this matter that need to be identified. The fundamental issues come down to two words: suppression or prevention. What purpose should we follow? Where should the major expenditure of government be? Should it be putting out your house after it has burnt down, hosing down the ashes? Should it be trying to put helicopters in the air when there is so much smoke they cannot fly? Or should it be implementing policies, practised historically in Australia by the Aboriginal people, of keeping fuel loads down to a level below where wildfire of almost nuclear proportions can develop?
I have heard many arguments over time. As soon as there is a fire somewhere, the media want to focus on who lit it. It might have been lit by natural causes, of course, such as lightning. But let us say it was lit by a careless smoker or—unfortunately, but frequently—by children who have a fascination with matches. It might have been lit by a careless worker using an angle grinder on a bad day. But the fact of life is that those fires would go nowhere if there were not adequate fuel to sustain them. I have said to many a journalist: `Go home tonight, put some 50 millimetre logs in your barbecue or lounge room fireplace and try to light them with a cigarette butt. If you like, go and get the angle grinder and try to light them. You can't.' We have to realise that there are no fires without fuel.
Prevention is a better solution than burying four or six people around Australia and wiping out 400 houses in Canberra alone. Let us look to history to find out how this might be done. Deputy Speaker Adams might be interested in what Abel Janz Tasman wrote in his logbook in 1642 when he was at the north end of Storm Bay, Tasmania. He talked about massive trees and went on to say:
... the country was covered with trees; but so thinly scattered, that one might see everywhere to a great distance amongst them ... Several of the trees were much burnt at the foot ...
That was the forest that people say we are supposed to protect. But it is not the forest today. I could go on.
In Western Australia in January it gets a bit hot; it is not exactly the time you would light fires. But William de Vlamingh, commander of the Dutch ship Nijptang during January in 1697 at the Swan River recorded:
No men were seen but they observed many smokes ... 
The Aboriginals were burning in January with safety. Why? Because they burnt all the time, as recorded by Governor Phillip, when he wrote in 1788:
... and they—
the Aborigines—
are seldom seen without fire, or a piece of wood on fire, which they carry with them from place to place, and in their canoes.
	...	...	...
The natives always make their fire, if not before their own huts, at the root of a gumtree, which burns very freely and they never put a fire out when they leave the place.
That is the history of it. That is not criticism; that is the way they managed. And they never got killed in bushfires because the bushfires never had the fuel. This is interesting because it is a matter of history. I have an interesting extract of an article published on the American ABC News web site on 18 August 2000. It reads:
With wildfires raging out of control in 13 Western states, Rex Wahl has seen enough. Like a peace-loving homesteader who finally reaches for his six-shooter, the influential environmentalist has unholstered his chain saw. Wahl is ready to cut down trees to save the forest.
There is an environmentalist looking out for the environment. I could go on to explain that he saw massive destruction of 200 homes in a fire near his place. The article is interesting because it talks about history. It went on:
A century ago ... healthy conifer forests sprouted 25 to 70 mature trees per acre. Lush meadows filled the gaps.
	...	...	...
 Today's forests stand in cadaverous contrast. After a century of fire suppression, as many as 850 spindly trees per acre clog the same forests. More than half stand dead, starved for sunlight and strangled by insects that bore into them.
I can take the member for Lyons to parts of the great forests of Tasmania where he will see that the dead trees are in predominance. Prevention requires us to go back to history.
Four years ago I was the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. Back in 1988 I read of the devastation of Yellowstone National Park. It still has not recovered. The fires got so hot that they burnt a metre into the ground, as happened in the Snowy area. The trees in the Snowy area are not growing back; there is no soil there for them to grow on. It was burnt out.
But I called a ministerial council—and for the information of members there were two Liberal ministers present, one representing the ACT. I had them briefed by Australian firefighters who had been to America and seen the devastation—the damage to the environment, private property and human life and the huge costs involved for the taxpayer. I got them briefed by one of the leading firefighters, who told them that it was all going to happen in Australia. When I asked them as federal minister—and there has been some reference to us taking the lead in a national strategy—what they thought they should do about it, they said, `We had better put out a press release.' I said, `Is that press release going to have some reference to prevention?' There was deathly silence around the table, then someone said, `Are you talking about cutting down the odd tree?' I said, `That may be part of it.' Their response was, `If we have to touch one tree, we will not do it.' There are an awful lot of dead trees now, and it was a deliberate decision by the state ministers at the time not to do anything. 
What was going on in New South Wales? The National Parks and Wildlife Service were taking over all of the declared national parks, immediately going in, as this report identifies, ripping up the old forestry roads, which were apparently a symbol of past decadence, pulling out the bridges and making it impossible to get the normal suppression measures of a water tanker and maybe a piece of earthmoving equipment in to address the fires when they started. Furthermore, they had an absolutely deliberate opposition to hazard reduction, which is highlighted as the first recommendation of the McLean committee and others that have been conducted in recent times. They deliberately opposed doing it. In their own report they identified that they were down to doing hazard reduction on 0.5 per cent of the area under management per annum, whilst in the remaining areas of New South Wales forest still under the management of state forests hazard reduction was being done on 15 per cent a year.
We have people like Koperberg, who is put up as some sort of hero but is never seen near a fire—he is just a television man—getting up on the 7.30 Report with Kerry O'Brien, saying that it was impossible to do 85,000 hectares of hazard reduction a year and hinting that that was one per cent of New South Wales, as though there is no Sydney and all of New South Wales is covered in trees. That is blatant misrepresentation when you are talking about life and death and massive environmental destruction.
In the last two fire years state forests have had negligible fires within their area of responsibility. The National Parks and Wildlife Service have had millions of hectares burnt. What does that tell us? You cannot say it is not a fact. It is a fact. Of course, notwithstanding the sneering at me and others for trying to raise these issues four years ago, I was consequently accused one day by the state minister—who for a change came out instead of leaving it, as usual, to his minions, Koperberg and, I think, Gilbert, who as public servants should be out there putting out or preventing fires, not being television identities—of wanting to bituminise the forests of New South Wales. What a load of silly rubbish, when I was standing up and warning all Australians that the tragedy that has now occurred was imminent.
In frustration, I eventually put myself on the Laurie Oakes show one Sunday morning and I made these predictions—and I had a look at a copy of that particular interview just the other day. The next day I was attacked throughout Australia in the print media, and the Sydney Morning Herald went as far as to say—quoting, I think, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is a great expert in all these matters, run by a guitar player who, I guess, has some connection with wood; he has it in his guitar—that Australian native trees were naturally fire retardant, to which I replied, `Does that mean we can spread woodchips on future fires to put them out?'
This raises another issue, about which I have corresponded with the Press Council. Does the Australian media have a duty of care? For that matter, did the National Parks and Wildlife Service have a duty of care? Why did Koperberg pull his barrister down in, I think it was, Batemans Bay during the recent coronial inquiry when his barrister started to get up national parks and wildlife witnesses as to what they had done? There is a duty of care, and it goes well beyond firefighters. It goes to the people who live reasonably close to forests, such as the people here in Canberra. Does the media have a responsibility not to be carried along by guitar playing greenies but to put some proper substance into these debates so that people know their homes and lives are at risk? 
I found it outrageous that I was attacked in that way—as I was attacked when I came out after the fires here and said that there should be an inquiry. I was told that I was insensitive, that I had made some insensitive remarks. That report was made on the ABC and, when we asked them to give us evidence, they apologised and withdrew the remark. But that did not stop every other journalist, or the Labor Party in the House of Representatives the other day, making this allegation. When I challenged the member for Canberra to produce evidence, she produced a couple of transcripts that had no such insensitive remarks in them.
It is not an issue for politics; it is an issue of life and death. It is an issue of environmental destruction. This report and its recommendations, if followed, will assist considerably. It is just a pity that it was not seen as the penultimate document, with proper contribution from the state agencies in New South Wales and Victoria. More importantly, they have to work through the issues of prevention. You can have as many helicopters and as many firefighting appliances as you like but, if you have not reduced the fuel load, they will be ineffective when, as occurred in Canberra, the energy released by the fire is equivalent to one of the nuclear devices dropped on Japan. That is what it was. Those houses did not burn; they were blown up. Anyone who visited the area after the fire could see just that, particularly when you saw some houses left standing and others destroyed. They are the issues—and it is very important that the recommendations in this report be considered.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—I rise to speak in support of the report on the recent Australian bushfires. The House of Representatives Select Committee inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires was one of a number of inquiries conducted by state and federal authorities into those devastating events. There was the ACT McLeod inquiry and also a coronial inquiry in the ACT. In Victoria, there was the Auditor-General's inquiry and the Esplin inquiry. In New South Wales, there was a joint select committee on the 2001-02 bushfires, and a coronial inquiry has also been completed. At the national level, two inquiries have been conducted—the one we are debating today and the national inquiry on bushfire management, prevalence and mitigation being conducted in cooperation between the Commonwealth, states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG.
If the member for O'Connor would like to stay, in a little while I intend to refer to the ex-minister and make some remarks about his involvement. I also want to refer to what I felt were the political implications of the inquiry. It is something that one felt. Not a lot had to be said, but you felt that there were some political implications. Previous members of the committee from the ALP side have already emphasised that, and I indicate that that was also my feeling. The member for Canberra has indicated that she was concerned about the minister arriving in Canberra on 19 January and making some statements relating to the bushfire at what was a very inappropriate time when there was a lot of tension and a lot of emotion and the people were feeling very vulnerable. At times such as those, it is a good idea for politicians to get out of the way and let the firefighters get on with the job.
Another story that I picked up during the inquiry was that the minister's plane, while in Jindabyne, actually blocked a fuel tanker and the firefighting plane could not be refuelled for over an hour. Obviously I do not blame the minister for that—he was not the pilot; he did not park the plane. But it shows us that in times of crisis when we cannot make a contribution—we could have had a look too if we had wanted to get in the way—it is a good idea for us to stay out of the way until the firefighters have done their job and we can make an assessment. Other members of the committee have also indicated their concern. The member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor, said: 
Despite the overt political circumstance of this committee's establishment and, on occasions, its overt political manipulation, Labor members stuck with the task in order to keep faith with the people and communities around Australia ...
We did that in spite of some tension and in spite of some bullying tactics from the government side when we tried to raise particular issues. The member for Lyons also took the same view. He felt that there was an overly political tone because of the antics of the then minister. That was certainly the view we had, but we stuck with the job. In the long run, I think there were some people on the government side who helped very much to get the committee on track and made a good contribution. They took a moderate approach. We then felt we were able, with our additional comments, to support the recommendations.
I recall quite clearly the first day of inspections of the damage caused by the Canberra fires. As one who had only seen the effects on TV, it was certainly an eye-opener. We were forewarned. The committee was advised that people giving evidence were very emotionally affected by the fires, because of their life-threatening experiences—which at that stage we were not aware of—the loss of their family homes and the devastation of the surrounding countryside with extensive damage to flora and fauna. Clear evidence was given to the committee by the local firefighters that, in their view, the fires should have been attacked earlier, before they got well established, and that the mechanical and aerial resources should have been brought into play a lot earlier than they were.
As land management authorities did not give evidence to this inquiry, for various reasons, these genuine criticisms were not able to be fully tested. However, media reports indicated that the New South Wales Rural Fire Service had evidence that these fires had, within hours of ignition, on 8 January, become too dangerous to fight directly. I think it is significant that, in spite of the intensity of the fires—which are probably the worst we have seen in our lifetimes—there was no loss of life amongst the firefighters themselves. There was, unfortunately, loss of life, as we all know. This is in marked contrast to other fires around Australia, where there has been loss of life amongst the firefighters. Maybe the caution that was exhibited, and which has been criticised, was of some benefit in saving lives. Neither that evidence nor the media reports have been put to the inquiry, but they will be tested in the New South Wales Rural Fire Service evidence to the inquiry set up under the Council of Australian Governments. I believe that is in the process of commencing now, with appropriate people being appointed to that inquiry.
To come to some broad conclusions about the Canberra fires, it may be useful to look at evidence presented by organisations that were not directly affected by the Canberra fires themselves but were very much involved in the bushfire scene. I think that is important, because you have people who know what they are talking about but who are removed from the emotion involved in what were obviously very devastating effects for the people directly involved. One submission I would like to refer to was made by the Blue Mountains Conservation Society. I would like to refer to two points made in that submission. It said:
Lightning and arson are the two main causes of wildfire. Fires arising from these causes can not be prevented, but watchfulness of all in areas of risk can reduce the severity. 
The submission also made the point:
 A major risk factor contributing to the impact on people and property is that of granting development consent in high and extreme bushfire risk areas. This could be addressed immediately, preventing further building in such areas.
I think this is a very good point. Councils and other authorities have allowed residential developments in high-bushfire-risk areas. Another factor which has come though quite clearly—and which, I believe, was the major factor behind the fires—was the hotter, drier weather that we were experiencing at the time. Although this may be cyclical climate change due to global warming, leading to more frequent El Nino events, the federal and state governments share equal responsibility for not improving the control of these changes. As the submission says:
This must be addressed urgently, and by all Australian governments as any change will be over the long term.
Another important point made in this submission was about the lack of education and preparedness of the communities in general, which contributed to the severity of the impact. For example, in the Canberra fires, most residents were not adequately prepared to protect their homes or gardens and did not maintain them to reduce fire spread. Homes were not fitted with well-known and acceptable measures to assist in risk management. Furthermore, too many residents were not insured, contributing to financial impact. One of the issues with the fires was that most of the damage was done not by the fires moving past the buildings but, rather, from the embers getting into the buildings. In many cases the homes were destroyed after the fire had passed by. The argument was put that, had people been allowed to stay in their homes, most or many of the houses would have been saved. Where people did stay in their houses, they were able to fight the fires and no houses were actually lost. That is an interesting point that came out in this inquiry.
The other point made in the Blue Mountains Conservation Society's submission is based on a paper prepared by Stuart James for the rural fire service in the Blue Mountains district. The submission states that Stuart James found that hazard reduction burns are of limited effectiveness. I noticed the member for O'Connor previously speaking in this debate. He used the example of how the Aboriginals operated 100 years ago. I think we have to be prepared to recognise that things have changed since then and what may or may not have been effective in those days is not necessarily effective today. I think we have to be prepared to accept modern views and modern technology. Referring once again to Stuart James's report, in relation to hazard reduction burns, the submission stated:
The studies found that there was significant difference in results in dry and wet climatic cycles, with greater success in dry cycles. Effectiveness also depended on the aspect, and on the degree of shading of the ground and understorey. There is also a correlation between understorey heights and burn result ...
The submission also says:
Hazard reduction, other than by fire, eg slashing, mowing and thinning of vegetation, near the assets being protected will provide better protection for those assets than burning in remote areas. 
They are just some of the conflicting issues that we were confronted with. I would like to refer, once again—to give a broad approach to this inquiry—to some comments made by the CSIRO, which we all accept as being an authority on this issue. The CSIRO submission said: 
The severity of the recent fires was related to a combination of factors including the generally high fuel loads, the prolonged drought, and the weather conditions experienced during and after the fire ignition events (mostly lightning strikes and ember spotting). CSIRO has no data to definitively attribute cause, or link effect, to the various individual factors.
Further, the submission says:
The combination of fuel loads, drought, daily weather and fire ignition conditions on the worst days were a 1-20 to 1-30 year event. Canberra was experiencing a 1-10 year drought, could expect lightning storms of this nature in about 1-20 years and experiences about 3 days per year of similar extreme weather conditions. The need to understand what happened and to plan for future events is thus an urgent priority.
We have to learn something out of this; it is no good trying to apportion blame. A lot of good information has been provided. The Labor Party were happy, with some reservations, to support the conclusions of the report. We probably have to look at all of the reports that have come down. There is no doubt that those responsible for determining future policies on land management and fire prevention will have the benefit of evidence and conclusions presented to all these inquiries that I have mentioned and will not have to rely on any one particular inquiry which may have a political bent or may not have been able to hear all the participants in the bushfire field.
Finally, I thank the committee secretariat and staff for their dedication and work in putting this report together. Can I also say how impressed I was, as I am sure we all were, by the residents of Canberra and the surrounding areas who made submissions to the inquiry. We were also impressed by their commitment to the environment and to fighting bushfires generally.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"Causley, Ian, MP",NATS,2003-11-27,"—Unfortunately, with my duties, I did not get to a lot of the hearings of the committee. But, having grown up on the lower Clarence River in northern New South Wales, I cut my teeth on bushfires and I think that, given my family background, I know quite a bit about the problems associated with bushfires, particularly in New South Wales. My family first went to the lower Clarence in 1889. My great-grandfather was involved in some of the very early management of the land in that area and probably some of the clearing, which is now criticised too, for farming. As I was growing up, my grandfather gave me a lot of advice on what needed to be done to manage the land, particularly the land we owned privately that was forested land.
If you go back through the history of Australia, you will soon realise that fire has always been a part of our environment. The fact is that if you look at the diaries of the old explorers—which people tend not to do at the present time—you will find that most of the countryside was in fact open grazing country. That was what the explorers reported as they went across it. In hindsight, the reasons for that are quite clear—the regularity with which fires, including wildfires from lightning strikes, went through the landscape, and its management by the Aborigines. And then of course most of the young trees were killed off. There were not the great forests that we have in certain areas today. In fact, in many areas of my electorate, particularly above Grafton, when Europeans first settled that area—including the Baryulgil Station, which was the big grazing station of the upper Clarence—they did not settle it because there were trees to clear but because it was open grazing country. That same country today, because it has been locked up and is no longer grazing country, is forest. Those forests have grown in the last 30 years because of the changes to land management. 
So land management is at the core of this problem. I am disappointed that the states have played a game here, and the reason for it is quite clear. The fact is that they are the managers of the public land in their areas and they can clearly see that they have a problem, but they are not addressing it. The problem is that they have so much public land they cannot manage it. If they try to manage it in the way that is in the best interests of the whole landscape, it is going to cost them a lot of money—and that is the real reason why they will not participate in this debate. It is the real reason why they are not engaging with a problem that is a real problem for the whole community.
My great-grandfather said that he learnt very quickly from the Aborigines, probably just from observing them, that the way to keep fuel under control was to use their method of management. Their method of management was not on par for the environment, by the way; it was for food. They used fire to get food, but in the process of course fires went right across the landscape. Much of our flora in particular has evolved through fire and would not exist if the landscape had not had fires through it. So it is something we have to come to terms with.
During my youth, even though much of the land was what we call crown land, it was either forest land managed by Forestry or, in many instances, leasehold land. Even the forest land was given grazing rights. There were grazing rights given over the crown land as well. On a very cool, clear autumn or spring day, I would see, especially as a young person going to school, fires rising. We used to call them horseback fires—and that is exactly what they were, because the graziers who had the lease on this land would take that opportunity to reduce the fuel. They knew that, if they did not reduce the fuel, they would have trouble later on in the hotter months of the year when they could get wildfires running through those areas.
I think it was Commissioner Koperberg who said, in an interview last year, `There's only a short window of opportunity.' That is absolutely right. There are very few days of the year when it is optimum to reduce this fuel. How was it done in the past? It was done in the past by the people on the ground. Hundreds of little lessees and property owners—and Forestry, and I will come back to that in a minute—took that opportunity to burn off little sections and keep the fuel down. It is only in recent years that that management has changed. I can recall the complaints, even in my area, by new settlers about the smoke in the springtime caused by these people reducing fuel. The new settlers said they came for the clear skies of the North Coast of New South Wales. Those clear skies can get awfully black at Christmas time if you do not have a bit of smoke in the autumn and the spring. You have to manage that properly.
When I was minister for forests in New South Wales, there was a whole section of the Forestry Commission whose job it was to reduce fuel. The section was run by one of the deputy commissioners of forests, Mr Roy Free. They had two fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters, and at the optimum time of the year they would drop incendiaries along the ridge lines to try and reduce some of this fuel, because that was in the best interests of the forests and of the flora and fauna of the forests.
We have this argument at the present time which has developed over the last decade and a half or so from extreme environmentalist groups who say that the only way to manage the land is to lock it all up and make sure that it is not affected at all—just put a fence around it and walk away from it. That is where we are getting into trouble. It does not matter whether you live in rural New South Wales or other parts of rural Australia or in the northern suburbs of Sydney—the risk is the same. When I fly over the northern suburbs of Sydney coming into the airport, I look down and say, `There is a disaster waiting to happen,' because my knowledge of fire is that it does not matter which way the wind is blowing—fire always goes uphill. I can assure you that those people who are living on the edges of those gullies in northern Sydney are sitting on a tinder box that will erupt one day. It is just a matter of when it will happen. 
It used to be the role in life of the Forestry Commission to reduce the fuel, but many of these areas have now been turned over to National Parks, and National Parks has a different attitude to this. I think that it is fair to say that the Premier of New South Wales would like to see himself with a place in history. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that he has a bit of an ego, and he certainly has a panache, I suppose, in certain ways for history—and certainly American history. But, unfortunately and ironically, I think in many ways he will be remembered in history as the Premier who caused the problems in New South Wales with the management of public land.
When I first went into the New South Wales house, Bob Carr was the Minister for the Environment and was responsible for national parks. He was in the Wran government in those days. Again, I do not think it is any exaggeration to say he is deep green. That is fine, but I think that the argument is flawed. I believe the argument is flawed because there is a report by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales which clearly shows that the majority of the fauna on the public land of New South Wales is in the forest areas that have been disturbed. Why is that? I think it is fairly obvious. It is because there is more food for the animals in a mixed growth forest. Koalas do not eat the leaves of old trees; they eat those of young trees. They eat young, nutrient-rich leaves. I have been in the bush all my life and I have seen them. They enjoy those. So the argument that you lock these areas up in the interests of flora and fauna is flawed. I think our grandchildren will judge us on that because, quite frankly, it is wrong.
The other issue is that when you have reduction burns in autumn or spring they are slow, cool fires. The fire probably will get no more than a metre off the ground because of the time of year, especially if you keep the fuel down to a reasonable level. This allows the animals and birds to escape. How do koalas try to escape from fires? They go up trees. That is their escape mechanism. But when you get these extremely hot, savage fires in the summertime and koalas go up the trees the fire gets them because you have an explosion throughout a eucalypt forest. 
I do not know whether anyone has ever seen the crown fires that can happen in a eucalypt forest. They are frightening because on a very hot day, with temperatures around 42 or 43 degrees and humidity of 20 per cent, you get this big fire. The eucalyptus gases from the leaves explode and the fire just runs across the tops of the trees. It is a frightening sight—it travels at enormous speed. In that instance the birds and animals, and the trees for that matter, do not stand a chance. I can take you to areas on the North Coast where a very hot fire went through some 20 years ago. The trees still have not grown back because of the heat of the fire at the time, although they will eventually.
The argument that you lock these areas up and that somehow this enhances the environment is quite wrong. I think we have to look very closely at the way we have been managing our public lands. There is plenty of experience out there in the community if we are prepared to use it—if we are prepared to listen to how these people manage the land. I am sure there is plenty of evidence, if we are prepared to look at it in an objective way, to show the best way to manage the land. 
As far as the built environment and the horrific fires around Canberra which triggered this particular report are concerned—although they were not the first: there were horrific fires in Sydney in 1993-94—I believe there is an enormous problem with planning. If you are going to build close to bushland in Australia, you have to be aware of the risks. I know many people love to build a house in the middle of the bush and say: `Isn't this a magnificent area to live in?' It is, until it turns nasty.
There is plenty of evidence around the edges of our cities, and in some instances in rural areas, where people have built in inappropriate areas. To take advantage of the environment, they have even built verandas and areas of their houses out into the trees. As I said, it is a wonderful aesthetic environment while the climate is benign but, as soon as the climate turns against you, you are in huge trouble. There are many issues with planning where the local governments in particular—in New South Wales they are charged with the responsibility of planning—need to look very closely at some of the planning issues associated with the risks from these horrific fires.
Fire will always be with us. That is part of Australia. Even if we reduce the fuel, it does not completely eliminate the problem of fire. In the area where I live, on the North Coast of New South Wales—a relatively high rainfall area for a country like Australia which does not get a lot of rain—there are some years when the fuel cannot be reduced, because it is too wet. So we do get a build-up of fuel, even in the best managed areas, and in those circumstances there can be some fairly severe fires. Of course, the more years it is left, the greater the risk. If we have a look at the United States of America, in the last four or five years—I was there in recent times—they have changed their ideas dramatically. There were areas in California, in particular, that had not been burnt in 30 or 40 years; and, all of a sudden, they have got horrendous trouble on their hands and a tremendous loss of property and life. Australia really is in the same situation.
As I have said, I did not get to a lot of the committee meetings, but I have read through the report and I think it is a comprehensive one. I just hope that people are prepared to look at it. I hope they put aside the politics involved and the fact that, in many instances, they have fenced themselves into a corner in the state scene. It is now going to be a very expensive exercise to try to manage public land, but that is absolutely no reason to ignore it.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—One of the most incredible experiences, not just in my own electorate during last summer's bushfires but during the extensive days of public hearings and going through the numerous written submissions—in fact, there were more than 200 submissions from my electorate—was seeing the usual, and justified, cynicism that so many Australian people have about government and reports actually dissipate.
When I was travelling around my electorate during last summer's bushfires, there was, admittedly, little I could do. I was not a volunteer firefighter. But what I could do was travel around the hundreds of burnt hectares in my electorate and speak to the people who were at the coalface of the fires, fighting the fires and doing things like preparing meals for the firefighters. These volunteers left their businesses, their farms and their places. I spoke to these people because, at the end of the day, the people I trust the most are those ordinary Australians who live not just in my electorate but in other parts of the country. They may not say much, they may not be at the front of powerful lobby groups but, through their actions and their generosity with their time, they contribute so much to our communities, particularly in the country, and have a very positive benefit for our standard of living.  
As I travelled around the fire-affected areas, they said to me: `Sophie, we need an inquiry. We need the federal government to get involved. We are sick to death of being told that we do not have degrees and we cannot fight fires properly. We are sick to death of state departments not adequately managing the land next to our properties. We have to spend hundreds of hours and a significant amount of financial resources dealing with things like feral animals and noxious weeds, and yet we have seen, over years and over decades, the build-up of forest fuel. We have just had enough.' Those of us who represent country electorates know that country people are used to adverse situations and natural disasters, and they are very patient. Sometimes I think they are too patient with respect to government action. And they have just had enough. Armed with that request and after consulting my other colleagues—including the member for Eden-Monaro, whose electorate was similarly affected through last summer's bushfires—and once, eventually, after much discussion, the federal committee was announced and appointed, I was very honoured to serve on the House of Representative Select Committee into the Recent Australian Bushfires.
Others who have been in this place longer than I have commented that this was one of the most difficult committees, if not the most difficult committee, they had served on in terms of the number of submissions, the hours of accepting evidence, the field trips and the general difficulty in reaching consensus on 59 very comprehensive recommendations. The difficulty, and let us not mince words about this, in reaching consensus on these 59 recommendations stemmed from the fact that state governments of all persuasions—but it just so happens that we currently have state governments who are all Labor governments—came under criticism.
Much of the report was based on the evidence of volunteers—people who have had to deal on a daytoday, season-to-season basis with these bureaucrats, people who have seen the systems of management of fires and crown land change and who were not afraid to speak. Unlike public servants in Victoria and New South Wales who were, disgracefully, gagged, these people owed nothing to anyone. I can understand some of my federal colleagues from the other side of the House not being prepared to be overtly critical of their state colleagues, even though they knew in their hearts that what these people were saying and what the recommendations have ended up saying was true. The over 500 pages of the report have said that it is pleasing—
—Committees should not be used for party political processes.
—It is not surprising that we have some members on the other side being upset.
—I am not being upset.
—Truth often hurts.
—The member for Chisholm has a city electorate. Let me remind her that she is fortunate that her constituents did not suffer the economic and environmental devastation of not just the last fire season but several seasons. It is very difficult at times for federal Labor members to be overtly critical of their state colleagues— 
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! The member for Chisholm!
—but it was pleasing that, in spite of some of their reservations, in spite of some of the difficulties they may have had, particularly with the state minister, Mr Haermeyer—but everyone is having difficulty with him at the moment, including many of his own state colleagues—the federal Labor Party members on the committee supported the 59 recommendations. At this point, it is convenient that the member for Chisholm is deciding not to hear that her federal colleagues supported the 59 recommendations—which is of course at odds with the Victorian government, which very conveniently brushed aside the recommendations.
The wonderful thing about this report is that everyone who sat on the committee, those who gave evidence and the thousands of people who have read it know that this is the voice of the people. If I have to trust anyone at all, it is not going to be the bureaucrats in state or federal departments; it is going to be my people on the ground who know how to fight a fire, who have fought them for decades and who do it, quite thanklessly at times, in the face of the bureaucracy and without any financial reward. It is to those people I would particularly like to say thank you. Thank you for putting aside for a moment that well-earned cynicism about what governments can do and about whether governments will listen to you. It is particularly touching and very humbling for me that you trusted me to work in Canberra to produce something that gave you a voice and gave you an opportunity to finally be heard.
The response to this very substantial inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires and the report, A nation charred: report on the inquiry into bushfires,has been absolutely tremendous. The report has already been read by a significant number of those who submitted their own thoughts to the committee and who gave oral evidence, and they are very pleased indeed. They share my concern, of course, to see that implementation of these recommendations is carried out as quickly as possible. Obviously these 59 recommendations will not be implemented overnight, but the onus is on all of us who understand that these things can easily be swept under the carpet and only brought to the fore with another major disaster, through our respective parliaments and political parties, to put party politics aside and do what the people of this nation have requested of us.
You only need to look at the majority of the submissions to see that, from one end of the continent to the other, people were speaking with one voice. From one end of the continent to the other, we heard that there has been a change in fighting fires, that there is not as aggressive an attack when a fire begins. We saw some very tragic evidence here in Canberra that the fires could have been prevented had there been an aggressive attack in the first instance in the rural areas of the ACT. That not only saddens me but also angers me, because there are innocent citizens out there who have suffered economically and emotionally and many families right across my electorate of Indi, and over the border in Eden-Monaro, will never recover financially. And why?
Of course we cannot control fires, but what we can control is the management of them. What we can control are the fuel loads. These people have suffered due to stupid and ill-conceived government policies—policies which parties on both sides have adopted from time to time. I feel very strongly and very passionately about our key responsibilities as legislators, members of parliament and representatives of the people to at least diminish the burden on those people of ill-conceived government policy. 
One of the most remarkable things I observed during the course of this very extensive inquiry was the guidance and chairmanship of the member for Eden-Monaro. I admired—and could only hope to emulate—his absolute patience and resilience through many meetings. I commented once before that, on one occasion, my patience was rather tried—and I suspect his was tried significantly more—when, for over 45 minutes, we debated the inclusion or exclusion of one word, and it was not one of those seminal words like `not'. At the end of the day, when looking at the final report, it was not a particularly seminal word, but I suppose we do need to go through a baptism of fire at times—and that was certainly mine.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his guidance in the lead-up to the committee actually being established, during the committee's deliberations and afterwards. I know he is as passionate as I am about this over 400-page report, its recommendations and the obligations we have to the Australian people who took the time to speak to us and to write to us—particularly those who, after having gone through drought and fires, took time out from rebuilding their lives and their businesses to give us their very unique insights.
There was also an extraordinary job done by the secretariat. The number of submissions that kept on flooding in was quite extraordinary. At one stage I did not believe that we would end up tabling the report by the allocated date, but the secretariat worked miracles. They worked wonders and they all worked extremely hard. The draft report that was produced was absolutely excellent and is a credit to them. I am sure I will sit on many inquiries over the course of this parliament—and perhaps, if the people of Indi decide to return me as their federal member, subsequent parliaments—but I doubt whether there will be too many other inquiries of the intensity of this inquiry or too many other inquiries which are as important to my electorate as this particular inquiry and report have been.
I again thank those volunteers in my electorate who gave of their time during the fires and gave of their time to give us evidence in the inquiry. I will work with them and with my parliamentary colleagues to ensure that we reverse the trend of ill-conceived policy ideas that have resulted in the destruction of the environment and the economic devastation of so many rural areas.
I thoroughly commend this report. For those members of parliament who dwell in the city and for whom bushfires are but a mere news clipping—and I am sure some of them would have gotten bored seeing bushfires raging in northeast Victoria for approximately 60 days last summer—I commend this to them. Perhaps they can understand the soul and the spirit of country Australia and country Victoria. It is not good enough just to pretend to latch on to our identity, which is so linked to the Australian bush, when it suits you politically. You actually have to help country people when it matters.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-11-27,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak at some length about the A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires report. As a new member of this House, this was the first opportunity I had to sit on a committee and to find out about the committee process and how committees operate. I am sure there are many people out there in the community who really do not understand the importance of the committee process in the federal parliament. As a librarian archivist, I was aware of a lot of material produced by this parliament and a lot of reports. You see the end outcome, the 400 or 500 pages of the report, but you do not realise the amount of work that goes into producing such a report—over 500 submissions and thousands and thousands of pages that are a supplement to the report. As the previous speaker, the member for Indi, said, a lot of people—a lot of volunteers, a lot of ordinary Australians—have put a lot of effort into this report. I think it is quite unique. That is one of the most important values of this whole process, both in getting that information from the community and allowing the community the voice to put forward their views to the federal parliament. I think that was an important issue in regard to this bushfire report. 
The whole issue of bushfires is very hot, very heated, very emotional. We have seen with the previous speaker, the member for Indi, the emotion that surrounds this issue. This committee gave a lot of the people who had really been affected—who were scarred both physically and emotionally, and whose properties were affected by the recent bushfires that occurred earlier this year and the ones that occurred during the summer of 200102—the opportunity, where many of them had not had the opportunity, to present their views to politicians, to the parliament. That was the great thing about this committee—it was very open and gave the public the opportunity to present that information.
We are all very aware that the inquiry was, unfortunately, politicised. Various state governments decided not to submit information to the committee. I was dismayed by that. It is unfortunate. As the Greens member on this committee, when I was selected for the committee I immediately visited the local rural fire service in my electorate and spoke to some of the people there. I was given a detailed briefing on how they deal with bushfires. It was very impressive. In my electorate covering the Illawarra, we have had to deal with bushfires for a long period now. We had disastrous bushfires back in 1968. A large number of houses were lost and property destroyed and damaged. Since 1968, there have been great efforts on the part of the firefighting authorities in the Illawarra, the various state government bureaucracies and—dare I say it—the federal government to come up with management plans which deal on an ongoing basis with bushfires, which put in place hazard reduction and which identify areas in our local area that should not be burned or should be burned or whatever. 
So I was quite surprised when I spoke with the local firefighters and some of the local volunteers, that they were quite happy. They felt that they had in train a pretty good process. They were working at local, state and federal level with volunteers and they had a pretty good idea of the way forward for dealing with bushfires in the Illawarra area. As I said, we are used to bushfires. So when we did have bushfires in the summer of 200102, a lot of them were contained. Because there had been hazard reduction, there was in place a good network of volunteers and a good network of state government authorities working together to minimise the impact on the local environment.
Having said that, I have realised from the many submissions I listened to regarding this report that we cannot really stop bushfires. Bushfires are horrendous and horrific, and they do run out of control despite all the best efforts by volunteers and by state and federal government authorities to minimise the hazards. It is a very complicated issue. In urban areas such as my own electorate of Cunningham we need to deal with it environmentally, in management terms and financially. But in areas such as the Illawarra I saw that a good process had been put in place. Obviously that happened very early in the piece for me—within the first few weeks of my being on the committee. I, like many members of the committee, such as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, went out to various parts of Australia and looked at the situation beyond my own electorate. I went to places such as Tasmania, Western Australia, northern Victoria and western New South Wales, and the situation was very different. We found areas where there were no management structures really in place. There were old-fashioned ways of dealing with fires. Maybe there is a need for change there. There were not necessarily the resources there to back up and assist those volunteers or to give them clear direction so that they could identify areas which needed to be conserved, areas which could be subject to hazard reduction and areas which needed to be part of a more detailed hazard reduction zone management plan. We found that there were a lot of different ways of managing the bushfire hazard throughout Australia. 
I was most of all impressed with Tasmania and the way in which Tasmania has a very well-coordinated way of dealing with bushfire hazards. What was most telling was what I saw on the front page of a Tasmanian paper which was issued the day before a massive fire event was due. That front page basically told people to stay at home and prepare for the fire. That is in stark contrast to the recent news we have had of the fires over in America, where I understand there are mandatory evacuations and we have seen thousands of properties destroyed. But in Tasmania we were taken into the bush and we saw houses on the sides of hills, surrounded by trees and bush, that had survived the fire. The reason they had survived was that the state had put in good plans and the volunteers and local residents were aware of how to deal with the bushfire hazard on a regular, almost daily, basis. They were prepared to defend their properties. They had in place water and knew the various procedures needed. They were supported by the volunteers, the state government authorities and the federal government when it was needed. In those instances they were able to defend their properties, whether there had been hazard reduction or not.
That was a great example of the fact that bushfires can be managed—but they cannot be stopped. Bushfires and wildfires do run out of control, but they can be managed. Prevention is very important, and we all agree that we need to prevent major disasters. However, we cannot always do that. The other information we received, which was from meteorologists, was that global warming is occurring. They clearly said that the greenhouse effect is taking place, that the weather in Australia is getting hotter and that the fires are getting hotter and more frequent, so unfortunately in the future we can look forward to more disastrous bushfires. Having accepted that the weather is not getting any better we now realise, with reports such as this—with all the information that is coming in, with the reports that are being gathered and with the investigations throughout the country—that the way forward is to have more information, better planning, better maps, better scientific data and better coordination between all those firefighting authorities to better plan and manage bushfires when they come so that we can minimise the impact on local properties, minimise the loss of life and minimise the trauma and terror that people go through.
We had major bushfires in the Illawarra in 1968. I was only a young child then, so I did not really have any perception of the sheer horror of a bushfire. But during this year I was shown a videotape, taken by a local resident from Darkes Forest in my electorate, of the bushfires when they came through in Christmas of 2001. You saw the terror and horror of a bushfire coming through a property. In that instance, the man kept videotaping throughout the incident. You saw the flames coming. You saw all the people running around, getting the children, getting inside, preparing for the fire front and getting the hoses out. The volunteer firefighters were there helping them. There was a lot of screaming and shouting, a lot of smoke, a lot of ember attacks and a lot of fire around. All of a sudden the fire front came, and within a minute it was almost gone. It was very quick.  
Then there was the cleaning up afterwards—making sure that the ember attacks and the fires did not catch. Fifteen minutes after the fire had gone through, you saw the people finally saying, `We've survived. We've protected most of our property.' They did their best with the help of the firefighters and with the help of knowing how to deal with fire on their property. Seeing that video was a very telling experience for me. I realised what a horror it was and the fact that, in many instances, we will not be able to stop bushfires. But we have to prepare. There is no doubt that we have to be better prepared.
Within this report, a lot of the over 50 recommendations deal with the issue of better preparing for and managing the bushfire hazard that we face almost on an annual basis in this country. I really do commend and support a lot of those recommendations that go to the heart of things such as better communication, better assistance for our volunteer firefighters, more money to support their work and more money to support aerial firefighting. I fully support a lot of those issues. However, I did put in a dissenting report to this committee's report. The dissent was mainly concerned with the need to consider the environmental impacts of what we are doing.
At a late stage in the work of the committee we received a report from Nick Gellie on various aspects and the way forward in dealing with bushfires. I really welcomed that report because in that Mr Gellie, a fire ecologist, said that, basically, in any area of Australia—urban areas or whatever—you might have areas where you need to set up specific zones to protect property, and that might cover about 20 per cent of the land. Hazard protection zones need to be set up, and that is very evident in my electorate of Cunningham, which is an urban electorate. We need hazard reduction. We need fire prevention zones set up. That could cover up to 20 per cent of the land. Perhaps 20 to 30 per cent of any area has overwhelming environmental values which need to be protected and which may never be subject to burning. That is just the reality. The other 50 or 60 per cent of the land will most likely be subject to some sort of hazard reduction regime. I have said repeatedly to people that the Greens are not opposed to hazard reduction. What we want, and what this report really does reinforce and in many ways support, is a more scientific, coordinated approach. If that takes place, we will better serve the people of Australia.
I could go on, but I will not. I welcome the report. I thank all my fellow members of the committee. We had a lot of good, heated discussions during the course of forming this report, and I found it very interesting to be a member of this committee. I learned a lot from being on the committee. I also thank the parliamentary staff who assisted us, who kept the show on the road and who put all the submissions together so that we were all given copies of all the submissions. We were kept up to date and knew exactly what was happening, where we were going and what parts of Australia we were dealing with. The result of their hard work, and that of all the members of the committee, is seen in this report. Of course, you can also see it by going to the web site. There you can see the over 500 submissions by members of the public dealing with this issue. It is an important issue, and we all recognise that. It is an emotional issue, it is a hot issue, and it is something which I am sure we will be talking about in this place for many years to come.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2003-11-27,"—As a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires, I am pleased to be able to join in this debate and say that it really was one of the most extraordinary experiences that I have been through as a member of parliament. As my colleagues and I went around to various places for the hearings, there was only one reaction that we felt, and that was growing anger. The anger was because so many people who had given so much time, mainly as volunteers, and who were prepared to come to the inquiry were pouring out their hearts to us about the problems that they had had—and in many cases the devastation of their lives—and the fact that it appeared that we were the first people who were prepared to really listen to their point of view. It was most moving, and I think all members of the inquiry came away with a much better understanding of just what bushfires can do to people and, more importantly, how we might approach them better in the future.
In the limited time I have, I would like to give special credit to the chairman, the member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn. I think he did an outstanding job in chairing this inquiry under a lot of pressure. He put a huge amount of work into it and, in a very short period of time, he has, with the committee's support, produced an excellent report—A nation charred: inquiry into the recent Australian bushfires. I would suggest that it is probably the best reference there is in Australia right now on bushfires. It contains a lot of information and I think it has brought together all the relevant views of the best minds in Australia on what really happened in those devastating bushfires and how we might better manage in the future. So I give full marks to the member for Eden-Monaro. I think it was one of those outstanding efforts that are never fully recognised, but I think it should be on the record.
Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as you know, we had an amazing response to this inquiry wherever we went. I have said how angry I became listening to what people said. However, many people were prepared to come before the committee and tell it as they saw it. They brought forward their experience—in many cases decades of experience—on handling bushfires. As we know, fire is a natural part of the Australian landscape. It is something that has been around for many thousands of years, and there are records that show that Aboriginal communities knew how to manage it. In fact, I have read a local report which talks about the Grampians in my electorate. In that report an early European settler wrote that he came across Aborigines doing controlled burning in the 1840s. The words he used were that they displayed `astonishing skill' in managing fire. I think that is something that people often overlook nowadays; but it is not something new as fire has been managed, and we still have to continue to do that. 
Two things came through very clearly. One is that there has been insufficient fuel reduction in recent times. That led to a build-up of combustible material which clearly made those fires far more intense. The second point is that the way the fighting of the fires was managed showed a very cautious approach, for want of a better term, which clearly allowed the fires to do a lot more damage than they otherwise might have. One illustration of the extent of that damage is that it was estimated that the amount of timber burned in the fires earlier this year is the equivalent of 40 years of logging. A lot of people in the community seem to be against logging on public land, but they were surprisingly silent when it came to talking about the fact that the equivalent of 40 years of logging just went up in smoke. 
I think that is a point that the wider community ought to be taking on board. I guess what it really shows is that there is a growing gap in the community—and that is the overriding message that comes through—between those who have had the practical experience and those with a theoretical approach; or, to put it another way, in many cases there is a gap between city and country thinking on the question of bushfires. My real concern is that, if we do not take note of the report, the recommendations and the findings, we will be destined to repeat this mistake when another serious bushfire season comes along, as it surely will. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Does the member for Wannon wish to seek leave to continue his remarks at a later date?
—I do.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-11-27,"—Today I bring to this chamber a tale of courage, a tale of dedication, a tale of struggle and a tale of achievement. It is the story of Tracey Blair, a 32yearold woman who had a brain tumour removed in 1991, a week before her 20th birthday. It was cancerous and she was required to spend four months in hospital undergoing radiotherapy treatment. Now she is permanently in a wheelchair and left with disabilities. Four years ago Tracey took up swimming. She has been invited overseas twice previously, to England and Korea, and now she has been chosen to represent Australia with the Excell squad in Argentina for the Pan Am Games in December this year. Her classification is S4, which makes her one of the more disabled members of the team, as the classifications run from S14 down to S1. You can see from that that she is quite a disabled young woman.
Tracey has always enjoyed swimming, and she was not going to let something like a brain tumour stop her from swimming. So in 1999 she started a learn-to-swim program at Arnolds Swim Centre at The Junction, in Newcastle. Tracey's original coach was a woman called Jenny Lambert, who encouraged her to get involved in competitive swimming. After Jenny left in 2001, Shane Arnold, at Arnolds Swim Centre, took over as Tracey's coach. Tracey trains from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and on Tuesdays she works out in a gym.
Since being involved in swimming, Tracey has competed in many local, national and international events. She has competed in the following events: in 1999, the Southern Cross Multi-Disability Games in Homebush in Sydney; in 2000, the BT swimming nationals, Sheffield, England; in 2002, the FESPIC Games, Busan, South Korea. Tracey has gained medals, certificates and trophies. She has been inspired by this and she aims to be selected for the Paralympics in 2004. Tracey is involved in Sailability, which is conducted on Lake Macquarie, near the Belmont 16 footer sailing club and is sponsored by them. Tracey does volunteer work for Christo Road Private Hospital, is involved in Headstart, which is a program for people with acquired brain injury, and is part of the education team that talks to the community about brain injury and how to prevent it. Tracey is a young woman who has achieved a lot and has not allowed her disability to keep her down. 
Tracey received a letter from Senator Rod Kemp on 22 November last year, congratulating her on winning a silver medal in the women's S4 50-metres freestyle race in 2002 at the Far East and South Pacific Games. Tracey is off to Argentina on 2 December, and I am sure she will succeed and perform very well. In the S4 division in the IPC swimming rankings, Tracey is currently ranked as 13th in the world for the 100-metres freestyle, 12th in the world for the 50-metres backstroke and 18th in the world for the 50-metres freestyle. Tracey is a young woman who has worked very hard to achieve what she has. She has the support of her family and the support of her community. Today in this House I would like to wish her all the best when she goes to Argentina. I pay testimony to the fact that Tracey has struggled and worked hard to achieve the success that she has. I congratulate her on her past achievements and wish her success for the future.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Blair, Ms Tracey</title>",Adjournment,24,1
