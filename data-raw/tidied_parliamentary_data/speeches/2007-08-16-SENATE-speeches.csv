SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill(s):


Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2007


Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration


This Bill amends section 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take legal action on behalf of persons who have suffered or are likely to suffer loss or damage as a result of unlawful secondary boycotts.


Currently, the ACCC cannot take such action even though it is able to do so in relation to all other forms of anticompetitive conduct under Part I V of the Trade Practices Act. There is no good reason for excluding secondary boycott conduct.


The Government believes that people affected by unlawful secondary boycotts should have access to the same remedies as people suffering loss or damage as a result of all other forms of anticompetitive conduct under Part IV of the Trade Practices Act.


The relevant secondary boycott provisions are contained in sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.


A secondary boycott involves action by two or more people acting in concert, which prevents a third party, such as a potential customer or supplier, from dealing with or doing business with the target. The innocent third party, who has nothing to do with the dispute which is the subject of the direct boycott, suffers loss or damage as a result of the boycott.


Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act deal with two types of secondary boycotts. Section 45D prohibits two persons from acting in concert to hinder or prevent a third person from supplying or acquiring goods or services from the target of the boycott, where the purpose or likely effect of the conduct is to cause substantial loss or damage to the business of the target.


Section 45E prohibits a person from making an agreement with a trade union for the purpose of preventing or hindering the supply or acquisition of goods or services between that person and the target of the boycott.


At present, the ACCC is able to investigate and prosecute unlawful secondary boycotts under sections 45D and 45E, but it cannot bring representative actions. That is, the ACCC cannot seek compensation for damages on behalf for parties affected by a contravention of the provisions.


On previous occasions when Parliament has considered extending representative actions to these provisions, the debate has centred on whether the provisions themselves should form part of the Act or whether they should be reclassified as questions of industrial relations.


On this issue, the Government’s position is clear: this is a matter of competition policy, because trade is adversely affected in the market affected by an unlawful boycott. Secondary boycotts can have a significant impact on our economy. They disrupt trade, they reduce output and they inhibit competition. It is important that we provide a strong disincentive for those people who would target, intimidate and bully small business by applying a secondary boycott to that business.


As the provisions are part of the Trade Practices Act, it makes sense to allow the ACCC to have consistent enforcement powers across all the provisions in Part TV.


In relation to concerns about extending the ACCC’s capacity to take representative actions, it should be emphasised that the Government’s changes will not create a new cause of action. Unlawful secondary boycotts are already prohibited by the Trade Practices Act, and the ACCC can currently obtain substantial penalties against parties who contravene sections 45D and 45E. These reforms are about enabling the ACCC to bring a representative action seeking compensation and other remedies.


The ACCC takes into consideration a number of factors in determining whether it will bring a representative action, including the resources available to those affected to bring their own action. Therefore, these reforms will be of particular benefit to Australian small businesses that often do not have either the time or resources to commence legal action.


For over 10 years, the Government has committed itself to implementing reforms which provide fairer outcomes for small business. This commitment is in recognition of not only the significant contribution small business makes to our economy, but also of the fact that the nearly two million Australian small businesses often lack the power and resources to take action when they experience unfair treatment. This is particularly so in relation to secondary boycotts, as small businesses operating on tight margins and with limited cash flows find it difficult to bear both the cost of the secondary boycott and the burden of initiating legal proceedings.


As a result of this Bill, those who would inflict economic damage on small Australian businesses under s 45D and 45E of the Act will no longer be able to do this with impunity. Instead, they will be held to account for the economic damage that they cause as the ACCC will, for the first time, be able to bring a representative action on behalf of those small businesses.


The Government reaffirms its commitment to stand up for small business against thuggery and intimidation. It is vital, both for our economy and our way of life.


These amendments will achieve greater consistency in the administration of the Trade Practices Act and provide Australian small businesses with greater protection from unlawful secondary boycott conduct.

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill(s):


National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Bill 2007


Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration

The bill:
Establishes a single, national framework for reporting greenhouse gas emissions, abatement actions and energy consumption and production by corporations from 1 July 2008.
Eliminates unnecessary costs currently imposed on the Australian economy through streamlining duplicative reporting requirements under a patchwork of separate state, territory and national reporting programmes.
Enables the secure sharing of nationally consistent data, under robust security and confidentiality protection arrangements, between the Australian Government and state and territory governments to better inform the climate change response and energy policies of all governments.

The Australian Government will invest over $26 million over five years to implement the national reporting system.


Key features of the system are:

a single online entry point for reporting based on the Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting (OSCAR), which is recognised as a world class application;
public disclosure of company level greenhouse gas emissions and energy data for the first time;
consistent and comparable data provided to government for policy making; and
reporting thresholds that avoid capturing small business.

Thresholds and timing for reporting

The first reports under the new national streamlined system will be due in October 2009. Companies will report greenhouse gas emissions and energy use and production for the preceding 12-month period from I July 2008 to 30 June 2009.
Companies emitting more than 125,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases or using or producing more than 500 terajoules of energy will be required to report at the start of the new system, as will facilities emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases or using or producing 1 00 terajoules of energy.
The threshold for companies will be phased down over time to 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases or 200 terajoules of energy used or produced, to allow new reporting companies to prepare for their reporting requirements. The facility threshold will remain the same.

Relationship to Emissions Trading

The Bill underpins the Australian Emissions Trading system, announced by the Prime Minister on 17 July 2007.
Robust data reported under the Bill will provide sound information to inform decision making during the establishment of the trading system, including permit allocation and incentives for early abatement action.

Development of the Bill

Introduction of this Bill gives effect to the April 2007 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) decision to establish a mandatory National Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reporting System.
The design of the national reporting system is consistent with the proposal developed through the COAG and consulted on during October 2006 with all levels of Government and industry.

—I move:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the following bills, the bills be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee:
Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007 for inquiry and report by 13 September 2007; and
Migration Legislation Amendment (Restoration of Rights and Procedural Fairness) Bill 2007 for inquiry and report by 10 September 2007”.
It is becoming a regular Thursday morning activity for the government to come in here and whack down its desired outcome for bills to be referred to the Selection of Bills Committee and to demonstrate its willingness to ignore the views of anyone else in this chamber. I repeat once again that, unless there has been an extremely good reason, the longstanding convention has been that any request for a bill to be referred to the committee has been agreed to. Certainly I have heard of no reason of any substance to explain why the Democrats’ request for these two pieces of legislation to be sent to the committee should be rejected by the government. The government’s attitude seems to be: ‘We don’t like it, so we’re not going to support it being referred.’ Frankly, that is not good enough. The government is quite entitled to vote against the bills should they come on for debate in this chamber, but to block the bills from being examined by committee and to deny the opportunity to seek public input into these bills are very different matters.
It is very important to maintain the distinction that referring a bill to a committee does not indicate support for what is in the bill; it indicates support for the concept of enabling a bill and the matters that the bill addresses to be examined. Putting forward policy proposals in a legislative form is, I think, probably the key task of a parliament or a legislature. To refuse to allow that to be done without good reason or without any reason of any consequence at all other than, ‘We don’t feel like it,’ or ‘We don’t want that issue to be raised,’ is, in my view, just not good enough.
It should be emphasised that the Selection of Bills Committee Report No. 13 of 2007 is referring six bills, including—I accept—two private senators’ bills. The government is going to request the referral of the four other bills to committee later this afternoon. This has also become a consistent pattern: bills that we have not seen or bills that have just been introduced that morning are referred across to a committee.
The two Democrat private senators’ bills would require only short inquiries. This is partly a reflection of the reality that there is a real prospect that the next sitting could be the last before the election. It is also partly a reflection of reality that, whilst the legislation that we are seeking to refer has not been examined previously, despite what the government might say, it is an attempt to put into legislative form issues that have been raised. I point particularly to the Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007. The Democrats have had legislation seeking to remove discrimination in this area in this chamber since 1995. So the broad issue is not new, but the form in which it is being put forward here is new. This is new legislation, and it is being put forward in the first sitting week after a report was brought down by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, following a comprehensive inquiry. It is a new piece of legislation; it is in a new format. It might be addressing an old issue but it is addressing it in a new way, following a comprehensive inquiry.
That is one reason why the Senate inquiry does not need to be particularly long. It is simply examining whether or not the legislation adequately addresses the recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. I emphasise that support for the principle of this report has been expressed by people across the political spectrum. Unfortunately, we keep seeing support expressed for the principle, but any efforts to enact that principle in law continue to be blocked. This seems to be another example of where an effort to implement a principle that everybody says they support is blocked by the government. This shows that the government’s words cannot be believed. The government are not genuine about addressing this issue of discrimination against same-sex couples, because they keep blocking every attempt to address it—and this is yet another one.
Migration is another area where the issues are old. These issues were raised and debated here in 1998. However, the context in which migration laws are operating is new, so I believe that it is appropriate for them to be examined. A new bill has been put forward; it was introduced last week. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-16,"—Mr President, I congratulate you on your new position. I want to make a short contribution on the Democrats motion. We will not be opposing it but I want to make a particular point: the strength and test of a government is its ability to allow dissent. In this instance, the government has demonstrated its inability to allow matters to be aired, to be scrutinised by the Senate and to be dealt with by the Senate, particularly where the government may fundamentally disagree.
Senator Bartlett has encapsulated what is the ability of the Senate—the ability to scrutinise, to look at the issues and to have debate in the committees, which then report back to the Senate. That is all that Senator Bartlett has asked for. He has not asked for a view from the government about the veracity or otherwise of the particular piece of legislation. Senator Bartlett understands that there may be differing views in the Senate on the bill and the difficulties that might surround how it might be progressed. Senator Bartlett accepts that.
This is the difficulty that I see with what this government has turned the Selection of Bills Committee into. We now have a situation where the government refers bills that it thinks the committee should look at, it accepts references—even, sometimes, when we may indicate as part of the Selection of Bills Committee that we do not have a view on whether the bill should be referred—and it denies references, based on the grounds that it thinks that the matter has already been looked into. I suspect that its argument in this instance will be that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has looked into this issue significantly and therefore no further work needs to be done. In this instance, there is a difference. This is about a legislative outcome and how that would be progressed. It is a different issue, in truth. The government simply rejects bills that it thinks should not be referred, because it wants them dealt with quickly in the chamber, or it sends them off for a short inquiry.
We now have a situation which is a far cry from where we used to be. The position which we adopted as a general principle in this place was that, within the usual confines, senators should be able to allow bills to be referred to committees for inquiry and examination. That does not predetermine the position that any party might adopt when the bill comes back here for debate—if it were to come back for debate, because sometimes they do not. The government has now sought to exert control over the outcome—and this is a poor outcome for the Senate more broadly.
The beauty of this place is that it allows debate and it allows committees to examine matters. Part of the ability of the committee structure is to allow scrutiny, to throw light into dark corners and to allow us to have arguments—and not to have them in here. That is part of the position as well, because, if you will not allow the committees to do work such as that which Senator Bartlett has put forward, the debates will come back into the chamber. Senators understand that, if they want matters to be progressed, they will have to progress them in here. We will then lose more time dealing with these issues on the floor of the chamber, instead of allowing the Senate committees to deal with them. I am also concerned about that. By not allowing the committees to do their work, more business is generated in here. You will then complain that not enough government business is being done. May I remind you that it may, in fact, be by your own hand.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-08-16,"—The government opposes the motion put forward by Senator Bartlett. What Senator Bartlett and Senator Ludwig have told the Senate would, on the face of it, make a fair degree of sense, until you realise that the selection of bills proposal that the government is supporting is the referral of six bills to various committees. When you look at those six bills, you see that two of them are from the minor parties: one from Family First and one from the Leader of the Democrats herself, the National Market Driven Energy Efficiency Target Bill 2007. The government has some questions about the policy intent of that bill, as it does with the Family First proposal, but it is more than happy for those bills to be referred to Senate committees. The bland argument that the government will not consider any dissent, that the government will not allow the reference of anything which it does not agree with, falls flat at the very first hurdle, which is: what are we actually debating? Out of the six bills being referred, two are from minor parties and the government has not indicated its support for them.
We as a government make a considered decision—and it would be good if every senator would do this—in relation to each bill that is proposed. We then look at the work, at the timing and at the particular value of each of the bills. In the case of the Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007, we simply advise the Senate—and I dare say that this is, perhaps, where the idea of this bill came from—that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reported on this very matter, and its report was tabled in this place on 27 June 2007.
Are we trying to stifle consideration? No. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which this government funds, received 680 submissions. That is a lot of public input and a lot of public consideration, and guess what? The government wants to consider the report. That is not unreasonable. Given that another arm has already investigated this—namely, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which received over 680 submissions on that particular issue—we believe it is a bit premature to have such a Senate inquiry.
The government does not support the referral of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Restoration of Rights and Procedural Fairness) Bill 2007 because most of the provisions the bill would seek to repeal—and that is what we are discussing—were enacted with the support of the then government and opposition. So this issue had a lot of public debate at the time the government and opposition agreed to it and now somebody is wanting to revisit the issues and repeal some of those sections. We are saying no, the Senate has had a fair crack at this already, has had a look at that, and, therefore, this is not a fresh and new debate—matters have already been considered.
We have taken a very principled and considered approach to all the bills put before us—the two new ones, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Fair Bank and Credit Card Fees) Amendment Bill 2007 and the National Market Driven Energy Efficiency Target Bill 2007, things that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have not looked into and things that the Senate has not debated before. These new and fresh matters are worthy of a Senate inquiry and that is why we support them, but we do not support the other matters which have already been given considerable airtime. When you manage these things, you have to determine value in consideration of each measure.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—What a failure that was to respond to the submissions from the two earlier senators from the Democrats and the opposition. The government is simply dictating, through its numbers, which bills it will allow to go to committee and which it will not and which topics it decides it wants to have analysed by Senate committees and which it does not. It is a policy-driven decision made by an arrogant government which has taken over the committee system, which has the majority in the Senate and is dictating which topics affecting the Australian populace will get Senate scrutiny and which will not. This is a breach of the promise by the Prime Minister himself that he would not allow hubris to interfere when the government got the numbers to control this place. If ever there was an argument for the government to be stripped of seats in this Senate and put back into a minority, where it deserves to be, we are seeing it here this morning. Senator Abetz has fostered that argument and put it beautifully by his presentation—that sheer arrogance to deny oxygen to topics which should go to the Senate committee, such as the Migration Legislation Amendment (Restoration of Rights and Procedural Fairness) Bill 2007 and theSame-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007. The government says: ‘No, we don’t want to see those scrutinised. We don’t want to see how they might best be implemented. They’re complex pieces of legislation and we, in particular, don’t want to see our government’s failure in these areas under scrutiny.’
Senator Abetz has by his reverse argument, his negative presentation, really stated for us all how out of control the arrogance of the government is now that it has the numbers in this Senate and how we are going to see this Senate continue to be sidelined and its role under the Constitution put on the sideboard if this government continues to have a majority in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-08-16,"—It might be helpful to the debate if the minister could give the Senate some indication of when the government expects to make a decision on the Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007, or proposals therein, and whether the minister is prepared to provide—something which has been missing so far and is a good reason for sending this bill off to committee—details of the cost implications of these changes. We have heard some fairly rough, rubbery figures expressed here and there, but there are certainly big differences and gaps in the information that is needed. That was one of the reasons not to revisit the whole issue. I think HREOC did that very well indeed. We do not need to do that but we do need to look at the implications of this bill coming into force.
When is the government going to make up its mind on this issue? Will we have to wait until after the election or can we expect something fairly soon? After all, HREOC did an extensive inquiry. It seems to me there is only one consideration and that is: how soon can we implement it? Are we going to get a decision in the next few days, weeks or months or after the election? When will it be? Will the minister see to it that information about the cost implications that were mentioned are made available?
—Senator Allison, Senator Abetz has already spoken and we are not in the committee stage of a bill, so I will put the question.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Bartlett’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1

This Bill amends section 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take legal action on behalf of persons who have suffered or are likely to suffer loss or damage as a result of unlawful secondary boycotts.


Currently, the ACCC cannot take such action even though it is able to do so in relation to all other forms of anticompetitive conduct under Part I V of the Trade Practices Act. There is no good reason for excluding secondary boycott conduct.


The Government believes that people affected by unlawful secondary boycotts should have access to the same remedies as people suffering loss or damage as a result of all other forms of anticompetitive conduct under Part IV of the Trade Practices Act.


The relevant secondary boycott provisions are contained in sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.


A secondary boycott involves action by two or more people acting in concert, which prevents a third party, such as a potential customer or supplier, from dealing with or doing business with the target. The innocent third party, who has nothing to do with the dispute which is the subject of the direct boycott, suffers loss or damage as a result of the boycott.


Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act deal with two types of secondary boycotts. Section 45D prohibits two persons from acting in concert to hinder or prevent a third person from supplying or acquiring goods or services from the target of the boycott, where the purpose or likely effect of the conduct is to cause substantial loss or damage to the business of the target.


Section 45E prohibits a person from making an agreement with a trade union for the purpose of preventing or hindering the supply or acquisition of goods or services between that person and the target of the boycott.


At present, the ACCC is able to investigate and prosecute unlawful secondary boycotts under sections 45D and 45E, but it cannot bring representative actions. That is, the ACCC cannot seek compensation for damages on behalf for parties affected by a contravention of the provisions.


On previous occasions when Parliament has considered extending representative actions to these provisions, the debate has centred on whether the provisions themselves should form part of the Act or whether they should be reclassified as questions of industrial relations.


On this issue, the Government’s position is clear: this is a matter of competition policy, because trade is adversely affected in the market affected by an unlawful boycott. Secondary boycotts can have a significant impact on our economy. They disrupt trade, they reduce output and they inhibit competition. It is important that we provide a strong disincentive for those people who would target, intimidate and bully small business by applying a secondary boycott to that business.


As the provisions are part of the Trade Practices Act, it makes sense to allow the ACCC to have consistent enforcement powers across all the provisions in Part TV.


In relation to concerns about extending the ACCC’s capacity to take representative actions, it should be emphasised that the Government’s changes will not create a new cause of action. Unlawful secondary boycotts are already prohibited by the Trade Practices Act, and the ACCC can currently obtain substantial penalties against parties who contravene sections 45D and 45E. These reforms are about enabling the ACCC to bring a representative action seeking compensation and other remedies.


The ACCC takes into consideration a number of factors in determining whether it will bring a representative action, including the resources available to those affected to bring their own action. Therefore, these reforms will be of particular benefit to Australian small businesses that often do not have either the time or resources to commence legal action.


For over 10 years, the Government has committed itself to implementing reforms which provide fairer outcomes for small business. This commitment is in recognition of not only the significant contribution small business makes to our economy, but also of the fact that the nearly two million Australian small businesses often lack the power and resources to take action when they experience unfair treatment. This is particularly so in relation to secondary boycotts, as small businesses operating on tight margins and with limited cash flows find it difficult to bear both the cost of the secondary boycott and the burden of initiating legal proceedings.


As a result of this Bill, those who would inflict economic damage on small Australian businesses under s 45D and 45E of the Act will no longer be able to do this with impunity. Instead, they will be held to account for the economic damage that they cause as the ACCC will, for the first time, be able to bring a representative action on behalf of those small businesses.


The Government reaffirms its commitment to stand up for small business against thuggery and intimidation. It is vital, both for our economy and our way of life.


These amendments will achieve greater consistency in the administration of the Trade Practices Act and provide Australian small businesses with greater protection from unlawful secondary boycott conduct.

Name of bill(s):


National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Bill 2007


Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration

The bill:
Establishes a single, national framework for reporting greenhouse gas emissions, abatement actions and energy consumption and production by corporations from 1 July 2008.
Eliminates unnecessary costs currently imposed on the Australian economy through streamlining duplicative reporting requirements under a patchwork of separate state, territory and national reporting programmes.
Enables the secure sharing of nationally consistent data, under robust security and confidentiality protection arrangements, between the Australian Government and state and territory governments to better inform the climate change response and energy policies of all governments.

The Australian Government will invest over $26 million over five years to implement the national reporting system.


Key features of the system are:

a single online entry point for reporting based on the Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting (OSCAR), which is recognised as a world class application;
public disclosure of company level greenhouse gas emissions and energy data for the first time;
consistent and comparable data provided to government for policy making; and
reporting thresholds that avoid capturing small business.

Thresholds and timing for reporting

The first reports under the new national streamlined system will be due in October 2009. Companies will report greenhouse gas emissions and energy use and production for the preceding 12-month period from I July 2008 to 30 June 2009.
Companies emitting more than 125,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases or using or producing more than 500 terajoules of energy will be required to report at the start of the new system, as will facilities emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases or using or producing 1 00 terajoules of energy.
The threshold for companies will be phased down over time to 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases or 200 terajoules of energy used or produced, to allow new reporting companies to prepare for their reporting requirements. The facility threshold will remain the same.

Relationship to Emissions Trading

The Bill underpins the Australian Emissions Trading system, announced by the Prime Minister on 17 July 2007.
Robust data reported under the Bill will provide sound information to inform decision making during the establishment of the trading system, including permit allocation and incentives for early abatement action.

Development of the Bill

Introduction of this Bill gives effect to the April 2007 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) decision to establish a mandatory National Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reporting System.
The design of the national reporting system is consistent with the proposal developed through the COAG and consulted on during October 2006 with all levels of Government and industry.

—I move:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the following bills, the bills be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee:
Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007 for inquiry and report by 13 September 2007; and
Migration Legislation Amendment (Restoration of Rights and Procedural Fairness) Bill 2007 for inquiry and report by 10 September 2007”.
It is becoming a regular Thursday morning activity for the government to come in here and whack down its desired outcome for bills to be referred to the Selection of Bills Committee and to demonstrate its willingness to ignore the views of anyone else in this chamber. I repeat once again that, unless there has been an extremely good reason, the longstanding convention has been that any request for a bill to be referred to the committee has been agreed to. Certainly I have heard of no reason of any substance to explain why the Democrats’ request for these two pieces of legislation to be sent to the committee should be rejected by the government. The government’s attitude seems to be: ‘We don’t like it, so we’re not going to support it being referred.’ Frankly, that is not good enough. The government is quite entitled to vote against the bills should they come on for debate in this chamber, but to block the bills from being examined by committee and to deny the opportunity to seek public input into these bills are very different matters.
It is very important to maintain the distinction that referring a bill to a committee does not indicate support for what is in the bill; it indicates support for the concept of enabling a bill and the matters that the bill addresses to be examined. Putting forward policy proposals in a legislative form is, I think, probably the key task of a parliament or a legislature. To refuse to allow that to be done without good reason or without any reason of any consequence at all other than, ‘We don’t feel like it,’ or ‘We don’t want that issue to be raised,’ is, in my view, just not good enough.
It should be emphasised that the Selection of Bills Committee Report No. 13 of 2007 is referring six bills, including—I accept—two private senators’ bills. The government is going to request the referral of the four other bills to committee later this afternoon. This has also become a consistent pattern: bills that we have not seen or bills that have just been introduced that morning are referred across to a committee.
The two Democrat private senators’ bills would require only short inquiries. This is partly a reflection of the reality that there is a real prospect that the next sitting could be the last before the election. It is also partly a reflection of reality that, whilst the legislation that we are seeking to refer has not been examined previously, despite what the government might say, it is an attempt to put into legislative form issues that have been raised. I point particularly to the Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007. The Democrats have had legislation seeking to remove discrimination in this area in this chamber since 1995. So the broad issue is not new, but the form in which it is being put forward here is new. This is new legislation, and it is being put forward in the first sitting week after a report was brought down by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, following a comprehensive inquiry. It is a new piece of legislation; it is in a new format. It might be addressing an old issue but it is addressing it in a new way, following a comprehensive inquiry.
That is one reason why the Senate inquiry does not need to be particularly long. It is simply examining whether or not the legislation adequately addresses the recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. I emphasise that support for the principle of this report has been expressed by people across the political spectrum. Unfortunately, we keep seeing support expressed for the principle, but any efforts to enact that principle in law continue to be blocked. This seems to be another example of where an effort to implement a principle that everybody says they support is blocked by the government. This shows that the government’s words cannot be believed. The government are not genuine about addressing this issue of discrimination against same-sex couples, because they keep blocking every attempt to address it—and this is yet another one.
Migration is another area where the issues are old. These issues were raised and debated here in 1998. However, the context in which migration laws are operating is new, so I believe that it is appropriate for them to be examined. A new bill has been put forward; it was introduced last week. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-16,"—Mr President, I congratulate you on your new position. I want to make a short contribution on the Democrats motion. We will not be opposing it but I want to make a particular point: the strength and test of a government is its ability to allow dissent. In this instance, the government has demonstrated its inability to allow matters to be aired, to be scrutinised by the Senate and to be dealt with by the Senate, particularly where the government may fundamentally disagree.
Senator Bartlett has encapsulated what is the ability of the Senate—the ability to scrutinise, to look at the issues and to have debate in the committees, which then report back to the Senate. That is all that Senator Bartlett has asked for. He has not asked for a view from the government about the veracity or otherwise of the particular piece of legislation. Senator Bartlett understands that there may be differing views in the Senate on the bill and the difficulties that might surround how it might be progressed. Senator Bartlett accepts that.
This is the difficulty that I see with what this government has turned the Selection of Bills Committee into. We now have a situation where the government refers bills that it thinks the committee should look at, it accepts references—even, sometimes, when we may indicate as part of the Selection of Bills Committee that we do not have a view on whether the bill should be referred—and it denies references, based on the grounds that it thinks that the matter has already been looked into. I suspect that its argument in this instance will be that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has looked into this issue significantly and therefore no further work needs to be done. In this instance, there is a difference. This is about a legislative outcome and how that would be progressed. It is a different issue, in truth. The government simply rejects bills that it thinks should not be referred, because it wants them dealt with quickly in the chamber, or it sends them off for a short inquiry.
We now have a situation which is a far cry from where we used to be. The position which we adopted as a general principle in this place was that, within the usual confines, senators should be able to allow bills to be referred to committees for inquiry and examination. That does not predetermine the position that any party might adopt when the bill comes back here for debate—if it were to come back for debate, because sometimes they do not. The government has now sought to exert control over the outcome—and this is a poor outcome for the Senate more broadly.
The beauty of this place is that it allows debate and it allows committees to examine matters. Part of the ability of the committee structure is to allow scrutiny, to throw light into dark corners and to allow us to have arguments—and not to have them in here. That is part of the position as well, because, if you will not allow the committees to do work such as that which Senator Bartlett has put forward, the debates will come back into the chamber. Senators understand that, if they want matters to be progressed, they will have to progress them in here. We will then lose more time dealing with these issues on the floor of the chamber, instead of allowing the Senate committees to deal with them. I am also concerned about that. By not allowing the committees to do their work, more business is generated in here. You will then complain that not enough government business is being done. May I remind you that it may, in fact, be by your own hand.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-08-16,"—The government opposes the motion put forward by Senator Bartlett. What Senator Bartlett and Senator Ludwig have told the Senate would, on the face of it, make a fair degree of sense, until you realise that the selection of bills proposal that the government is supporting is the referral of six bills to various committees. When you look at those six bills, you see that two of them are from the minor parties: one from Family First and one from the Leader of the Democrats herself, the National Market Driven Energy Efficiency Target Bill 2007. The government has some questions about the policy intent of that bill, as it does with the Family First proposal, but it is more than happy for those bills to be referred to Senate committees. The bland argument that the government will not consider any dissent, that the government will not allow the reference of anything which it does not agree with, falls flat at the very first hurdle, which is: what are we actually debating? Out of the six bills being referred, two are from minor parties and the government has not indicated its support for them.
We as a government make a considered decision—and it would be good if every senator would do this—in relation to each bill that is proposed. We then look at the work, at the timing and at the particular value of each of the bills. In the case of the Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007, we simply advise the Senate—and I dare say that this is, perhaps, where the idea of this bill came from—that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reported on this very matter, and its report was tabled in this place on 27 June 2007.
Are we trying to stifle consideration? No. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which this government funds, received 680 submissions. That is a lot of public input and a lot of public consideration, and guess what? The government wants to consider the report. That is not unreasonable. Given that another arm has already investigated this—namely, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which received over 680 submissions on that particular issue—we believe it is a bit premature to have such a Senate inquiry.
The government does not support the referral of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Restoration of Rights and Procedural Fairness) Bill 2007 because most of the provisions the bill would seek to repeal—and that is what we are discussing—were enacted with the support of the then government and opposition. So this issue had a lot of public debate at the time the government and opposition agreed to it and now somebody is wanting to revisit the issues and repeal some of those sections. We are saying no, the Senate has had a fair crack at this already, has had a look at that, and, therefore, this is not a fresh and new debate—matters have already been considered.
We have taken a very principled and considered approach to all the bills put before us—the two new ones, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Fair Bank and Credit Card Fees) Amendment Bill 2007 and the National Market Driven Energy Efficiency Target Bill 2007, things that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have not looked into and things that the Senate has not debated before. These new and fresh matters are worthy of a Senate inquiry and that is why we support them, but we do not support the other matters which have already been given considerable airtime. When you manage these things, you have to determine value in consideration of each measure.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—What a failure that was to respond to the submissions from the two earlier senators from the Democrats and the opposition. The government is simply dictating, through its numbers, which bills it will allow to go to committee and which it will not and which topics it decides it wants to have analysed by Senate committees and which it does not. It is a policy-driven decision made by an arrogant government which has taken over the committee system, which has the majority in the Senate and is dictating which topics affecting the Australian populace will get Senate scrutiny and which will not. This is a breach of the promise by the Prime Minister himself that he would not allow hubris to interfere when the government got the numbers to control this place. If ever there was an argument for the government to be stripped of seats in this Senate and put back into a minority, where it deserves to be, we are seeing it here this morning. Senator Abetz has fostered that argument and put it beautifully by his presentation—that sheer arrogance to deny oxygen to topics which should go to the Senate committee, such as the Migration Legislation Amendment (Restoration of Rights and Procedural Fairness) Bill 2007 and theSame-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007. The government says: ‘No, we don’t want to see those scrutinised. We don’t want to see how they might best be implemented. They’re complex pieces of legislation and we, in particular, don’t want to see our government’s failure in these areas under scrutiny.’
Senator Abetz has by his reverse argument, his negative presentation, really stated for us all how out of control the arrogance of the government is now that it has the numbers in this Senate and how we are going to see this Senate continue to be sidelined and its role under the Constitution put on the sideboard if this government continues to have a majority in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-08-16,"—It might be helpful to the debate if the minister could give the Senate some indication of when the government expects to make a decision on the Same-Sex: Same Entitlements Bill 2007, or proposals therein, and whether the minister is prepared to provide—something which has been missing so far and is a good reason for sending this bill off to committee—details of the cost implications of these changes. We have heard some fairly rough, rubbery figures expressed here and there, but there are certainly big differences and gaps in the information that is needed. That was one of the reasons not to revisit the whole issue. I think HREOC did that very well indeed. We do not need to do that but we do need to look at the implications of this bill coming into force.
When is the government going to make up its mind on this issue? Will we have to wait until after the election or can we expect something fairly soon? After all, HREOC did an extensive inquiry. It seems to me there is only one consideration and that is: how soon can we implement it? Are we going to get a decision in the next few days, weeks or months or after the election? When will it be? Will the minister see to it that information about the cost implications that were mentioned are made available?
—Senator Allison, Senator Abetz has already spoken and we are not in the committee stage of a bill, so I will put the question.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-08-16,"—I present the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Australia’s public diplomacy: building our image, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Over recent years public diplomacy, as it is known, has attracted growing attention. In this report, the committee has considered and settled on a broad definition of public diplomacy being ‘work or activities undertaken to understand, engage and inform individuals and organisations in other countries in order to shape their perceptions in ways that will promote Australia’s foreign policy goals’. Many international commentators have noted the increasing significance of public diplomacy, with some asserting that it matters more than ever and should not be the poor relation of mainstream diplomacy. There is a very strong connection between Australia’s international reputation and its ability to influence the regional and global agenda in ways that promote Australia’s interests. Our international reputation can either promote or undermine our foreign policy objectives.
In the course of this inquiry, we have seen a significant number of government departments and agencies which are engaged in activities overseas that either directly or indirectly convey to the world a positive image of Australia. I want to mention some of those this morning. Let me start with two which I think are particularly important, which I have spent a bit of time looking at in various iterations. They are the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program and the Australian Leadership Awards Program, which are strengthening mutual understanding between the people of Australia and particularly the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.
There are several visitors programs which are highly effective in promoting shared understanding and strong links between people in Australia and overseas. Even the work of local councils—particularly the City of Melbourne submission—highlighted work with international cities and organisations that goes far beyond a ‘civic ceremonial basis into productive connections of broad social, economic and cultural benefit’—to Melbourne in that case.
Inevitably in Australia, through AusAID and the Australian Sports Commission, we are forging very strong and friendly ties with other countries through the Australian Sports Outreach Program. ABC International, a major player in representing Australia offshore, encourages awareness of Australia and an international understanding of Australian attitudes on world affairs. Our universities are actively cultivating a network of relations between Australian students and scholars and their counterparts overseas and our cultural organisations are actively engaged in building Australia’s international reputation and encouraging a better understanding of Australia and its people, as are the very many other private organisations working with overseas communities, including non-government organisations—especially those engaged in humanitarian work—other sporting associations, businesses and the Australian diaspora.
We commend the work of the government departments and agencies, the cultural and educational institutions and the many private organisations that are actively promoting Australia’s reputation overseas. Many of them work quietly behind the scenes and they are helping to secure a presence for Australia on the international stage and to build a reputation that helps to advance Australia’s interests internationally.
We note in the report, however, that Australia is in fierce competition with other countries that are also seeking to be heard on matters of importance to them. On some occasions the stage is very crowded. Some countries devote considerable resources to public diplomacy and even smaller countries like Norway have developed public diplomacy strategies to gain a comparative advantage in international affairs. Canada is reinvesting in its public diplomacy and making it central to its work and Germany, the United Kingdom and the US are keenly engaged in public diplomacy. China, in particular, has recently embarked on a significant campaign to improve its global image and to influence world opinion.
To ensure our efforts are not overshadowed in this highly contested international space, we have to ensure that we take advantage of opportunities to capitalise on the positive outcomes from our many public diplomacy activities. The committee identified some areas where we believe Australia could improve its public diplomacy achievements. For example, one very pertinent observation made during the inquiry was that ‘the whole is not as great as the sum of the parts in our public diplomacy’.
In light of the importance of public diplomacy to Australia’s many interests, including trade, investment, security and those in the political arena, the committee believes that greater effort is required domestically to inform Australians about our many public diplomacy activities and the benefits that flow to the country from them. The committee has recommended that the government formulate a public communications strategy and put in place explicit programs designed to inform Australians about our public diplomacy and to encourage and facilitate the many and varied organisations and groups involved in international activities to take a constructive role in actively supporting Australia’s public diplomacy objectives.
The committee was concerned about the overall effectiveness of Australia’s whole-of-government approach to public diplomacy in producing a cooperative, coordinated and united effort by the many organisations and agencies that contribute to, or have the potential to contribute to, Australia’s public diplomacy, including the Australian diaspora. The committee noted that the importance of public diplomacy—especially as an exercise of soft power—means that an effective and effectively coordinated public diplomacy strategy is critical to the overall endeavours of Australia to effectively tackle some of our greatest foreign policy challenges, including the challenge of dealing with the threat of terrorism and developments and strategic changes in the south-west Pacific. With this in mind, the committee recommended that the government restructure the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Diplomacy—the IDC—so that its functions extend beyond just sharing information between departments and agencies to include proper coordination and monitoring. One of its most pressing responsibilities would be to produce a coherent public diplomacy strategy that outlines priority objectives for public diplomacy.
The committee also drew attention to the observations of some cultural and educational institutions that the lack of strategic planning that we see in this area impedes more effective engagement in Australia’s public diplomacy, so we have recommended that Australia’s public diplomacy strategic plan take account of non-state stakeholders, including business, non-government organisations and Australian expatriates. The committee also recommended that the government establish a small but specifically tasked cultural and public diplomacy unit in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. While liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that unit would provide the necessary institutional framework to ensure that our cultural institutions are well placed and are encouraged and supported to take full advantage of opportunities to contribute to Australia’s public diplomacy.
To ensure that the department is able to meet the growing challenges of conducting an effective public diplomacy policy, the committee believes it would be more than timely for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to commission an independent survey of its overseas posts to assess their current activities and to ascertain their future needs when it comes to public diplomacy, and we have recommended that accordingly.
The committee acknowledges that evaluating the performance of Australia’s public diplomacy is not easy. We are firmly of the view, however, that Australia’s public diplomacy programs can and should be evaluated. We have recommended as a matter of priority that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade put in place specific performance indicators that would allow it to both monitor and assess the effectiveness of its public diplomacy programs. In other words, effective public diplomacy is not, in the committee’s view, just about listing activities page after page but, rather, also about properly contemplating the outcomes that derive from that activity.
In relation to funding, it is clear that a significant effort is required to project and establish a positive image of Australia in a fiercely contested international space. It is an expensive undertaking for a country of our size to secure and maintain international recognition as an ‘identity’ in its own right but it is fair to say that we have some natural advantages before we start. The committee notes and welcomes the increased funding allocated to cultural diplomacy announced in the 2007-08 budget—undoubtedly it will allow Australia’s cultural institutions to make an even larger contribution to Australia’s image abroad. In light of the proven capability of these institutions to contribute to Australia’s public diplomacy and their willingness and enthusiasm to do more, the committee believes that the government should consider either a significant expansion of the program or the strengthening of its commitment to supporting their public diplomacy activities more widely.
In conclusion, the committee has, in this very broad and interesting inquiry, looked at the challenges facing Australia to be both seen and heard on the world stage, the effectiveness of Australia’s public diplomacy, the coherence, consistency and credibility of its message, the network of relationships and communication systems that form the bedrock of public diplomacy and the coordination of public diplomacy activities between government departments and agencies and non-state entities. It has also looked at the training and qualifications of those responsible for the government’s public diplomacy programs, the use of technology, the evaluation of the programs and the funding available. It is a very interesting and comprehensive report. I hope that it is a milestone report in the consideration of this particular area of policy, and I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,16,1
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-08-16,"—I want to make a few remarks in relation to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Australia’s public diplomacy: building our image. Public diplomacy is essentially about Australia’s reputation and image abroad. In modern international relations I think countries increasingly appreciate the importance of their image and reputation and the vital importance they can have to the conduct of their wider foreign policy. It is an increasingly crowded field of international affairs. The United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and countries in Europe all conduct very considerable public diplomacy programs. They are all very well funded and, I think I can fairly say, they are increasingly providing further funds to advance those programs. So Australia, in relation to its image and reputation, has to compete in a very crowded international space. This poses very considerable problems and challenges for our broader foreign policy.
The committee’s report seeks to make a constructive contribution to understanding these challenges and to making suggestions as to how they may be met in the future. The purpose of the inquiry was not to determine the nature of Australia’s reputation and image it projects overseas; but we can fairly say that we received a lot of evidence that that image and that reputation were very favourably received in large parts of the world. It is reassuring that that is the case and it is, perhaps, not surprising because there is a great deal of public diplomacy activity which Australia projects into the international arena. One of the interesting findings of the report is the extent to which this activity takes place. The following are manifestations of this activity: the considerable work done in our posts and missions abroad, the profile of members of the Australian diaspora around the world, the activities of AusAID, the activities of Australian sporting teams, the many performing arts companies which contribute to Australia’s cultural diplomacy and the very active role of Australia’s universities in promoting education overseas. These activities all contribute to the building of Australia’s image and its reputation abroad. Despite all this activity, public diplomacy in general—and this was a finding of the committee—is not as well coordinated as it might be. There are some areas of public diplomacy which the committee is of the view might be considerably better funded—not exhaustively, but I think increased funding would certainly improve the effectiveness of the program.
In the report, the committee acknowledges the very important and valuable work undertaken by the Images of Australia Branch within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but believes its effectiveness could be improved by some modest reforms. Most of the recommendations in the report focus on strengthening policymaking in the department, improving coordination of our general cultural and public diplomacy programs and reviewing the need for additional funding.
The report contains 20 recommendations. I will save the Senate the time of going through each of these recommendations, but I think all of them deserve close attention. They will all materially improve the way in which Australia conducts its public diplomacy. All I want to do in the time which is available to me is mention the four most important recommendations.
Recommendation 6—and Senator Payne referred to this in her remarks—refers to the strengthening of the operation of the interdepartmental committee process within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This is actually the pivot of Australia’s public diplomacy activity, and the widespread view of the committee is that this needs considerable strengthening.
Recommendation 11 of the report suggests the creation of a new unit in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, largely to more effectively coordinate the conduct of Australia’s cultural diplomacy. One very interesting finding of the inquiry was that there are a large number of arts organisations contributing to Australia’s cultural diplomacy abroad. They are contributing with great enthusiasm. Indeed, the impression the committee had was that there are other arts companies and other arts organisations which, given the opportunity, would very much like to contribute to that kind of activity. Those organisations which gave evidence were certainly of the view that these organisations which were contributing in such a constructive way were doing so without clear and obvious strategic purpose. So the creation of a unit in DCITA, we think, will help to address that particular problem effectively.
Recommendation 19 of the report suggests that there should be a review of the small foundations, councils and institutions—these bilateral organisations—which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has set up over the last few years. The evidence to the committee was that each one of these small councils, institutions and foundations is doing very effective work in its own way in the pursuit and conduct of Australia’s public diplomacy. Indeed, my own experience, as a member of the Australia-Indonesia Institute board some years ago, reinforces my impression that they are a very effective way of conducting Australia’s public diplomacy. The point is that, essentially, these organisations have not been reviewed since they were created. A review would be productive to see whether or not they could, perhaps, be more focused. I would hope that the review would take into account that many of these organisations should perhaps receive increased funding to conduct their activities.
Finally, recommendation 17 suggests that there be a strengthening of the mechanisms for measuring the conduct of Australia’s public diplomacy. Senator Payne referred to this matter as well. There are plenty of outputs which we saw as members of the committee, but the effectiveness of these outputs—the way in which they actually make a difference to Australia’s image and reputation abroad—is a matter that concerned the committee. Our sense of it is that they probably do in many ways make a very considerable contribution but, since we are dealing with public moneys here and since we are dealing with a policy program that is of vital importance to the nation’s future, we think they need to be better monitored and that closer attention should be paid to ensure that the programs are actually delivering what they are claiming to deliver.
In conclusion, the reforms will require greater involvement in public diplomacy activity by the government and a stronger commitment to the conduct of this area of policy. In the last budget $20 million was advanced for the public diplomacy program through the Australia on the World Stage program. I know the former Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, has taken a close interest in this matter, and that is very much welcomed by the committee. This is a very narrow part of public diplomacy in relation to cultural diplomacy, and Australia should not be shy in making a greater contribution financially to the conduct of what is a very important dimension of our foreign policy.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,16,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2007-08-16,"—I rise to speak on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report Australia’s public diplomacy: building our image. I would first of all like to indicate that I am going to direct my remarks essentially to chapter 9. I have not had time to read the full report in the brief time since it was tabled but, from what I have read in the summaries and, particularly, in chapter 9, I would like to extend my congratulations to Senator Payne and her committee, including Senator Trood, who is in the chamber and has spoken on the report. I think they have been very effective in identifying a magnificent opportunity for Australia; that is, the role that our cultural institutions and our artists can play in the public diplomacy area—in particular, their capacity to show to the world the sophistication of Australia and what Australia has been able to achieve culturally.
A great deal is happening in this area at the moment. You only have to read the press to see that companies as diverse as the Bell Shakespeare Company, the Australian Ballet, Opera Australia and our theatre companies are active on the world stage. But my judgement is that a great deal more can be done. I took great heart from the last budget when a new program, Australia on the World Stage—referred to by Senator Trood—was announced with funding of some $20 million over four years. It is a start—but, I have to say, only a start. That funding is welcomed and the establishment of the program is welcomed but, in order to conduct the strategic initiatives which have been so well explained in the report, more funding needs to be provided and there needs to be a greater capacity to undertake long-term planning. The committee have reflected on the organisational aspects of this, and they have made, to my mind, some very helpful suggestions as to how the program can be better coordinated and form the basis for a larger strategic program in the arts.
We have performing arts centres opening up around our region. They will be hungry for important cultural events, and Australia can be a major supplier of these activities. Would it not be wonderful, for example, if Opera Australia were able to plan major tours each year through our region—travelling, for example, to Shanghai, performing in the wonderful new opera house in Beijing or travelling to Seoul, Tokyo and Kuala Lumpur? Just imagine the interest that would create and the opportunities it would provide for Australians in those countries to come into contact with the politicians, the businesspeople and the cultural people in those countries. Those sorts of events do provide a wonderful opportunity for that.
Opera Australia is only one such company that would benefit. The Australian Ballet is another one. Indeed, all the major performing arts companies would see the wonderful potential of having a well-funded program, as they would have the confidence to undertake long-term planning for major cultural initiatives in the region. Of course, I am talking not only about the major performing arts companies but also about our artists. One can easily project the exhibitions that could be held in the regions under a global vision type of program.
The report has effectively identified a wonderful opportunity for Australia. It is now up to the government to carefully consider the recommendations. My judgement is that to have a well-funded program along the lines which this report has outlined would probably cost in the order of $15 million to $20 million a year. That is not a small sum, but the amount of activity that that could help underwrite would certainly have a very substantial impact on our region and would be very useful in further promoting Australia and its cultural activities in Europe and America.
I welcome the report, the analysis that has been done and the insights which have been given. I certainly hope that the government will be able to give careful consideration to these proposals. Hopefully we will see further action on this extremely important front so that we can see a properly funded and organised program along the lines of Australia on the World Stage.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-08-16,"—I present the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Australia’s public diplomacy: building our image, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Over recent years public diplomacy, as it is known, has attracted growing attention. In this report, the committee has considered and settled on a broad definition of public diplomacy being ‘work or activities undertaken to understand, engage and inform individuals and organisations in other countries in order to shape their perceptions in ways that will promote Australia’s foreign policy goals’. Many international commentators have noted the increasing significance of public diplomacy, with some asserting that it matters more than ever and should not be the poor relation of mainstream diplomacy. There is a very strong connection between Australia’s international reputation and its ability to influence the regional and global agenda in ways that promote Australia’s interests. Our international reputation can either promote or undermine our foreign policy objectives.
In the course of this inquiry, we have seen a significant number of government departments and agencies which are engaged in activities overseas that either directly or indirectly convey to the world a positive image of Australia. I want to mention some of those this morning. Let me start with two which I think are particularly important, which I have spent a bit of time looking at in various iterations. They are the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program and the Australian Leadership Awards Program, which are strengthening mutual understanding between the people of Australia and particularly the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.
There are several visitors programs which are highly effective in promoting shared understanding and strong links between people in Australia and overseas. Even the work of local councils—particularly the City of Melbourne submission—highlighted work with international cities and organisations that goes far beyond a ‘civic ceremonial basis into productive connections of broad social, economic and cultural benefit’—to Melbourne in that case.
Inevitably in Australia, through AusAID and the Australian Sports Commission, we are forging very strong and friendly ties with other countries through the Australian Sports Outreach Program. ABC International, a major player in representing Australia offshore, encourages awareness of Australia and an international understanding of Australian attitudes on world affairs. Our universities are actively cultivating a network of relations between Australian students and scholars and their counterparts overseas and our cultural organisations are actively engaged in building Australia’s international reputation and encouraging a better understanding of Australia and its people, as are the very many other private organisations working with overseas communities, including non-government organisations—especially those engaged in humanitarian work—other sporting associations, businesses and the Australian diaspora.
We commend the work of the government departments and agencies, the cultural and educational institutions and the many private organisations that are actively promoting Australia’s reputation overseas. Many of them work quietly behind the scenes and they are helping to secure a presence for Australia on the international stage and to build a reputation that helps to advance Australia’s interests internationally.
We note in the report, however, that Australia is in fierce competition with other countries that are also seeking to be heard on matters of importance to them. On some occasions the stage is very crowded. Some countries devote considerable resources to public diplomacy and even smaller countries like Norway have developed public diplomacy strategies to gain a comparative advantage in international affairs. Canada is reinvesting in its public diplomacy and making it central to its work and Germany, the United Kingdom and the US are keenly engaged in public diplomacy. China, in particular, has recently embarked on a significant campaign to improve its global image and to influence world opinion.
To ensure our efforts are not overshadowed in this highly contested international space, we have to ensure that we take advantage of opportunities to capitalise on the positive outcomes from our many public diplomacy activities. The committee identified some areas where we believe Australia could improve its public diplomacy achievements. For example, one very pertinent observation made during the inquiry was that ‘the whole is not as great as the sum of the parts in our public diplomacy’.

It is patently evident that senators have been contributing very directly to this important debate. The public assertion by Senator Abetz that members of this Senate have been taking time simply to fill in the Senate sitting hours with irrelevancies is quite outrageous. He might be more judicious in the words that he chooses to use outside in a political way to try and defame falsely those in the Senate. There are very serious matters before the Senate and they have been taken seriously by all parties, including the government, in the Senate. That process, as far as the Greens go, will continue.
This is important legislation. The nation’s attention has been drawn to it. This is our opportunity in committee to question the government about it, to elicit more information and to ensure that we are informed before we vote on the various amendments and then on the third reading of the bills. I request that Senator Abetz be a bit more moderate and sensible in the comments that he makes publicly about the process of this very serious debate in this parliament. We can do without the Senate being treated as a political football by the senator. If he were to attend more of the debate about the Northern Territory legislation, he might get to see how serious it is and how good and incisive the debate has been—including the contributions by the minister involved. All parties have been doing this in a mature and sensible way, and the proceedings deserve a better public description than the one Senator Abetz has given.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,17,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-08-16,"—The motion that is before the Senate says that if we have not transacted the business by midnight tonight we will be commencing sitting again tomorrow at 9.30 am. The reason for that—and plenty of notice has been given of this—is that we as a government believe that the Northern Territory legislation, the water legislation and some bills relating to APEC need to be transacted by the end of this week. That was in fact discussed with leaders and whips earlier on. We had in fact wanted the citizenship bill to be part of that as well, but we removed that from the list of bills that we were requesting to have Senate consideration concluded on by the end of this week.
Yesterday, I was asked by journalists some questions in relation to the government’s plan. The government’s plan, as indicated quite some time ago, is to have these bills on the list transacted by the time that we conclude this particular sitting fortnight. It had come to my attention—and I will not say through which sources—that certain people were anxious for the government to apply the guillotine so that they could campaign on the basis of the government guillotining legislation through this place and treating it with contempt. There would then only be the one party that could save the Senate from this heinous activity of legislation being guillotined. All I ask senators to do is to give consideration to the way in which they conduct themselves during this debate. In general terms, what Senator Brown said was right. But I would not say that all senators have conducted themselves in an appropriate manner during this debate, because it has dragged out.
It is interesting that in the 106 years of this Senate since Federation, in 1901, only 29 bills have ever been considered for more than 20 hours. In those 106 years, 29 bills have taken more than 20 hours. In almost half—14 out of those 29 bills that have taken 20 hours or more—and in all that time and in-depth discussion, guess which government provided that time to the Australian Senate? The Howard government. That is a very good and very proud record. But, of course, when the Howard government says: ‘This is important legislation. We might recall parliament to give it more time to consider it,’ it is condemned by only one party. Guess who? The Greens. And we were told at that time, ‘There’s no need to recall the parliament early; the parliament is going to be sitting anyway. We can transact it during that time.’ Guess what happens? When we then do not recall parliament early and deal with it at the time suggested, there is a motion to defer its consideration until October.
—By whom?
—You are quite right to interject, Senator McGauran, just in case people could not pick up who that might be—of course, it was the Australian Greens. And now, we have said, ‘We’ll give the Senate a whole extra day if they need it to consider this legislation,’ but I hear Senator Brown in the media saying he needs to get back to his electorate. Sometimes in life you have to make a decision about what is more important, and we believe that protecting the children and women in particular of these Indigenous communities is vitally important. We also believe it is vitally important for the environment that we get this water legislation through, which has been out and about for discussion and consultation for months. There is some machinery legislation to deal with the APEC conference that is happening very shortly—I think there is unanimity in the parliament in relation to that legislation. That is all we are asking for. We are saying that, if the Senate cannot curtail the debate by midnight tonight, then we as a government are willing to sit an extra day and, if we have to keep sitting, we will then consider the consequences.
The history of the Howard government has been to allow exhaustive debate and, as I indicated, out of those 29 bills that have taken more than 20 hours, nearly half—14 of them—have been bills introduced by the Howard government. Only 29 bills have gone over 20 hours in this place in 106 years, and guess how much time we have already clocked up on this Indigenous legislation for the Northern Territory? Fifteen hours and 17 minutes. So, by the close of today, we will have clicked over the 20-hour mark in relation to this legislation. Then the tally will be 30 bills and exactly half of them, 15, will have been under the Howard government. It shows that we have never taken this place for granted. When we seek to recall parliament early to give it more time we are condemned by the Australian Greens. When we want to give it more time on a Friday, to have an extra day of sitting to consider bills, we are condemned as well. It is the typical, cynical approach of the Australian Greens: you’re damned if you do; you’re damned if you don’t. There will always be opposition manufactured for the sake of opposition so that you can get a cheap headline. I commend the motion to the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—And, with that, Senator Abetz left the chamber. We are dealing with clauses 90 and 91, which effectively forbid courts to take into account cultural practice and customary law with regard to passing sentence and certain bail applications. We support the Democrats’ amendment here and oppose these clauses. I have a question for the minister: is it not true that other organisations in Australia are privileged under the law in a way that makes this legislation cut across the rights of Indigenous Australians in what can only be described as racist?
The Exclusive Brethren, for example, along with other Christian organisations, have exemptions from having unions come into their workplaces under the Work Choices legislation of this government. We know that the government is funding Exclusive Brethren schools which are set up to isolate Exclusive Brethren children from the rest of the community, which is described as ‘worldly’—meaning unworthy and not fit. This isolation means that those children do not and cannot eat with other children, cannot go to university, will not be allowed to vote and cannot go for military service. If one or other of their parents goes to a different customary view, cultural practice or religious ideology, those children are forbidden for life to see their parents again.
That matter has been raised before the Australian courts, including the Family Court. The Family Court has taken those factors into consideration in deliberations, including the passing of sentences. I ask the minister whether he is aware of whether the Prime Minister met the Elect Vessel of the Exclusive Brethren, Mr Bruce Hales, last Thursday. Is the Exclusive Brethren getting special consideration under the law at a time when Indigenous Australians are having any court consideration of customary law or cultural practice struck down by the way this law is applied?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Perhaps the senator does not understand. I should just add some explanation, particularly with regard to his initial comments that this was just about Indigenous people: that is not the case. This provision is intended not only for prescribed communities; it is intended to extend across the entire Northern Territory community, consistent with changes made to the Commonwealth Crimes Act. There were some references yesterday—I hope that you are across it; in my mind I cannot go straight to the reference—to the fact that sometime last year we made some amendments to ensure that, in sentencing or applying bail conditions and determining the severity or otherwise of the circumstances, we could not take into consideration customary law.
I think it is important, initially, to outline exactly what the circumstances are with regard to the changes that this will make. This will apply right across the Northern Territory and, consistent with other aspects of this bill, when the Northern Territory takes it over—which, I understand they have undertaken to do through the COAG arrangements; that evidence was provided to me by Senator Evans last night—we will repeal this. I understand the same provisions are being provided around Australia. That is the general circumstance of the bill; it is not only about the particular aspects of the prescribed communities.
These amendments do not prevent customary law or cultural practice from being taken into account for bail and sentencing. That is not the case. When you are considering bail or sentencing matters customary law and cultural principles or practice can be taken into consideration, and will continue to be taken into consideration. The amendments ensure that in making an assessment about the seriousness of the offence the relevant authority cannot take into account customary law or cultural practice as a factor which aggravates or lessens the seriousness of the offence—for example, in exercising some sentencing discretion, the court could still take into consideration that an offender will be subject to tribal punishment or something of the like under customary law. In sentencing, a court could say, ‘Well, he has already suffered under customary law; we can take that into consideration by lessening that sentence.’ That may be the circumstance. That consideration can still continue and it is a very important aspect of the recognition of customary law.
A bail authority could perhaps also consider the fact that an offender lives in circumstances in a family or a community structure that operates under a customary law environment. They could take into consideration the particular circumstances of a very strong tie with customary law in a community or family when determining whether or not to grant bail or set bail conditions. So, again, these amendments do not prevent customary law or cultural practice from being taken into account in bail or sentencing decisions. An extreme situation that we are trying to avoid is a court taking into consideration the argument that in a person’s culture violence against women was not considered a serious offence. We would not be taking that aspect into consideration, because the cultural law diminishes the offence. So that is what we are attempting to create here. As I indicated earlier, I understand that all of the states and territories have agreed to amendments that are parallel to the amendments we made last year to the Commonwealth Crimes Act with regard to these matters.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—In a definitional sense I am not in a position to provide an answer to that.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I can provide some information to the question I had taken on notice. I am informed that I was correct: a person’s language would never be taken into consideration in terms of diminishing or adding to the seriousness of an offence. In terms of whether this extends to the Exclusive Brethren or any other culture, these amendments, in terms of how you define customary law or cultural practice, do not exclude any particular practices or culture. So, I would say that that is the case.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,—I want to go back to that definition. The cultural practice is the speaking of the language. I want to make it absolutely and abundantly clear here that the intention of the government is not to include Indigenous language in the term ‘cultural practice’.,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I indicated in my previous answer, Senator, that language is a part of culture and it is a part of customary law.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—If it is not to be taken into account, it can be seen as mitigating an offence. For example, if a person cannot read or does not understand an instruction given by a police officer in a language that is not their own, that is a mitigating factor. I need it to be abundantly clear that this legislation does not intend to prevent the court from taking into account customary law in, for example, excusing, justifying or lessening the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates. It may be very much a part of the consideration by a court, because a person’s understanding of instructions or, indeed, laws that are in a language they do not speak obviously affects their behaviour.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—The circumstances affected by this particular provision are the circumstances where, when you make an assessment of the seriousness of an offence, in terms of both sentencing and bail applications, then you cannot take customary law into consideration. But we are certainly not asserting that mitigating circumstances in a criminal trial would not be taken into consideration. This only refers to both sentencing and bail applications. Of course, those sorts of circumstances would always be taken into consideration in any prosecution and defence of a criminal matter.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—A person is found guilty or not, then a sentence takes into account such things as these clauses outline, mitigating or aggravating factors that are involved. The problem that I have with this is that the minister is saying that language can be taken into account in the finding of the person’s guilt or otherwise but cannot be taken into account then in the sentence that is applied. I think this is a law that cannot be supported.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—As I have said many times, I am not a lawyer, I do not have a legal background, but there are some things that strike me about your question. A matter of understanding is a mitigating circumstance. But those circumstances could be established. The fact that somebody did not understand the law would obviously be a mitigating circumstance. But, in this context, whether or not it is a particular language, or whether that language is part of customary law or not, is not the issue. The issue just goes to the matter of whether or not they understood, and that issue would provide some mitigating circumstances in consideration of sentencing and bail, not the fact that it was a customary law or a customary language. The issue is whether or not they understood.

What I thought you had said last night, Senator, and what I indicated this morning is that the states are in fact intending to give effect to the COAG principles, I understand; I have been advised that is not exactly the case.

I did want to ask, while there is a break in proceedings, whether or not the minister can confirm the reported comments of the minister for FaCSIA that he was to introduce a government amendment to this bill. There has been much press coverage about it. Apparently the minister slammed the Territory and indicated that we are going to have to move amendments to protect ourselves from being in breach of the Northern Territory residential act. Unless it has been circulated in the last few minutes, I have not been able to find it in the chamber. I understood it would be to this bill before us. So perhaps the minister could advise whether that is just done for getting a headline in the paper or whether the government really has an amendment to this bill.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

—In this bill?
—No.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Greens oppose parts 3 to 6 in the following terms:
(1)    Parts 3 to 6, clauses 26 to 91, page 22 (line 2) to page 69 (line 11), TO BE OPPOSED.
This amendment opposes parts 3 to 6. I appreciate that we have substantial debates on parts 4, 5 and 6 so I do not want to go back over that old ground, but I do want to ask some specific questions about part 3, which is about the publicly funded computers. Again, these seem very broad ranging powers. I will put on record that I understand what the government is seeking to do with these amendments but they are very broad ranging powers that I want to clarify, the same as we did last night on the extent of the powers over the business management areas. I want to clarify the extent of these powers so that the community and this place are clear about the extent of them and what will and will not be done under them.
I have gone to the definition of a publicly funded computer and, as I understand the definition of a publicly funded computer: it is a computer that is owned or leased by any individual or a body whether incorporated or not that receives funding from a Commonwealth, state, territory or local government authority, or one that is on loan—in other words, as I understand it, the computer does not have to have been funded directly by any of those bodies; it just has to be owned by a body that is funded by the government.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,—There is a suite of questions there. I am not saying they are out of order but out of order in the sense that we have already debated them.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—These are critical to this debate. The point we are trying to get to is  that we are talking about any computer that happens to be owned or used by or on loan from an entity that is funded by the government in these prescribed areas, as I understand it. It does not have to be directly funded by the government. The point I am trying to make here is that these quite extensive and extraordinary powers go, for example, to any NGO that has government funding to provide services in these regions. They are subject to the laws. Am I correct in that?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—My understanding of the bills and the legislation is that this is not just about pornography. The list includes things that are slanderous, libellous or defamatory or what is offensive or obscene—I can understand the obscene bit, but people’s definition of what is offensive varies, I can tell you, because what I find offensive may be different from what other people find offensive. It goes to sending an anonymous or repeated communication that is designed to annoy or torment. I find some repeated communications annoying that other people would not find annoying. Who is the arbiter? Who decides, and what criteria are being used for what is offensive or what is abusive or what is annoying? I find some things extremely annoying. Who makes those decisions? Where will the criteria be outlined?
I would also like to know what happens in this instance: who identifies the person responsible for a publicly funded computer? How is that person designated and what happens if an organisation does not have someone that is responsible? I would also like to know what happens if there is unauthorised use of a computer. The person responsible for the computer is to keep a record of the use. What happens if some unauthorised person uses it? Is the responsible person still committing an offence, because if a person does not keep a record they are committing an offence? What are you doing about training people to know when something is slanderous or libellous or defamatory or offensive or annoying?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Again, there is a suite of questions there. We have said that there has to be a reporting process. Everybody would be issued with a password so that when you get on the computer we can trace who it was that accessed these things, if that is the case, and it is an offence not to do that. If it is a computer that has the capacity to access pornography, then we want to ensure that it is not there. I would have thought that this was a fairly straightforward process.
You re-asked a question about the details of how we would have a definition and appraisal of a few of the issues. I said that it would be useful for me to get back to you on notice. It is a detailed answer and I will try to do that as soon as I can. In terms of the training, there is a whole suite of ways in which the intervention team is being prepared both in a cultural way and in other ways. When they arrive, one of their first tasks will be to ensure that we communicate with the community exactly what all these things mean. In my original submission yesterday I went through the process. That is one of the fundamentals and, because part of the legislation is that that will be explained, we will ensure that people understand very clearly what a lawful use of a computer is in those circumstances and what is not.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—You keep using the term ‘pornography’, and I understand the government’s intent. But, as I said earlier, you have not explained what materials, and why materials that could be considered offensive or annoying, are included in this. The definition does not just relate to pornography. There are lots of things that I find offensive that are not pornographic and there are lots of things that I find annoying that are not pornographic, and that is not defined here. You are also talking about computers that are owned by—potentially, again—non-government organisations that are not funded by government. But it is ‘any’ computer; you are not covering all computers. So aren’t you just going to all computers?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—The head title of section 28, the section you are referring to, is ‘Development of acceptable use policy’. Effectively, the remainder of this is a guideline under which the policy should be constructed. A particular example of the use of ‘annoying’ is in the guidelines under 28(3)(a)(i) to (vi). Subsection(3)(a)(i) states:
that contravenes, or forms part of an activity that contravenes, a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory ...
It is effectively saying that an acceptable use policy would go further than that, because continual, annoying messages are unlawful. So, rather than just having a provision that deals with one specific area, we have been efficient in ensuring that the lawfulness of computer use generally is also dealt with as part of these provisions.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—The answer to that is that this is within our capacity, and it applies only to the computers that we have a link to. The law, as part of these provisions, also extends to the illegality of having access to pornography in the community. If there are other private computers that have access to pornography in the community—and no doubt there are investigations of that within the community—it is unlawful and would be pursued. But we are saying that we have the capacity to have a look at those computers and put special provisions around the computers to which we have access or links so that we can maximise opportunities to ensure that pornography is not available in the community.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—No; the Commonwealth has the ability to legislate on these matters and on unlawful matters relating to computers held by anybody. There are two components here. There are the things that are clearly unlawful and contravene a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory, but then there is a list of things that do not do that, such as being defamatory, offensive, abusive or harassing, and these are matters for which the legislation gives us no guide as to limits. It is fair and proper that we ask the minister, whose legislation this is, what the limits are outside the law to which this section is intended to apply. Why not apply those same limits to the use of all computers within the Territory? I think the reason the minister has given is that the Commonwealth cannot legislate to prevent legal material being disseminated by a computer. But the Commonwealth is legislating here to prevent legal material being disseminated by computers that are funded by the Commonwealth, if that material is considered defamatory or offensive. So here we are outside sexual matters, presumably, and into matters which are political. The Senate ought to hear exactly what the limits of those definitions are and who is going to be the judge when these matters are not breaches of law but are matters of government policy.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—There are a couple of issues here. I appreciate the fact that the minister has to take things on notice—and it is certainly preferable that he does that rather than not answer or give us an incomplete or misleading answer—but it goes back to the core problem we have here. As was mentioned earlier today in this chamber, Senator Abetz—I appreciate that it was not Senator Scullion—has been out there, around the media, slagging off the Senate and saying that we are deliberately dragging out this debate, deliberately filibustering, deliberately trying to hold it up. I do not think that anything the Democrats could have done would have made it clearer that we are not trying to hold this up. But this is what happens when you do not let the Senate have a proper Senate committee hearing. You have to ask these questions here in the chamber because there is no other way to get the details on the record. It is not just for us to make an informed decision in our vote, although that is important; it is for the community. It is just not good enough to pass laws and say, ‘We’re still working this stuff out.’ You cannot continue to use the excuse that it is an emergency to keep doing that. Frankly, it just reinforces the reason why the Democrats consistently argue that this bill should be brought back in the first sitting week in September—when we will be sitting, when an election will not have been called and when we will have a clear idea of what all this stuff means. Basically, as has just been indicated, these things are still being worked out. The powers are far reaching, and there are more far-reaching areas than this in the legislation, but certainly this in itself has its own significance in the imposition it puts on people. It is not a matter of arguing about the intent; it is a matter of talking about the implementation and the consequences.
Having made that comment, the question I would like to ask is with regard to the auditing of publicly funded computers under section 29 of part 3, where people responsible for a publicly funded computer must ensure that the computer is audited twice a year, on 31 May and 30 November, and on any other day determined by the minister—so, potentially more than twice a year. Is the cost of conducting that audit going to be worn by the body that has the publicly funded computer? Senator Siewert asked a question earlier about the definition of ‘publicly funded computer’, which is any computer owned by an organisation that is publicly funded. So it is not actually that the computer is bought with public funds but that the organisation that owns the computer is publicly funded in some way. Of course that means non-government organisations, some of whom are already active in these communities, bodies like Oxfam and Mission Australia and, I am sure, others. Are they going to have to bear the cost of auditing these computers? To use the example that was given in a slightly different context yesterday or the day before by Senator Crossin of people who are taking computers—laptops and the like—in and out of communities, is there any requirement for them to be audited or checked, or is it just those computers that are in the communities on those particular audit days? If that is the case, does that mean that as long as the computer is not present in the relevant place on that day then it is not going to be subjected to an audit?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I will go to the questions on notice I took from both the Greens senators. In terms of the definitions, I am advised that general law covers those definitions and that they are clearly set out in general law. For example, the definition of ‘defamatory’ is that it tends to lower the persons about who it is said in the estimation of right-thinking people. There are a whole suite of those definitions that are available and that the courts would look to.
With regard to the questions from Senator Bartlett and, firstly, the cost of the audit: I am advised that this is a technical audit. It is an IT based audit. While the Commonwealth would not be paying the cost of the audit, I am advised that one of the principal costs of the audit is in fact the software used for the audit and at the moment issues surrounding the supply of software are under active consideration. In terms of a computer coming into the community and the example given by Senator Crossin, the legislation specifically says that the computer would ordinarily be in that location, so obviously it would not apply to somebody travelling in or out. An audit would not be required in those circumstances. If it was ordinarily located in the community then it would.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

They will receive advice that this is the standard of filter, not any old filter but a particular filter that might have a number or a brand. It might even be that the filter may have to meet a standard. It is simply a technical thing, so the minister has decided, through the process, that this is the standard that applies.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-16,"—Yes, but that is the concern that I have here. We are applying this to the areas that are being designated under the bill, and I understand that. What I thought I understood you to say a few moments ago, in answer to my first question in relation to this, is that there is already a standard filter that applies across the Public Service and that this is that particular filter. It is not just any old filter; you said it is one that is a ‘standard’ application. That was the inference I took from what you said, which is why I then asked: is that the standard that applied such that these breaches occurred in the department and have since been dealt with? Obviously, new standards are going to apply—or I would hope that new standards are now going to apply—in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I just need to have clarity about whether what you are putting on in the Northern Territory is what has failed in the Public Service already, or is it different from that? If it is different from that, will it also be applied across the Public Service, given that we have proven breaches and proven access to pornography on the government’s own departmental systems?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—My term ‘standard’ was not as in ‘common or garden’; it was as in specific requirements. So when you go to a ‘standard’ I was referring to a standard being a series of prescribed measures to give a particular benchmark for use technically or otherwise. I am sorry there was some confusion about that. With regard to the remainder of your question, what happens in the remainder of the Public Service outside this bill is beyond my capacity to respond.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-16,"—Then I think there is a very important issue here. We are being told that what is happening under this legislation is to stop people accessing pornography using publicly funded computers. We have examples now of people under the government’s watch, in its own backyard in Canberra in the Public Service, accessing pornography with a standard, a benchmark of some kind, that the government applies. I do not think it is adequate to answer the question by saying you are unaware of what goes on elsewhere. I want to be sure that whatever standard you apply is a standard that you will apply in the Public Service following these clear breaches and access to pornography. I think the public are shocked enough about the statistics that have been released about the Northern Territory. They will also be shocked to know that in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry 11 people were sacked, 14 have resigned and several have walked and that there are investigations going on. What I am asking is: are there different standards being applied to publicly funded computers in areas prescribed under this legislation from those that are prescribed in the Commonwealth Public Service, given that in the Commonwealth Public Service people have been accessing pornography?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—This is an emergency situation in the Northern Territory. The provision in this legislation applies specifically to that.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-16,"—I have always believed that this is racist legislation, and clearly it is, because the government is seeking to exempt itself from the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. You cannot have a situation where you say that certain standards will apply about the level of filter on publicly funded computers for one group of people in the population but that a different standard will apply when you are talking about the government’s own Commonwealth Public Service. Given that the State of the Public Service report published in 2004-05 said that 283 employees in 29 agencies were investigated for improper use of email or the internet—and that is not all pornography, I absolutely acknowledge that, but some of it is—we have a situation where the government is going tough on pornography in Indigenous communities but has a different standard for the Commonwealth Public Service. That is not a good look. That is very discriminatory. I would like to hear from the government an undertaking that the same standards will apply to all publicly funded computers. Otherwise, what is the justification for saying that Indigenous people have to have one level and other people have to have another?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

There was some comprehensive discussion on that, but I respect that you need to have the discussion, Senator Brown—you may have been elsewhere then. The five-year leases are a fundamental part of the intervention. We believe that the leases are a necessary part because we have a clear understanding that, without the acquisition, the infrastructure and the changes that need to be made will not be able to be made in an efficient and timely way in the context of the intervention.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,—I am aware of the debate yesterday. I ask the minister again if he could explicitly put to the Senate—this is a key question which was not specifically answered by the minister—the relationship between the abuse of children and other members of the communities being targeted and the title to their land. Could the minister put in explicit terms how you are going to advance the cause of ending abuse and violence in selected communities by taking the land off those people?,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—First of all, I will make it quite clear that the ownership of the land will always remain with those people. The leases are for a five-year period. There are some clear connections between the violence and child abuse and the reasons we need to acquire unfettered access to the land to provide for changes—principally in infrastructure—to provide for further protection of children and families within these communities. That connection needs to be clearly articulated in the context, usually, of governance arrangements. It has been very difficult. I could cite examples, but it has been pretty difficult around communities in terms of a decision-making process to ensure that these infrastructure placements are done in a timely manner.
Often the townships are owned by traditional owners. Often not all of the people living in the townships are traditional owners. The process to establish, for example, where there may be three or four groups of different traditional owners, who own parts of a township is an extremely long process, and a process that is a requirement when, let us say, we have to go and put in a sewerage pipe. It might cut across four or five of these. Because their rights are still protected in terms of consultation in other places in Australia, not when they are in the community—under the Aboriginal land rights act—the process to find the traditional owners and to go through the consultation process may take 12 months.
If we are going to make some changes to these communities in terms of infrastructure in a timely way then we need to ensure that the governance arrangements—which, in other circumstances, would have been okay, but might take a fair while—are okay. It may also be that the governance arrangements that are in place are the reason that the infrastructure is, frankly, so poor. But in any event, as you would well know, Senator, there is a very clear connection between the abuse and violence in the communities and the level of amenity. If we have 22 people living in a house then the stress and the tension—as well as the general hygiene and a whole range of other issues—within the house are obviously going to impact on the suite of issues that we are trying to ameliorate. So there is a very close connection between that and this government’s need to be able, in an emergency, to do this. I am not sure whether you accept that that is the case, but the government and the Australian people see it as an urgent situation—an absolutely urgent situation.
We know that we need to deal with this crisis on every front. One of the fronts that is absolutely fundamental to change—and I know you will accept it—is the provision of and changes to infrastructure that every other Australian takes for granted. We also know that you are not going to be able to provide that infrastructure in a timely way unless impediments to the swift application of that, by law, are removed. It is for a five-year period. I would hope that, well within that five-year period, the changes we are able to provide will change the circumstances of particularly the women and children who are living in these communities.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The removal of consultation that is involved in this legislation is one of the great grievances from the Indigenous communities who handle their affairs well. If it is for five years, it may well be for 50 years or forever. The question remains about the government’s intention here. The minister talks about 22 people per household and this being an emergency. This was an emergency early in 1996 when Prime Minister Howard took over the reins of government in this country. For 10 years he turned his back on that emergency. In fact, he began by taking money out of the Indigenous communities, some of which would have gone into housing, health and so on—and I am talking about very large amounts of money: $400 million in that first budget. So things were made worse. This emergency has been made worse by the government’s own behaviour, and that comes right from the Prime Minister.
Now there is action being taken here which cuts right across the rights of First Australians to even be consulted. I want to ask the minister: after this decade or more not just of failure but of compounding and making the situation worse by the Howard government, what is the estimated cost of the house-building program for the next five years that will bring Indigenous household habitation to the levels of the rest of the community? I agree that there is evidence—including from the World Health Organisation—that, where you have massive overcrowding, the rate of violence including child abuse goes up, and that it would be a good thing if we can bring that down.
I do not accept, Minister, by the way, that consultation is out the window here. I think it is a grievous stealing of the right of Indigenous people to be treated as adults who know their own lands, their own communities and what is best in those communities. That being swept aside by this legislation, I ask the minister, who has given a justification: if we are going to end this emergency within five years, what is the plan and what is the price being applied to that plan to bring house occupancy levels in these communities to those which approximate those of the rest of the Australian community?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-16,"—I am interested in the minister’s response on the need for infrastructure. I am aware that the legislation provides that, after the five years, the Commonwealth will maintain an interest in the infrastructure, but there is no definition of what is possible under the broad definition of infrastructure. In particular, I would like to ask whether the Commonwealth will be working with the private sector not only in building the infrastructure but in allowing members of the private sector to have access to that infrastructure. I am interested to know whether any of the infrastructure that is to be built will be built for or in conjunction with, or will be leased to, the mining industry in any shape or form.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I will answer Senator Brown’s questions first. In the statement that you made before you put the question, Senator, you implied that consultation was out the door. Then you said that you did not think that it was and you made some other assertions. I agree with you in that sense, Senator. We will be working with these communities. That is absolutely essential in building a partnership and is reflected across all of the communities that have been visited by the intervention task force. Consultation and talking about a partnership role are absolutely a certain matter. Under the law, there are certain provisions with regard to consultation. The expectation that we provide the level of amenity that is needed in a very short period of time may put that at risk. Any piece of legislation that underlines our capacity and our absolute determination to make things better for the women and children in these communities will continue to be supported.
In terms of how much money has been spent on housing and where all the housing has gone, I have to agree with you there too, Senator. We put $100 million each year into the houses in the Northern Territory—I am not sure why we are always having discussions about these matters—but we have fewer houses now than we had five years ago. Those are matters that concern us.
We have had a number of questions about where the money is going to come from for the housing. I think it might be useful to place on the record some additional information about this. The new fund that has taken over from the CHIP fund will provide an additional $287 million in funding for Indigenous housing for three years from 1 July 2008. The additional funding is on top of existing funding that has been provided through the CHIP. The total ARIA funding from 1 July 2008 will be $1.24 billion over three years. This fund will also increase the proportion of funding that is provided to remote Indigenous communities, as a result of a greater focus on remote communities. The increase of funding to these areas will be greater than the additional amount provided under ARIA. The CHIP will continue to operate in 2007-08 as it has done; it has an allocation of $306 million for this year. There is also a payment of $6 million from ARIA to the Torres Strait Regional Authority in 2007-08. The amalgamation of these two programs—as they step over—will provide funding for new housing and for the repair and maintenance of existing housing, including in the communities that are a part of the Northern Territory emergency response.
In response to Senator Milne’s question: the transferral of infrastructure to private interests will only be to the Northern Territory government, a Commonwealth authority or a Northern Territory authority. As to whether we would be preventing a mining lease or similar things, I am not sure that we would move to prevent any particular activity, because this legislation is not intended, in any way, to have any unintended consequences such as impeding business. If Indigenous people in a particular area decided that they wanted, for example, a hairdressing shop, I am quite sure that the Commonwealth would ensure that we had the capacity to provide for whatever businesses were available.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The minister did not answer the question about household occupancy rates, and I ask him if he will. What is the household occupancy rate in Indigenous communities expected to be at the end of the five-year period compared to the rate at the start of the five-year period?
The minister said that government funds had been spent on housing in the Northern Territory and that there are now fewer houses. We all know that that applies to the whole of the Australian community. Billions of dollars have been put into housing, but there are fewer houses held in government hands now than at the outset, simply because they have been privatised or disposed of in other ways.
We have to be very careful with the statistics here. It is important that we know what the government’s game plan is. When it comes to this housing allocation in the Northern Territory, the land is being taken from the Indigenous people—for five years in the first instance—without consultation. That is what I meant. This government did not consult with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory before taking this action. The government says it is going to consult from here on in, but its record belies that will be anything other than paternalistic approach to the future for Indigenous communities. If this is so serious that it is going to lead to the removal of the Indigenous people’s authority over their own land, what is the outcome in terms of reducing the household occupancy rates, which the minister cited as being the problem which connects us to the violence and abuse?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I would go firstly to the complex nature of the circumstances in communities, to the complex nature of the provision of housing and to the complex nature of the occupation of the houses. It is a seasonality issue. There are a whole range of issues about the number of houses. Do we have a target for how many people should live in each house? No, we do not. I certainly am not aware of one. I am not sure that that is absolutely essential. The term ‘normalisation’ means we want to have the number of people living in houses at the level that you and I enjoy. That is the vision. It is not a five-year vision; we are in this for the long haul.
Communities’ needs are vastly different and we should respect that. For the sake of practicality, some communities have very low levels of occupation and some have very high levels of occupation. Townships which have a language difference have higher or lower occupation depending on what is happening. Independent assessments, which are being conducted at the moment, of each of the communities will provide us with some ideas and direction about the nature of the housing. You have already heard of some of the pilots we have conducted in terms of the nature of housing. We believe there can be some economic efficiencies in terms of critical mass, the numbers of houses we are able to purchase. We are in this for the long term. We know that, if a house is overcrowded, that house will function for a much shorter period. We acknowledge all of those things, and those issues will be taken into consideration as we further roll out our strategy. As I have indicated, it is the government’s stated intention that we will bring the strategy to this place within six months and report back again in 12 months. That will include a housing strategy which will reflect the needs and diversity we find among communities and within those communities.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The problem with that is that, yes, you report back, but the legislation is through the parliament. If the report indicates that there are problems with it, unless things change in terms of the parliament—and well they might—we have no power to change the government’s trajectory. What surprises me here is that there is no ultimate plan involved in taking away the authority of people over their land—this incredibly important relationship and empowering factor in Indigenous communities—on the basis that the government is going to roll in and build new houses but it does not know how many and, as the minister says, it is incredibly complex. I agree with him on that. It is an extremely complex matter, but what the government has decided here is not complex—and, I submit, right at the heart of that complexity is the relationship of Indigenous people with their land. The government said: ‘We’re cutting through that. We’re taking that at the outset. We’re disempowering communities and we will do as we want over the next five years in consultation with you.’ But we know what that means, and that is the problem here.
It did not have to be this way. These outcomes could have been achieved, particularly if the Prime Minister had not turned his back on Indigenous Australians, with much better outcomes by now and moving through into the future. The minister says it is long term. I would agree with that and I agree that really earth-changing action has to be taken but not earth take-away action like this. It is very important that these communities do not have their spirit taken from them.
Can you imagine if this were legislation taking away for five years church property around the country because there has been child abuse in certain church properties, leading to millions of dollars in damages suits? Indeed, some church property is being put on the market to pay for it. Can you imagine, if that legislation were before the parliament, what the mayhem would be? No. That has not happened and it is not going to happen, but Indigenous people are suffering the taking away of their relationship with and authority over their land because this government thinks that is a simple thing to do which appears to them like a first move but it cannot explain what it is doing after that. It is wrong, you see. This whole plan was devised even without cabinet, let alone consultation with this parliament, let alone consultation with the people who matter most—Indigenous Australians.
I go back to what Senator Milne asked. Minister, you said you want hairdressers, that they can do that now. There is a real concern that this will not be the end of the takeover of land by the Commonwealth and that big vested interests have a stake in this. Can the minister say that none of these lands which are being taken over will be given to entities other than those Indigenous communities involved, in terms of infrastructure?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—It is probably useful to take the last question first. No, that is not the case. I would like to reflect for a moment on something that is close to my heart—that is, the spirituality of Aboriginal people and the communities in which they live. I respect the fact that the senator acknowledges that. I have to say that, as the intervention task force moved in, their spirits lifted. You assert that it is like taking a brick out of the church. You can make those assertions, but the land always belongs to them. It is not having an impact on native title. The Aboriginal land rights act still applies. When I speak to Aboriginal people about this matter I find that, yes, there was some concern over the first couple of days and there was a lot of mischief in the communities. It is very difficult to communicate in the communities and I acknowledge that perhaps we could have done that better. But, at the end of the day, the spirits of the people in these communities have been lifted. They have not been disempowered; they have been empowered. Now, for the first time in years and years, they enjoy the same rule of law and order that everyone takes for granted, that you and I take for granted.
If somebody threatens you with a stick or smacks you in the side of the ear when you are going down to the ATM, you have someone you can complain to about that. You do not just hold your ear and go home. The little people, particularly the women and children, in these communities, can now stand up to such threats in the same way that women and children in our community can. I have to say that their spirits have been lifted, and that is why I am such a strong supporter of the intervention and the legislation that is so necessary to provide for that. The land always remains Aboriginal land. The only difference to the land from the time we arrive until the time we leave will be the five-year strategy—it is a clear strategy—in which we will move over a range of fronts to improve the lives, wellbeing, safety and security of the Indigenous people who live in those communities. It is simply not reasonable to assert anything else, Senator. You find it difficult—and I accept that—to understand why there is a tie between our need to acquire this land and the safety of its people. I have been quite clear in my attempt to explain why that is the case. We are not going there with any other reason than to reflect the will and the feeling of the Australian people. The Australian people are saying to us: ‘This is a great thing. Go and help these Indigenous communities. Let’s make a real change.’ These laws do just that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Greens do not disagree with lifting the spirits of Indigenous people. I note the letter from the Elliott Community Council, which says, ‘There’s a huge amount of money to be expended here, effectively, and we have infrastructure needs and we want to be part of what the government is doing here.’ The minister himself says, ‘People have got to understand that they are feeling better without the land being taken off them for five years.’ The minister himself has given the argument that I put: you do not need to take land off people to make them feel that they have got more security, that they are going to get better services or that something is finally going to be done about the grog supply or, indeed, the abuse and violence. Those are things that we all want. I am not disputing that, but you cannot go to that argument, Minister, when you are asked specific questions about the aim of the government in taking over the land. You argue that it is to put in housing. But what aim does the government have in mind over the five years? You cannot give me an answer to that question. You said that you were in this for the long term, so can you tell the Senate that this arrangement for taking away the rights of people to make decisions about the use of their land and what is put on it for five years will end in five years and will not be extended?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I think I can remember long enough to take the questions in the order they were put this time. We do have a strategy. At the end of five years—as I have articulated, but I will say it again because perhaps it was mixed in with some other assertions I was making—we would like those communities to be the same—
—Can you guarantee that it will end in five years?
—That will be your second question. I will take it in a moment. With regard to your first question about the standards—and that is what we are looking for—you are asking the question: what is our plan? At the end of five years these communities should enjoy the same level of law and order, the same level of housing and the same level of amenity that the rest of Australia enjoys. Will the land be given back at the end of that period—it will not be extended? Absolutely. It is a sunset clause. It will not have to go through the parliament. When five years expires from the day this legislation is enacted, those provisions will be lifted and the land will return to exactly the way it is today, except for the fact—and I wish this to be so and I am sure that you share my hope—that the circumstances in which those people find themselves will be drastically changed for the better.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

If there is some aspect to the legislation that you think indicates that that might be the case, I am more than happy to discuss it with you if you can bring it to my attention. From my scrutiny of the legislation, nowhere does it indicate that we are making it easier for one particular sector or another. I have said that we will not be building any structures for mining. We have no interest in providing one way or the other for any sector, including agriculture. These provisions are specifically to further protect women and children in these communities. That is what these provisions are about.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-16,"—Before I respond to that, I draw your attention to the articles in last weekend’s papers from elderly Aboriginal women. They said that this legislation will make humbug worse for them, that they will be subject to more violence because of the breaching on social security and that they will be subject to more pressure and violence for their social security income from younger or other people in the community who are subsequently breached. So I draw that to your attention. I intend to come back to that later in the discussion of that particular bill.
In relation to the mining industry, my understanding is that you are privatising land because you want to provide infrastructure in those communities, but ‘infrastructure’ is not defined. You say that at the end of five years there will be ongoing interest in that particular land from the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory or any departments thereof. I also note that you said that the provisions of the land rights act still apply and so on, but I do draw to your attention that last year the government moved to allow for the nomination of a waste dump on Indigenous land without the consent of Indigenous people. It allowed the minister to approve a nuclear waste dump on Indigenous land without the consent of Indigenous people, and it also legislated to take away procedural fairness from Indigenous people. So you can hardly be surprised that Indigenous people or the general community are extremely cynical about a move to privatise land—especially when we know that the uranium miners are out there now, in large areas of the Territory. And, by coincidence, a lot of the prescribed areas would be enormously satisfying for the industry if they were able to service them from infrastructure in those communities. That is why I am asking specifically about this: we know that the mining industry has been a driver of the campaign against land rights and undermining Indigenous land rights.
The point I make is this: this legislation privatises land for the purposes of infrastructure. You have not defined ‘infrastructure’. You have said it is not designed to stop private enterprise. What is to prevent a mining company from entering into a partnership with the Commonwealth or with a community to access some of this funding to build infrastructure to support mining exploration or some other mining development, including a nuclear waste dump?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—We have suddenly discovered that the hidden wealth of Australia’s mineral resources is in fact hiding under each and every one of the 63 prescribed communities! Give me a break. This is a serious matter, and you are suddenly putting to this place that this is some kind of a Trojan Horse so that we can mine the area of the townships.
Perhaps I should describe the nature of the prescribed communities. We are talking about the area literally around where the houses are at the moment. We have a community and basically the boundary fence of the community is there, and that is where we are talking about. Having a radioactive waste facility, a mine or mining infrastructure there is not the intention. As I have said, it seems so silly to stand in this place and work through and guarantee all the things that we are not doing. We could spend forever here. Your particular bent is ensuring that there is no assistance given to mining. This legislation is specifically to provide infrastructure to help out Indigenous Australians. The land is not being privatised. The things that government is able to do with the land are spelt out in the legislation. Whilst I am more than happy, in the spirit of trying to get through this, to continue to do this, I would say that all of the amendments you are discussing are already behind us. They have already been voted on. There are no amendments that we are currently considering, or are likely to consider, that cover this area.
In light of some of the previous discussions we have had in this place, I have continued to debate this issue and provide information where I can, even though there is no reason for me to do so, because it has already been debated. If I am showing some frustration I apologise; it is not normally my way, Senator Milne. You can continue to ask questions about what we are not going to do. I would prefer if we could just focus on the bits of the legislation that concern you about what we have allowed. We have been quite prescriptive in the legislation about what the government are able to do in these communities, and it reflects our clear intention to make these communities better places to be.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-16,"—There is a deliberate misrepresentation there. What I was talking about was infrastructure to support those developments, not digging up and mining the communities within the boundaries of those communities. That is clearly not what I was talking about. I was talking about developing a node or point, if you like, in infrastructure. That is the point I was making, so please do not misrepresent that as suggesting anything to the contrary.
In relation to having dealt with this previously, the government did not provide an opportunity through a Senate committee process for a proper length of time to allow people to come before it and to tease out what it actually meant. My colleagues and I have tried to establish, throughout this debate, what is meant by it. I have heard what the minister had to say, and it will be noted. In terms of privatising the land, I would argue that that is precisely what will happen, because there is communal ownership now and it will go into lease arrangements—and, at the end of five years, I will be very surprised if that privatisation process is ever reversed.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—The Democrats oppose part 7 in the following terms:
(8)    Part 7, Division 4, page 82 (line 2) to page 85 (line 6), TO BE OPPOSED.
This amendment is to oppose part 7, division 4 of the legislation, which refers to the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the assets and liabilities of a community store. Part 7 more widely deals with the licensing of community stores.
I continually seek to point to and highlight common ground and to attempt to find constructive and cooperative ways forward and I would note that, in the sections related to community stores, the general stated aim of action is one that is, broadly speaking, welcome. The feedback I have received from a wide range of people, including Aboriginal people and groups, is that some concerted action to improve the situation of community stores is welcome. I put that on the record. I am not sure why I keep making the effort of positively acknowledging what the government is doing, because it certainly does not acknowledge our approach. Indeed, even yesterday Minister Brough once again completely misrepresented the Democrats and made grossly false statements about the Democrats’ ‘inaction’ in this area—but I will deal with that at another time.
The section dealing with the licensing of community stores recognises that there would be potential benefit in improving the situation of community stores. As with every example and comment with regard to this area of activity in the Northern Territory and with indigenous communities more broadly, it is not a situation of universal disaster across the board: there are positive examples of stores as well as extremely negative examples. There are different types of circumstances, different situations, different contexts, in all of the different communities; it is not an across-the-board disaster area. I hope that is acknowledged by the Commonwealth in the implementation of all of these things. I hope they do not take a scorched-earth approach and try to reinvent the wheel in areas where the wheel is actually doing okay. Nonetheless, there is undoubted merit in improving the situation of community stores.
I will not pass comment on all the other measures that are being taken, whether it be in this intervention or in a lot of other areas to do with Indigenous people, or on all the different ideas that people have. However, in the feedback I have had from people in the Northern Territory, more than one person has said to me, ‘If you could just make sure that all of the kids get a couple of good-quality meals each day—which could be done pretty cheaply—then you would be making an enormous difference to the health of those kids.’ I know that is a wider issue than sexual assault, but we were talking about the wider issue of the health of children, which is an overarching issue. If you get good-quality food for those kids each day, the health benefits, the social benefits, the wider community benefits, would be enormous and that could be done without massive expense. It would obviously be at some expense—getting food to these areas is not cheap—but, on a national scale, the cost of doing it should not be that large, and it certainly should not be beyond the wit of Australia. I am not sure that delivering it through the government is necessarily the best way of doing it. Utilising private means and community based means and leveraging off private enterprise may well be better ways of doing it, rather than through a government command economy way. That is a broader comment.
The Democrats amendment goes to part 7, division 4 of the legislation, on page 82:  ‘Acquisition by the Commonwealth of assets and liabilities of a community store’. The Democrats’ reasoning behind this is that we think there are other alternatives. We understand the intent; it is the same intent with everything else: the Commonwealth identifies a problem and it thinks the best solution is for it to take over.  We do not believe the compulsory acquisition power is necessary for dealing with stores’ management issues. We think they can be dealt with without giving the power to seize assets. In many communities, the community store is the only viable business, and to have that only viable business able to be acquired by the Commonwealth is a huge step. People should not be dismissive of what that is about. While we are not touching on some of the other aspects to do with the licensing of community stores—the varying of licences, the revoking of licences—the acquisition of assets and liabilities is a step further than is needed. There are already quite substantial powers in other areas.
That is the rationale behind the Democrats amendment. I have an alternative amendment if this one should fail—which, frankly, is pretty likely. Mind you, my alternative amendment is probably pretty likely to fail as well. But it is possible there might be a sudden outbreak of willingness to engage and listen on the part of the government. We will see what happens.
There are several questions I would ask with regard to division 4, ‘Acquisition by the Commonwealth of assets and liabilities of a community store’. Firstly, for the record: what are the appeal mechanisms if the Commonwealth moves to acquire; is appeal through the courts the only avenue, and, if that is the case, what is the scope of that appeal—is it in any way a merits review or is it a court being able to assess the lawfulness or otherwise of the action? Secondly, what is the mechanism for compensation if there is an acquisition by the Commonwealth?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—The assertion that there is only one store, that the Commonwealth would be taking over that store and that this is some sort of draconian power does not really reflect the intention as stated in the legislation. Clearly there are a whole range of provisions available before that particular power would be used. But we can say that it is about ensuring that stores operate in the normal way that we would expect stores to work, as I was saying to other senators today. When you go into a store the food is actually marked with a price tag. You would assume the quality of the goods in the store is up to scratch; you would assume that the store is not filthy; you would assume that the store does not have rats running across all the products at night; you would assume that you would have some sort of notice of opening hours, that you would know what they were and that the storekeeper would not just open whenever they felt like it; and you would assume that they would actually have fresh fruit and vegetables.
We have some fantastic stores in these communities—for instance, the Arnhem Land Progress Association is one, also Galiwinku and Palumpa, and I have been to plenty of others. These are outstanding stores that provide all of these things. But, unfortunately and tragically, in some communities that is not always the case. So it is our intention to ensure that, as part of this intervention, normal access to fresh fruit and vegetables is available to people in these communities. As I have said, it is a complex and sophisticated circumstance that we are dealing with and it needs a complex and sophisticated solution. The solution provided is ensuring that every store will have access to the same level of amenities that we who live outside of those communities take for granted.
When we have gone through the process of giving the community stores the opportunity to improve through a conditional licence and assisting them in that way, they will be approached and afforded the opportunity to take on a new operator if the operator is the problem. Where it is feasible, and other avenues to license the existing store have been pursued, the government then may consider facilitating the establishment of a new store. In areas where there is only one store and we have tried every single thing—and we will try all of those things—yet the store still does not provide reasonable service and food to these communities, the government reserves the right to move to acquire it. In some of these communities fresh vegetables and fruit are foreign to them. That should not be the case. So we will go all the way, right up to where we have strived to do everything, but I can tell you that this government is not going to accept: ‘Oh, well, we did our best. We’ll do everything else but you simply won’t be able to feed yourself properly.’ Roger Corbett, who is on the task force, used to be the CEO of Woolworths, ‘the fresh food people’. We are seeking his advice to ensure that the standards we are asking for the stores reflect the standards required in the wider community.
So I say again: this will be a power of last resort. We think the communities deserve the knowledge that, when this legislation has passed, we will work responsibly with the community stores to ensure they are providing those standards, and many of them are. The good stores will remain and will be encouraged. In fact, they may be the sorts of operators we would like to see in the other communities. But at the end of the day we have a compact with Indigenous Australia. We have said that we will stop at nothing to provide the same level of amenity. That does not mean saying, ‘If we can’t get the cooperation then, at a certain point after we’ve tried everything, we’ll simply give up.’ That is not what we are doing in this case. The suite of processes identified in the legislation ensures that this power is definitely a power of last resort. It is important to retain this power to acquire assets of stores, as has been written into the legislation, as a last resort.
Specifically, with regard to your question about appeal, like much of this legislation the right of appeal is through the courts. The assessment process is exactly the same as for the acquisition of any property. It will depend entirely on the circumstances, which in some circumstances may well be a lease, but in other circumstances no lease may be involved. So the assessment of property would be on those terms.
There is no mischief, no hidden agenda from the government. We are simply saying that dietary factors have an absolutely close tie to health. I know the senator is not disputing that. But it is a very important point to make that the health and wellbeing of these communities is a fundamental part of this—all aspects are connected: health, education and housing. That is why, for each one of these endeavours, we have ensured that all of those anticipated blockages to our providing the same level of amenity are removed, whether those blockages are housing, infrastructure, school attendance or inappropriate use of welfare payments or whether it be, as it is in this case, the very simple thing that people take for granted—that is, the provision of food for your health.
Whilst you have not asserted it on this occasion, Senator Bartlett, it has been put to me that we need to demonstrate a close tie between any aspect of this legislation and the prevention of violence and sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities. While I am probably not able to make that assertion directly in this case, one would think the general wellbeing of the community was a fundamental plank in resolving the circumstances that these First Australians find themselves in.
Again, it is important to retain the power to acquire assets. I assure you that this will be a power of last resort. As we indicated in the legislation, this would be considered only when the community store is the only store available to the community but it has not been possible to issue a licence, and the store needs to be licensed to participate in some sort of income management process. We would then go through the full suite of processes in consideration of the store, as I indicated to you earlier. The stores will be given every opportunity to come up to a simple standard that every other Australian takes for granted. I think Indigenous Australians, particularly young Indigenous Australians who are growing up in these communities, deserve nothing less.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) and the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Johnston) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Evans) and Senator Carr today relating to nuclear energy.
I do so in the context that it has to be appreciated just how important nuclear research is in this country and what a magnificent chance we have to explore the opportunities for expansion of nuclear research in a range of medical developments and manufacturing industries and in engineering and other processes. What I find absolutely astounding though is the government’s irresponsibility when it comes to the selling of uranium to India in circumstances where India has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. India has something like 36 nuclear warheads, and the United States government has indicated that its position is to reprimand India over its nuclear weapons program because it has breached undertakings with regard to nuclear testing. In these circumstances I find it absolutely extraordinary that ministers in this government can claim that India has a strong record when it comes to honouring its commitments on nuclear testing and the military use of nuclear power. It is an extraordinary proposition that this government can seek to take a position of such blinding hypocrisy.
On the other hand there is the government’s position on local government. Just last year this government voted against a proposition, moved by me, to give constitutional recognition to local government. But this year, on the eve of an election, the government seeks to intervene in the electoral processes in Queensland with regard to the operations of the Local Government Act. We have a simple proposition: if that is to be the rule—this newfound commitment to concerns about local interests—it is important that that position be held in all regards. You would think that position would be held on the establishment of nuclear power plants. This government has received a commissioned report by the Prime Minister which indicates that it is the government’s desire to build 25 reactors in this country, yet there is no discussion about where those reactors are to go and no discussion about the consequences of building those reactors.
In that context, I think it is appropriate that we hear from this government about what legal advice they have sought about the capacity of the Commonwealth government in Canberra to override local communities when it comes to the expression of their desire not to have those reactors built in their localities. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources stated on 26 July that such legal advice would be sought. Where is it? It is time for the government to put that advice on the table. If it is appropriate to intervene in local government elections in Queensland, it is also appropriate to put a position with regard to people’s rights to have their say about where these new nuclear reactors go.
—Can you speak up a bit?
—We are entitled to know the locations of the 25 reactors that this government intends to build. The people of the Hunter, and the people of the Queensland coast, for that matter. The senator across the chamber interjects. We are entitled to know what his attitude is on the building of nuclear reactors on coastal Queensland. We are entitled to know what the position is on the Hunter and Jervis Bay and on the Victorian coast. What is the situation in South Australia? Does the government intend to build reactors there? Why shouldn’t people have a say on whether or not such reactors are built in their backyards? If it is the case that the government now thinks it has the constitutional power to intervene in local government elections in Queensland, then it will also have the constitutional power to provide the AEC with the authority to conduct plebiscites on the issue of nuclear reactors right across Australia. That is simply the logic that has been put here today, and I would love to hear what this government has to say on that question.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Uranium Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,22,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2007-08-16,"—I will first start by saying that I do not know what Senator Carr has been reading, but this country could not afford to build 25 nuclear reactors. This country does not need 25 nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors cost billions of dollars each and, multiplied by 25, you could easily see that we do not have that. We do have uranium in this country. We are not, as some people may think, the biggest developer and biggest seller of uranium in the world. Canada holds that position. However Australia does have the biggest reserves of uranium in the world. We export something like 11,000 tonnes of uranium each year now. Canada exports slightly more than that. With the expanding of the UO production, or yellowcake, in Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan will easily become the biggest exporter of uranium in the world, with 18,000 tonnes per annum beginning in 2008.
The point I want to make is this: if Australia does not sell its uranium, with guidelines, to India—the largest democracy in the world—then Kazakhstan will. India is a country with which we have historical ties. It is a country with which we have traded for almost a couple of centuries, if you include our British heritage. Many of India’s citizens live in Australia. India is a country that has shown the world what can happen when a country adopts the democratic process. This government, I know, will not expand its uranium sales unless there is agreement from India to our terms. And it is not just Kazakhstan that will sell uranium to India; there are places in Africa that will sell their uranium to India too. Plutonium is a very special by-product of uranium waste. It is not something that can be taken from used or spent fuel rods and put into a bomb. It takes years, sometimes, to develop enough uranium to make plutonium and enough to make a device that will explode. Also, it takes an immense amount of technology to do it.
If Australia does not use its uranium wisely, someone else will fill the void and Australia will miss out. My home state of Western Australia, for instance, has missed out on tens of billions of dollars over the past 20 years by not developing the known uranium sources in that state, the biggest mining state in the world, the state that has an excellent record for mining. If Australia does not contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases, when we do have the devices here to do it, we will be left wanting. We will have the finger pointed at us saying: ‘You had the means to stop production of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, and you failed to do it. Instead, you have kept on exporting coal.’ There is nothing wrong with exporting coal, particularly if that coal is adapted to the clean coal process.
Other countries in the world that we respect, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and France—80 per cent of France’s power is nuclear power—are developing and expanding their nuclear power stations and building new stations. China, our biggest trading partner now, is expanding its nuclear power plants across China. Why shouldn’t China expand its nuclear power plants and buy uranium from Australia? China loses up to 10,000 people a year in its coalmines, largely in small coalmines that are owned by individuals in China. This will obviate the necessity for the rush to coal to create energy for the massive industrialisation of China.
If we do not do that, I think that we would have the finger pointed at us. People from various parts of the world will say to us: ‘You have the means to reduce the deaths in China by exporting your uranium there. You have the means to reduce the occurrence of millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases per year and you’ve failed to do it, you’ve failed to take note.’ We should grasp the opportunity and embrace nuclear power, provided—and only provided—that it is a safe issue for us to embrace.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-08-16,"—Less than three months ago the federal Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Ian Macfarlane, said that Australia will not sell uranium to India until India signs the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Today in this chamber we have government senators’ responses to questions telling us that it is not necessary for India to sign the NPT for Australia to sell uranium to it. Minister Macfarlane spoke to the Age newspaper about the sale of uranium to India in May this year. The article said:
“The answer is no,” Mr Macfarlane said. “The Australian uranium industry can prosper without India, that’s my answer.
“We have a prohibition on the basis they have not signed the NPT.”
But it does not end there. The article goes on to say:
Asked about the contradiction with Mr Howard’s comments over uranium sales to India, Mr Macfarlane said he was simply stating the Government’s policy. “There has certainly been no discussion with me, and I’m the guy who signs the export permits, about the potential to supply India,” he said.
We are three months down the track and we have Mr Downer telling us that selling uranium to India without its signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty would make the world safer, because its nuclear plant would be subject to international inspections for the first time. According to today’s Age newspaper, Mr Downer also said that there was no way that uranium could be used for military purposes. But the question really is: what level of safety and what level of assurances would we have about the uranium from Australia going to a country that has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? India’s chief scientific adviser has his own views about this. In an interview in the Hindu newspaper he is quoted as saying:
Whatever reactors we put under safeguards will be decided at India’s discretion.
He went on to say:
We are not firewalling between the civil and military programs in terms of manpower or personnel. That’s not on.
The foreign minister does not ‘think there is a risk’. But how can we be sure? Is it a risk we really want to take?
The development by the Howard government of a shift in Australia’s policy from no sale of uranium to countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a policy that to date has served us well, to the possible sale of uranium to countries outside of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty will not be a decision welcomed by the Australian people. India is a nation that will not rule out nuclear testing and it will not put its name to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Labor believes that selling uranium to a country that will not sign onto the NPT is not only a risk we do not want or need to take but also a move that will undermine the delicate nuclear non-proliferation regime. Labor believes Australia has an obligation to make sure the International Atomic Energy Agency fulfils its role through the non-proliferation treaty. Yesterday, Mr Rudd said:
Nuclear weapons proliferation is not a laughing matter, it’s a serious matter ... And it is a very bad development indeed when we have the possibility of the Government of Australia stepping outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty and saying it’s OK to sell uranium to a country which isn’t a signatory to the NPT. This is a significant breach from the consensus of Australian governments in the past and I believe sends a bad message to the international community.
By committing to uranium sales to India, Australia would also be forced to cross its collective fingers that none of this nuclear material falls into the wrong hands. Pakistan cricketer Imran Khan has said that the Howard government’s decision to sell uranium to India will now spark a new arms race on the subcontinent. He told SBS television that Australia’s decision to export uranium would encourage generals in his country to spend more on weapons to counter India’s access to nuclear fuel.
Nuclear power is not the answer. It is not the answer to Australia’s future energy needs either. It will be at least 2020 before nuclear—(Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-08-16,"—From time immemorial in our country, local councils have had the ability to question and poll their constituents on issues of importance to those local constituents. Nowhere in the democratic world have I ever been aware of a state government demanding by legislation that councils should not conduct a poll, yet this is what is happening in Queensland at the present time. Why there is not outrage in this chamber from all sides, I cannot comprehend. This is the greatest attack on freedom of speech that Australia has ever seen.
Whilst the opposition talk about conducting polls on nuclear power plants—and my colleague Senator Lightfoot has very clearly answered that—there is nothing to stop a council conducting a poll on a nuclear power plant or on anything else, except if you happen to live in Queensland. If you happen to live in Queensland, you cannot conduct a poll on a particular matter. And what is that matter? It is a matter of governance and whether the way you are democratically governed in your particular locality should or should not continue. A Queensland Labor government has determined by legislation that, if any councillor should dare to suggest that their constituents have a say, they will be in breach of an act and will be fined a maximum penalty of 15 penalty units, which is a substantial sum of money. The Queensland act goes on to say that any councillor who should have the temerity to ask his constituents for an opinion will face having to pay personally any costs incurred in doing that.
This sort of antidemocratic, un-Australian legislation is unbelievable in a country like Australia. I am disappointed the Labor Party in this place have not demanded some protection of freedom of speech. The union movement in Queensland—and of course all of my colleagues sitting opposite me are only in this chamber because of the union movement—were initially totally opposed to this because they knew that it would mean a loss of jobs in rural and regional Queensland. Mr Bill Ludwig, from the Australian Workers Union and father of Senator Joe Ludwig, was totally opposed to it. Suddenly, he has gone all quiet and we wonder why. As Senator Johnston said in answer to Senator Carr’s question, it is because the AWU in Queensland have been made part of the Queensland local government system in the transition process. That is why the unions have been bought off.
Australians must not contemplate having another Labor government in this country so that we have wall-to-wall Labor governments—eight Labor state and territory governments and a federal Labor government—because the arrogance of Mr Beattie, the arrogance that the Queensland state Labor government demonstrate, would be palpable and would consume and continue on into a federal Labor government. Mr Beattie demonstrates the arrogance that Labor governments exude. You can imagine if there were a Labor government in Canberra, unaffected and unable to be dealt with by an opposition here, the arrogance that Mr Beattie displays would roll over into a Rudd Labor government. Mr Beattie’s actions demonstrate very clearly to all Australians just how undemocratic Labor governments can be. The outrageous approach of the Queensland Labor government in not allowing Queenslanders to have a say on a matter of governance cannot be left to pass without outrage.
There were opportunities for Queenslanders themselves to demonstrate in the street, but Mr Beattie told the SES workers that if they put up any barricades they too would be sacked. And this is a supposedly democratic government. There is not an upper house in Queensland so its Labor government rules as it wishes. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I address my comments to the answers to questions given today by government senators relating to the sale of uranium to India. If anybody was looking for another reason not to vote for this government in the forthcoming election, they certainly heard it today. Not only is this government arrogant, out of control, reckless, presiding over interest rate rises and interminably racked by leadership divisions, it is now downright dangerous. This government is intent on dragging Australia down the nuclear path. We already know it wants to build nuclear reactors because that is the only answer it has to the nation’s future energy needs. Never mind all the clean, green, cheap and safe energy technologies that we should be exploring; this government wants dangerous, expensive and polluting nuclear reactors. Of course, it will not tell us where it wants to put them. But we will keep asking that question, and I am sure the people of Australia will keep asking that question too.
Now this government wants to sell uranium to a country that refuses to sign the treaty on nuclear non-proliferation—a country that has nuclear weapons and, as late as this week, is saying it wants to conduct more nuclear weapons testing; a country that abuts another country, Pakistan, which also has nuclear weapons, which has not signed the treaty and which has a long history of friction with its neighbouring country, India. What kind of reckless, dangerous behaviour is this from a federal government that is supposed to protect its citizens and keep them safe and is a signatory to international laws intended to prevent nuclear non-proliferation?
In this very week, we remembered the end of World War II. Who can forget how that war ended? It ended when the Americans dropped atomic bombs—nuclear weapons—on Japanese cities. Seventy-thousand people in Hiroshima were killed instantly and a similar number were killed in Nagasaki. Tens of thousands more died in the months following. The vast majority of them were civilians. That is what nuclear weapons do—kill lots and lots of innocent people. Some of us took the time this week to remember World War II and we hope that it never happens again. But it sounds like some of the people on the government side of this chamber do not learn from past tragedies.
The whole point of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is to prevent another Hiroshima or another Nagasaki. If you undermine the NPT by condoning exceptions and exemptions and special arrangements for your friends, that weakens the treaty. Other countries then come along and say: ‘Me too! I want some of that special treatment too.’ Australia is, thank goodness, a signatory to the treaty, so we should be committed to it and to strengthening it, not trying to wreck it. The very suggestion that we sell uranium to a country that is not a signatory makes it look like we are not truly committed to the NPT—that it is not important and it is not necessary. The very suggestion that we want to sell uranium to India makes us appear to the rest of the world as though we are more concerned with playing ‘follow the leader’ with the United States than we are about global security.
Instead of flogging uranium to India and hoping it does the right thing, we should be encouraging that nation to join most of the rest of the world by becoming a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty. We heard vague comments today from Senator Coonan about how India’s use of the uranium that we will export to it will be managed and curtailed and restricted to civilian use. We are certainly not convinced on this side of the chamber that anything is in place to ensure that that happens. The government says that the exporting of uranium to India would have to be preceded by a nuclear safeguards agreement, but it cannot tell us how it will work and how it will be enforced. We know anyway that such an agreement will not provide much protection because it would be with a nation that does not support the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We know that providing uranium to India for civilian purposes will have the effect of freeing up its existing fuel stocks to be used on its nuclear weapons projects.
This government is blinded by everything nuclear and is prepared to put at risk global security and the fight against terrorism. If we sell to countries that will not sign the treaty, why stop there? Other countries could be well within their rights to ask, ‘What about us?’ Why should Pakistan feel constrained if its neighbour is given the green light by the United States and Australia? When I came into this place, I thought ‘the arms race’ was terminology from a previous decade that I would never have to use again. But it seems that this government wants to reopen the arms race. What a devastating thing that will be for world peace and world security. (Time expired)

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-08-16,"—I want to make a contribution to this debate on the Queensland amalgamations because I think it opens a couple of areas—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I understand that the motion before the chair is to take note of answers to questions today relating to the sale of uranium to India, the nuclear safeguards and the issue of nuclear reactors in this country. There has been no proposition to take note of the proposal about ballots or plebiscites in Queensland. Senator Macdonald got away with it; he took a bit of liberty and we let it go. But I think Senator Boswell is stretching a long bow by seeking to speak on this issue.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: I would point out that Senator Carr in particular drew the direct analogy between referenda in Queensland on the issue of local government elections and referenda on the siting of nuclear power reactors. The two have been melded throughout this question time and throughout the debate in taking note. It is perfectly reasonable to give Senator Boswell the opportunity to make his remarks relevant to the general debate about the question of referenda on the siting of nuclear reactors and the relevance of that question to the issue of local government. He has not been given that opportunity yet.
—On the points of order: Senator Boswell there is really a choice. You can make yourself relevant to the question that is before the chair, which is in respect of nuclear reactors, or I can put that question and then you can move to take note of the other answer. If you go down the other path you run the risk that I will rule that you are out of order. It is up to you.
—Mr Deputy President, I was responding to some of the remarks that Senator Carr made in his contribution when he brought forward the amalgamations debate and linked it with the other question. I believe that gives me the right to respond, as Senator Carr has, and I would like to proceed to do so.
—You have to make your remarks relevant to the question that is before the chair; you just cannot reconstruct the question. Let me put the question first. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Carr be agreed to.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Uranium Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,22,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) and the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Johnston) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Evans) and Senator Carr today relating to nuclear energy.
I do so in the context that it has to be appreciated just how important nuclear research is in this country and what a magnificent chance we have to explore the opportunities for expansion of nuclear research in a range of medical developments and manufacturing industries and in engineering and other processes. What I find absolutely astounding though is the government’s irresponsibility when it comes to the selling of uranium to India in circumstances where India has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. India has something like 36 nuclear warheads, and the United States government has indicated that its position is to reprimand India over its nuclear weapons program because it has breached undertakings with regard to nuclear testing. In these circumstances I find it absolutely extraordinary that ministers in this government can claim that India has a strong record when it comes to honouring its commitments on nuclear testing and the military use of nuclear power. It is an extraordinary proposition that this government can seek to take a position of such blinding hypocrisy.
On the other hand there is the government’s position on local government. Just last year this government voted against a proposition, moved by me, to give constitutional recognition to local government. But this year, on the eve of an election, the government seeks to intervene in the electoral processes in Queensland with regard to the operations of the Local Government Act. We have a simple proposition: if that is to be the rule—this newfound commitment to concerns about local interests—it is important that that position be held in all regards. You would think that position would be held on the establishment of nuclear power plants. This government has received a commissioned report by the Prime Minister which indicates that it is the government’s desire to build 25 reactors in this country, yet there is no discussion about where those reactors are to go and no discussion about the consequences of building those reactors.
In that context, I think it is appropriate that we hear from this government about what legal advice they have sought about the capacity of the Commonwealth government in Canberra to override local communities when it comes to the expression of their desire not to have those reactors built in their localities. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources stated on 26 July that such legal advice would be sought. Where is it? It is time for the government to put that advice on the table. If it is appropriate to intervene in local government elections in Queensland, it is also appropriate to put a position with regard to people’s rights to have their say about where these new nuclear reactors go.
—Can you speak up a bit?
—We are entitled to know the locations of the 25 reactors that this government intends to build. The people of the Hunter, and the people of the Queensland coast, for that matter. The senator across the chamber interjects. We are entitled to know what his attitude is on the building of nuclear reactors on coastal Queensland. We are entitled to know what the position is on the Hunter and Jervis Bay and on the Victorian coast. What is the situation in South Australia? Does the government intend to build reactors there? Why shouldn’t people have a say on whether or not such reactors are built in their backyards? If it is the case that the government now thinks it has the constitutional power to intervene in local government elections in Queensland, then it will also have the constitutional power to provide the AEC with the authority to conduct plebiscites on the issue of nuclear reactors right across Australia. That is simply the logic that has been put here today, and I would love to hear what this government has to say on that question.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Nuclear Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,22,2
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2007-08-16,"—I will first start by saying that I do not know what Senator Carr has been reading, but this country could not afford to build 25 nuclear reactors. This country does not need 25 nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors cost billions of dollars each and, multiplied by 25, you could easily see that we do not have that. We do have uranium in this country. We are not, as some people may think, the biggest developer and biggest seller of uranium in the world. Canada holds that position. However Australia does have the biggest reserves of uranium in the world. We export something like 11,000 tonnes of uranium each year now. Canada exports slightly more than that. With the expanding of the UO production, or yellowcake, in Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan will easily become the biggest exporter of uranium in the world, with 18,000 tonnes per annum beginning in 2008.
The point I want to make is this: if Australia does not sell its uranium, with guidelines, to India—the largest democracy in the world—then Kazakhstan will. India is a country with which we have historical ties. It is a country with which we have traded for almost a couple of centuries, if you include our British heritage. Many of India’s citizens live in Australia. India is a country that has shown the world what can happen when a country adopts the democratic process. This government, I know, will not expand its uranium sales unless there is agreement from India to our terms. And it is not just Kazakhstan that will sell uranium to India; there are places in Africa that will sell their uranium to India too. Plutonium is a very special by-product of uranium waste. It is not something that can be taken from used or spent fuel rods and put into a bomb. It takes years, sometimes, to develop enough uranium to make plutonium and enough to make a device that will explode. Also, it takes an immense amount of technology to do it.
If Australia does not use its uranium wisely, someone else will fill the void and Australia will miss out. My home state of Western Australia, for instance, has missed out on tens of billions of dollars over the past 20 years by not developing the known uranium sources in that state, the biggest mining state in the world, the state that has an excellent record for mining. If Australia does not contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases, when we do have the devices here to do it, we will be left wanting. We will have the finger pointed at us saying: ‘You had the means to stop production of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, and you failed to do it. Instead, you have kept on exporting coal.’ There is nothing wrong with exporting coal, particularly if that coal is adapted to the clean coal process.
Other countries in the world that we respect, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and France—80 per cent of France’s power is nuclear power—are developing and expanding their nuclear power stations and building new stations. China, our biggest trading partner now, is expanding its nuclear power plants across China. Why shouldn’t China expand its nuclear power plants and buy uranium from Australia? China loses up to 10,000 people a year in its coalmines, largely in small coalmines that are owned by individuals in China. This will obviate the necessity for the rush to coal to create energy for the massive industrialisation of China.
If we do not do that, I think that we would have the finger pointed at us. People from various parts of the world will say to us: ‘You have the means to reduce the deaths in China by exporting your uranium there. You have the means to reduce the occurrence of millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases per year and you’ve failed to do it, you’ve failed to take note.’ We should grasp the opportunity and embrace nuclear power, provided—and only provided—that it is a safe issue for us to embrace.

You can make yourself relevant to the question that is before the chair, which is in respect of nuclear reactors, or I can put that question and then you can move to take note of the other answer. If you go down the other path you run the risk that I will rule that you are out of order. It is up to you.
—Mr Deputy President, I was responding to some of the remarks that Senator Carr made in his contribution when he brought forward the amalgamations debate and linked it with the other question. I believe that gives me the right to respond, as Senator Carr has, and I would like to proceed to do so.
—You have to make your remarks relevant to the question that is before the chair; you just cannot reconstruct the question. Let me put the question first. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Carr be agreed to.

Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD


Government Response to Committee’s Recommendations


Review of the listing of six terrorist organisations (tabled 7 March 2005)


Recommendation 1:


The Committee recommends that a comprehensive programme, that takes account of relevant community groups, be conducted in relation to any listing of an organisation as a terrorist organisation.


Response:


It is not practicable to undertake broader community consultation in advance of the listing of terrorist organisations.
 
 The Government has undertaken a number of steps to ensure awareness of the terrorist organisation offences.
 
 Following the listing of an organisation as a terrorist organisation, the Attorney-General issues a media release attaching the Statement of Reasons for the organisation.
 
 This information is disseminated to all major media outlets.
 
 The Attorney-General’s Department’s National Security website has been improved to give greater access to information and provides a list of all organisations listed as terrorist organisations in Australia, along with the Statement of Reasons for each of those organisations.


The Attorney-General’s Department has produced a ‘Question and Answer’ pamphlet providing information on recent counter-terrorism legislation.
 
 This pamphlet is printed in eight different languages and is distributed by officers of the Attorney-General’s Department at forums and seminars they are invited to attend.
 
 A pamphlet providing information on the terrorist organisation offences including the financing of terrorism offences is currently being developed by the Government.


Departmental officers have spoken at the following forums in relation to Australia’s counter-terrorism measures:

27 February 2006- Departmental staff briefed the Muslim Community Reference Group on the new counter-terrorism laws;
19 April 2006- Departmental staff participated in a legislation and policy forum held at Monash University to discuss the counter-terrorism legislation;
19 and 20 May 2006 – Departmental staff provided a presentation on the Government’s counter-terrorism legislation at a forum hosted by the Citizens for Democracy in Armidale;
28 May 2006- Departmental staff provided a presentation on the Government’s counter-terrorism legislation to a forum hosted by the Young Lawyers Association in Sydney;
2 June 2006- Departmental staff addressed the Attorney-General’s Non-Government Organisation Forum on Human Rights;
19 July 2006- Departmental staff provided a presentation on the implications of Australia’s new terrorism laws on specific ethnic communities at a conference of The Northern Migrant Resource Centre Inc. in Melbourne; and
7 December 2006- Departmental staff provided a presentation on Australia’s counter-terrorism legislation and arrangements at the National Security and Crisis Management Workshop in Sydney.

Recommendation 2:


The Committee does not recommend disallowance of these regulations


Response:


The Government agrees with the recommendation


Review of the listing of four terrorist organisations (tabled 5 September 2005)


Recommendation 1:


The Committee requests ASIO and the Attorney-General to specifically address each of the six criteria referred to in paragraph 3.2 in all future statements of reasons particularly for new listings.


Response:


The six criteria are among a range of factors ASIO considers when making its preliminary evaluation of whether to put an organisation forward for possible listing as a terrorist organisation.


Section 102.1(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code) requires that the Attorney-General must be satisfied ‘on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur) or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur)’.
  
 The Statement of Reasons is designed to specifically address the legislative requirement for listing a terrorist organisation.


Recommendation 2:


The Committee does not recommend disallowance of these regulations


Response


The Government agrees with the recommendation


Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security


Government’s Response to Committee’s Recommendations


Review into the re-listing of Al-Qa’ida and Jemaah Islamiyah as terrorist organisations


Tabled 16 October 2006


Recommendation 1:


The Committee renews its request that the Attorney-General and ASIO incorporate the criteria ASIO has provided for determining which organisations should be listed in future statements of reasons.


Response:


The six criteria provided to the Committee by ASIO are internal criteria, used only as a preliminary means of assessing whether an organisation should be considered for possible proscription.


Section 102.1(2) of the 
Criminal Code Act 1995
 (the Criminal Code) requires that the Attorney-General must be satisfied ‘on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur) or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur)’.
  
 The format currently employed for the Statement of Reasons is designed to address the legislative requirement for listing a terrorist organisation.


Recommendation 2:


The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulations.


Response:


The Government agrees with the recommendation.


Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security


Government’s Response to Committee’s Recommendations


Review of the re-listing of ASG, JuA, GIA and GSPC


Tabled 26 February 2007


Recommendation 1:

The Committee renews its request that the Attorney-General and ASIO incorporate the criteria ASIO has provided for determining which organisations should be listed in future statements of reason.
The Committee requests that the Attorney-General and ASIO provide the Committee with a set of criteria outlining under what circumstances an organisation will not be relisted.

Response:


The six criteria are among a range of factors ASIO considers when making its preliminary evaluation of whether to put an organisation forward for possible listing as a terrorist organisation


Section 102.1(2) of the 
Criminal Code Act 1995
 (the Criminal Code) requires that the Attorney-General must be satisfied ‘on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur) or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur)’.
 
 The Statement of Reasons is designed to specifically address the legislative requirement for listing a terrorist organisation.


The re-listing of an organisation is considered to be an entirely new listing. Therefore, whenever an organisation is considered for re-listing, the Attorney-General must be satisfied of the legislative requirements set out in section 102.1(2) of the Criminal Code.
 
 If the Attorney-General is not reasonably satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur), or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur)’, the organisation will not be listed as a terrorist organisation.


Recommendation 2:


The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulations on the four terrorist organisations:

Abu Sayyaf;
Jamiat ul-Ansar;
The Armed Islamic Group; and
The Salafist Group for Call and Combat.

Response:


The Government agrees with the recommendation.


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE’S ROUNDTABLE PUBLIC HEARING:


REVIEW OF THE GRIFFIN LEGACY AMENDMENTS


THE HON JIM LLOYD MP


MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, TERRITORIES AND ROADS


July 2007


THE GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE


Recommendation 1:
 
 The committee recommends that the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in the future provides the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories with the option of inquiring into every Draft Amendment to the National Capital Plan.


Where the committee requests an inquiry, the Draft Amendment under consideration should not be tabled until after the committee completes its inquiry.


Not agreed.


The Resolution of Appointment is the source of authority for the establishment and operations of the Committee.
 
 The current Resolution was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on 18 November 2004 and provides that the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (the Minister) may refer draft amendments to the National Capital Plan to the Committee for its consideration.
 
 While it has generally been the government’s practice to refer draft amendments to the National Capital Plan to the Committee, the government considers that the Minister should retain the discretion to do so.


Currently, as part of the approval process for draft amendments, the Minister provides a copy of draft amendments to the Committee giving them the opportunity to indicate if they wish to conduct an inquiry into the amendments.
 
 In addition to this, the Committee is also given the opportunity to be briefed on draft amendments.
 
 In the case of the Griffin Legacy Draft Amendments, the Committee was provided with private briefings throughout the development of the Griffin Legacy.


As part of the draft amendment process, there is usually time for the Committee to conduct inquiries, however there can be matters of national significance which may not allow time for full consideration by the Committee.


Recommendation 2:
 
 The committee recommends that the National Capital Authority explore options for ensuring that submissions to all the Authority’s consultation processes are made publicly available subject to full approval by the submitter and compliance with relevant privacy principles and advise the committee.


Agreed.


Submissions received during consultation processes will be made publicly available providing approval is obtained by the submitter and all relevant privacy principles are adhered to.


The National Capital Authority (NCA) has already released its Consultation Protocol (the Protocol) which includes the requirement to publicly release submissions.
 
 The Protocol also sets out the minimum requirements for consultation which must be carried out:


when the Plan is being made or amended;


when a Development Control Plan (DCP) is being made;


on a development application; and


when the NCA informs community and stakeholders on an annual basis.


The Protocol seeks to formalise, clarify and guide the community and stakeholders to ensure consistency in the application of consultation within the legislative requirements, as outlined in the 
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management Act 1988
 and the 
National Capital Plan
.


The Protocol is available on the NCA’s website here:


http://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/downloads/planning_and_urban_design/consultation_reports/Consultation_Protocol_July2007.pdf


Recommendation 3:
 
 The committee recommends that before 29 March 2007 the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads moves to disallow Amendments 56, 59, 60 and 61 so that the National Capital Authority has the opportunity to further refine the amendments taking into account issues raised in the committee’s report.


Not agreed.


After the Committee’s report was tabled, the Minister publicly declined to disallow the Amendments.


The disallowance period ended in the House of Representatives on 22 March 2007.


On 29 March 2007 the Australian Greens Senator, Bob Brown moved to disallow the Amendments in the Senate.
 
 The debate and vote on the disallowance motion was held on 10 May 2007 and was not supported by the Senate.
 
 The Amendments are now incorporated in the National Capital Plan.

Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration

The Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 (the Bill) gives effect to the Government’s announcement, made in the 2007-08 Budget, to establish a perpetual endowment fund to generate earnings for capital expenditure and research facilities in higher education institutions.
The Bill:
Establishes the Higher Education Endowment Fund (REEF) which, like the Future Fund, is a financial asset fund consisting of cash and investments.
Grants the Treasurer and the Finance Minister, as the responsible Ministers, the power to credit cash amounts to the IIEEF through a Special Account (also established by the Bill).
Grants the Future Fund Board of Guardians (the Board) statutory responsibility for managing the investments of the I IEEF. These powers are the same as provided for in the Future Fund Act 2006 (Future Fund Act).
Expands the Future Fund Management Agency’s (the Agency) operational activities to include its functions under the Bill but its role will remain the same – to provide executive support for the Board and will be responsible for the operational activities associated with the investment of the REEF.
Requires responsible Ministers to issue an Investment Mandate—a collection of Ministerial directions – to the Board regarding the investment of the HEEF. The purpose of the Investment Mandate is the same as provided for in the Future Fund Act.
Requires the responsible Ministers to determine rules for the maximum level of payments from the HEEF. The Education Minister is responsible for authorising grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions consistent with these rules.
Establishes the Higher Education Endowment Fund Advisory Board to advise the Education Minister on matters related to the making of grants to eligible higher education institutions.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—This is, in effect, a Democrat amendment that we are speaking to. Just before question time Senator Scullion spoke in response to a couple of the questions that I asked. I have one or two more, but I will wait until he is in the chamber before I ask them. In the meantime, note that Senator Scullion’s comments before question time in many ways reflected mine—the importance of ensuring that Aboriginal people across the board, but particularly Aboriginal children, have access to fresh food and that their community stores are reliable and not filthy with rats and all of those sorts of things. There is no disagreement here. This is where we are at so many cross-purposes in this debate: raising a concern about the application of the government’s policy via this legislation is not in any way disputing the intent. I said at the start of my contribution that this is one area where there is pretty widespread agreement amongst the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people whom I have spoken to in the Territory.
There is definitely room for improvement amongst some of the community stores. I was pleased to note the minister specifically acknowledged that in some communities the stores are fantastic. Wherever we can in this debate, we need to ensure that we do not create the impression that every community is a disaster and that every Aboriginal man is a paedophile and so on. I know nobody is saying that, but that can be the impression that people get. I am sure all of us know—and I am sure that even Senator Scullion has heard this in his feedback—that a concern is developing amongst some Aboriginal men that everybody instinctively thinks that they are probably a paedophile or a violent drunk. That is not directed at the government, but when there is a lot of focus on the issue of child sexual abuse there is that potential. We all know that that is a minority of people, but we need to state that as often as we can to ensure that that almost subconscious perception does not develop.
But to come back to community stores: it is the same principle but a different point. Clearly, there are stores which are good, and it is important to acknowledge that. The Democrats amendment before us is not in any way disputing the stated goal. As I said at the outset, getting fresh, good-quality, healthy food into kids a couple of times a day is probably as good a health measure as you would wish for and better than an endless array of medical checks. If you can get the healthy food into them, you will be doing a hell of a lot more good in the long term. If you do not do that, you can have all the medical checks in the world and you will still keep having problems. This is a crucial area and the Democrats have indicated our in-principle support for the intent. Our concern is about the application and the workability of measures in the legislation. I think that is what we should focus on: whether this will work and whether it is necessary.
I appreciate the minister’s concern that the expansive and very significant power in the legislation does not reflect the intention. I am not debating the intention. I am debating what is in the legislation and how this power can be used. As a legislator, you have to look at what sorts of things are enabled by the power, not what the intention is of the government of the day. With regard to that, I think there are a couple of issues here that do need acknowledging. I will read out a bit of division 4 so that it is clear and it is on the record what is actually enabled by this section:
The Minister may … make … declarations in relation to some or all of the eligible assets—
that is, the assets of a community store—
… to which this section applies …
These declarations may include:
(a) a declaration that the legal and beneficial interests in the assets are vested in the Commonwealth … without any conveyance, transfer or assignment …
…            …            …
(c) a declaration that a specified instrument relating to any or all of those assets … continues to have effect after the legal and beneficial interest in those assets … vest in the Commonwealth …
(d) a declaration that, immediately after the legal and beneficial interests in those assets or liabilities vest in the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth becomes the successor in law of the holder of those assets.
Those are very significant powers, and I accept that the minister said they are powers of last resort. Our concern is whether that is still an acceptable reason for giving such extreme powers, particularly given the basic issues with regard to lack of oversight of how those powers are used. They were flagged in the Alerts Digest report of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has been referred to a couple of times in this debate.
I will not go into hyperbole too much, but I note that we have some allegations about the five-year leases being privatisation of Aboriginal land, which I think is an overstatement of the case. But, having said that, yesterday at the Press Club, Minister Brough was, once again, talking about Aboriginal communal titles being communism. I think that is also a ridiculous concept. You can throw around labels suggesting that having land rights has not worked because it is a form of communism, then you have the state coming in and taking over ownership. That is, potentially, nationalising the assets of Aboriginal communities. Again, I accept it is a last resort, but that is the power which the Commonwealth is being given. That is why you need to have a very good reason for wanting to do it. It is not an argument about intent; it is an argument about the potential consequences of this legislation.
Let us not forget that this part in the legislation to do with community stores has a lot of other powers in it as well—powers which are also pretty strong, which the Democrats are not opposing. These include decisions with regard to granting and refusing licenses, assessments of community stores, conditions of community store licenses—there are very strong powers going to the federal government in relation to that—and surrender and transfer of community store licenses. The Commonwealth already has all those powers. This measure just goes to acquisition, and I think it is a step too far. I do not think it is necessary and I think it is potentially damaging.
Again, the government talks a lot about empowering people, and Minister Brough used that term again yesterday. I do not see how the Commonwealth moving in and taking ownership of a community store is terribly empowering. It certainly would be empowering for a community to have their store run better, for it to be clean and reliable and for it to have fresh food available. I totally accept that. But I do not think the Commonwealth coming in and taking ownership of it is the way to do it.
I wish to take the opportunity of asking a couple more questions of the minister, which go specifically to matters raised in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report on the legislation—particularly while the chair of the committee, Senator Ray, is in the chamber; I am sure he would love to hear a response to issues raised in that report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Issues were specifically raised with regard to this division and the excluding of merits review. Clauses 97 and 106 of the legislation, which are in the broader part 7, give the secretary of the department the discretion to grant or refuse a community store licence or to revoke an existing community store licence. The explanatory memorandum makes clear that that decision will not be subject to internal review or to external review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Is it the best that the government can do to justify the lack of review to say, ‘This is an emergency; therefore, letting people have a review would slow things up too much?’ Is that seriously the only reason they will use to say that they can do what they want without even an internal review?
The other issue concerns the specific division which I am talking about here, which the Democrats are seeking to remove where the minister can, in writing, make declarations with regard to taking over the assets for a specified time. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, again, drew attention to that and sought the minister’s advice. Subsection (6) of clause 112, division 4, says that such a declaration is not a legislative instrument. I, on behalf of the committee, thought I would seek the minister’s advice here about whether the declaration, although not legislative in character, is a determination subject to review under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act and, if so, whether the exercise of the minister’s discretion ought not be subject to merits review. Is the intent of simply stating that something is not a legislative instrument to prevent any form of merits review and, if that is the intent, can the minister guarantee that that will also be the effect?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—It certainly is the intention that, consistent with other areas of this nature in the act in terms of acquisitions, the appeal process will be the appeal process available through the courts.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—There were a number of other matters that Senator Bartlett referred to which require an answer. While the minister is thinking about that, I would take him to clause 86, which says at subsection (2):
If the Secretary, on reasonable grounds, suspects that a person other than the wrongdoer—
the person being convicted of something—
can give information relevant to an application for a civil penalty order in relation to the contravention, whether or not such an application has been made, the Secretary may, by writing given to the person, require the person to give all reasonable assistance in connection with such an application.
Then subsection (5) says:
If a person fails to give assistance as required under subsection (2), the person commits an offence against this subsection.
Penalty: 30 penalty units.
So we have a situation where the secretary or somebody outside the court can penalise a person—not the wrongdoer but somebody who might have information—30 penalty units. I would ask the minister to justify that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—As I understand it, if we know a wrong has been done and the secretary suspects on reasonable grounds that a person other than the wrongdoer can actually provide information relevant to the application—in other words, a witness to an event—the secretary may in writing require the witness to give all reasonable assistance. So we are saying that, if a person witnesses an event, that person is required to provide assistance. If that person fails to provide that assistance, under subsection (5), that is an offence.

So we have a system that is outside the rule of law and outside the courts and outside the Australian system of presenting an opportunity for a person to either put their case—and plead one way or another and be represented—or appeal.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—How can the government justify a fine of more than $3,000 for somebody the secretary says has information and has not complied with their wish to get it? How on earth can you abandon the proper process of the rule of law in this country and say that the minister can give this person the ability to put a huge fine like that on another citizen without there being any proper opportunity for an investigation or a plea to put a case? That is Wild West justice, if ever I have heard it! Surely the government has made a mistake here and would want to rectify it. I ask the minister again: is that what was meant when this was written or has this hasty legislation failed a step—that is, the ability of the court to apply such a penalty, not some official appointed by some minister in the future through some secretary unnamed in this legislation?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

Is the government giving one citizen the ability to impugn someone, without any evidence and without any responsibility, and fine that person more than $3,000 because that person did not do what they wanted them to? That is not justice; that is flouting Australian law and the justice system as we know it. Surely there is a mistake here. Who is this secretary going to be? What is the evidence that they require under this section?

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,—I have been advised that with regard to most legislation there is no need to specifically state that this is a criminal penalty and has to be dealt with by the courts.

(5)      If a person fails to give assistance as required under subsection (2), the person commits an offence against this subsection.
Penalty:             30 penalty units.
That is talking about assistance that is required to be provided to the secretary under subsection (2). I am sure that the minister is right; it is intended to go to court. What we have here is at best clumsy, badly written law which has been written in haste by the government and which will be regretted at length by the citizens. The minister ought to look at the clumsy, unsatisfactory way in which this section is constructed and correct it to make sure that it is clearly understood by anybody reading this section that charges have to be laid and that the courts have to be brought in to the matter—and not just for subsection (4) but for the whole of the clause.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
Senator SCULLION,NA,2007-08-16,"—As I understand it, the process would be that, if somebody is identified as someone who may be able to provide assistance, we would ask them to provide assistance. If they then decided that they were not going to provide assistance, we would be able to coerce them to provide assistance through an application to the Federal Court. If the Federal Court then found that the person had decided that they were at that stage still not going to help, then that would be a criminal offence, for which there would be a maximum penalty of 30 penalty units.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I move Democrat amendment (9) on sheet 5340 revised:
(9)    Clause 93, page 71 (after line 3), after paragraph (1)(a), insert:
            (aa)    the community store’s capacity to train locally employed community members;
This is an alternative amendment. It is quite a small one and therefore one which would be given some genuine consideration if we were to assume that there was any degree of willingness to engage on the part of the government. It relates to the licensing of community stores. In the legislation, there is a list of criteria which are assessable maters in relation to the licensing of community stores. It includes the following:
           (a)           the community store’s capacity to participate in, and (if applicable) the community store’s record of compliance with, the requirements of the income management regime;
           (b)           the quality, quantity and range of groceries and consumer items, including healthy food and drink, available and promoted at the community store;
           (c)           the financial structure, retail practices and governance practices of the community store;
           (d)           any matters specified by the Minister under subsection 125(2) to be assessable matters;
           (e)           any other matter that the Secretary considers relevant to the provision of high quality community store services.
This is simply an amendment from the Democrats that seeks to add another assessable matter as a definite criteria, that proposed assessable matter being the community store’s capacity to train locally employed community members.
We are all—quite rightly—talking about the need for any type of positive result to have long-term benefits. Part of that with a community store is or should be the ability for that store to train up locally employed community members. That is not the be-all and end-all of criteria, and it is not the sole reason a licence should be issued, amended, extended or removed, but we believe it is a sufficiently important issue that it is worth having as an assessable matter the capacity to train locally employed community members to staff the community store. It is something that is minor in the scheme of the totality of the legislation, but something that the Democrats nonetheless believe would be beneficial.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I acknowledge that the senator is touching on employment in communities and we do need to maximise it where we can. We have taken the approach of encouraging higher rates of employment. There are a couple of reasons for that. Some of these community stores have only one employee. To suddenly make it prescriptive that that employee be a local individual would not in the short term bring about the outcomes that we require. But that is certainly not the norm. We have some special programs that will very much target store workers through some of the retail training packages. Why the notion of simply encouraging that to take place rather than being prescriptive? One of the great challenges about being prescriptive is that, if you do not have people who are trained, then it tends to backfire on you and the level of amenity that we are looking for may not be able to be achieved, particularly in the short term.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I have a final question on community stores. Another matter raised in the Scrutiny of Bills report which I do not think has been specifically raised and specifically answered goes to the issue of revoking a community store licence because the store does not comply with assessable matters—these newly developed matters that are in this legislation. The report says: ‘The committee expressed a concern that a decision to revoke a community store licence because the store does not comply with these newly developed assessable matters and a decision to refuse to grant a community store licence to a new applicant who has taken into account the new assessable matters in their application are treated in the same way in terms of access to merits review.’ The committee expressed a view, which I emphasise was a unanimous view of the committee, including coalition members, that the first decision—that is, revoking a community store licence because the store does not comply with these newly developed assessable matters—fits in more clearly within the emergency response scenario that the government is painting as justification for all this, as opposed to the second decision, which is with regard to a new applicant who has taken into account the assessable matters. As I understand it—I am not actually on that committee—if an existing store is as appalling as the one Senator Scullion described before question time, the sort that does exist in a few communities, you assess it against the assessable matters and if it clearly fails you can revoke the licence. Whether or not I agree that it should be merits reviewed, at least you can say that this is justifiable under emergency response powers: ‘That’s the immediate here and now. The existing store is terrible. We make this assessment, and no merits review; there’s no time.’ This also applies, as I understand it, to new applicants who take into account the assessable matters in their application.
When you are talking about someone who is a new applicant for a licence, the Commonwealth is still in a position where they can say, ‘No, we don’t think you meet the criteria here,’ but in that circumstance, according to the committee’s view—and I tend to agree with it—that is not the scenario that fits in an emergency response type of situation. You are talking about a new applicant who is yet to be given a licence as opposed to an existing applicant who is losing their licence and whether that person should also be excluded from merits review. So the committee sought the minister’s advice about whether a decision not to grant a licence to a new applicant should also be excluded from merits review, as this process would occur in full cognisance of the new assessable matters; it would not result in a non-compliant community store continuing to operate pending the review.
The justification for the emergency matters is: existing store; totally unacceptable; we cancel the licence; we do not want them to continue to trade whilst they are able to appeal under merits review. Whether or not you think that is a good thing is another matter, but that is very different to a new applicant that is not an existing non-compliant community store. The concern of the committee is that to exclude that also from a merits review is excessive and not consistent with the emergency response scenario. I would appreciate it if the minister could respond to that concern.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Thank you, Senator Bartlett, for the question. The answer is that the first situation that you agree with is simply on the basis that it is an emergency—and I accept and acknowledge that that is for an important reason that you have let that go. We have then the circumstance where there is no store, so we implement another one. It is still ‘the store’ and one would still say that the same sense of urgency or emergency—call it what you will, Senator—would still apply because we still at that stage do not have an operating store. For that reason, we would assert that we should keep that provision there because the emergency situation will still apply.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—It has been a long time coming, but I have pleasure in moving amendment (7):
(7)    Clause 132, page 93 (lines 12 to 17), omit subclauses (1) and (2), substitute:
         (1)    Subject to subsection (3), the provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are, for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, special measures and are consistent with Part 2 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.

         (2)    Subject to subsection (3), the provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are not laws as described by subsection 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.

I am glad to see we are moving onto matters that might be a bit more substantial, although I am not suggesting the earlier ones were not important. There are a range of issues that we need to get to in this debate on these bills that are quite fundamental, and I am sure Senator Bartlett agrees with me that the question about the RDA is one of those. This amendment seeks to amend clause 132 of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007, and that clause provides that—and I will read the first two parts:
(1) The provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are, for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, special measures—
So it declares that everything that occurs in the act are special measures:
(2)      The provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are excluded from the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.
The second measure excludes the bill before us from the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act part II, and the Racial Discrimination Act part II is the section that prevents racial discrimination, so we are passing a bill which the government says should not be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act’s prohibition on racial discrimination.
I think on the face of it people will say: ‘Hang on! We’re passing a bill that’s for the benefit of Aboriginal people but we want to ensure that we’re not caught up by the Racial Discrimination Act that prohibits us from discriminating on the basis of race.’ I do not know about anybody else but it strikes me as passing strange that we should look to pass legislation that is for the benefit of Indigenous people, to deal with the crisis in terms of violence and child abuse in some Indigenous communities but, in doing so, we seek to exempt the legislation from the pretty fundamental requirement that it not be racially discriminatory.
I have had difficulty with this aspect of the government’s legislation, and Labor has had difficulty with it because we think it sends exactly the wrong message. As we know there are mixed views in Indigenous communities about whether these bills are discriminatory. There are mixed views in Indigenous communities about whether they are for their benefit.
Labor accepts that these are special measures, provided for under the Racial Discrimination Act, that are for the benefit of Indigenous people. Part II, section 8 provides that we can pass special measures for the benefit of persons under the Racial Discrimination Act—so we have the capacity to do that. Labor is assured by the government that these measures, in totality, are special measures, and we have agreed that that is the case. In fact, HREOC, in their submissions to the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the bill, conceded that these measures could be characterised as special measures; however, they expressed very serious concern at the failure to consult the Indigenous people affected.
One of the aspects of special measures has been a consideration of the question of consultation and consent. It has generally been viewed that the aspect of consultation is central to the question of a special measure. Consultation clearly has not occurred formally in this case. HREOC were urging the government and the parliament to ensure that that consultation took place, arguing that it was never too late. Labor supports that view. We would have much preferred that more consultation had occurred prior to this, and the Senate committee chaired by Senator Barnett also urged that there be more consultation with Indigenous people to try and build support for the special measures.
The key issue is that Labor supports the fact that these are special measures. We believe that the totality of these measures are capable of being implemented in accordance with the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act. I know some people want to argue that case, and it will be argued here. I approach it from this point of view: people in a society have a bundle of rights. People are entitled to exercise those rights and sometimes you have to balance those rights. The rights that are pre-eminent in this debate are the rights of children, which I have always taken very seriously, rights based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. There are the rights of children to live in safety, to live free from violence, to live free from sexual abuse and their rights to an education and to proper food and clothing. Those are very basic rights but they are fundamental rights that need to be observed.
Labor takes the view that, on balance, these measures in this bill can be seen as special measures that are for the benefit of Indigenous people. In doing so we accept that some of the other rights of people—in terms of the welfare packages et cetera—are restricted. The welfare measures will require people to have some of their payments quarantined. You can argue that that is affecting some of their rights to dispose of their income as they see fit, but it is important when dealing with the special measures in this legislation to look at the totality of the package. I think that one can argue that, in total, the measures are for the benefit of Indigenous people, and that the package attempts to deal with very fundamental rights such as the right of children to live free from violence and sexual abuse and the right of Indigenous women—and men in some cases—to live free from violence. As I said, those constitute beneficial measures.
We have no problem in accepting that these are special measures and we are happy to have that recognised in the bill. In moving our amendment, Labor look also to protect the observance of the Racial Discrimination Act. What we seek to do in moving this amendment is to recognise that the measures in the bill, or the totality of the bill, can be considered special measures under the Racial Discrimination Act, but we oppose the government’s attempt to exempt the bill from the Racial Discrimination Act—to, in effect, say, ‘This is a law of the land which does not have to comply with or recognise the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.’
Labor is very proud of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. We see it as one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed by this parliament. We think it is a fundamental bedrock of our modern democracy and that it provides for people protections from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity and religion. This is a fundamental protection in our democracy. I have seen the technical arguments from the government as to why they think they need to exempt the Northern Territory legislation from the Racial Discrimination Act and quite frankly the arguments are not strong enough. We have to do better than this.
We had the same challenge when Labor brought in the native title legislation in 1993. We had the same question about how one could seek to make the native title legislation consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. We had the same arguments put to us at the time that in passing the native title legislation we needed to exempt it from the Racial Discrimination Act. People were uncomfortable with that so a lot of work was done to try to work through that problem. I know my colleague from the other chamber Daryl Melham did a lot of work on this, and I am grateful for his advice because he has been interested in this subject throughout his time in the parliament. In the end, we managed to ensure that the Native Title Act actually invoked the Racial Discrimination Act and we used it as a positive part of enacting the Native Title Act. It invoked and embraced the Racial Discrimination Act.
Even though a range of the measures—particularly those in relation to the validation of title—could be seen in some ways to be acting against Indigenous interests, the totality was seen as being of benefit because, as well as validating some titles, it provided rights of native title and future acts that were beneficial to Indigenous people. So we faced the same dilemma in 1993. That was the first major debate I was engaged in in this place; I had been in the parliament for only six months and it was a very important debate for the parliament. We worked through the very problem that we are confronting now. We came out with a positive measure that allowed us to embrace the Racial Discrimination Act in the passing of the first native title legislation in Australia. What we have been asked to do today is to pass another measure which the government says is beneficial to Aboriginal people, which Labor accepts. But to also say, ‘Oh well, it is beneficial but we don’t really want to be bound by something that says you’re not allowed to be racially discriminatory,’ sends a conflicting message. I think it fundamentally undermines confidence in the legislation.
People rightly ask: ‘If you’re so confident, if you’re sure that this is beneficial for Indigenous people then why won’t you allow it to be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act? Why do you have to weasel out of meeting a fairly fundamental right for people to actually know that legislation passed in this parliament does not offend the Racial Discrimination Act?’ Quite frankly, that is the overwhelming consideration for Labor. We are supporting the bill. We are supporting the fact that these are special measures. We are committed to assisting the government in its endeavours to respond to the very serious issues in these communities—although every time Mal Brough speaks I am more inclined to vote against it, but that is a personal issue. I find his lack of good grace and his lack of any commitment to build support amongst either parliamentarians or Indigenous people abhorrent and I think his behaviour is very unfortunate. Labor are committed to supporting the bill. We recognise that these are special measures, but we see no reason why the government cannot ensure that we honour and invoke the Racial Discrimination Act rather than seek to exclude this legislation from the provisions of the act.
I know that there are all sorts of legal arguments. I have been taken through them and I do not pretend to understand all of the nuances, but I understand in broad terms the complexities involved. The bottom line is this: should the parliament really be passing an act which it says is for the benefit of Aboriginal people and at the same time seek to exclude that act from the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act? It sends exactly the wrong message to the community. It sends exactly the wrong message to Indigenous people, who are nervous about how these measures will impact upon them. It says to them that we are not confident that this bill is not racially discriminatory. I am confident that it is not because the balance of measures are special measures for the benefit of Indigenous people. But it sends exactly the wrong message.
The bill has been drafted in haste. We have not had a chance to work through these issues. I know that during the native title debate we had a long period of time to really engage with the issues in order to find solutions, and we had extensive consultation with Indigenous people. That has not occurred on this occasion. I think we can do better than this. Labor is proposing this amendment to make that point and to try to ensure that the parliament does better. I have no confidence that the government will respond to any of this. The government have made it pretty clear that they are not interested in hearing from anybody else. But Labor firmly believe that we ought to do better in terms of ensuring this legislation is invoking and embracing the Racial Discrimination Act rather than seeking to exclude its provisions.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Greens have an amendment to these clauses as well, which goes much further than that of the ALP. While we will not oppose the ALP’s amendment, we do not think you can fix this act with this amendment. It is quite clear that this act is racially discriminatory, and we believe that the provisions do not qualify as special measures. A lot of people have been quoted in this chamber as supporting or not supporting this legislation over the last couple of days. I have been sent some words by Professor Mick Dodson, who is well known to most of us. He is the Director of the Australian National University National Centre for Indigenous Studies. I think his comments are very pertinent to the issue we are discussing right now of racial discrimination. He has written:
None of us is in any doubt that we have to intervene to make children safe. We have a responsibility to do this, so does government. But we must draw the line on responses that involve racial discrimination.
My life is littered with abuse. When I was growing up I got abused because of who I was. I got called names for being black, I got excluded for being black. I was treated as inferior for being black. I got told I would not amount to much for being black. I was told I was unworthy for being black. I was told my culture was primitive because it was black.
I was told my mother’s language was unintelligible gibberish because it was black. I was told I was uncivilised because I was black. I was told I had to be white. This was all abuse.
And how did I react to all this abuse? I got abusive. I punched the kids in the playground and on the sports fields. I screamed at the teachers and headmaster. I threw tantrums and sulked. I wagged school to get away. What did this achieve? Bugger all! My abusive behaviour reinforced the views of me and mine in the eyes of my abusers. Just another useless black fella (“the whole lot of em”).
By the time I got to be about 14 or 15 I realised this. I realised that being abusive back didn’t get me far. What was the problem? Well I now knew it wasn’t me that was the problem in spite of all the conditioning.
I realised I shouldn’t be blamed for being black. Being black is not a blameworthy thing. In fact blame as a reaction is not particularly useful at all to any perceived problem. So being sick of being blamed for being black is not a way out of the problem until you realise, like I did, that it was not my problem. It’s not me who is uncomfortable with being black, it’s some other people. So it must be their problem. Bingo! All solved, I thought, but it’s not so.
Being able to identify the problem and who has it does not always make it go away. You see, most people who want to abuse you in this way do not accept they have a problem. Most of them deny it or make excuses. But the decent ones do not and you cling to them.
When I got older and went to university and got an ‘education’ I found a name for this problem. It’s called racial discrimination. It’s another form of abuse. By then, like nearly all kids who are different growing up in this country this form of abuse is part of everyday life for you and you build up defence mechanisms including identifying the problem as not yours. When you grow up you teach your kids the same defensive responses and you hope they will teach your grandchildren because you know the problem is going to be around for at least that long.
This does not mean you walk away from the problem—you try to fight it in different ways through education, awareness raising, information sharing and through other processes such as reconciliation. You endeavour to assist people to deal with their problem. You do not accept silence as an option. You certainly don’t make excuses or seek to excuse.
I know today our kids get abused, our women get abused, even we get abused from time to time. Indeed we are sometimes abusers—I know I have done so. I have not been immune from giving someone an abusive verbal spray, I have not been free from pouring scorn and ridicule on others. Abuse is all around us. We need to desperately do something about it when it’s our kids who are being abused. We all know that. It’s a given.
But, we now have draft legislation which uses a form of abuse in the name of stopping abuse. What an abuse of process this is. It is an assault on democracy and an abuse of decency. We are asked to accept abusive government behaviour in our name to stop abuse. We are asked to believe these are ‘special measures’ so we can be comforted that they comply with the Racial Discrimination Act. We are told we need to accept this so that the country can meet its international obligations. We are asked to accept that just to be absolutely sure our government needs to ‘disapply’ the RDA.
Just in case—just in case we are asked to name our problem. Just in case the ‘special measures’ turn out to be a big fat political lie. We are told we need to take people’s land from them and remove their right to control access to that land in the name of stopping abuse—yet we know in our heart of hearts that this has nothing to do with the issue of child abuse. Deep down we know it is something else.
I am at a loss as to what to do. I have been fighting racial discrimination all my life and I have run out of ideas. But I know that no Australian should accept that racial discrimination is necessary in any context. It is too high a principle to set aside—as sacred as the rule of law itself.
It is not excusable in any situation and is even more troubling when we know what needs to be done to make children safe and it doesn’t involve racial discrimination.
I could not put it any better than Mick Dodson did when he wrote that. These measures do not qualify as ‘special measures’. We do not believe that taking land away from people and taking away their permits and being discriminatory in welfare reform will lead to the advancement of Aboriginal people. We do agree that something needs to be done but we do not agree that we should set aside the Racial Discrimination Act to make that occur. Not only does the government count these as special measures, which we do not agree with, but just in case they do not count, everything is exempt anyway.
We have been through this debate: here we are talking about the taking away of people’s land; the taking away of the permit system; changing the system of welfare and taking people’s income support—50 per cent of it—whether they have children or not; and applying the Crime Commission to Indigenous child abuse and violence. That is racially discriminatory. When we asked Pat Anderson and Rex Wild, the authors of the Little children are sacred report, whether they thought any measures needed to be taken in order to address child abuse or whether they thought that any measures should be exempt from the Racial Discrimination Act, they said no. There is nothing in the report that says there should be any racially discriminatory measures taken.
Australia should be in no doubt that these are racially discriminatory laws. The government knows it because they are exempting themselves from the law. Special measures are supposed to be able to be taken to advance a particularly disadvantaged racial group. So why is the second clause in the bills there that exempts everyone? It is your ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card. You get a get-out-of-jail-free card because we are going to exclude everything from the Racial Discrimination Act. That is what these laws do. Australia today should be in no doubt that parliament is about to pass racially discriminatory laws.
The Greens do not agree with the ALP. We do not think that these are special measures. We do agree that they should not be allowed to exempt other laws. If these laws go ahead—and it looks like they will because the government has got the numbers—this amendment makes it slightly better. So we will not oppose it. We think that the Democrats amendment to oppose this clause, and the Greens amendment, which is even more wide-ranging, are better because they actually oppose these clauses that are attempting to exempt these laws from the Racial Discrimination Act. There is no excuse for excluding these laws from the Racial Discrimination Act.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Perhaps I will try to deal with Senator Siewert’s questions first. You are quite right, Senator Siewert, the laws that we are bringing in here are discriminatory. But they do not discriminate against people; they simply discriminate in a way that treats one class of people differently from another. This is a targeted, emergency response in an Indigenous community. Senator Evans reflects that this is a fundamental part of what we want to do. Throughout this morning and yesterday we have accepted that we are moving forward. If there are impediments to our providing the levels of safety that we have said we would provide through this suite of initiatives, we need to remove that impediment. That is exactly what we have done. If we do not exempt some of these areas from the Racial Discrimination Act, they will be unlawful and they will not be able to proceed. That may suit the particular purpose of the Greens—that is your business—but it does not suit our purpose. That is why we promote it. We want to put these provisions in place because it is only this sort of suite of issues that will make any difference in these communities.
It is interesting that you are going to support Senator Evans’s amendment, which is an interesting amendment in that it is very close to our amendment; it is almost identical. There are two parts to the opposition’s amendment. The first part, which Senator Evans talks about, is quite right. That says that measures are consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. So they have not declared it. They just said that they think they are consistent, so there is some risk involved in that. But, to be frank, Senator Evans, to go on about the sanctity of the Racial Discrimination Act and its sending the wrong signal is inconsistent with the second part of your amendment, which in effect excludes other parts from the act. I am not saying that you cannot have it both ways. I am very grateful for your very practical approach and for your support generally with the bill. But we are not going to support your amendment—and it is a good amendment; it is almost parallel to ours. It is unclear to us why you have chosen to deem the legislation as complying with part 2 rather than simply excluding it, as you have with the second part of your amendment. What I believe—and the advice I have been given is quite clear—is that it is just a high level of risk.
We are not looking at playing around the edges. The second part of yours does exclude it. The legislation reflects that we are not deeming it consistent; we are just simply excluding it. So there is no risk to these provisions going ahead. These are important provisions and I know that you accept that. I know that in all your deliveries here today, Senator Evans, you have ensured that there are no impediments to providing the levels of safety in these communities that we are going to provide. If that is the case, I would ask you look very carefully at my submission because the second part of your amendment does exclude it from the Racial Discrimination Act. I understand; it is very important to send the right signals. It is unfortunate that there are those in this place who interpret this as a discriminatory act and that somehow we are discriminating against them, instead of saying, ‘This is something we’re doing on behalf of Aboriginal people, particularly in these communities, and it’s something that should be supported. We contend that your amendment, whilst well meant, has no effect and therefore will not be supported.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I will leave most of my comments on this to the Democrat amendment, because it goes much more clearly to the specifics of the exemption to the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Evans’s commentary is one I broadly agree with. With regard to making a commentary about the principle here regarding exemption from the Racial Discrimination Act, it is not just a matter of standing up in support of a principle because it is a nice noble principle, although it certainly is that. These measures were put in place in the law because people not only felt it was the right thing to do but also recognised it was necessary to prevent serious injustice. I just do not see how you can say something is a special measure just because we say so but then exempt it from the Racial Discrimination Act. I have read at least some of the lawyers’ advices and government advices flying around the place and some of the answers that were given at the Senate committee inquiry into this. I guess we all say, ‘I am not a lawyer,’ but eventually you can read all the legal opinions you like. It really boils down to the fundamental issue: if it is not a special measure, if it is not positive discrimination, then it is racially discriminatory and in a negative way it is in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act.
To me, it demonstrates the insecurity of the government’s position and the insecurity in their assertions that all of these are positive measures and will be positive measures. I have no doubt that is their intention—it is certainly the intent of the minister—but it is whether or not it will be the effect, and that is the key part in relation to the law. Without getting religious on people, because that is not really my forte, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and stacking a whole pile of them in legislation is not necessarily going to pave a road that will get you to a good place. We do need to look at practical outcomes. But issues to do with racial discrimination and prohibition against racial discrimination were put in place because it is a way of preventing us getting to bad places. It is not just about good intentions and feel-good stuff and, to me, that is the core issue here as well. So it is a fundamental issue for the Democrats. That is why, frankly, we basically believe that that whole section, which we will move to shortly—clause 132—should just be struck out.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I think it is important to again make the key point. I hear what Senator Scullion says about what he thinks is a declaratory statement in the second part of the amendment. The key issue is this: should the parliament make an effort to comply with and invoke the Racial Discrimination Act when moving measures that are clearly directed at Indigenous people and that will apply different provisions to them than to non-Indigenous people in the same areas? It seems to Labor it is worth the effort.
I know this has been rushed and that the focus has been on other issues. I have seen a number of legal advices around the place, but this is exactly where we were with the Native Title Act. It seems to me that, for want of some effort and engagement with people, parliament can do better than this. It is easy for the government to say: ‘We’ve got the numbers so we don’t have to work too hard at this stuff. A lawyer has said to us, “This is the easy way to do it—just wipe out the Racial Discrimination Act and the bill will go through because you have the numbers, 39 to 37, and it will all be over.”‘ Quite frankly, if the government did not have the numbers it would not be going through like this. We would be making more of an effort.
Labor will not support the Democrats and Greens in wiping out the whole section of this bill, because we are not going to scuttle the bills. Fundamentally, we think they are capable of being seen as special measures under the Racial Discrimination Act. But it does send the wrong message that the parliament is legislating for Indigenous people but cannot do it in a way that preserves the observance of the act, which says that you cannot discriminate against people. It is pretty fundamental. I know that people get tied up in the minutiae of the legal argument, but fundamentally it says that we cannot have the right to be free of racial discrimination in legislation that is designed to be targeted at Indigenous people. It is just the wrong message.
Labor think we can do better. This amendment is our attempt to do better. Quite frankly, with more time and the goodwill of the government I am sure we could do better than this. I do not pretend our solution is perfect, and that is in part because we want to support the legislation and in part because we recognise the government has the numbers and it will go through anyway. But it is an important point of principle that the parliament think about whether or not we should do this in this way. I know that urging the government to reconsider is a waste of time, but I do think people should reflect on this. While we will support the legislation, I think the parliament could do much better than what we are doing here.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I think Senator Evans’s remarks deserve a response—and a level of response in terms of a legal mind. At least we are equals in that sense. Senator, what is at risk here? The reason we have moved to ensure that we have provisions in this legislation that clarify the operations of the Racial Discrimination Act is that we want to ensure that there is no risk of us not being able to go to the communities and do what fundamentally the opposition agree with.
When assessing that risk, it was not that we were saying, ‘Let’s just rush it through.’ In fact this area has had a great deal of scrutiny, and I am very pleased to see that it had a great deal of scrutiny on your side as well—and it is reflected. There is just a minute bit of difference. The question is whether deeming it rather than excluding it is a higher level of risk. If we get it wrong, we are putting at risk our capacity to roll out things that you agree with. We are definitely not being disrespectful of the Racial Discrimination Act. In fact, we just want to make it very clear we are not amending that at all. We are simply clarifying, through provisions in this bill, how to clarify the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act with regard to this particular piece of legislation.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Chris Evans’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—The Democrats oppose clause 132 in the following terms:
Clause 132, page 93 (lines 11 to 19), TO BE OPPOSED.
The Democrats are opposing clause 132 on the same principle we have just been discussing but our proposal is a much cleaner and clearer way of addressing it. Clause 132 states that the provisions of this legislation are, for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act, special measures and that the provisions of the legislation and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions are excluded from the operation of part II of the RDA. There are fundamental legal issues here. I will not go into all the legal arguments, but to say that something is a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act just because you say so is not a sufficient test. You can assert all sorts of things—you can put something in a law saying, ‘The sky is red,’ but that does not make it red. Saying something is a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act does not necessarily make it so either.
The key point here for the Democrats—I have made this point before; I will elaborate on it a little more—is that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act are there because of a recognition that legal processes and policy implementation that are discriminatory in a negative sense on a racial basis almost inevitably mean injustice. How the government can credibly assume or assert that these measures they are putting forward will work to the benefit of people even though they may be negatively discriminatory on a racial basis is beyond me. The government are quite confident that these are all special measures under the act and, therefore, they are all fine. Good; in that case they should not have a problem. But they should not be able to get away with just saying, ‘It is because we say it is.’ If other people have a view that it is not, then I think they should have a right to be able to ascertain and determine that. Frankly, it is hard when you look at some of the measures in this particular bill, which is a very large one, to do anything other than suspect that the practical implementation, as opposed to the stated intent, will mean a racially discriminatory outcome.
It is worth looking at the history of why the Racial Discrimination Act came about. It did not just come about because people back in the 1970s thought it would be a nice thing to do, that it would look really good and make us look good globally, that it would be a fine upstanding principle. The fact that there is the Racial Discrimination Act at federal level has been absolutely pivotal in preventing flagrant and deliberately racially discriminatory acts against Aboriginal people, certainly in my own state of Queensland by the Queensland government. We had Aboriginal people in reserves and missions all around Queensland being paid less than the award wages for years—consciously and knowingly—by the Queensland government. They had specific advice recited to them at cabinet level, we now know, telling them that these underpayments were in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act, and they still kept doing it. It is only because of the Racial Discrimination Act that those things stopped. And it is only today, in some cases 20 years later, that people are finally starting to get the money they are owed, that they were entitled to but did not get paid because of the racially discriminatory policy of the Queensland government of the time. So the act produced a practical outcome of ensuring equality.
I heard the following from one of the speakers in the second reading debate, and I found the lack of awareness of history extraordinary. They were talking about how well, back in the old days, the pastoralists employed Aboriginal people on their pastoral properties. They did not pay them their full wages—they underpaid them a bit—and they kept some of their money, but they used that to buy food for them, so they were doing them a favour and it worked out well and it was only when they started getting paid equal rates of pay that everything went wrong, and wasn’t that terrible. I am not saying there were not consequences of that, in terms of people being consciously thrown off stations by the pastoralists, but quite why that is seen as an appropriate thing to have done, I do not know. But, in the context of speaking in favour of this legislation, we have had speakers in this chamber saying it was actually a good thing that Aboriginal people used to have their money taken away from them, kept by pastoral station owners and used to buy food for them. There was underpayment of wages.
The simple historical fact is that some of those pastoral people kept some of that money for themselves. That is what is known as the ‘stolen wages’. We have had a Senate committee inquiry into that. It was not just pastoralists; it was state government agencies as well. The state government kept the money. I am going partly into the quarantining issue, which is in a different bill, so I will save my comments mostly for there in terms of this example. The state government took the money that Aboriginal people in Queensland were legally entitled to. It was not just welfare money; it was earnings. But they also did it for their family payments. They took the money, saying, ‘We’ll keep this because we know what’s best for you.’ Then they just kept it. They used it for other things. Or they used it to buy them a building and say: ‘This building’s what’s best for you. We know what’s best for you. We’ll buy this building out of your money.’ It was flagrantly racially discriminatory. In some cases I have no doubt there was a genuine intent—’We know what’s best for you in terms of your money, in terms of what to do with your land. We have the intent to do this thing for your benefit.’ That is not good enough. That is why you have an act like the Racial Discrimination Act—because people did precisely these things before. And, in many cases, they did that with good intent. The outcome was gross injustice.
Let me hasten to add that I am not alleging in any way that the measures contained in some of the other bills we have not got to yet will mean that Aboriginal people will have their money taken away by the government and used for other things. They will still be able to use it; it will still in a legal sense be their money. So I do not want to overdo the parallel but I do want to point to the historical reasons for the Racial Discrimination Act. And there are plenty of other examples in Queensland alone, let alone elsewhere, of policies that were clearly discriminatory that were nonetheless put in place, at least in some cases, and where some people, with absolutely the best intent in the world, were saying, ‘This is what’s needed for people.’ That is why this suggestion that this is some great, huge leap forward, some big, visionary never-before-tried approach, is in many ways quite misleading, because there is a lot about this piece of legislation before us, and some of the other measures we have not got to yet, that is actually quite a big leap backwards. I like a bit of retro stuff too, occasionally, and I do not mind leaping backwards if I think it is actually going to work. But the key issue for me and the Democrats is whether this is going to work. I think anything that gives an exemption from the Racial Discrimination Act is actually going to increase the chances of it not working. I make that assessment because of history, because of evidence, not because of a feel-good thing.
I will also briefly note and touch on Senator Evans’s comments about the comparison with the native title legislation. There is obviously a deliberate propaganda campaign from some in the government—although I have not heard Senator Scullion drop to this level yet, which is appreciated, but it has come from others; we heard it from Senator Minchin and Senator Abetz today—that in going through the issues in this legislation we are filibustering, we are deliberately holding up the law. We certainly are not doing that. From the Democrats’ point of view we are not doing that. But I would make the point again that, if you do not have a proper committee inquiry process, this is the only opportunity to explore these points.
I would also say to you, Senator Evans, on the example of the native title legislation, that that did have quite a comprehensive Senate committee inquiry first. We still had a very drawn out—much more drawn out than this debate—committee stage of the process. There were a lot of negotiations over a number of weeks. We did have a sitting on a Saturday then as well. I note the minister saying today that we might be sitting on Saturday. So be it, if we are. I think we need to do what is necessary to explore and get sufficient detail on the record about this legislation, even it is not going to be improved.
—We would have sat on Sunday too, but for Senator Brian Harradine’s religious observances!
—I think we spent about an hour deciding whether or not to say prayers on one day, or something—not that there’s anything wrong with that. I think the key point there is the engagement that occurred between all the parties, including the Democrats and the Greens—although they were the WA Greens at the time, so I suppose there is a bit of historical appropriateness in having a Green from WA as part of this debate, even if they are not the WA Greens anymore. There was engagement of people across the board. And, most importantly, as Senator Evans pointed out, there was extensive involvement of Indigenous people, from all around the country—indeed, as people may recall, they came with different perspectives. As has been pointed out by a number of people in this debate, there are different views from Aboriginal people in the Territory on what the government is doing. I have tried to reflect that diversity of opinion in my contributions throughout this debate. I have no doubt there are different views. In fact, I have spoken to Aboriginal people who have said, ‘We need help so badly that we need to do whatever it takes—get rid of the permit system, take over the land, exempt the Racial Discrimination Act—as long as we get a big boost in funding and some extra attention. That is what we need; we need it so desperately we’ll take anything.’ I understand that view. The point is that it should not be an either/or situation. It should not be that you either take the whole lot or you get nothing.
We should be able to do this properly and with a fair bit of thought. I know there is always a tension when you have the desire to assist immediately, but it comes back to the issue of whether you do it quickly or you do it effectively. This goes to the effectiveness of the government’s actions. To specifically allow an embedded exemption from the Racial Discrimination Act for the entire provisions of this act and any acts done under or for the purposes of the provisions of this act, will compromise its effectiveness. Maybe it would slow things down a bit in some areas. There should not even be an implication that that will bring everything to a screaming halt, although I am not sure that the minister has actually said that. It would not bring everything to a screaming halt but it might mean that in particular areas you have to work through things. That is why, as Senator Evans said, it would be far better if the work had actually been done and we had the opportunity for a proper inquiry.
I repeat that the Democrats’ preferred option, and the option put forward by many Aboriginal people, is to continue this debate when we come back in the second week of September, having better thought through a range of ideas and consulted with a range of Indigenous people in the Territory. That is the Democrats position. It is not to put it off until later but to put it off until September, when we know there will still be opportunity for debate. Let us be clear about this: despite the government’s rhetoric and despite some of the frankly offensive commentary by Minister Brough—including yesterday at the Press Club, where he grossly misrepresented the Democrats for one by accusing us of not doing anything, not taking any action and not even raising the issue, which is blatantly false and yet another smear—the simple fact is that Aboriginal people want to make this work and certainly the Democrats want to make it work.
The government simply refuses to engage with people and refuses to work through what are some difficult issues. I fully accept that there are complexities in the different ways you can go about this, but if they made that effort and worked with people they would be far better placed in a month’s time—having done the work and built that support across a wide spectrum—than they would by pushing this through unchanged. You might feel like you have to do this today because we cannot wait another three weeks, but there is plenty that will happen in that intervening period and this is about the long haul and what is going to happen in five years. Taking a few weeks to get it right at the start can make a big difference in where we end up in five years time.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Greens will be supporting this amendment. As I said earlier it is similar to one of ours but ours is a bit broader. As I have articulated in this place earlier in the debate, we believe that this clause is unacceptable. The issue of consultation was raised earlier in the debate. HREOC made a submission to the one-day inquiry, but unfortunately due to time we were not able to go through these issues as thoroughly as I, and I suspect as much as they, would have liked. They pointed out in their submission that they do not support the emergency response measures being exempt from the RDA. They also made some very pertinent points about the issues around special measures. They said:
These laws clearly have a number of significant actual and potential negative impacts upon the rights of Indigenous people which are discriminatory. The laws generally must therefore be justifiable as a ‘special measure’.
This is what we have been talking about. They went on to say:
HREOC submits that a fundamental feature of ‘special measures’ is that they are done following effective consultation with the intended beneficiaries and generally with their consent. The absence of effective consultation with Indigenous people concerning the NTNER measures is therefore a matter of serious concern. HREOC accepts the need for urgent action. However, the success of that action both immediately and in the long term will depend upon effective consultation. And such consultation is fundamental to respecting the human rights of Indigenous people.
We have heard it said many times over in the last hours of this debate that the Commonwealth have done extensive consultation in the past and it is time for urgent action now. The government use that to justify the fact that they did not go out to talk about the special measures or consult with the Aboriginal community and those affected by these special measures, because this was urgent action. We reject that notion. Talking to Aboriginal communities generally about issues around abuse and disadvantage—and I accept that the government have been doing that—does not justify the fact that the government are taking these most extraordinary measures. It does not justify that because they cannot say that they have consulted with the community.
During the short committee hearing that we had last week, I asked a question of Andrew Johnson, who appeared with the ACOSS delegation. He also happens to be an expert in international child protection and is a former consultant to UNICEF and the UNHCR on emergency interventions. I thought it was an ideal opportunity to ask for his opinion of what you do in emergency situations and in emergency responses. He said:
In an emergency setting, the first thing a UN agency would do, under the direction of OCHA, is to ensure proper consultation on the ground. That is done within the first 24 to 48 hours and it is quite extensive. They then sit down with the communities to find out what supports and services they need. They set up safe houses and ensure that there are safe places for children to play. The international community ensures that there is safe and proper housing, water and access to medical services. The international community is able to do things quite quickly in a refugee camp, and that is based on consultation and asking the population themselves what they need. The biggest lesson learnt from all interventions internationally is that they always fail when they do not involve and empower the local communities to take part in the interventions that are taking place. If you look across the world at the operations that have been successful in resource-poor communities, the fundamental thing that crosses through all those interventions has been the giving of ownership, empowerment and control to the people themselves to ensure children are protected and families and communities are safe.
I do not buy the excuse that this was an emergency response and that therefore, ‘We could not go out and talk to the communities about what a special measure is.’ The government have failed in the basic outline of justifying a special measure and in justifying these provisions as special measures. There is no excuse for not going out and talking to the communities about these extraordinary powers the government are taking upon themselves. HREOC goes on in its submission:
More broadly, HREOC is concerned that the … measures are likely to produce unintended negative consequences that adversely impact upon the rights of Indigenous people.
Some examples are given later in the submission. They then outline some examples of how they are concerned about the special measures and how the special measures may have negative impacts, which would then make them not special measures, because they are not to the advantage of Aboriginal people.
HREOC point out, for example, the phasing out of CDEP—we will have a substantive debate about CDEP later, so I will not go into too much detail right now—and that CDEP may increase unemployment, movement to urban centres and the risk of family violence. Bear in mind that 7,000 CDEP people are being moved off CDEP. Currently, they can only identify around 2,000 jobs. During the committee hearing, in answers to some questions that we asked, it became clear that $76 million is being taken out of CDEP and, to balance that, only $46.9 million is going into increased income support. That is a reduction of $30 million going directly into the pockets of Indigenous peoples in community. I would suggest that will have a negative impact on community. HREOC also talk about the unintended negative impacts on Indigenous physical and mental health and wellbeing and quote some evidence from overseas. They state:
International and domestic evidence links the mental health impacts of dispossession, the removal of children, loss of culture and a general sense of powerlessness that Indigenous peoples have experienced with the social dysfunction that is evident in some Indigenous communities.
For example, the landmark study by Chandler and Lalonde in Canada showed that those First Nations communities that had some form of self-government and settled land claims had much lower rates of youth suicide as a result. Those communities that did not, have excessively high suicide rates.
Given the highly interventionist approach of several aspects of the government’s emergency response, it is reasonable to expect that more functional communities will feel disempowered by measures that distance them from control over daily decision-making responsibilities. For example, the role and functions of the government business managers may have the unintended impact of undermining Indigenous authority structures and dispute resolution practices.
I would suggest that going in and quarantining 50 per cent of people’s income support, irrespective of whether they have children and irrespective of whether they are spending their money exactly how the government thinks they should be spending their money, will also disempower communities. HREOC state that the quarantining of welfare payments may increase the risk of violence against women. They also highlight the fact that quarantining payments for school attendance may disproportionately impact on families in areas without adequate schools and teachers. Further, they suggest that the amendments to the permit system may work against efforts to reduce substance abuse. They point out that alcohol bans may result in an increase in the prison population and that rapid intervention may result in undesirable compromises.
HREOC have very strong concerns that these measures do not necessarily qualify as special measures and they do not support measures that are being exempt from the Racial Discrimination Act. They have very strong concerns about these so-called special measures and believe that the measures should not be exempt from the RDA.
The government did not consult on these measures. They are saying: ‘These are special measures, give them a tick. We’re calling them special measures; therefore, they are special measures.’ These measures will have unacceptable impacts on many Aboriginal people. I do not dispute the fact that the government genuinely want to do something about child abuse in the Northern Territory. They are going about it the wrong way, which is why the Greens do not support this package. We do not support it because we do not believe that the measures outlined there will in fact deliver the outcomes that the government want. They are dressing up their response measures and the provisions in this legislation by saying they are special measures. Calling something a special measure that does not meet the internationally accepted criteria for what is a special measure does not make it a special measure.
I went onto the HREOC website and I looked at what the convention calls a ‘special measure’. The Greens do not believe that these measures qualify as special measures under the convention. In fact, I have very serious concerns that it takes the RDA outside the purview of the convention. HREOC expresses concerns, the legal community expresses concerns and the Aboriginal people, who have been inundating me with emails, do not believe these are special measures. They strongly highlight the fact that they have not been consulted about these so-called special measures. They have not been consulted about the bills, the acts or the measures that the government intends to put in place. They say that the government have not justified why they have to take our land as a special measure and how it will address child abuse. They say: ‘They have not consulted us about how changing the permit system will address child abuse or justified it and how it is a special measure.’ The government have not justified why the spelling out, specifically of Indigenous child abuse and violence, by the Crime Commission is a special measure. And they have not justified why they have to take such extreme measures in welfare reform and why they have to convert the jobs from CDEP to special measures.
But we know why they have done that. They have done that because they found out that they could not quarantine payments under the CDEP. People may remember that, when this plan was first announced on 21 June, the government said that they were going to be quarantining payments out of the CDEP. They backtracked on that one because they realised that they could not do that. That is why they are cancelling the CDEP. Not only is it the case that 7,000 people are going to 2,000 jobs but also many vital services that are being delivered in Aboriginal communities are dependent on the CDEP. So what is the government going to do there? Oh, that is right: ‘We’re going to come in and use those special provisions under the business management areas, where we can go and sit on the boards of community entities and put our spies on those boards and take their assets. That is how we are going to do that.’ That is a special measure as well!
It is ill thought out legislation that does not meet the absolute objectives that the government say they have, so they are giving themselves blanket exemption from the Racial Discrimination Act. The legislation is discriminatory—the government have acknowledged that it is discriminatory—and it will not deliver what they say it is going to deliver. They accuse us of filibustering, because they do not want these sorts of things exposed to the light of day. We are going to do everything we can to show how discriminatory this legislation is and show that it is not going to deliver the objectives that the government say that they are trying to deliver. If the government were genuine they would start listening to people and start listening to the communities that are saying, ‘We want you to do something, but we don’t want you to do this.’ Those communities have got really well thought out plans on how you can address these issues, but you do not want to listen to them or talk to them because they are saying things that you do not want to hear. The Greens will be supporting this amendment and opposing this racially discriminatory legislation and this specific clause, clause 132.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Greens will of course be supporting this amendment, as there is no reason for Australia to be going back into the dark period of racial discrimination which beset this country from 1788 until the Racial Discrimination Act was passed under the Whitlam government. This legislation sweeps that aside and says that we can legislate on racial grounds against Indigenous people in a way that makes them second-class citizens to the rest of Australia. This is unacceptable in 2007. It is unacceptable because it is not necessary.
Suddenly, at the end of a long period of turning its back on the Indigenous people of this country, the Howard government has discovered that it should be putting a large amount of money into bringing the Indigenous people the services and the rights that the rest of the country has. That process is needed to end discrimination against Indigenous people—for example, to end the discriminatory situation whereby less is spent on health services for Indigenous people per capita than is spent on non-Indigenous Australians, even though Indigenous people die 17 years younger on average than non-Indigenous Australians. And I am talking about people right across this country, whether they be in the big cities in the south or the communities in the north.
What was required from the government was for them to move to give Indigenous communities the education, housing, skilling and security that other communities in the country have. The minister himself said in here today that, after it was understood that some of those things are being provided—belatedly—people felt better about it. And so they should, because they have been living under the discrimination of inadequate services for so long. But now to employ the Racial Discrimination Act, and to claim that it is a meritorious thing to do so because it will advantage Indigenous people, shows that the government’s philosophy, drive and reason behind doing this are based not on an equal partnership but on a discriminatory attitude of ‘We know what is best for you and we will do for you what we say, not what you say.’
So we have the situation where the Racial Discrimination Act is being set aside against not only existing national law but also international law. The Law Council of Australia said to the committee:
The Law Council considers the inclusion in legislation proposed to be enacted by the Australian Parliament in 2007 of a provision specifically excluding the operation of the RDA to be utterly unacceptable. Such an extraordinary development places Australia in direct and unashamed contravention of its obligations under relevant international instruments, most relevantly the United Nations Charter and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (“CERD”). In addition to its status as a treaty obligation, contained in all major human rights instruments, the prohibition of racial discrimination has attained the status of customary international law, and has been characterised as one of the “least controversial examples of the class” of jus cogens. Jus cogens or peremptory norms of international law are overriding principles of international law, distinguished by their indelibility and non-derogability. They cannot be set aside by treaty or by acquiescence. Other “least controversial” examples of jus cogens include the prohibition of the use of force, the prohibitions of genocide, slavery and apartheid, and the principle of self-determination.
What has now been accepted, without any exception, as international law—and Australia proudly led the move for such international law in the middle of the last century—is being removed in this country of ours to discriminate against the first Australians. It is simply inexcusable that racist legislation should be before the Senate in 2007.
Mr Brough has said that there will be more Indigenous sex offenders arraigned or incarcerated. Let us look at the statistics regarding Indigenous people in the prisons of the Northern Territory. These statistics come from the Northern Territory Quarterly Crime and Justice statistics from 19 March this year. Indigenous prisoners currently represent 82 per cent of the daily average prison population and Indigenous juveniles represent 88 per cent of the daily average prison population. It is discrimination that those figures are the way they are. The minister says that he is going to make those statistics worse. The minister is presuming a lot here. The argument is that removing sexual offenders and putting them in jail will in some way or other improve the basic conditions of Indigenous people—conditions that have led to those figures. What we should be aiming to do is improve those figures. One of the ways of doing that is to ensure that when people come out of jail—sometimes called the university of crime—they are better for it and have gained some pride, some skills and some better ability to take part in the community that they go back to. We are not going to see that manifest here.
We know that there are zero facilities for dealing with sex offenders in Northern Territory jails. We know that the ability to deal with drug addiction in those jails is not much better. I am told that at the moment there are only two people out of 900 prisoners in the jails in the Northern Territory receiving some form of medical treatment—including substitute substances—for their drug addiction. I am also told that there are no psychiatric facilities in the Alice Springs jail or at the hospital and that there is no other way of dealing with people who have a psychiatric crisis. Eighty per cent of prisoners Australia wide have been found to have some sort of psychiatric disorder. If we have such appalling shortcomings, surely the government should move rapidly to work at that end of the spectrum to help fix people up who have been traumatised in a way that has landed them in prisons on the racial basis that the figures show. But that is not what we are getting here today.
What we are getting is the setting aside of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is totally unnecessary and ill-founded and breaches national and international law—certainly this overrides national law. It is a shameful thing for Australia in 2007, because it is so unnecessary. It suits the government’s philosophy. There is a punitive component here which is built into the racially discriminatory approach that we see in this legislation. There is no way that the Greens are going to support legislation in the Senate which says that you can discriminate on the basis of race and lays out how you will do it: ‘Here is how the Australian Crime Commission, with its coercive powers, can be used against Indigenous people—but not non-Indigenous people—not only in the Northern Territory but right across this nation.’ If you are black, you come under the scrutiny of the Australian Crime Commission, with its coercive powers, including its domestic spying powers and its ability to coerce the production of information and materials—powers which are way beyond what ordinary Australian law accepts.
Under this legislation, it does not matter whether you are in Brisbane, Perth or Adelaide: if you are black, you will come under this new police state regime. If you are white, you will not. It is appalling that there could be such highly honed racially discriminatory action against the whole of the Indigenous population of Australia. Can the fact that this legislation can be used against Indigenous people in Redfern be justified? How does that relate to this national emergency in the Northern Territory? When I asked the minister about this, he had no answer; there was no response. There is in this legislation a racist component—reflecting the view of this Howard government in 2007—against all the Indigenous people of Australia. When it comes to the argument that the racist laws are to help the people that they target, we will cop none of that. It is inexcusable and unacceptable, and we will be opposing it.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Australian Greens oppose part 8 of this legislation in the following terms:
(2)      Part 8, clauses 128 to 135, page 92 (line 2) to page 95 (line 2), TO BE OPPOSED.
We have just had the substantive debate on the Racial Discrimination Act. Part 8 includes more than the Racial Discrimination Act. We have had the debate on clause 132, which as I said is the substantive part of part 8. This part also includes the delegation powers and various modifications to the Northern Territory law—compensation for acquisition of property, various regulations and some Northern Territory laws—that will be excluded under this law.
The Greens—as I think we have stated on several occasions; on more than one occasion—oppose this legislation. We oppose the racial discrimination amendments and we oppose the other elements of this legislation. I will not go through again all the issues that we are concerned about around racial discrimination and these bills being excluded from the act. I think we have got that well and truly on record.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—I point out, as Senator Siewert has done, that this even goes further than removing the racial discrimination act as a bulwark against laws imposed on Indigenous people which do not apply to the rest of the country. For example, under clause 133, some Northern Territory laws are excluded. It says:
(1)           The provisions of this Act are intended to apply to the exclusion of a law of the Northern Territory that deals with discrimination so far as it would otherwise apply.
It goes a step further. It removes any Northern Territory law which might prevent discrimination on the basis of race; which might prevent a discrimination on the basis of the colour of one’s skin; which might prevent discrimination on the basis that you are a member of the first Australian community or nation; or which might prevent discrimination on the basis of the fact that your ancestors were here before 1788.
Part 8 goes to give extra powers to the minister to discriminate on a basis not seen in this country for half a century or more, and it is all unnecessary. The good that could come from this belated decision to put money and services into Indigenous communities to help them get the longevity, the education, the skills and the wherewithal that the rest of the community has does not need to be based on laws which are overtly and blatantly racist. But that is what the government has. This is a division called ‘miscellaneous’ which should be declared ‘the promotion of racism’, and we oppose it.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I move:
(1)    Clause 4, page 3 (lines 11 to 17), omit subclauses (1) and (2), substitute:
         (1)    Subject to subsection (3), the provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are, for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, special measures and are consistent with Part 2 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.
         (2)    Subject to subsection (3), the provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are not laws as described by subsection 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.

This is effectively the same measure that we moved in the previous bill, which related to the Racial Discrimination Act and Labor’s attempt to ensure that these bills complied with the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not my intention to repeat the debate. The debate occurred on the previous bill. Unfortunately the government refused to concede to make some measures to try to ensure that it was seen that these bills were invoking and consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. As that debate has been had and lost I will not delay the Senate any further other than indicate that we will be supporting it again.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—The Australian Democrats oppose clause 4 in the following terms:
(1)    Clause 4, page 3 (lines 10 to 26), TO BE OPPOSED.
This is basically a repeat of what we have just been through and opposes the exclusion of the Racial Discrimination Act provision in this bill, for the same reasons I have just outlined. I will not repeat all the arguments because people can look back at the Hansard from about 30 minutes ago. The same arguments apply with regard to this. I would just reinforce that in only speaking briefly to this, because we have just dealt with it, I do not want to in any way imply that it is not a serious matter. This is a very fundamental matter. To exclude the Racial Discrimination Act from legislation and just insert an assertion that something is a special measure just because you say so is just not good enough. It is nowhere near good enough and nowhere near enough effort has been made to find a better way of doing this.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Australian Greens opposes clauses 3 to 5 in the following terms:
(1)    Clauses 3 to 5, page 3 (line 7) to page 4 (line 24), TO BE OPPOSED.
The Greens oppose clauses 3 to 5. This covers one of the clauses that we just talked about, on the Racial Discrimination Act. I appreciate that we have already had that debate and dealt with those two amendments, so I will not go there again. It also covers the Crime Commission, which we have had some debate about, and the permit system. I appreciate we will have amendments that specifically relate to some of the other issues later. This contribution goes to the fact that the government is amending the permit system. Again, we do not believe that the government has demonstrated the positive benefit that this is going to have for the community in terms of dealing with child abuse and violence. We believe there is evidence to suggest that this will in fact negatively impact on the community’s ability to deal with these issues. I do appreciate—it is splitting hairs to a certain extent—that the government says that these permits are only going to apply to a small percentage of Aboriginal land and will remove the need for permits on roads and town leases. However, as came out in the committee report on a number of occasions and as has been put straight to me as well, the community are very worried about how they are going to police the permit system. Once people are allowed into a community—for example, tourists—how will they know to stay to the town boundary? Who is going to police it? It is going to be impossible to police people coming in to make sure they just stay in the designated areas that they do not need a permit to go into. Those are very significant issues.
The other point that has been made on a number of occasions and that also came up at the Senate inquiry into Indigenous visual arts is that the permit system is very important for stopping carpetbaggers coming into communities. It was put to us very strongly by Marion Scrymgour, the Northern Territory minister who is now responsible for child protection and also appeared at the Senate inquiry into Indigenous visual arts, who made a very strong case for why the permit system was important for protecting community art centres, artists and the art industry in the Northern Territory. So, again, we do not believe that this is a necessary measure, and it could have a negative impact. We do not support the removal of the permit system.
The government said that they received, I think, 100 submissions—it might have been over 100 submissions—when they had a consultation period on this issue late last year and this year. They said that they regarded those submissions as confidential and therefore would not release them to the committee so that we could see what community members actually said about the permit system. They maintained that there was support for removal of the permit system. Well, I can tell you that the emails that I have had certainly do not support the removal of the permit system. I have had people email me many examples of why they think retaining the permit system as is is important.
As has been put to me on a number of occasions, the permit system is not perfect and some people who should have been excluded through the permit system have come into towns—I know that. As I said, it has not been perfect. But just because it is not perfect does not mean that you should take it away. People break other laws and you do not take those laws away. You do not amend the laws because some people break those laws. Just because the permit system has not been perfect does not mean you should get rid of it. Communities have argued very strongly to me that they want the permit system to remain because it is important to them to be able to control who comes onto their land. It is important to them to be able to manage who comes onto their land and to keep out perpetrators, grog runners and people that may be bringing in illegal substances. They do not think that it is a good measure to amend the permit system. The Greens do not think it is a good idea to change the permit system, and that is why we are opposing this particular provision by the government.
We went through the issues around the Crime Commission in quite a lot of detail in the previous debate. The Greens maintain our opposition to the changes the government wants to make to the Australian Crime Commission. We believe, as we articulated in the debate just then and in a previous debate, that it is racially discriminatory. We believe that, if you are going to give the Australian Crime Commission these powers, they should apply to all violence and child abuse. We do not support those provisions that the government is trying to bring in either.
This bill also deals with the provision of infrastructure on Aboriginal land, and this amendment covers those provisions as well. We have some very strong concerns about these particular provisions and the rights that the provisions give the Commonwealth under these clauses. What I would like to ask the minister specifically on this one is: how does the government think the provisions of the permits, where they are only applying to certain areas, are going to be policed? I think they say that the permits still remain in 98 per cent of cases. How does the government see the permits being policed for people remaining in the areas they do not have to have a permit for? When I asked Aboriginal community members, they did not know how they would be able to police access to areas where you do need a permit system and they are extremely concerned about how they would keep people out of specific sacred sites and off specific areas. They felt that this system was taking away their ability to control access to those areas. I would like the government to explain how they envisage this system being implemented.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—The same circumstances would always apply—that is, if somebody breaks the law with regard to the permit system and they go somewhere where they are not permitted to go, it is unlawful. I would have to say that for the first time many of these communities will actually enjoy the rule of law and there will be a police presence as such. There is no difference from any other breach of the permit system. It is operating exactly the same as it operated in the past. It is a criminal offence if you do not have a permit under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. There are some exemptions from that but that is pretty much the way it is. It would run in exactly the same way as it has always run.

However it is a big piece of legislation and we have not had it for long. That raises the question then of what happens if a traditional owner issues a permit to someone of bad character and does not agree to revoke the permit. This government is very quick to identify traditional owners and people in Indigenous communities and to characterise them and accuse them of all manner of things, as Senator Heffernan did the other night in a most unscrupulous way. It then seems though that if a person who is of bad character is granted a permit by a traditional owner, who may be a close friend, co-conspirator, co-drug-user or grog runner or what have you, there is no power to revoke that permit.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I can add some further clarification to my first very vague answer—and I apologise for that. The minister can only revoke a permit that he or she has issued. So if the land council issues a permit, under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act it is the land council that can deal with that permit. The notion of the adjustments to the permit system is that we are exempting the main road that goes into the township and the direct township area. That will be exempted. In terms of issuing any special permit, as I said, the minister can only revoke permits that he or she provides.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I have a few questions I want to ask about this system, which perhaps the minister might be able to clarify for us.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—They do indeed. But there is no difference now and there will be no difference in the future in terms of the provisions of these bills and as the Aboriginal Land Rights Act provisions stand.
—Both answers can’t be right.
—I thought Senator Crossin’s question was: is it true that a permit provided by land councils or traditional owners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act cannot be revoked by anyone else? My point is that outside the townships and the main street, where a permit is not required, that is the case. It is the case today before the provision of this legislation.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—We need to get this really clear here. In some respects I think Senator Evans is correct.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I have an amendment that goes precisely to this point but it is a bit of the way down the track. I do not want to jump ahead of things but I think that, given we are already talking about this, it is relevant because it is a specific Democrat amendment.

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—It is a good one, let me tell you—page 53 of the issue that has just been given to me. Under this new legislation before us, a permit issued may be revoked only by the issuer of the permit. So, under the changes being made here, if a traditional owner issues a permit, it cannot be revoked by the land council or by the minister, or if the land council issues something it cannot be revoked by the traditional owner. This was a point that was raised in evidence to the committee, very fleetingly, of course. I do not think it was able to be explored in the verbal evidence but it was raised in the submissions from at least one of the land councils. That is a concern and I have an amendment going to it. But I think the point Senator Evans was raising is that if a traditional owner issues a permit to somebody who is an undesirable, for whatever reason, my understanding is that on very rare occasions—not very often—land councils have stepped in and cancelled permits. That now will not be able to happen in all the areas where the permit system will still apply.
It also raises another issue which I think was also raised in a submission—certainly in some of the multitude of correspondence I have seen in the last week or two—of what happens if the issuer of the permit dies. If a traditional owner issues a permit and then dies, what happens then if it can be revoked only by the issuer of the permit? I think it would be useful to clarify that. The Democrats, I hasten to add, have an amendment that specifically seeks to remove this new clause 74AA. I am not sure why it is there. I do not know whether it is meant to disempower the land councils in some way. There is some view that there have been lots of tugs of war between land councils and traditional owners or something like that and this is meant to stop those. I am not aware that it has been a big issue. I think that, even if it has been a small issue, if this is a solution it is more likely to create more problems than it solves. As I said, we have an amendment a bit down the track. I think the solution is just to scrap the new clause and enable the status quo, basically. I think the minister’s initial answer was that nothing is changing, but it is changing because of this new clause 74AA. I think it would be better not to have it changed, frankly. I do not know whether the minister can clarify it. Maybe he can tell me I am misunderstanding things, but that is as I see it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—If somebody who has issued the permit passes on, the notion is that the person who has issued the permit represents a group of people who own the land. In that case, the assumption would be that there would be other people who would be a part of the landowners’ group who, I am assuming, would survive that. That also takes into account the fact that, from time to time, individual traditional owners may issue a permit in their own right. But if they were not to survive, the responsibility for issuing the permit, or any responsibilities before issuing the permit, would then lie with the landholding group they represented. In the same way if somebody is of bad character or has some information about a permit that has been applied to someone who is behaving badly, the information would have to go back to the person who provided the permit so that, if they wished, they could act upon it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I think that what has come to light through the proposed changes here to the permit system just complicates serious problems that have emanated from the Northern Territory in the last 12 months, and I think the government should give some serious consideration to this. There is an infamous newspaper article that was written by an Australian journalist about one particular community in the corner of the Northern Territory on the South Australian and Western Australian borders. It led to a traditional owner issuing a permit, which then led to a non-Indigenous person trading Viagra for Indigenous art. Under that system, the Central Land Council was able to step in. Under the system you are proposing in the nature of protecting children, if that same scenario exists in two months time the person who is driving into that community with a truckload of Viagra in exchange for Aboriginal art would not need a permit if he goes down the main road and stays in the main part of the town, or he could get a permit from a traditional owner who would be just as culpable in all of this.
Basically, what you are saying to me is that, under your changes in this legislation, nobody would be able to revoke that permit except that traditional owner. Having packets of Viagra and trading them for art is not breaking the law; it is not illegal to do that. It was that issue that was raised by that journalist, which is a real-life issue, which triggered Rod Kemp’s passionate need to get this parliament to inquire into Indigenous art so that some of that stuff could be stopped. I honestly have to ask you to sincerely think about how taking away the ability of the land councils to remove that permit in a situation like that could protect the children in that community.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Perhaps I can take the question regarding the traditional owner who has issued a permit. As I said, the traditional owner represents a group of individuals, and anyone in that group of individuals who represents the land that the permit has been issued for can cancel the permit. In terms of the tragic story about Viagra and the artwork, it is against plenty of laws—I do not know exactly how many—to resell prescription drugs. The whole matter is cast with criminality and common law will prevail.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—Can I ask what I think is a more pertinent question. Senator Crossin raises a tragic example of potential exploitation, which is why we will be arguing against your changes to the permit system, but is it actually the legislative intent of the government that no-one else be able to revoke the permits once issued or is it an oversight in the legislation? Is it a policy decision by government that no-one else be able to revoke them? If so, why, given that the previous act did, as you indicated, provide for other people to revoke them? Is it an oversight, given the rush with which this legislation has been put through, or are you deliberately making it easier and restricting the ability to revoke these permits? Then the rest of us in the parliament can make a decision about whether or not we support that. I think we have agreed how it applies. Is this deliberate; and, if so, why?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—There has been a great deal of confusion in circumstances where somebody with a permit has been legitimately going about their business and then someone else who had nothing to do necessarily with that person with that particular permit—it may have been a land council—cancelled that permit. And there have been circumstances where that has been the case. This is simply to ensure that we have no further confusion, and it will put beyond doubt that only a party who has issued the permit can revoke that permit. When I say ‘a party’, I am talking not necessarily about an individual but a group of individuals. So the same group of representative people are the only people who can revoke the permit. And, yes, it is deliberate, because there has been an amount of mischief where someone else who may have been unknown at the time has cancelled a permit, making the action on the land unlawful, even for the period of time whilst it was sorted out. When it is actually cancelled, they do not have a lawful permit to be on the land, and in that period of time that unlawfulness can be a bit embarrassing. We just want to make it clear that the person or the group of people who made the decision, the ones who were fully cognisant of the facts and the opportunities—the reasons why somebody said, ‘I want to come onto the land’—are the only ones able to cancel that permit, not some other individual or organisation, which has happened in the past.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—That was an interesting response from the minister. I am quite taken aback, given that this act, like no other, gives the minister special powers—and the minister has actually boasted on TV that he is the most powerful Indigenous affairs minister ever—but that you do not give him the power to revoke a permit where someone of bad character has been given it. It just seems amazing that you do not give it to the minister or to the land council, that you actually do not provide for anyone else to be able to cancel the permit. One would have to say it is a little out of kilter with the general approach, which is to say that the minister can do anything he damned well likes in any circumstance. Senator Crossin, with her local experience, raises one particular occurrence, but the minister’s response seems to say, ‘Because we have had particular problems with people being inconvenienced because someone has revoked the permit, the answer is to give no power at all to revoke the permit.’ On the face of it, I am warming to Senator Bartlett’s amendments.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I am pleased to hear that. Our amendments are not before the chair, but in the interests of efficiency we may as well continue exploring this issue. We have a dinner break at 6.30, so perhaps the minister could look into that issue over the break. There are two questions that Senator Evans asked Senator Scullion and that he partly answered with regard to this new clause 74AA on page 53 and why this decision has been made to prevent a land council being able to revoke a permit given by a traditional owner and vice versa. If I heard the minister’s answer correctly, he said that it was because there had been some mischief from time to time that had led to confusion. I can certainly understand that, if someone had a permit and the land council in Alice Springs, Darwin or wherever cancelled it, it might take a while for the cancellation notice to be stamped on the permit—that sort of thing—and there could be some confusion in the meantime. I can understand that, but I would assume that the same thing could apply with any permit that is revoked—making sure that, whoever revokes it, the message gets through to the appropriate people that it has been revoked.
The statement the minister made—to paraphrase him slightly—is that there had been some mischief about this sort of thing. I would appreciate it if he could provide some details, perhaps after the dinner break, of where that mischief is. How big is the problem that exists that this is trying to solve? As other senators have suggested, there is a lot of concern that this could be creating some new and bigger problems. If it is trying to solve a problem that is actually very tiny and, in the process, creating a much bigger one then it is probably not a terribly good idea. So perhaps the minister could give us some examples of where this has been a problem and whether there was actually some ill intent, as opposed to either confusion or a difference of opinion. That would be useful. I have been told that it happens occasionally that a land council will revoke a permit issued by a traditional owner but that it is not done very often. It is usually, if not always, done on the request of other people who have said that there is a problem.
Perhaps we could have been given some information about just how frequently this has been an issue at all, for good as well as for ill. I am sure that it has been done for good purposes; in fact, I know it has. I know of one example where some people were given a bunch of permits by someone to have a party in a dry area, a lot of other people complained, and the land council stepped in and revoked the permits to resolve the problem. That is one instance I have been given. That will not be possible anymore under this new section. You might be trying to deal with a problem but you are also preventing land councils from dealing with a problem, so I am still far from convinced that it is a desirable solution, and it would be good to have some evidence about this. I cannot help but repeat the comment that we should have had the opportunity to examine this properly in the Senate committee process when we had the land councils there. I think they got 30 minutes between them, maybe 35 if they were lucky, and we did not get the opportunity to ask them these sorts of questions. We would obviously have asked them then if we had had the opportunity. We cannot ask them now, so we have to try and do it via the minister.
I want to track back to make as clear as possible the meaning of this new clause that the minister was explaining, because certainly from some material I have seen from the land council that is not how they perceive it. I am not doubting the minister but I think it would be good to get it absolutely beyond doubt. The wording says:
A permit issued under section 5 of the Aboriginal Land Act of the Northern Territory may only be revoked by the issuer of the permit.
I take what the minister has said to mean that if a traditional owner issues a permit for the purposes of this new section, the issuer is not just a traditional owner; it is any traditional owner, and it becomes a matter of whether the issuer is within the traditional owner class, if you like, or the land council class—or, indeed, the minister, I presume. It would be useful to clarify that because, on the face of it, the way it reads to me is that the issuer of the permit is a traditional owner, they issue it and no-one else can revoke it except them. The minister indicated that if that person passes on, the issuer is deemed to be the traditional owners as a group. Does that group ability to revoke only kick in if the original issuer passes on or is it there all the time that any traditional owner can revoke it? And if it is the case that any traditional owner can revoke it, does that leaves us in the circumstance where one traditional owner could issue a permit and another one could say it is revoked, and we would then have that same sort of confusion? That is something that springs to my mind with regard to that, whether that is relevant to the new clause or the existing system.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I will just explain again some of the background. There has been a history of traditional owners cancelling permits that have been issued by land councils, and land councils cancelling permits issued by traditional owners. I know of some circumstances when it has in fact been for their spouse. It is very difficult to have a distant land council, which is often the case, cancel someone’s permit when it is for a spouse. The fundamental right to invite someone or to have your spouse live with you in the community is something that should not be able to be overridden by a distant land council. So, again, it is removing the power of the gatekeepers over some of the traditional owners who live on country. This just seeks to provide a clarity on that matter to stop this confusion. In terms of the law and order issue, it is always going to be a matter for the police rather than the land councils.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

I would like an answer from you, if not now then certainly after the dinner break, as to whether you would need a permit to travel along that track. From memory, there are plenty of roads leading off that track that go into communities, but they are hundreds of kilometres away, as you well know. The other question I would like you to give me an answer to is whether or not you would need a permit to travel from Nhulunbuy out to Baniyala.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—When the permit system is amended so this can happen, you will not require a permit to travel from the Stuart Highway to Nhulunbuy. If other communities adjacent to the highway were prescribed communities, it is my understanding that if it was on the left-hand side of the highway you would simply turn left along the track that led directly to the other prescribed community. In terms of whether or not a permit would be required to drive from Nhulunbuy to Baniyala, it would depend on whether or not Baniyala was a prescribed community.
—It is a prescribed community.
—You are talking about the road from Nhulunbuy which comes from the Stuart Highway. Let’s say you wanted to get to Baniyala and it was a prescribed community; you would not require a permit to get there. There would be no permit required to move from the highway via Nhulunbuy to Baniyala. I think it is important to note that there are a number of ways you could get to Baniyala, but we will be prescribing the route that would be taken. There is only one road from Nhulunbuy to Baniyala, but there are a number of other tracks that lead to the south-west from the highway to Baniyala, and I appreciate that.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—Minister, I want to pick up where we left off before the dinner break—that is, your declaration that people would no longer need a permit to travel on the road between the Stuart Highway and Nhulunbuy. Can you advise me what this government is proposing in two aspects there. You would be well aware that the current permit system has been required on that road for people’s safety. It is extremely unsafe at times, and extremely corrugated. There are two rivers to cross, one of which is the Goyder, which can be extremely unsafe. My advice from the land council is that the issuing of permits was not so much so that people did not go where they were not advised to go but as a safety measure. After the permit was issued, if you went across that road and you had not arrived in 48 hours people started to be concerned about your safety. There is no mobile phone coverage along the road. We are talking about a 780-kilometre stretch here. People I have spoken to recently tell me that satellite coverage is intermittent. So, in revoking the permit system, what is this government’s plan to protect the safety of people who travel on that road?
Secondly, Dhimurru land management people tell me that tracking the number of people who use that road by permit allows them to also track the quality of the road, to get an idea of how much it is being used and when they ought to get out there and grade it. If this is now not something that can be monitored through the permit system, what are the federal government’s plans for both of those measures in the future?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Perhaps we could have a fair dinkum comparison. In my experience the Gibb River Road is the same sort of terrain with pretty much the same sort of vegetation. The Gibb River Road is not quite the same length, but it is pretty similar. A number of people go along that road, with a variety of different equipment—whether they are Indigenous people, tourists or just travelling around Australia; it is a very popular destination—and there is no permit system on that road. People just make the normal provisions for safety. We know the order of the road. You can find out the state of the road from the police station. There are a number of weather observations, particularly during the wet season, about which roads are cut. There is the website from the weather bureau, as you would be aware, that you can access to work out where you can get to. I know that you, as a well-travelled senator from the Northern Territory, would be aware of those issues. It is effectively just like anywhere else. To cling onto the permit system on the basis of safety I think is drawing a bit of a long bow.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I thank the senator for the question. It gives me the opportunity to briefly outline what the benefits will be. You talk about sightseers. Generally, people who travel in this way, while they are sightseers, when they go to a place they will require fuel, they will require a sandwich or a milkshake—the normal provisions for just driving in or out. When they get there, there are a huge range of opportunities. In fact, one of the biggest employers is the provision of artworks. We have many artworks for sale in these communities. It is unfortunate that they sometimes only have a couple of outlets. Those outlets by and large are excellent outlets—like Papunya Tula. There are a whole range of cultural artefacts and artworks available.
Artists are at different stages of development. There is the quality of artwork of someone like Papunya Tula and there is the bottom end of the scale, in terms of experience and style, which would be quite attractive to tourists. But that opportunity may not necessarily be available to the community. To touch on the committee that was chaired by Liberal Senator Eggleston which reviewed Aboriginal art and was tabled in federal parliament in June, today’s Australian says:
... Eggleston’s committee wanted the permit system abolished to “outmanoeuvre the carpetbaggers”, as he puts it. “By letting tourists come in and buy from the arts centres directly,” he says, “it would undermine the carpetbaggers, who come in and set up exploitative relationships with the artists.”
I do not have sufficient knowledge of the inquiry of the committee but, like all Senate committees, they have probably done a pretty good job.

The committee received very strong evidence from a number of submitters and people who appeared at the inquiry who said that they were very strongly concerned about the removal of the permit system and the impact it will have in allowing carpetbaggers into community. We received some evidence where people were saying, as Senator Scullion just quoted, that they did not mind having the permit system removed. But we received a lot of evidence that people were very concerned about the removal of the permit system and the inability to then control carpetbaggers coming into community. There were some very good examples given of how the permit system had in the past helped to control carpetbaggers.

That would be a matter for the police. Tragically, over the years the permit system has usurped the real force of the law because people have said, ‘Well, we’ve got the permit system and that’s how we control things, so we do not need any police officers’. I am assuming that was the rationale because there are hardly any places where you can say, ‘There are sufficient police officers here and they are sufficiently resourced.’ We are moving to a model where there is the rule of law and if people travel into those places and they behave unlawfully then that is against the law. The law is there now to deal with it, not some notional system of permission where you say, ‘I’ll be able to have a bit of a chat to this person and I’ll be able to make an immediate appreciation if he is someone who is likely to be unlawful or not.’ The position we are moving to now is far superior to the one that we are leaving behind.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

The question of now opening up communities to everybody who might want to, of their own free will, go there puts a big responsibility on to the government. There is no good intersection in this legislation for asking some of the very pertinent questions about the situation which exists, particularly about the much-quoted—by the government—’rivers of grog’.

It has been my experience that it is both of those demographics, tragically.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The point I make here is that it has been non-Indigenous people who have profited, who have been the source of the rivers of grog mentioned in the Angry Australians by Ward McNally in 1974. I ask the minister: what will be done to look at how that profit system worked and what checks were put in place by the white community, which do not suffer the discrimination—for example, the removal of the Racial Discrimination Act—which the Indigenous people are now suffering through this legislation? What can the government say about this destructive behaviour by the community which brought grog to Australia at the expense of Indigenous people and who have made huge profits out of that? What has the Commonwealth done about that and, now that it is taking this action, what does it have to say about the profiting from liquor at the expense of Indigenous people, who have not been the source of it, who do not have it as part of their culture? What does the government have to say about that?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I was not here in the late 1700s and, again, I am only making personal observations. I am trying to be helpful. Just to clarify, do not mistake from my answer that it is both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. A substantial amount—at least 50 per cent—of the profit-takers in the delivery of alcohol to communities are Indigenous people. But, in the context of this discussion—and for a whole range of reasons I think it is important to keep it in the context of the provisions we are putting in place to ensure that these communities are kept safe—these provisions reflect what this government is doing. We recognise the close association between alcohol and violence and sexual abuse. That is very clear and you can look to some very good science and some very good material on that. This government has moved, through the prohibition of alcohol provisions in this suite of legislation, to ensure that we can provide an environment where it is much easier to ensure that alcohol does not continue to affect the communities in the way it has in the past.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

The regulation is now simply just being enforced, which is why there will now be this ban on kava. There always was a ban, technically, in this country on kava, but the regulation was not in force.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—I appreciate that—although it appears we will be sitting for some time tomorrow. I might make the same request about alcohol, but I think a very large truck indeed would be required to come to the Senate. The point to be made here—Senator Crossin has made it—is that, even where regulations or laws have been in place, the Commonwealth has failed in some circumstances to carry those out. When it comes to alcohol, the entreaties to this government by Indigenous people over the last 11 years failed. We regret that. Now the government is coming in and saying, ‘We’re not consulting with you; here’s a set of laws.’ How much better it would have been had representations been listened to by the government and had there now been a spirit of consultation with the people who know best—and that is the Indigenous people of Australia—about the impact, about what they require and about how to handle the terrible situation that has occurred, instead of now having a sledgehammer racist set of laws put through here with no consultation with the very people who have asked repeatedly to be given, through law, the protection they have been denied but which is being brought in now in this unsatisfactory fashion.
Going back to the permit system, I just want to make the point that the government must take responsibility for removing the rights of Indigenous people to the permit system in the way that has been debated here in the last hour or two, and the government must accept and shoulder the outcomes of that. But there is one outcome that they will not take responsibility for, because it is not measurable—and that is the death of culture. The powerful Western culture is moving in on an Indigenous culture which has nowhere else to go, no place to flee and no defence mechanism. Defences like the permit system are now being removed by law—and behind that is the thinking of this government that Indigenous people must integrate.
I listened to the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, talking about the prospect of ending many remote communities. Talk about that prospect would never have been dreamt of if they were non-Indigenous communities, but these are Indigenous communities. What is being put forward here is ‘integrate or else’. In this legislation we are talking about the death of culture, and enormous damage. The permit system, which is being interfered with here, is a major factor in that. I do not think the government has done any assessment whatsoever of that.
Yesterday or the day before, I listened to Senator Milne talking about the government removing the support for Indigenous languages. I have not heard the minister in this chamber say that part of the suite of measures that we are dealing with tonight is the re-funding of Indigenous languages to make sure that, now that we have removed the permit system and everybody can go to these communities, the languages will be kept alive. With those languages comes culture and pride. We know from experience right around the world—from the Gaelic experience to the experience of people in the Americas—that the loss of language brings great anguish and depression, which visits people for centuries afterwards. Yet this government seems to have put that aside in the move—which must be very clear about here—to say to Indigenous people, ‘Take up the predominant culture or else.’ And we will be dealing with that a little bit later with the next motions to be dealt with here.
I want that on the record, so that no-one reading about this moment in history 10, 50, 100 or 500 years from now can say, ‘If only they had known what they were doing to Indigenous culture in Australia.’ We all know. The government has made its choice. It has the bulldozer; it has the numbers, and we do not. But let nobody in this place say that it did not know what this would do to Indigenous culture, custom, law, language, pride and wellbeing into the future of this nation. And if there has been a measure of what the impact will be, besides selling more paintings to more tourists, which the minister was talking about—but I will not go into that in any length; that is an obvious matter—the government has in this debate made no contribution on that hugely important assessment for the Indigenous people of Australia and this nation.
I want to make that part of the debate tonight and I want it noted. I want to put it on the record that we all knew that this was going to have a massive impact on Indigenous culture, particularly across Northern Australia where its stronghold exists after the devastating of such culture across southern Australia. Here we go again, but this time many of us care—and this time the eyes are wide open. And the government has made no assessment of the impact.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I thank Senator Brown for bringing this very important issue to this place. Culture is an absolutely central part of this debate and a central part of Indigenous communities. I do not have to acknowledge that; I think all of Australia realises that. Senator, you are right: the culture in these communities is at threat. Many people in the communities I visit tell me that their culture is dying, that their culture is collapsing. But, Senator, unfortunately, I cannot follow the process that it is collapsing and dying because of anything this government has done. It is collapsing and dying because of the drunkenness, the violence and the sexual abuse in those communities. That is why it is dying. And I am not the only one saying that. Anyone who has been to those communities and has sat down with the people in those communities—as I have done over many years—know that those are the things that are killing the culture that you quite honourably say that we should look after.
Senator Brown, I have to say that the culture is not dying everywhere. Daly River in the Northern Territory is a wonderful community, mate. You drive into there and it is absolutely clean. It has very low levels of crime. It is fantastic stuff. There is great leadership. It has no permit system, Senator Brown. That is what makes it a stand-out: it is just an ordinary place with the rule of law and order. Do you know what the strongest thing in that place is, Senator? It is culture. They have maintained the strongest culture. With respect, do not come in here lecturing me or other Australians in this place about what has either damaged culture or is going to fix culture. At best, it is misleading. It is probably misinformed, and I like to be respectful about those things. Then there is Tjirrkarli. For $1,000 a night, people go there to spend time with Indigenous people and to get an understanding of the wonderful spirituality and diversity of their culture. That is a great thing for jobs. There is employment and prosperity. To become part of the economy is the future. They need opportunities—the same opportunities that you and I take for granted, Senator Brown.
When you say that we are out here with the bulldozers and that the government is going to push ahead because, after all, we have the numbers, although I have probably only been here a blink next to you, I have to say that my observation is that we represent Australians. Each one of these seats here represents a group of Australians. Let me tell you, if you want a vote on this, it will not be in this place. If you go outside the doors and talk to people out there, the vast majority of informed Australians think that this is the best thing that has ever happened. We can look back on a horrific past, which was a train crash of cultures in which the older culture lost out. They have gone through a great deal of change; we all acknowledge that. But I do not think it is reasonable, in the context of this debate, to come in and paint our intervention as anything other than stopping a further deterioration of culture and providing those individuals who live in Indigenous communities with the same opportunities in life for law, order, protection and anything else you want to name as the rest of us.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—It was a Greens bill, supported by the Senate before the government got the majority, that forced the Prime Minister’s hand. It made him go to the previous Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and say, ‘We want you to take children out of mandatory sentencing.’ Aboriginal kids were being locked up for stealing biscuits. The Prime Minister did not act on that until the political power of the Senate expressed itself, legislation went to the House of Representatives and there was a backbench revolt. The Senate also said that we wanted Indigenous languages available in the courts so that youngsters there understand what is going in. The Senate committee had found that they did not know and that tragically one youngster did away with himself because he did not understand that he was going to be freed three or four days later.
I am talking here tonight about the vacuum in all this legislation. There is money for this, money for something else and money for a third thing, but the government has defunded language programs in the Northern Territory. Where built into this suite of laws is not just the protection but the fostering of the rights of Indigenous people to their languages, customs and laws? What we have dealt with today are simple mechanisms for saying that the courts cannot take those into account. Where is the rest of it? I will tell you: it is not here.
When I moved also for a Senate inquiry and action in this place against petrol sniffing—that scourge of young people, 400 to 600 of whom were active petrol sniffers in Indigenous lands in the Northern Territory and adjacent states—it was this government that held that up. It did not want that rolled out in Alice Springs—you will remember that very clearly, Minister—until the force of public argument finally overcame the government resistance, and the vested interest behind that government resistance, to immediately making available non-sniffable petrol. That rollout has finally taken place, which will not only save the culture of those kids but their ability to appreciate it, take part in it and to enjoy it into the future.
The government says that it has some special moral authority to arbitrate what is going to happen through these laws, that that is best for Indigenous people and that it knows that because it did not consult them. It did not consult the Northern Territory government or the Indigenous people; it just brought the laws in, announced they were going to happen and started to enact them at the earliest moment. They are here in the parliament and will go through this week. What I am warning about is that the lack of probity, prudence and consultation here will have a very big cost, and that cost will be on the Indigenous people; they are going to bear it. The minister can make his argument in the way he has just done and cite examples, but we are talking about scores of communities here and about laws that reach into every black household in the country without consultation. I am warning about the impact that that will have on Indigenous culture into the future. There has been no assessment of it; there has been no account of it; there has been no consultation about it with Indigenous people. And there is nothing in this legislation which advocates it. That is the problem.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—There are a couple of points I want to make to clarify the record or at least give my perspective on some of the things people have said. I think we are getting into a waxing lyrical stage here, which is sort of interesting. I also have some questions about other aspects of the bill to do with the permit issue we dealt with before dinner and some other sections to do with pornography et cetera. It might be my anal nature but I would rather move onto those sections before we have to ask more of those questions. So I am suggesting it might be good to put the question, although having said that I want to say a few things before we do because I am being a bit helpful—but not too much.
There has been some useful broader philosophical contributions from the previous speaker. I want to give my recollection of the record in regard to a couple of the points that were made with a purpose beyond just correcting the record. I am 99.9 per cent certain the legislation that Senator Brown is referring to that dealt with mandatory sentencing was a joint piece of legislation of the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens—Senator Bolkus, Senator Greig and Senator Brown from memory. As you would know, Madam Chair, that sort of cooperative effort tends to increase the chance of success that occurred on that occasion. Purely for the record, I want to acknowledge the Democrats’ equal contribution in that particular process but also to use the petrol sniffing inquiry example and contrast it with what we are doing now.
As you would know, Madam Chair, having been heavily involved in the petrol sniffing inquiry yourself, my recollection is that there was an initial Senate inquiry put up by Senator Brown which focused on petrol sniffing, which I think the Democrats supported but some others felt was too narrow. It was focused too much or solely on Opal and not on other things. There was an effort, if I recall—it might even have been by Senator Scullion—to try and amend the motion put up by Senator Brown, and that was not agreed to. He did not want to amend it, so it did not get up and everybody got nothing; no inquiry at all. It did not help anybody very much; a chance to beat up on the government of course for not going ahead with the inquiry.
I think it was Senator Scullion’s motion that did initiate the final inquiry after consultation with other people, including me. It might have been a bit broader than others wanted it to be, but we worked through it and we got an inquiry up. That inquiry was conducted over a period of a few months and went to a number of places, including Mount Theo, which I think got recognition through the Order of Australia award today for their work in that area. We produced a unanimous report after that consultation. The government acted on it because of ongoing political and public pressure and all those things, but it was recognised to have been a great success—although I would caution to say it was not the universal problem solved forever, as has occasionally been reported, but it was still a great success done in conjunction with and listening to Indigenous people.
My points are firstly to acknowledge that it was partly the role of people within the government, specifically Senator Scullion, who wanted to work constructively with people to get that inquiry initiated and then it was conducted properly and a good result was produced. I acknowledge the contribution that Senator Scullion made because he might have been, no doubt inadvertently, left out of history in the way it was described. I use that to contrast with what we are doing now, which is exactly the opposite: no consultation, no cooperation, no listening, no engagement, no nothing on a range of issues far more complex than petrol sniffing. That is why I have concerns about this working. It is nothing to do with all the philosophical to-ing and fro-ing we have had, interesting though it is. I hate to be a stick in the mud and put all that great, broad philosophical encountering to one side and pull it back to what is before us now and whether or not it will work in practice on the ground—that is my concern. I have some more questions on that but perhaps I should focus things and move it forward a little bit. It might be worth putting the question and moving on; it is just a suggestion.
 (Senator Moore)—Thank you for your suggestion; I will give it a go. The question is that clauses 3 to 5 stand as printed.

It is good to get up every three or four hours and move one of these. We have had some discussion about the permit issue but the Labor Party regards this as a very important debate. This set of amendments seeks to put in an alternative regime to that proposed by the government. The government is effectively looking to remove the permit system from roads and townships and only apply it to land beyond those boundaries. Labor fundamentally thinks this is an issue of safety; this is an issue of child protection. The test we set when we agreed to support the legislation proposed by the government was that it would get our support if it improved the security and safety of children in a practical way.
There has been a lot of aspects to the government’s legislation where people have argued that the measures are not directly targeted towards the protection of children and that they are peripheral matters or matters that reflect a broader agenda that the government has been trying to get adopted. But clearly when it comes to the permit system I think the opposite is the truth: the government has not gone far enough and its measures to abolish the permit system is contributing to the thing they say this legislation is aimed at combating—that is, protection of Indigenous women and children, their ability to be safe.
We believe that the government’s proposals fail the test that we set for them. We think that the alternative regime that we propose will achieve some of the objectives the government argued for in support of their measures but will still allow those Indigenous communities to exercise the permit system in order to provide safety in their communities. It would provide them protection from the grog runners, drug runners and other undesirable characters who seek to prey on some of these communities.
We are supported in that by the views of the Northern Territory Police and the Northern Territory government. There was a submission to the Senate inquiry from the Police Federation of Australia, which I thought was quite compelling. It said:
In relation to the long-standing permit system for access to aboriginal communities, the PFA is of the view that the Australian Government has failed to make the case that there is any connection between the permit system and child sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities. Therefore, changes to the permit system are unwarranted.
The submission goes on:
Operational police on the ground in the Northern Territory believe that the permit system is a useful tool in policing the communities, particularly in policing alcohol and drug-related crime. It would be most unfortunate if by opening up the permit system in the larger public townships and the connecting road corridors as the Government intends, law enforcement efforts to address the ‘rivers of grog’, the distribution of pornography, and the drug running and petrol sniffing were made more difficult.
So the police are saying that they do not support the government’s proposals. They do not think we should go as far as the government are proposing in terms of amending that permit system. So Labor are offering an alternative regime which seeks to recognise some legitimate arguments made by the government and others about access for certain classes of individuals to townships. We propose a regime which provides for designated persons who can get access to the communities. It will allow those with proper reasons for visiting the communities to go there but it will still allow the permit system to restrict those who go for purposes that might offend the inhabitants, and those who might go there for purposes of criminal or inappropriate behaviour.
Our amendments allow access to roads and town community centres only to the class of people that we define in our amendments as ‘designated persons’. These designated people are members of parliament or candidates for election, as per the existing legislation; Commonwealth or Territory government employees, or agents of the Commonwealth or Territory governments acting in an official capacity; and journalists acting in their professional capacity.
Labor believes that there is a good argument for extending access to journalists. I think we all agree that being able to report on occurrences and what is going on in communities or in our society is part of a free society. That transparency is a useful part of our democracy so we think that there is an argument to put journalists on that list of designated persons. But we still think that we need to provide the protections that the permit system has afforded Indigenous people so that they can control who is coming onto their communities. It is a measure that will assist in protecting communities from sly groggers, paedophiles or whoever else comes onto the community without due cause.
We think our alternative regime is preferable to the government’s regime. We think it ensures that access to those with business in visiting the communities is guaranteed, but that those who are not designated persons ought to go through the current practices and apply for access through permits. We think it is a better balance between providing openness and transparency about what occurs in communities and the need for those communities to have their culture and tradition protected, and the security of the people who live in those communities assured.
It is not often understood that this is a question of people entering Aboriginal property. Just as I like to control who comes onto my property, it is not unreasonable for Indigenous people to want the same. This is their property. People tend to forget, when they are discussing Indigenous rights, that people have property rights. We do a lot in this act to suspend those property rights but I think it is important that the people in those communities retain that sense of control which in no way prevents the police or proper authorities coming onto their land.
I do not accept that the current system prevents that either, but if one wanted to make that argument, this amendment provides for designated persons. It provides access for those people who need to be there to ensure law and order and to provide proper services, including health services or any of the measures that need to be supplied to communities. It allows the communities to control who else comes into their communities, and who uses the roads to those communities. The government argues that they have protected something like 99.8 per cent of the lands in the sense that people cannot go beyond the major roads and communities, but the point is that they can go where the people live. They can get access to the people who are in the communities. If we are serious about the security of children and protecting them from some of the activities that have been associated with people visiting communities, then the alternative regime we are proposing is preferable to the government’s regime. We think that the complete destruction of the permit system, which is achieved by the government’s legislation, is not supported on the evidence.
I know it has been a bugbear of the minister’s for some time; it is an agenda he has been running for some time. But this is not the opportunity for the minister to keep running his personal agendas; this is a question about whether the Parliament of Australia should pass legislation that deals with emergency concerns about child abuse and violence in the Northern Territory Aboriginal communities. We have to make a judgement about whether the government’s arguments for the changes it is proposing are solid. I do not think they are. I think we ought to fall on the side of the Northern Territory Police and the wishes of those communities and limit the changes in the permit system to the ones proposed by Labor rather than accepting the approach the government is proposing.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I want to make a few comments about this section of the legislation because I think the government has got this fundamentally wrong. Despite the fact that there may be some elements of this bill I have supported, I seriously think this part of the legislation is driving a personal agenda. I am not sure if it is the personal agenda of this minister or of the member for Solomon, who has advocated long and hard to have the permit system abolished. I am not sure because this does not actually cover any of the seat of Solomon.
The government got the opportunity to make this move into the permit system and, looking at their history, I think it will be just the start of further changes to come. We had an announcement last year that this minister and this government were going to conduct a review of the permit system. That happened. They say they got over 100 submissions. Funnily enough, I got three-quarters of those cc-ed to me. I am not sure on what basis they came to their conclusion but, on reading those submissions, I could come to no other conclusion than that the permit system needs not only to be kept in place but enforced. I have heard the minister say that a couple of people dragged him aside at a meeting and said, ‘Look, I didn’t want to say anything publicly, but I’d like the system abolished.’ Well, we do not usually operate like that in this country. When you call for submissions to an inquiry, people need to have the tenacity to front up and put in a public submission, a submission that is available for all time for others to see. We do not usually make changes by Chinese whispers or word of mouth. So I am not convinced that your submissions overwhelmingly said the permit system should be changed in any way at all. I think that, if you were so convinced that that was the evidence before you, those submissions would have been public, a paper summarising those positions would have been public. But we have not seen that at all.
I think this is the beginning of taking away some of the control that the land councils have in the Northern Territory. I do not say that there would be no communities in the Northern Territory that want changes to the system. So why don’t you consult with Indigenous communities and, for those who want the changes to the permit system, do it? It would be quite easy to schedule those by regulation to say that you will make changes to the permit system when and if required by individual communities, but I do not see that happening.
I went to Maningrida nearly seven weeks ago along with the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, and I made it my business to talk to the police in that community. I did not talk about this in my speech on Tuesday night because I was leaving it for now. The afternoon that we were there we sat with those five police officers and had a cuppa, and they said to us both categorically: ‘Look, to be quite honest with you, we rely on the permit system as our key to stopping intruders in this community. Twice in the last 12 months we’ve noticed strange vehicles in this community, and the permit system was our opportunity to stop those vehicles. The first one took off and we weren’t able to chase them. We were immediately suspicious then about why they didn’t stop, but they got away. The second one didn’t get away; we were able to stop them. They had a stash of marijuana under the seats in the back and we were able to prosecute them.’ That, to me, is real hard evidence that the permit system works.
The police officers I spoke to three weeks ago said to me, ‘The reality on the ground is that the federal government needs to put more police into communities’—and, let’s face it; it is not going to happen overnight in these 70 communities—’or, when they take away the permit system, give police the power to stop a car.’ For what reason? You actually have to have a reason to stop a car; you cannot just flag down a car and say, ‘You’re a stranger in this community; I want to search your car.’ The police tell me that, if the permit system is revoked on the main road, they will have no key, no mechanism, no trigger to stop, talk to or question people who may be suspect. The government has to seriously look at the implications of this on the ground and have a bit of common sense in this. I do not see any common sense prevailing in this.
I cannot believe that the federal government would turn their backs on the Northern Territory police force, on the Northern Territory Police Association and on the Australian Federal Police Association and say to those well respected members of those police forces, who seriously know what they are doing and seriously know how well the permit system can be used and implemented: ‘We know better than you. You guys out there on the ground are dealing with this 24/7, but your thoughts and ideas are really irrelevant in all of this.’ I would have thought that this week, with the Police Association meeting in Darwin and the strong representations that have come from the Australian Federal Police Force and from Vince Kelly, they would at least put a hold on this section of the legislation. They could just take it away and rethink it for another fortnight, and perhaps they say to themselves: ‘All right, we’ll make these changes but we’ll do it community by community, or we’ll implement these changes when more police get into communities.’ The way they are currently going about it does in no way in the world convince me that this is being done in the best interests of the children—in fact, quite the opposite.
The example that I gave earlier this evening is a real example. It was an example that moved the nationally renowned journalist from the Australian to write about it. He was so disturbed about it that he finally decided he would blow the lid on this operation between a senior traditional owner and a fellow from interstate. I heard what you said before, Senator Scullion, about the supply of Viagra, but, let us face it, you can get it over the internet. If you are like me and thousands of other Australians who access their email every day, the spam for the purchase of Viagra is coming at you day and night. You can buy it. You do not need a prescription and it is being peddled out there in the community. That is the reality.
This is the one area, I would have thought, in the whole saga of child abuse and child neglect that we have heard about that you might seriously try to turn around. But I am blowed if I can understand why you will not give either the land councils or the minister the power to revoke a permit if a TO is given that permit. I think that this sort of situation is going to be exacerbated. You know that as well as I do—you are from the Territory—and I think you know deep down that this is not going to work either.
Secondly, if you want to turn your back on the police forces in this country and suggest to them that you know better about how policing on the ground works, then I think you have seriously got this aspect of the legislation wrong. Finally, the irony is that somebody said to me the other day: ‘You know, Trish, if this government wants to abolish the permit system so that more tourists can go into the 70 communities, at the end of the day that will be the ultimate evaluation of this government. They have been an abysmal failure in Wadeye and a dramatic failure in Mutitjulu. So, if more tourists in this country witness what a devastating effect some of their policies have on these communities, maybe people on the eastern seaboard might suddenly wake up to what is actually going on in those communities and demand that more action be taken and the money be better targeted.’ Maybe at the end of the day, opening up these communities to more tourists might actually be the one form of scrutiny and evaluation that this federal government finally needs.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"I will speak to the Labor amendments which, as I understand them, seek to provide us with a bit of a halfway house from the government’s approach. The Democrats prefer an approach, which is reflected later on, to just scrap the schedule altogether. I still have not seen any evidence that it is necessary. I have heard plenty of assertions. We got a few assertions at the Senate inquiry and some during the debate in the chamber but I have not actually seen any evidence that this works. We got one page given to us without notice in the Senate committee hearing by officials from FaCSIA and, without being too harsh, it was not the most thorough in-depth justification I have read for a significant public policy change. It was basically a few dot points with a few assertions.
There are a couple of issues here. I am not here to defend the permit system as the be-all and end-all that should never be touched—I do not really see that as something I can speak about with sufficient justification—but I certainly feel quite justified in saying that it is not something that should be touched without consultation and at least some indication of a reasonable amount of consent from the people affected. It has been a longstanding provision and I have not seen any solid evidence, as opposed to theories and assertions, that it causes the sorts of problems that are being alleged. But we are certainly quite happy to look at it if evidence is provided. Even so, it is clearly far better to do that, unless it is absolutely necessary, with some reasonable degree of consent and consultation. I have reasonable suspicion that there would possibly be a few places that would not mind having some variation to the system, but having a review with secret submissions that are not published and then saying that you have made a decision on the basis of that is not exactly terribly comforting.
Going back to the specific link here, we are told that we have to do this now without consultation and without consent because it is an emergency and the emergency is linked to child sexual abuse and assault. But there has been no evidence at all to suggest that the permit system in any way exacerbates the problem. We are getting dodgy logic: that the permit system is in place in some communities and there is abuse in those communities therefore the permit system is not stopping it. Whatever the permit system was set up to do, I do not think that it was ever set up to stop child abuse. We have child abuse, it needs to be said, and child sexual assault at very serious levels in pretty much every town and community in the country to varying degrees, and to quite high degrees in many parts of the non-Indigenous community. That has been acknowledged by this chamber by a range of resolutions and, indeed, by the minister himself, Minister Brough. It is a very serious problem across the country—and that is everywhere where there ain’t no permit system!
The idea that by opening up a community, people will be able to see what is going on and they will see that there is child sexual abuse somewhere and it will stop, or people will not do it because there are other people wandering through their communities, is just ludicrous. People can think that way in regard to any city or any town of any size in the country. In many respects, it is the most secretive of grievous offences for all sorts of reasons. To link the permit system to child sexual assault and say that it gets in the way of that being mitigated, let alone eliminated, and to do that without evidence, is pretty lame, frankly, and that is being polite.
The wider issue then added on top of that is that it gets in the way of economic development et cetera. There is a debate that could be had there but it should not be tied to an emergency situation to do with child sexual abuse. I fully accept—before I get immediately misrepresented again—that improving the economic situation in some of these places would probably improve the strength of the community and reduce some of the psychological and social malaise that can be a contributing factor to child neglect and assault. I am certainly not saying that it does not matter whether we get improved economic circumstances, but that should be a more thorough debate rather than ramming this through under the guise of an emergency to do with child sexual abuse.
Again, I would ask, even on that point, whether there is some actual, decent, documented evidence, a good, peer-reviewed, thorough study, that demonstrates that those communities that have the permit system, on average, have a worse economic situation or worse child abuse statistics than those Aboriginal communities without the permit system. Certainly, in my state of Queensland, there are a number of communities and areas where there are serious problems with child neglect and abuse and there are serious problems with no economic development, and there is no permanent system in almost all of those. Senator Scullion mentioned a community before—I am not sure whether I can remember it now—that he was praising as being wonderful. Maybe it was the Daly River.
—Yes.
—That will give me the incentive to go there. That is good, and that does not have the permit system, apparently. I am sure there are other communities that are on the not-so-positive side of things that also do not have permits in the Territory and certainly in Western Australia and Queensland. I would also hazard a guess that there are some pretty good communities in the Territory that also operate under the permit system. To try to single it out as some key delineating factor in the absence of some pretty decent evidence is pretty sloppy reasoning, and that is why I think people make the reasonable conclusion that there must be some other ideological agenda—and, people are allowed to put forward ideological agendas. We probably all do it in different ways with different degrees of consciousness or self-awareness that that is what we are doing. But, if you want to have things passed in a rush because it is an emergency, you need, firstly, to make it clear that all the measures relate to that emergency; and, secondly, as has been said a number of times, if you want that emergency intervention to be effective, you need to build trust. To me, this is one of the areas, along with the five-year lease area—probably the area of permit removal, even more so, on the basis of what people have said to me, anyway; I do not want to be too conclusive about that—where people have said, ‘I just cannot see any logical reason for this; there has to be some other agenda and, if there’s some other agenda, it makes it really hard to trust what’s going on.’ A key issue for long-term success with this stuff is building trust. I am not saying that this is the be-all and end-all and it will never happen if this goes through, but I am saying you are making it a lot harder for yourselves for no particularly good reason.
Certainly, amongst the people I have heard from and talked to, a number of whom, as I have freely acknowledged, have been broadly quite supportive—a few very strongly—of what the federal government is doing, none of them has said that the permit system needs to go as part of this. There have been some who have said that that is the price we have to pay, that doing something about child abuse is more important and that, if it means getting rid of the permit system in the way that is proposed, that is the price we will pay. But it does not have to be the price they will pay, and that is what these amendments are about—and, more so, the Democrat amendments.
To me, the key issue is: where is the evidence? There have been lots of good assertions. On the face of them, you can even see how they might make some logical sense until you dig a bit deeper. But, without some decent evidence, I cannot support this sort of change. We got some pretty good evidence from John Altman, and whilst he, I am sure, says things the government does not like, I do not think they accuse him of not knowing what he is talking about or of not having a clue or those sorts of things. They might say he is outdated and living in the past and all that sort of stuff, but he knows a fair bit about this sort of area. He provided research to the committee—it was done on behalf of Oxfam, from memory—which pretty much demonstrated the opposite of what the government is asserting. That is why I believe this whole section should not be supported.
As to the specifics of the Labor amendment, they, as I understand it, basically seek to allow automatic access for a designated group of people. I think that is about right. That is a group of people listed in the legislation, which includes MPs, I note, and candidates. That leads me to one question, which I will float out there for the minister to answer whenever he does so. Groups of people listed under section 2A on page 39 as basically having automatic access included members of parliament, the Governor-General and government officials et cetera. But it also says ‘candidates for election’. I was wondering whether the definition of someone being a candidate for election means in the period after they have put in a nomination or whether it is—
—Same as the current.
—Right. Perhaps that could be clarified for me, as it sounds like a nice, clear-cut one. Or perhaps it goes from whenever a person announces that they are a candidate, which obviously they do well before they put in the nominations.
As well as that, I note that the Labor amendment allows in journalists who are acting in their professional capacity, so there is a special privilege status for journalists. I suppose there would be clarification in advance as to whether they are doing things on or off the record. I understand why that is put there but, again, I am not overly convinced about that. I am not in any way casting aspersions on journalists, let me hasten to add—that there is any particular reason for singling them out above all else. I can understand the reasons why it is put there. I think there is some merit in the halfway house that Labor has put forward. I am not overly keen on it because I do not see that the argument has been made at all for change, but that is another matter.
I have reviewed what the minister said before dinner about the specific issue of the revoking of permits. Perhaps I am a bit slow and it is getting a bit late, but I still do not understand 100 per cent what he said about that. I might leave that until we get to it specifically, because I note that there is a Democrat amendment and a Labor amendment around that same section. I think we can have the general debate about permits first and get to the specific, niche issues a bit later.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I am not sure whether I am looking forward to another debate about permits. I thought we had been through that, but no doubt we will deal with that when you are prepared to. I will speak to the opposition’s amendments and the effect of those amendments. With respect, I have to accept that this is a bit of a Clayton’s amendment. I can understand, perhaps, how difficult it must have been to try to find some sort of balance in this.
The effect of the proposed amendment is pretty much to allow government related persons and journalists access to areas as a designated person. I have been quite familiar with the permit system for very many years. When you work in a community as a government officer, you actually get a permit that has ‘ongoing’ on the bottom of it. It is just a once-in-a-lifetime thing whilst you are associated with a government department. I think that is pretty much the case at the moment. Allowing journalists is certainly something new. Journalists have often complained that they do not get access to communities, and I certainly support that part of the amendment, whilst it is generally caught up in the government legislation. I think Senator Crossin made my case very well: if people come to these communities—some of these communities are in a pretty poor state—they will know and they will travel back to their homes on the east coast and, as Senator Brown and others in this place have said, they will be part of the appropriate public outrage. If it is not right, people need to know about it, and that has been part of the problem, Senator Evans.
So what are the real changes here? There are a couple of changes. We sort of agree to the permit system as long as it does not really change anything. I really appreciate the difficulties you must have with this, Senator Evans, but effectively these limited changes would fail to open up the communities to the outside world. And they will not remove the climate of fear and intimidation in those communities. Senator Crossin reflected on a submission that we made that the minister had said to me both publicly and privately that people were coming up to him not only to say, ‘We think you should scrap the permit system’; they were saying: ‘I’m afraid. The reason I have to talk to you here is that I cannot stand up and say something in a public arena when other people in the community may not like what I say.’ That happens a lot in Indigenous communities, and it makes the consultation process very difficult.
—You hide behind that.
—If you have anything to do with consultation in those communities, Senator Crossin, you will understand that it is very difficult in a public arena to be able to ask, ‘Okay, what is actually going on?’ Like parliament, some aspects are a little bit wedded to a secret ballot and some are not. In my view, a secret ballot provides a far better indication of what people really think, and I think that is pretty much the situation here.
Senator Crossin touched on a couple of issues relating to the police, and I think the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate did as well. The police apparently have said that the government have failed to make any connection at all between child abuse and the permit system. Perhaps I will give it another crack. The police will well know that one of the issues, particularly in the younger generation, is that if you do not have a job you have a lot of time on your hands. You do not have to tell that to the police force, because that is certainly what police officers in the Northern Territory are telling me. That is the demographic that is extremely likely to provide a market for substance abuse in the communities. They are the ones who are saying: ‘I’ve got absolutely nothing to do. I don’t feel very good about myself. I don’t feel a great deal of self-worth.’ They are in the demographic that makes the market for substance abuse. The behaviour patters around substance abuse are very destructive not only to the individual but to those around them—the destruction of culture and the destruction of brothers, sisters, families and communities.
Whilst that may not touch directly on child abuse, surely without employment these communities are without the normal opportunities that come with a community of 100 people on the east coast. If you drive into an east coast community, there are small businesses—the hairdresser, the baker, the petrol station and somewhere to buy hamburgers and a milkshake. Wherever it is, there are always businesses. But these communities are not characterised by that. These communities are not characterised by the same opportunities for employment, and employment provides, not with a long bow, the sense of wellbeing so that we can start breaking the cycle of substance abuse.
I am not sure how much consideration was given to that statement, but I have had a lot of discussions with a lot of police officers in the Northern Territory about the permit system and about a whole range of other issues as I travel around the Territory. I think Senator Crossin is fundamentally right. I will have to be very cautious, because I am very respectful of police officers in the Northern Territory—they are a great bunch—but I think if you said to police officers anywhere, ‘By the way, you have the right to pull anyone over and have a bit of chat,’ they would all say, ‘Great stuff.’ It is difficult sometimes when you know someone is a bad guy but you cannot pull them up.
It has been my experience in the sorts of small communities we have that, if a police officer thinks that someone is doing the wrong thing, there are a whole range of other quite legitimate ways in which he can have a chat to the people concerned. It is certainly not something that I think has any legitimacy as another impediment to providing levels of safety—and that is what it is about. It is about providing the normal rule of law and order.
We will be providing $14 million in the first year and 66 police officers. That is what is going to change. There will be no more intimidation. People will actually feel that they can stand up and report someone who is behaving inappropriately. These are the sorts of fundamental changes that will do away with any particular idea that is wedded to the need for a permit system because it is a policing role. I am sorry, but I do not think that case has been made at all. The case that we should be making is that we need law and order. We need more police officers, and those police officers need to be properly respected and resourced. That is what will make the fundamental changes in these communities. The amendments fail to open up the communities and therefore are not going to be supported by the government.
With regard to your last question, Senator Bartlett, I understand that it is from the time of nomination.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—Reluctant as I am to keep going over some old ground, the minister just made a comment which may have been in the heat of a moment or may be what is driving some of these permit changes. He made a comment that it is only when people from the east coast travel through and get outraged and go back to the east coast and start stirring—he did not use the word ‘stirring’; that is my paraphrase. Now, I am sorry, but how many reports have we had about child abuse in the Northern Territory? You are not honestly telling us that it is just because people may have seen what is going on in these areas and gone back and caused outrage that you are taking action? Firstly, that is just a nonsense argument. But, secondly, does that mean we are going to open up every home in Australia for people to go in and see if there is abuse going on and then we will all get outraged? Because that is what you are doing—you are opening up Aboriginal owned land for people to go into to express outrage. Is that what you are doing it for? Let us do it for every Australian home. I know you are not implying—because we have been over this ground—that it is only in Aboriginal communities that child abuse occurs. So should we go out and tell the rest of Australia: ‘It’s okay, we’re going to open up all your homes so we can go in and get outraged and then do something about child abuse’? That is nonsense.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I am happy to say something here, and in the spirit of some sort of cooperation I probably should say something. Senator Siewert, I had mentioned in my contribution on the permit system that, if the intent of removing that system along main roads into these communities is to allow more tourist access to these communities, one of the things that may well occur as a result is that eventually people on the eastern seaboard may realise, if they have a long hard look at some of these communities, what this government’s funding and fundamental policy failures have been. Most people, if they had an opportunity to drive to Wadeye or Mutitjulu, would be quite shocked. In fact, I remember meeting James Hird on the night of my birthday this year when he had just come back from Wadeye, having been up there with the Bombers on a bit of a talent camp out in the communities. He spoke to me about how shocked he was at the condition of Wadeye. I mentioned to him that it had been one of the COAG trials, and he said that if that was the best the federal government could do—or words to that effect—he was pretty stunned. So my contribution on this matter was that if this opens up more Aboriginal communities to show some of the funding problems of this government then they may well get quite a surprise.
While I am on my feet, I will take this opportunity to ask the minister a couple of questions about the permit system, and I will try to be very quick. During the dinner break I was advised—and your advice may well be different—that if a traditional owner issues a permit and subsequently dies, it will be impossible for that permit to ever be revoked. I believe land councils have a view that it is a drafting problem in this legislation, since this legislation only allows the issuer of a permit to revoke it. There is a view that this appears to be an unintended consequence of the drafting. I understand that the issuing of the permit does not go to the ownership of the group, it stays with the individual. I wonder if you have had time to clarify that.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—That is not our advice and we do not agree with that. But if you do have some advice we would be more than happy to look at it. As I said earlier, it is our advice and view that all the land is communally held and, if someone passes away, the responsibility for that country still lies perhaps with an individual leader but certainly with the group of people, who would then be responsible for the maintenance of permission to travel upon that land. However, if you have some other advice, we would be happy to look at it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I will pass that answer on. Can I raise two other issues? My understanding is that the land councils currently also use their power to revoke permits that might be issued by a traditional owner as a circuit breaker to resolve disputes within those communities, those Aboriginal groups. I understand that this is a function that has been called on regularly and it occurs usually in consultation with the police. So when the police have called in the land council to assist, the land council has been able to use its power to assist the police and therefore withdraw that permit. Of course, this amending legislation removes the capacity of the land council to perform that function.
The other issue I want to raise is that there is now a question over whether this proposed amending legislation is inconsistent with the scheme of the land rights act, particularly section 5(1)(b), and the basic principles of trust law. I will explain this. Aboriginal land is legally vested in a land trust which, at the direction of a land council, must exercise its function as trustee and owner of the land in a responsible fashion for the benefit of Aboriginal persons who are beneficiaries of the trust. So it is a basic principle of trust law that a beneficiary cannot direct a trustee how to perform its function. However, I understand the proposed amendment vests in a beneficiary the power to override the trustee, notwithstanding that the section I mentioned provides that a land trust may exercise all the powers of an owner of land, including the power to make decisions in the interests of the trust beneficiaries regarding entry to the land. My question is: is it an intention that this amendment would be inconsistent with that clause?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Senator, I have to say I had some difficulty understanding all of that. I understand what you are saying, but there are some quite complicated aspects and I do not have the Aboriginal land rights act in front of me. I will say a couple of things. The permit system, in terms of whether somebody is behaving or not, at the end of it, should not be an alternative to the law. If, for example, a traditional owner has said or the group have said, ‘You can come on country,’ it is up to the police to pass information about bad behaviour back to the permit holder if it is just inappropriate behaviour; if it is unlawful behaviour, the police should act. Whether they have a permit to be there or not is really immaterial. We often hear of people saying, ‘What we have got in the permit system really helps us provide law and order.’ It probably has in the past because the shield of law and order simply has not been present.
I am advised in a more technical sense that land trusts are in fact not trusts for the purpose of the land rights act; they are shells for the purpose of holding land.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—On this point, as we have gone onto it now with those questions from Senator Crossin, I think it is worth putting on the record that the issues being raised were raised by the Northern Land Council in a supplementary submission. Because of the absurd time frame put on them, and on the Senate and the Senate committee, it was not actually submitted until after the hearing. So they put in that submission on Monday this week, after the hearing had been held, obviously when they were finally able to go through the legislation in detail and find this single clause in there. It is on the Senate committee website as additional correspondence, I think, for anybody who wants to check it out. It raises the issues that Senator Crossin was drawing on. Without disputing or getting into the competition of different advisers, whatever the opinion of the government about land councils, I do not think they would suggest that they do not know what they are talking about when it comes to permits. They live that stuff pretty regularly. Having said that, my understanding is that most of the day-to-day stuff with permits, in terms of individuals, is done at local level through traditional owners.
The one point I wanted to clarify goes back to that particular clause that we were discussing before the dinner break, section 74AA—item 14 on page 53. The minister has just said again that his advice is that, in the context of somebody passing on, the issue of the permit, while it is an individual, is in that category of being ‘traditional owner’ and therefore somebody else who is a traditional owner could revoke it. I want to clarify, because I really was not 100 per cent clear before dinner, whether that collective revocation power only applies in the context of the original issuer having passed on. Or is that something that applies all the time—forget about whether or not somebody dies? Is a permit able to be revoked by another traditional owner or is that only in the context of where someone dies? If it is able to be revoked by another traditional owner, doesn’t that create the same potential problems of confusion?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I want to respond briefly to Senator Scullion’s opposition to our amendments. All I can say is that I appreciate that he is very tired, but I found the response a little rambling. As I am very tired as well, it may be that I was not hearing well. But, quite frankly, claims that ending the permit system will create employment, end the drugs, remove the climate of fear and bring about world peace seem to me to be claims a little beyond what is rational or defensible. If Senator Scullion thinks that, I will take him around a few of the Western Australian communities, where there is no pass system, and I will show him the drugs, the unemployment, the hopelessness, the poverty and the abuse. Then we could both agree that the pass system has not protected people from that, but nor has the nonexistence of a pass system provided the sorts of protections that opening up is allegedly going to provide.
Quite frankly, I also do not share Senator Crossin’s optimism about non-northern Australians visiting the north, visiting Aboriginal communities, seeing the shocking state of those communities and somehow coming back and doing something about it. Hundreds and thousands of Australians who have been through those communities settle back into their peaceful existence and pretend it is not happening. In fact, successive ministers have done it. I remember in this government all those ministers who went for photo opportunities at Wadeye—successive FaCS ministers. I think the Prime Minister went there. They all have the photo opportunities. Then when the report comes out and we assess what has happened there it is a complete disaster—failure to follow through on promises, failure of big government to deliver to those people. But what we are now to understand is that the government are saying: ‘We got the previous one wrong, and the one before that wrong, but we’ve got the answer this time. We’re going to give ourselves more power to control their lives and we’re going to really fix it this time.’
Maybe I am getting old and cynical, but I actually think we have to get some empowerment of Indigenous people, some ownership of solutions. We cannot change social norms. We can provide support but we are not going to change the social norms that apply in Indigenous communities. That is only going to happen if you empower the local Indigenous people. Part of that is protecting them from fear, giving them the rule of law and providing them with services—services that this government and its predecessors have not delivered them. You can go on about police. I cannot see us maintaining a police station ongoing in all these communities for the next 50 years. It will not happen. We all know it will not happen. You have already blown your funding from what was supposed to be tens of millions to $500 million and rising. When it goes off the political radar, as it has every other time, some of the commitment will wane and some of the funding will wane. While there is that enthusiasm, while there is that focus, we must build the Indigenous communities’ capacity to develop social norms, develop economies and develop a sense of ownership of a future that has hope. That is much easier said than done. These measures are about putting in place some of the building blocks for that. That is why Labor is supporting them. But I am not sure enough thought has been given to the next step. And the failure to consult with Indigenous people, the failure to give them a sense of ownership of this, is a fatal flaw at the moment. Unless the government actually listens and thinks about that, we will fail in this endeavour.
Quite frankly, I worry about this sort of big government response where people think that they are going to run Indigenous lives and that somehow we are going to fix all of this. We can provide the building blocks but, in the end, we have to provide the capacity for Indigenous people to do it. The pass system is not the problem. What it does is recognise that Aboriginal people have property rights—this is their land. As well as being a system, it is a symbol of their control over their land. This is about empowering them. They decide who comes there—’and the terms on which they come’. This is about them having some say. Fundamentally, this government cannot cope with that. It cannot cope with the idea that Aboriginal people have control over their land.
The Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory have not always been great fans of the land rights act. The current government have not been fans of the land rights act. A number of these measures seem to be more about that ideological obsession about challenging Aboriginal control over their land and about making them more like us with 99-year leases so they can have a private home et cetera. Economic opportunity is a key part of the solution. This is more about the government’s inability to cope with Indigenous control and ownership of land, and that reinforces the concerns of communities that other measures in this package, which are well motivated, are somehow to be held up to suspicion. In a number of areas, like the Racial Discrimination Act and this area, you undermine the package. You go too far. You go in a way that adds to cynicism and suspicion and which will ultimately help undermine the success of the program. You do not need to make these changes to the pass system to make these things work. It is a bonus for you, because these are things you want to do anyway. You will actually undermine your capacity.
Labor’s alternative ensures that all those people who should be able to get there can get there. It provides a system by which people can apply to go on to the land. If somebody wants to go in and open a hairdresser’s shop on the corner and wants to get a permit then I am sure they will get a permit. I can take you to a lot of communities in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales et cetera where they do not have permit systems but they cannot get anyone to open a hairdresser’s shop on the corner either. It is not the permit system that is stopping that. We would be much better off in passing this set of laws, which so fundamentally take away from Indigenous people a whole range of current rights over land, to provide some recognition that we respect their relationship with the land and their property rights and we do not take away some of those rights just because we can.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—We sometimes need to remind ourselves just what we are doing here, not on the issue of intervention—I will not lecture you on that—but just on the scale: 99.8 per cent are exempted from all of this. This is just simply one prescribed road, and it was important that I had that clarified because I was not sure about it. There are no shortcuts. There is only going to be one prescribed road into a community. It is normally a public road paid for by taxpayers. It would require maintenance and a fence on each side. Anywhere else outside the township area, when you go off a road and there is a house and fence, is private property. The norms of anybody travelling in a town will provide. People are not going to be walking into houses, and I know that you are not asserting that. But it is a very small area and the relative benefits are a safer, more prosperous community. I accept your experience in Western Australia and it is a tragedy to know that there is no silver bullet for these issues. There has to be a suite of answers to this. I concede that if nothing else happens, if you just have open communities as they have in Western Australia, that is insufficient—I acknowledge that. We are providing a wide range of initiatives and this suite of initiatives is going to make a real difference. Part of those initiatives is the lifting of the permit system for the road in the way in—just on the township. We believe that a net benefit will be the prosperity and safety in the communities.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—On behalf of the opposition, I move:
(10)  Schedule 4, item 14, page 53 (after line 29), at the end of section 74AA, add:
         (2)    A Land Council may, by writing, request that the Minister revoke a permit issued to a person under subsection 70(2BB) where there are, in the opinion of the Council, reasonable grounds to believe that the person is of bad character.
I know we have gone over some of this ground earlier, but the bill proposes giving the minister the power to issue permits. The other section has limited to the person who issued the permits the power to revoke them and we have been through that discussion. This amendment will give a land council a right to ask the minister to revoke a permit, if there are reasonable grounds to believe the person to whom he has issued the permit is of bad character. It is just providing a facility for the land council to request the minister to make a decision within his powers. Labor think it would be helpful in the sense of dealing with people who perhaps should not have a permit and it would give the land council the capacity to bring that to the minister’s attention. Obviously, the decision still rests with the minister.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—We think opposition amendment (10) is unnecessary. The power of the minister to authorise a person or class of persons to enter or remain on Aboriginal land includes the power to revoke the authorisation. I am further informed that the situation now is that, if the land council has information that a person is of bad character, the land council should give that information to the minister and the minister can consider whether to revoke the authorisation. It is a given that, if there is unlawful behaviour, the matter should not really go through the minister; it should go to the police officers who can then deal with it.

(3)    Schedule 4, page 38 (line 2) to page 151 (line 18), TO BE OPPOSED.
I feel that we have already debated this issue ad nauseam but it is nice to finally have it before us. The Democrats oppose schedule 4. It is our view that we should not be removing the permit system.
I appreciate all the arguments that have been put forward, both for and against, but, as I said before, there has been no evidence put forward to actually suggest that it is necessary. I do not believe such a major change should be made without evidence, particularly given that it is a proposal that has, I think undeniably, caused a lot of concern amongst many Aboriginal people in the Territory. It is seen with suspicion and, unless you have a very good reason, I do not see why you would do something that is going to be viewed with suspicion. I have heard no good reason to do that—certainly not one that is backed up with any evidence—so I oppose schedule 4.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—I move Democrat amendment (4) on sheet 5341:
(4)    Schedule 4, item 12, page 52 (after line 31), after paragraph 70F(20)(b), insert:
       (ba)    land covering areas of cultural significance, ceremony or storage of sacred objects;
This concerns an issue that I do not think we have talked about until now. It is a small but still important amendment. It deals with the issue of the definition of ‘common areas’ under the new part 70F of the act. Under the new regime put in place in this legislation, a person may enter or remain on a common area that is within community land. The definition of ‘common area’ as put in the legislation is:
an area that is generally used by members of the community concerned, but does not include:
           (a)           a building; or
           (b)           a sacred site; or
           (c)           an area prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.
The intent of that, I assume, is for the government to make clear that opening up the permit system to some extent does not mean that people can go into buildings, as Senator Scullion said, or on to sacred sites.
The Democrat amendment would add an additional criterion to also include land covering areas of cultural significance, ceremony or storage of sacred objects. From my recollection, that is based on suggestions made to the Senate committee through some of the submissions that the exclusions of areas from the definition of ‘common area’ really need to be a little broader and should go beyond just a sacred site to also include the words that I stated. Areas of cultural significance, ceremony or storage of sacred objects would not come under the formal definition of ‘sacred site’.
The legislation says that the minister will have the power to add other areas by regulation for the purposes of the paragraph. So it may be that the government will indicate the minister’s preparedness to look at including a definition like that as one that would be prescribed by regulation, and that would have the same effect. If we can get that commitment, that would be a positive thing. It would be better if it was put into law, which is why I am moving it as an amendment. But, if we can have some indication that putting it in the regulations may be considered, that would at least go some way to addressing the concerns of those who raised this as an issue.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I know we have already voted on this, but I undertook to provide the senator with some information regarding his questions about the circumstance where a person who has provided the permit dies and how that works. I am advised that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is in fact the mechanism for the administration of the permit system. This legislation needs to be read in conjunction with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which refers to traditional owners in the plural. That means that, if the traditional owner who issued the lease dies, another traditional owner can be delegated. This is taken, I understand, straight out of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, so this legislation reflects that. It is in the plural in the original legislation, and it is reflected here.
With regard to the Democrat amendment, we think that the suggested additional exception to the definition of ‘common areas’ is a bit vague and unnecessary. The definition of ‘common areas’ already excludes sacred sites, which has a comprehensive and longstanding definition in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. It would be unnecessary and confusing to add the proposed provision, so the government does not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I understood, Senator Brown, that for the purpose of clarity the act will provide a schedule specifying, as we did with the prescription process, exactly where this particular act applies. It will be a place on the ground or a map with latitude and longitude that provides for the prescribed community. I am sure you will either continue to question me or someone will correct me but my assumption is that the common areas would obviously be the road areas and other public areas. It would differ from community to community, but most of the communities I go to have a large community space adjacent to the community centre. Normally, the community council or the community hall is in a hub where they have the childcare centre, the health centre and those sorts of things. One would assume that the common areas are all those areas that are not held privately within a prescribed area, so obviously private land would be a house, a front yard or whatever.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—There are two things there. Firstly, you talk about areas used by communities.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I have a series of facts, but we need to recognise that I am providing this information under the proviso that each community will be quite different. You cannot just be prescriptive about the common area, so this is a series of facts that will help us put that information together in most circumstances but it may change from community to community. Common areas are defined as areas which are generally used by the community concerned. The arrangements which will apply will be no different to other townships, including Aboriginal townships such as Daly River, where the permit system does not apply. It will be clear from fencing and other improvements whether land is of a public or private nature—for example, land surrounding a residence will clearly be private. Sacred sites will continue to be protected as they are now whether they are on Aboriginal land or not. Aboriginal townships already have visitors who are not allowed to enter sacred sites. If a problem arises then, quite clearly, practical measures can be taken as has been done in the past to ensure that people are aware that there is a sacred site in the area. The Sacred Sites Authority have provided us with great deal of knowledge about how to make their signs unattractive to people as well as ensuring that people understand the significance of the site. It has been done in a number of other areas.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—I understand that the minister is saying that land outside of a community—the term used by the minister—this circumscribed township area, is not common land in the definition for the purposes of this legislation. I want to make it clear that we are not talking about Indigenous lands in the main; we are talking about those lands within prescribed areas. It says that it does not include a building, and the minister said that private households will be excluded and fences will be put up. I presume it will be like Canberra, but it is all going to be laid down in the regulations. There is nothing here to say that everybody’s houses are not open to anyone who wants to go through them, past them, by them. I am thinking here particularly about the influx of people from outside, including busybodies, who are now permitted to enter Aboriginal land under this legislation.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—As I indicated from my seat but shall repeat for the record, the common areas we are speaking about lie only inside the prescribed areas which are only going to be prescribed areas for a five-year period. Nothing in my response to you refers to any lands outside of those areas. In terms of busybodies or other people, I think you made a good analogy—Canberra is probably a poor analogy—but like in a small country town where areas with buildings are private property. All other places would be considered to be communal areas. As I have said, we will be taking a very practical approach as with sacred sites. If this becomes a problem, then we need to look at it and try to resolve it.
Like in any community—these are very different and I do not think it is useful to be prescriptive—this is private land. By and large, people know exactly where their private land on communities is. Norms about travelling upon private land exist now in those communities. You do not just wander across land or do those sorts of things; you walk up to the front door, knock on the door and ask to speak to the people inside, in exactly the same manner as you would in any other community.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—Yes, but the legislation does not say that. We are left to trust that the regulations will. I was with Senator Siewert up at Karratha last year, looking at the Burrup. There was one place there which tourists could readily access. Signs pointed to where you could park and where you could go and look at the rock carvings in a very vast area. There were warnings asking people to respect the area and so on, and I was horrified to see that the places most proximate to the tourist parking areas had been defaced. One only has to look at other accessible human and natural heritage places around the country to see how some people cannot help but leave their mark. It is a reaction to their fear of mortality.
I am concerned that in removing the permit system and opening up these communities to whomever might come, the sacred sites will be a source of attraction to the curious, those who do not respect Indigenous culture—they are not few in number—and souvenir hunters. I want to know what it is in this legislation that is going to protect those sites now that the government is opening them to the greater threat of invasion by people who simply do not understand the significance of them to Indigenous people.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—The senator reflects on what we would all agree is a great tragedy. There are those in our community whom I simply do not understand. They go to some of our iconic natural heritage sites and want to carve their names in the trees. It is beyond me; I do not understand that and I am sorry that you were affected by the same sort of thing. There are laws against it.
I know of a well-known sacred site that is right in the middle of Tennant Creek. There is a fence around it and people know about it, but the experience is that none of those sorts of things happens there. Maybe it is because there is a high Indigenous population. It is right at the Julalikari Arts Centre, where tourists come in, have a cup of coffee and do those sorts of things. Perhaps it is not the perfect analogy because there are always people there but those sites, because people see and understand them, have never been desecrated.
Generally speaking, I think people are extremely respectful of our sacred sites. The way that you put the signage and manage the interaction are things that we have had a great deal of experience with in the Northern Territory. It is a criminal matter and very significant penalties apply under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act, and those will still apply. In any event, we would place a lot of confidence in that process—it is sad that we would have to—because it works so well in other parts of the Northern Territory that have the same sorts of visits as any proposed visits to some of these communities.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

But you would recall that, when we amended the Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act last year, we moved to increase the penalties for defacing sacred sites. I cannot recall when it was last year, but we will always move to ensure that there are disincentives.

As I have been saying, the first thing is that a whole range of assessments are happening, but we will ensure that people have the capacity, as soon as possible, to manage the interaction between people and sacred sites. We have done it in other places and we need to ensure that that is on the ground. All I can say is that, like a lot of other things, generally speaking—I do not want to over generalise—the sacred sites that occur within these areas already enjoy that. Because of the nature of the communities, there are not many sacred sites but there certainly are some. That is a general statement. Those sites enjoy a management plan for the visitors that currently go to the communities under the permit system to ensure that they are aware of the penalties. So this is not something that we are starting from scratch. We will improve on a level of amenity that has to deal with an increased amount of visitors.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—by leave—The Democrats oppose schedule 4 in the following terms:
(5)    Schedule 4, item 14, page 53 (line 23) to page 54 (line 4), TO BE OPPOSED.
(6)    Schedule 4, item 16, page 150 (lines 18 to 22), TO BE OPPOSED.
This deals with an issue that we have already talked of in about three different places, and I think the minister has answered the question that I have asked—at least as far as I am going to be bothered to pursue it, anyway. But it does still bring us back to the key point, I hasten to add, which is that I think the government is making a mistake here. The Democrats are opposing new section 74AA, which states:
A permit issued under section 5 of the Aboriginal Land Act of the Northern Territory may only be revoked by the issuer of the permit.
This means that if the permit is issued by a traditional owner then only that traditional owner can revoke it, unless they die—and we have dealt with that—and if it is issued by the land council then only the land council can revoke it. To a large extent we have talked about this, so I will not go on at length, but I think the core issue still has not been demonstrated—that is, why this is needed. I asked the minister prior to dinner if he could give us any more concrete details of just how widespread was the problem of land councils cancelling permits that had been issued by traditional owners in ways that had caused problems, had seemed to be capricious or had caused confusion. I am not denying that that could happen but I think it would be useful to get an idea of how frequent and how big a problem this actually is, because I am not aware of explicit examples.
The other side of that coin is what happens if you remove that power. Certainly my understanding—Senator Crossin referred to this and the supplementary submission from the Northern Land Council also referred to this—is that it is sometimes used as a circuit-breaker to resolve disputes within an Aboriginal group. In those circumstances, at least according to them—and I do not have any reason at all to doubt them—that is usually done in consultation with the police and often by the request of others in the community or Aboriginal group. It would seem to be logical to still allow that power.
There is a detailed process in the act for issuing and revoking permits, appeals and all of those sorts of things. The Northern Land Council’s supplementary submission indicates that ordinarily when they cancel a permit revoked by a traditional owner it is done in consultation with the police, other traditional owners and affected Aboriginal persons. In doing so, they must take into account all relevant considerations and ignore irrelevant considerations, and any decision to revoke a permit may be reviewed in the courts under administrative law principles or via complaint to the Ombudsman. So if there is some suggestion that there is improper revocation happening then there is some form of review available there.
It seems that you would want to have a good reason for taking away this power. I suspect that it is just a bit of a shot across the bow at the land councils or just to take away a bit of their power because you can, because they are seen—and I think this terminology was used by the minister—as the gatekeepers. I do not know whether or not the minister was using that pejoratively on this occasion, but I have certainly heard it used in a pejorative sense. It is not my position to defend anything and everything that every land council does, by any means. There are issues there that one could have in a wider debate. But to take away their ability to cancel or revoke a permit issued by a traditional owner without reasonable evidence to demonstrate why this would be a good idea is a bit of a problem. The Senate has received evidence from land councils saying this will be a bit of a problem. It could make it a bit harder in some circumstances.
The fact that a traditional owner has the right to issue a permit is without dispute. I think it is eminently plausible to say that from time to time you will have a traditional owner who may not have the best intention in giving a permit to somebody of less than ideal character. I have certainly been regularly told that cancellation of permits can be used as a way of assisting in having a person removed. I totally accept what the minister has said a few times—that the permit system should not be a replacement or an alternative to a proper police presence. I am not suggesting it should be. Inasmuch as it may have evolved that way, that is not ideal, and certainly we should ensure a proper police presence. But it is not just about catching lawbreakers. If you are talking about dealing with culture, lines of authority and good public order, sometimes it is not about people who have actually committed crimes; sometimes it is about other related issues.
The permit system is staying in place to some extent, so there are still issues about ensuring that that permit system works as effectively as possible. It just seems that, unless there is a good case being made—and I seriously have not heard it—for removing this power from land councils, there will be one less avenue available to them to revoke a permit in circumstances where it is causing a problem for the community and it cannot be revoked in any other way. In the absence of some reasonably solid evidence presented by the minister indicating the number of times and perhaps some examples of where this has been done in a capricious or unfair way or in a way that is causing significant confusion, I do not think that the case has been made to have this new section put in. A reasonably good case has been made in submissions to the Senate that it will do more harm than good.
I should say that the land council suggested an alternative form of wording and I have not gone with that. I do not think that that has been adequately explored either and I am not 100 per cent convinced that it would be the way to go based on the evidence I have before me. I am not here just to be a parrot for the land councils, by any means. I have not adopted their alternative solution. I think it is better just to keep things as is. The case has not been made and, until it is, we should not have this section in there.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—I would like to ask a few questions, if I may, around this specific provision as it relates to appeals. I know limiting people’s appeal rights to an internal review under part 3B of the Social Security (Administration) Act limits the rights of those people that are under the income management regime in the Northern Territory. Does that mean all their rights of appeal as they relate to anything that happens to their income support are covered under this clause? Does that mean they do not have the same appeal rights if they are breached and get an eight-week non-payment period?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—As I understand it—just for completeness—whilst it is the same regime, one regime deals with the management in terms of attendance and the other is in terms of the child or neglect, where somebody has identified an issue from a social worker. The appeal processes are separate. In the first there is simply a Centrelink officer at officer level. They are able then to seek review by the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. I understand that in the second case—in the case concerning the child protection income management regime—a person would be able to appeal the decision under the new part 3B to an authorised review officer, then the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is the difference between the two schemes.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,—So limiting those appeal rights to internal review only applies to those who are on the income management regime in the Northern Territory—in the prescribed areas? Can I take it from your answer that it just applies if it relates to child neglect and school attendance?

Schedules 1 to 3, page 7 (line 2) to page 111 (line 7), TO BE OPPOSED.
This essentially covers all of the substantive areas of the bill. I have some questions for the minister around a number of the provisions that we have not explored yet. Regarding CDEP, I think we have established fairly well, both in the chamber and in the inquiry process, that, though the numbers vary, there are about 7,000 people on Community Development Employment Projects who will be moved to income support or Work for the Dole. As I understand it, and there is some dispute over the figures, there are around 2,000 to 2,500 real jobs. I want to know what will be done to assist those approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people who are moving from CDEP to income support not only to find jobs but also to address the gap in income, because, as we identified during the inquiry, there will be a decrease by approximately $76 million in CDEP from the DEWR budget. According to an answer to a question I asked on notice, around $46.9 million is being put into income support. That is a difference of around $30 million that is coming directly out of the pockets of Aboriginal people in these areas. I would like to know how that issue is being addressed, because that is a fairly substantial amount of money.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—Senators will no doubt be aware that there are a number of CDEP positions in many of these communities that I think everybody acknowledges are full-time positions—and those people should not be there. So we are moving those people. If it is a Commonwealth position and it should be paid for by the Commonwealth, it needs to be a full-time position, not a CDEP training position with top-up. In the last budget the Commonwealth committed significant sums of money to pay for that. We would expect it will be the same for those people being paid for local government positions—and for the Northern Territory government, which has people in those communities. Those people who are employed on CDEP to do a job that should be full time will be transferred to those jobs.
The remaining cohort will move from CDEP to income support, with the provision of employment services. There will be literacy training and job preparation and training, as well as access to the STEP program, which in effect is how CDEP was originally intended. That is the suite of options that people will have, but, principally, much of that cohort will move to income support and employment service providers, with a whole suite of training initiatives to ensure that they can move into employment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—I would appreciate that; thank you. There are also jobs in the community funded under CDEP that in fact are not Commonwealth. They may not be classed as local government jobs but they are jobs in communities—for example, art centres that are funded by communities but only function because they are receiving CDEP. A lot of communities, as you know, depend on those jobs for some key services. How is it envisaged that those jobs will be funded from now on? I have received a number of letters, and I am sure you have as well, from communities expressing concern that, once CDEP goes, they will not be able to fund those positions any longer—and they are not necessarily Commonwealth positions. How do you intend dealing with those positions?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I think it is all about organisations taking responsibility for their employees, from whom they gain either a great deal of service or a range of profitability, as in any business. Yes, a number of art centres have enjoyed subsidised workers—I think it is reasonable to say that that is the case, Senator. But, most importantly, those are training positions and there is a reasonable expectation that, after 12 months access to a subsidised training position, the employer, which would be an arts centre, would have a plan to move that individual from a training position to a full-time position.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—I know we are all tired, so I will try not to get too frustrated about this. But, Minister, as you know—and I am sure many other people know—the rhetoric is all very well but there is in fact not the money to do that. It became plain through the Senate committee inquiry on arts and craft, which we have been talking about throughout this debate, that the arts centres provide many services beyond what would be classed as running as an arts centre. Essentially, they are multifunctional centres. They provide community support, they provide a broad range of training, they support artists—they do all sorts of things beyond just administering the arts centres. That is very well known. So it is all very well for the rhetoric to say that they should be moving on, but the fact is that the money is not there to do that at the moment.
I am using arts centres as an example. There are other services that communities provide based on CDEP as well, and you know as well as I do that it is all very well to say that they should be profitable et cetera, but the fact is that, at the moment, they are not and it is very difficult for them to get there. So communities are going to suffer when the CDEP money goes from those organisations if there is not something to help there. I am glad that the Commonwealth has identified those 2,000 jobs, and, while I am on my feet, I ask: are all the Commonwealth positions that are currently supported by CDEP going to be replaced by full-time positions?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I will answer your last question first, Senator. That is correct. All of the jobs will be replaced with full-time jobs, and we would encourage the other jurisdictions to provide the same leadership. Before I go towards giving you some comfort about those circumstances that I know you are very aware of, Senator, it is important to note that one of the reasons that there is not a bigger capacity in places like arts centres and all those sorts of things is that they are very comfortable where they are because they have this access. They do need to start thinking about their responsibility to move people forward. That is something that is clearly signalled and that we all need to think about.
Despite that, there are going to be a large number of Work for the Dole programs. So, in terms of having an increased capacity to continue to deliver a range of services, the Work for the Dole programs will be available and they will be vastly increased. It should also be noted that there is a net increase in the total services funding of $23.3 million. In terms of the employment programs, there will be a significant impact on ensuring people get that upskilling and a general support network within those communities. But we recognise the importance of the circumstances in the communities with regard to the CDEPs. We do need some sort of a Work for the Dole program, and the Work for the Dole programs will be vastly expanded.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—To follow up on that, is the $23.3 million for service funding meant for the STEP program and those sorts of funding programs? Thank you: I can see somebody nodding. My next question goes back to an issue that we identified during the arts inquiry—and I am using arts centres as an example because it is one that we have just been dealing with—which is that some arts centres, because of their area, the access to the artists and all sorts of things, are much more able to cope with moving down to a profitable outcome, and some—because of their areas et cetera—cannot. If I remember correctly without having the recommendations in front of me, we recommended, and certainly discussed, funding being made available to identify centres that are able to make that jump more quickly. Is that something that the government would consider to help identify organisations that need some extra support to be able to become profitable, to be self-supporting and to do exactly what you have been talking about?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—You have basically encapsulated in your question exactly what we are doing. There are a number of organisations that may be on the cusp of becoming profitable. We want to ensure that those supported businesses become real businesses. When I say ‘real businesses’ I mean that they employ people on real wages. There is an expectation that the employee will be able to supply a whole suite of products, like reliability, certainty of outcome and productivity around those things that I know they will have to supply to be in a real business. So the whole nature of that relationship will have to change. But there are many businesses in Indigenous communities, particularly in the arts area, that are at that stage, and we are determined to ensure that they can move to being real businesses. Many people on CDEP have not actually been in training; they are just there or at work. So we will be providing structured training through the STEP program. And, as I have said, there will be an expansion of Work for the Dole.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—I am trying not to drag this out, and I thank you for your answers, Minister. I want to go back to the difference between the money that is coming out of CDEP and the money that is now going into income support. On my calculations, it is a difference of $30 million, and that is coming directly out of the pockets of people in the communities. To me, that seems like an awful lot of money. Is that really what is happening? How is the government making up the difference between income support for people and CDEP?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I understand that we have a transition payment. I think that is the best way to look at how we will provide for that gap. In getting some details with regard to the transition payment, I was informed that for a 12-month period we will be ensuring that the gap, or the difference, between what they would have got on CDEP and the training wage will be filled. So, effectively, there will not be a change for a 12-month period.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—I want to ask the minister: seeing as this is a national emergency that is being dealt with and that there is to be this massive restructuring of the opportunities available to people who do not have work, what is the reskilling regime to be for those people? Work for the Dole has the connotation of taking people to do work that does not involve reskilling. That would be a lost opportunity because a lot of these people will be young and facing a lifetime ahead. They have lost opportunities through the education system up to now. What is the emergency opportunity being given to all people who are being taken off the CDEP to be reskilled to go into a worthwhile job that actually capitalises on their potential?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I think we all need to recognise that opportunities do exist in communities at the moment. We have identified a whole suite of jobs as part of this process and said: ‘This is a job here. This is needed. Why don’t we have someone here?’ There are opportunities in communities. We have identified some 3,000 job positions that are required. As I mentioned earlier, we have a net increase in the total services funding for Job Network providers of some $23.3 million for 2007-08. The Work for the Dole program is not simply about working for the dole; there are circumstances around that—particularly on-the-job training opportunities, competency based learning opportunities and preparation to understand the requirements of the workplace. Work for the Dole is not just leaning on a shovel and tapping your foot. If it is structured and supervised, it can be a very positive time that prepares people for the workplace in a whole range of ways. It might be on occupational health and safety or language. There are a whole range of ways in which people can be prepared for the workplace. There are jobs available in communities and we have a suite of funding deliverables and training initiatives that we have put in place to ensure that we can put people into those jobs.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—I think the bulk of people will not want to move, but there may be some who want to take up the opportunity of lucrative vacancies that are available, for example, in Western Australia. Components of this legislation are about the Northern Territory. Other components, such as household surveillance and the draconian coercive powers of the Australian Crime Commission, intrude into Aboriginal communities right across Australia—from Tasmania to Broome—so the government should not be too precious about that. There are estimates of 5,000 to 10,000 people being taken off CDEP and put elsewhere. The point is that that is a one-size-fits-all move. The government is saying, ‘We are going to make a big move on that.’ And so the government has a responsibility to make sure that people move to something better, more productive and—I would say—more lucrative for the work that they produce as a result of it. The CDEP move has the hallmarks of being punitive. It ought not to be.

I put a few questions on notice and got some very short answers. My understanding is that at the moment a decision has not been made by the government on exactly how the income support regime is going to work. I asked whether or not there was going to be a voucher system and you still had not worked out the answer, although I think that one of the answers I got said that the community store would have a voucher system.

In terms of mobility, we are looking at a suite of issues. We are speaking with the finance sector and with the retail sector, and, with the assistance of Mr Corbett and others who have a great deal of expertise in this area, we are formulating processes so that people will have access that reflects the mobility of people on the program.

When do you envisage it happening, and what level of consultation will be carried out to ensure that the system is actually going to work? There is evidence from overseas that it has not worked. I am aware that it took the Tangentyere Council in Alice Springs quite a while to get the Centrepay system that they currently operate there to work.

The questions I was asking you before were dealing specifically with the Northern Territory. Now I want to explore how it is going to roll out across the rest of Australia. Is it anticipated that, because it is obviously different in the rest of Australia, you would have a relationship with some major retail stores to facilitate the voucher system or the process?

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—Obviously, the reason I am asking this is that this is a very significant change to our welfare system in Australia. I have certainly been presented with information that indicates that there is no information to prove that these types of programs are successful. I have had great doubt expressed to me about, for example, the provisions as they relate to school attendance. I have seen some compelling evidence that shows that this is a fairly blunt instrument to encourage kids to go to school, for a variety of reasons. I am surprised, therefore, that you cannot yet tell us how this system is going to operate and how you are going to make sure it is refined enough, because it is a fairly blunt instrument, to achieve your ends. I have been told that there is little evidence to suggest that making school attendance a condition of receipt of income support has improved school attendance. In fact, as I understand it, the trial that was done in Halls Creek was not particularly successful. We are very concerned that these are blunt instruments that are not going to be successful. To my mind there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that they are going to achieve their aims, and there is a gross lack of detail about how these are going to operate. You can appreciate that there are a lot of people out there that are extremely concerned about how these systems are going to operate and concerned that they will have a negative impact in many of the communities. I went through some of those impacts yesterday when I went through the impact of the special measures and what HREOC was saying. You will be aware, Senator, that many of the social justice and welfare organisations in this country are very concerned about this program—I think, quite rightly—and are asking a whole lot of questions about how it is going to be implemented, what your benchmarks are and where the evidence is to say this is going to work.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1

From anecdotal evidence in some of the answers to questions I asked earlier, I know that they are not accessing that appeals process for a variety of reasons. Given that there is a such a significant increase under Welfare to Work of the number of Aboriginal people being breached, this is a really important point. If people cannot appeal when they have been breached, that has a very serious, detrimental impact on them, their families and their community. That is why I am being so particular about trying to find out about this. The way I read it is that, if you are under an income management regime, I cannot see why you are not breached.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—I would like to take the opportunity here, because there is not one elsewhere, to ask the minister about a report by Ashleigh Wilson and Patricia Karvelas in today’s Australian which says that:
... 850 indigenous children have received health checks across—
20 communities in—
the Northern Territory in the first phase of the Howard Government’s intervention in Aboriginal communities.
The operational commander of the taskforce, Major General David Chalmers, revealed yesterday that the checks had uncovered a range of medical concerns, including high levels of dental problems and skin, ear, nose and throat infections.
But Major General Chalmers said he was not aware of health workers notifying authorities of any cases of child sexual assault.
No allegations of abuse have been passed to Territory police since the intervention began.
When Mr Brough announced this national emergency, it was on the basis of the threat to children. That is a real threat and the figures used in this debate point to that. I quote from his press release of 21 June 2007:
The emergency measures to protect children being announced today are a first step that will provide immediate mitigation and stabilising impacts in communities that will be prescribed ... The measures include:
…            …            …
Introducing compulsory health checks for all Aboriginal children to identify and treat health problems and any effects of abuse.
Not discounting the devastating impact of child abuse in all communities in Australia—it happens in Canberra, in Sydney and in the Northern Territory—wasn’t the minister, on a racial basis, making a point of child abuse, which he overdid, to facilitate the argument for his intervention? As a result, the whole Indigenous community in Australia has suffered. He said that the point here was to have compulsory health checks. These were held up as an immediate need. We had pictures of doctors with stethoscopes going to the Northern Territory to check children ‘to identify any effects of abuse’—to quote the minister. And the first 850 checks have found zero effects of abuse.
Having been a doctor myself, I understand that, if it does not turn up in the history, you are unlikely to find the abuse, because you are not going to look for it. But on the day this announcement was made I also made it clear that it would be a breach of medical ethics and of the law to compulsorily examine children—those were the terms being used—for sexual abuse. Has the minister had time to review the overstatement and the abuse of Indigenous people right across the country that came out of those statements to proceed with this measure that the government wanted to proceed with, and all the things we have been talking about in this parliament going ahead anyway because the government has got the numbers to do it?
I ask the minister: didn’t his colleague Mal Brough make a very unfortunate mistake in the up-front assertion that there was an urgent need for compulsory health checks of all Aboriginal children—not others, but Aboriginal children—to identify any effects of sexual abuse? In fact, those checks have not discovered sexual abuse. Other means, like policing, are required to discover that. What appalled me about this process was the language used and the implications in the language used to brand Indigenous Australians in this way. I think it was reprehensible and regrettable. It was not needed. The government has the outcome.
The point here was that for the first time the Commonwealth moved to put an enormous amount of money compared to past times—not enough yet—into giving the health services, the education facilities, the community services and the upgrading of housing that are required to help Indigenous people to overcome the enormous disadvantage of neglect by governments at territory, state and federal level over decades. We agree with the government putting the resources at last where they are needed.
What I disagreed with from the outset was Minister Brough using the matter of sexual abuse, which has to be attacked wherever it is—in non-Indigenous or Indigenous communities. I give those figures again of 34,000 reportable cases of child abuse in the last year for which there are statistics, some 6,000 relating to Indigenous communities. That is a disproportionate amount, but nevertheless we are in the situation where the laws here are going to allow the invasion of people’s homes and the surveillance of Indigenous people but not of white people. Sexual abuse of children, wherever it occurs, has the same destructive impact on people’s lives. I think it was enormously unfortunate that Mr Brough and the Prime Minister used that one measurement of distress in Indigenous communities to try and win over the political support that was required for the measures that are going through this parliament today—regrettable and unnecessary. A real concern for Indigenous Australians would not have allowed it to be pitched that way.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—There are a couple of indicators that I always see with kids: it is what the parents reckon. Just for the record, Senator, the parents have welcomed these checks.
—I welcome them.
—I have not read the Australian this morning. It is terrific to see—if the indications of the health checks are as you say—that perhaps things are not as bad as the Little children are sacred report indicated. We would all hope that is the case, though I suspect it is not. Senator Brown, you are a doctor and I am not, so again you may be across the indicators of neglect and abuse. This is a necessary process to have a benchmark for the health of young Australians. The parents have welcomed that. Australia welcomes that. The suite of initiatives that this government is providing through these provisions is going to make the lives of Australians in those communities much better. Just living under the veil of safety; feeling happy, safe and comfortable in your own home; and actually having a home that you do not have to share with so many people—the infrastructure issues—are all very positive aspects that are supported by all Australians.
I do not want to get into a bunfight with you about your philosophies. We accept you have made it very clear that you accept we should be doing most of the things we are doing, except in this place every amendment you have collapses and scuttles the bills completely. I have a difficulty and I am sure Australia has a difficulty in understanding how you can stand in this place and say: ‘Senator Scullion, I support everything this government is doing. We think they’re good things. We think they’re overdue. But every amendment we put forward completely scuttles everything, with the exception of the alcohol restriction and a couple of other minor areas.’ Effectively, the provisions that you seek to wipe from this bill wipe out any real impact. I have a bit of cynicism, Senator, that you are fair dinkum about this. Any glance at or scrutiny of the amendments you have put forward shows your attempts to scuttle the bill. I find that a little inconsistent.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—You are newer in this place than I am, Senator Scullion. You have to understand that when a sledgehammer is brought in you have a choice of going with it or going against it. This is sledgehammer legislation but there are good components to it. We are making it very clear that long before you came to this place we supported and were calling for the services that should be given to Indigenous Australians—for example, the half a billion dollars a year that is required to help close that 17-year gap in life expectancy that advantages non-Indigenous Australians over Indigenous Australians. To close that longevity gap would cost approximately half a billion dollars according the AMA, and there is a move in that direction but it is not in this legislation.
Let me go back to the point I was making. We absolutely support children having medical checkups as part of that program. As the task force commander, Major General Chalmers, revealed yesterday, the checks have uncovered a range of medical concerns including high levels of dental problems and skin, ear, nose and throat infections. It is long past time that the medical services that would fix those illnesses were available in these communities—for example, there are extraordinary statistics in relation to the loss of hearing because of ear infections in Indigenous communities. They largely come out of the failure to provide adequate medical advice—primary health care—and then treatment when the problems arise.
We have heard about the failure to provide adequate education facilities. There are thousands more places needed at schools if there are going to be the same attendance figures at these schools that we have elsewhere. But the point I am making here is that it would have been much better for the honourable Minister Brough to announce that he was going in to attack the dreadful statistics for Indigenous Australians dying young, not just in the Northern Territory but right across this country. You only have to look at the statistics in Redfern to see an example of that, fantastic though the medical services provided by the Indigenous community there are. Minister Brough did not use those statistics; he chose to pick on the equally appalling statistics of child sexual abuse—and so did the Prime Minister—as a fulcrum for this move.
All I am saying, because it needs to be put on the record, is that that was an extraordinarily damaging way to go about it. It was advantageous to the government but devastating for Indigenous communities. It was surely a political advantage for the government but a very great disadvantage for Indigenous Australians, who have enough to put up with in terms of the way in which they are publicly presented. I am glad that the medical interventions occurred, and I am glad that the high levels of health problems suffered by Indigenous children have been uncovered and will be fixed up. That is how it should have been decades ago, but now at last it is happening because the money and resources are being put in there. We did not need calumny about the Indigenous people to get this action going; that is my point. We cannot undo that now, but thinking about how Indigenous people are portrayed and their need for pride in self—the same need that all of us have—would have been a better way to go, from the outset. There is good coming out of this. I agree with Senator Scullion about that, and I congratulate the government for that, but it was most unfortunate the way that Minister Brough went about it and I hope he does not do that again.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-16,"—I will briefly respond. I thank you for acknowledging that this is a good program and for recognising the work that the government is doing. I recognise that you also have problems with it. Senator Brown, this government and Minister Brough responded very responsibly in the discussions about why they were moving into the communities. They were responding to an independent report that indicated that there was widespread sexual abuse of children in the Northern Territory—I respect the issues that you have been talking about—and that is why it was declared a national emergency and we moved on it. Nobody is in disagreement about the circumstances that are there. As I said, I do not want to drag this matter on but I do not think I can leave the record unclarified. This was a response to sexual abuse of our most vulnerable First Australians. I am very proud of the government’s intervention in this matter.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—It is harrowingly frustrating, given the fact that Indigenous Australians are dying 17 years younger than all other Australians due to a lack of medical care and facilities, proper housing and good education, that that was not seen as a national emergency a decade ago and that it took one of a number of reports on the plight of Indigenous children to trigger this. Mind you, the recommendations of the report on the plight of the children have been ignored in this process—the one on consultation with Indigenous people in particular—and too much of a political point has been made of the distress. We have yet to see how the government is going to handle that particular problem. Let me reiterate this: there are no facilities—zip—in Northern Territory jails, which currently house 900 people, a number of them for sexual offences, to help people overcome the problems which have put them into those jails. I hope the government is looking at that very difficult end of the process. Locking people up without helping them to take a different path into the future is a very wasteful exercise for society as a whole.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-08-16,"—In relation to the Water Bill 2007 and the Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007, the evidence is very clear that the health of our rivers is deteriorating. This is particular so for the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin. There is also an acceptance that the water in the basin has been overallocated, and most of us accept that climate change is real and that we will need to get used to having even less water in our rivers. That is why federal Labor has consistently supported greater national leadership in water policy and water reform. It is for that reason that Labor supports the Water Bill 2007 and the Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007. The bills are not perfect—even the Prime Minister recognises that—but they are a step in the right direction. Labor believes that, by establishing a sustainable cap on water diversions from the basin, the bills are a step towards fixing some of the Murray-Darling Basin’s long-term problems. They give the Commonwealth greater control over water planning for the basin and should help deliver greater water security. The bills put in place a planning process to manage the basin and restore its health. It is only by doing that that we will secure the ongoing prosperity of the communities that rely on the system.
The Water Bill will help set up some of the structures to fix some of the basin’s long-term problems. Under the bill, the Commonwealth will establish a new expert based Murray-Darling Basin Authority to develop and oversee implementation of a basin plan for water management. However, Labor is concerned that having both a Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission will mean that the basin’s management and strategy will be confused. The layers of bureaucracy, coupled with a lack of information about actual program funding for the National Plan for Water Security, strongly suggests that a lot of the planning of this bill is being done on the run. Ending up with two Murray-Darling Basin agencies—the commission and the authority—will confuse decision making, and this should be sorted out. In broad terms, the plan will include a new sustainable cap on extractions of surface and groundwater in the basin, a salinity and water quality plan, an environmental watering plan and trading rules. But we await the details on all of this. The bill sets out processes for accrediting the catchment-level water plans prepared by basin states under their existing legislation to ensure the outcomes of the basin plan are achieved.
Labor are concerned that the separation of salinity from other environmental concerns may complicate management of the basin on a catchment basis. We must improve water security and planning while at the same time help water users adapt to having less water and to climate change. Of course it is possible that the long-term average sustainable water diversion limit for the water resource plan, otherwise known as the cap, will have to be reduced. That means there will be compulsory water entitlement reductions under clause 77 of the bill. But it is an open question as to how this will, in reality, be different from compulsory acquisition. Under clause 77 of the bill, when that cap is reduced it appears that the water entitlement holder may receive compensation for that reduction. Clause 77 sets out the way in which the liability for that compensation will be distributed. I note that clause 255 of the legislation does not authorise the compulsory acquisition of water entitlements. However, clause 77 sets up a mechanism for paying out irrigators for a legislated reduction in their water entitlement. I do not think this is a word game—and we will see how this works in practice, of course—but it is certainly arguable that forced acquisition of entitlements when the cap is reduced is really a compulsory process for acquiring water. Of course, compensation under clause 77 offers much less compensation than compulsory acquisition does, so it will be interesting to see how the government handles that one. It is a good step forward that the bill establishes a Commonwealth environmental water holder to manage environmental outcomes from the new water holdings purchased by the Commonwealth under the new funding program of the national plan—and, through the Bureau of Meteorology, the level and quality of information on water will improve. This will help our understanding of and ability to manage water resources on a sustainable basis.
Labor are concerned that, because of the haste to develop and pass legislation in an election year, the Water Bill 2007 represents a second-best solution on national water reform. We are concerned that more bureaucracy is being created and that the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority will have a very confusing mandate and not much authority. The overlapping and unclear decision-making structures are a symptom of a rushed piece of legislation in an election year. Labor deplore the government’s failure to consult in good faith with state governments and other stakeholders over the final version of the bill and the related intergovernmental agreement. We understand that the legislation we have before us today is very different to the versions circulated over the last few months. A key element of the national plan remains for basin states and the ACT to sign an intergovernmental agreement committing them to refer powers for an eventual basin-wide management structure and work cooperatively to implement all aspects of the Commonwealth’s Water Bill. The development of the intergovernmental agreement is critical to the effectiveness of the basin plan and future water management in the basin. We are very concerned that the intergovernmental agreement was not provided to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill, and has not been given to state governments or any stakeholders in the basin. The yet-to-be-released intergovernmental agreement will govern federal and state relations, guide investment and ensure water plans function properly—although the department conceded that the document would not be legally enforceable.
It is important that the government publicly release and circulate the intergovernmental agreement, set out clearly what the risk-sharing arrangements with states will be and explain why the states should carry more risk than was agreed to with the Prime Minister in early July, and explain why the water needs for towns and cities in the basin and the other downstream consequences of water planning are not dealt with in the bill and whether they will be dealt with in the intergovernmental agreement. Labor are worried that the Prime Minister appeared to change the conditions for the IGA at the very last moment. We are concerned that, as a result, states may not sign up. As a commentator said on The Law Report on Tuesday night, we may end up with a ‘constitutional Afghanistan’ when this is all over. We truly hope not, but by rushing the bill and playing political games with the IGA that is a risk the government is taking. More broadly, Labor believe the water reform process must continue so that we can properly fix the overallocation of water licences in the Murray-Darling Basin. We have to ensure harmony between the environment and consumptive use, and help address the impact of drought and climate change on water supply.
I just want to step back for a minute from the details of the bill and put this debate in a broader context. Water is one of our most valuable natural resources, and the sustainable management of water is one of the most important challenges facing the nation today. It is a challenge that goes directly to the health and sustainability of our planet, to our everyday lives and to our economy. In many ways water is the lifeblood of the nation. It is universally accepted that where there is water there is life, and when the water dries up life itself often perishes. Indeed, when NASA looks for signs of life on the planets in our universe, they look for water.
One of the signs of a prosperous, growing, healthy community, society and economy is one where there is a secure and stable supply of water. But in recent years, with one of the longest droughts on record and the current and future impact of climate change, water supply and storage has been at great risk. We cannot allow sudden bursts of rain and floods to lull ourselves into a false sense of security. Make no mistake, the great global challenge of climate change is inexorably linked with the water crisis now affecting rural areas and our cities, suburbs and towns.
The greatest threat to the security of our water supplies comes from our changing climate: continuing drought, changing rainfall patterns, declining overall rainfall and reduced supplies in our catchments. That is why it is so disappointing that the good work done at COAG in the early nineties was not followed through by the Howard government. Valuable time to help Australia adapt has been lost. Diminished water supplies and restricted use of water impact on almost every aspect of our nation—on our farms and in our factories, in our homes and schools, on our environment and our community. In short, water is one of our most precious resources, but it is a resource that has become threatened—threatened now and increasingly so in the future—demanding new and urgent action. If we ignore this threat and fail to rise to this challenge, we will do so at our peril and risk our environment, our communities and our economy.
You cannot plan for the future if you do not have a plan for climate change—and you cannot begin to address our national water crisis without understanding the powerful driving force of climate change. Surprisingly, some in the government do not believe that climate change is anything to worry about. They dispute the science. They downplay the effects of the changing climate. Looking ahead, we are advised by the CSIRO that we face hotter and drier summers, the devastation of the Great Barrier Reef, the loss of our snowfields, increasing droughts, less water for our cities and more bushfires. Australia needs to be ready for these changes, but the government’s inaction has left Australia unprepared for the dramatic impacts of climate change.
The bill before the Senate is a step in the right direction, and in some ways will help Australia to better plan and manage our water resources. It will help Australia adapt. But why has it taken 13 years for this legislation to come forward? The COAG meeting of February 1994 laid out a framework for national water reform. It is very disappointing that it has taken an election year to get the Prime Minister’s attention on this matter. Dealing with the water crisis is integral to dealing with the climate crisis. Taking action based on the science and showing leadership is what is needed, not ignoring the state of the Murray for 13 years. And blaming the states is simply not good enough. The blame game is a game for losers. Leadership is required, but it has been in short supply on water and indeed on climate change for many years.
Across Australia, our families, our farmers and our businesses are recognising the effects of climate change on their water supplies. Water restrictions are no longer uncommon; farmers and businesses are starting to realise the need to be more energy and water efficient—indeed, some have taken the challenge up well before this government. Neither water nor climate change are simply environmental challenges.
As with climate change, the water crisis is a fundamental economic challenge. The history of our economic development has been closely linked to water, as most of our cities and towns are located where water could be sourced for personal and economic use. Water is critical to the industries that generate more than half of Australia’s GDP and over 80 per cent of our exports, including our farms and agricultural industries, the mining industry and the manufacturing industry. But the environmental and economic challenges posed by water shortages are not isolated; they are linked. For example, the Murray-Darling Basin provides a good example as to how the shortages of water can have a significant economic impact, as the production of rice, cotton, wheat and cattle account for around 40 per cent of the nation’s agricultural output.
While it is right for the government to focus efforts on finding a solution for the Murray-Darling Basin, we cannot ignore the other 18 million Australians who live outside the basin. The water crisis affects our cities, towns and suburbs just as much. Coming from a part of the country that is well endowed with water, I can sympathise with those that come from more challenged parts of the country, such as the state of South Australia. There are the farmers and agricultural producers who rely on water for their livelihoods; businesses who use a lot of water like restaurants and laundromats; the mining and manufacturing sectors, who use water at various stages of production; our hospitals, universities and research institutions, which are also large water users; families who want to water their garden, wash their car and fill up their swimming pools—it is about lifestyle; and our kids who want to swim in local pools and play on the local sporting fields and are seeing them drying out and their sport cancelled on weekends in some parts of the country.
Our national government can no longer afford to ignore this challenge facing our regional towns and major cities. Labor believes that there is an important role for the federal government in transforming the way we secure our future water supplies and use our water more efficiently. That applies to water use in the Murray-Darling Basin and right across Australia. Labor does not believe that finding solutions to the water crisis should be simply left to the states or local government to tackle alone; it requires all levels of government to work together. Labor supports this bill as a step forward, and we are putting down a very clear marker that more work needs to be done.
—On behalf of Senator Wong, I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
notes that modern national water reform began with the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 and the historic Council of Australian Governments agreement on water reform in 1994 led by the Keating Labor government;
regrets that, despite clear warning signals about the health of the river system, it has taken 13 more years to see the next stage of Commonwealth action to address the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin;
is concerned that the legislation before the Senate represents a second best solution on national water reform;
deplores the Government’s failure to consult in good faith with state governments and other stakeholders over the Water Bill 2007 and the related intergovernmental agreement;
believes the water reform process must continue so we properly fix the over-allocation of water licences in the Murray-Darling Basin, ensure harmony between the environment and consumptive use, and help address the impact of drought and climate change on water supply;
notes that:
climate change will have a significant impact on water supply generally and the health of the Murray-Darling Basin in particular,

a cooperative and constructive approach with state governments to assist water reform and investment in urban and rural water infrastructure,
full implementation of the national water initiative principles agreed to in 2004,
fixing of the over-allocation of water licences once and for all, and the establishment of coherent, streamlined rules which ensure the problem of over-allocation never recurs,
recognition that economic instruments, including water trading, are necessary to address the fact that water has been over-allocated, undervalued and misdirected,
proper consultation with key stakeholders in the Murray‑Darling Basin, including all water users, farmers, water scientists, environment groups and the broader community to ensure the adoption and consistent use of efficient agricultural practices,
returning sufficient water to the rivers in the Murray‑Darling Basin to ensure the long-term health of all rivers, wetlands and all connected groundwater systems in the Basin and, as a result, ensure the health of the communities and businesses that rely on the health of those rivers, and
measures to ensure industrial and urban water users adapt to maximise water efficiency”.
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will provide an important report in late 2007 on the hydrology of the Basin and what the sustainable extraction levels are for the Basin, and

a cooperative and constructive approach with state governments to assist water reform and investment in urban and rural water infrastructure,

the following is needed for national water reform:

a cooperative and constructive approach with state governments to assist water reform and investment in urban and rural water infrastructure,

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-16,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I indicate that, whilst we have a range of concerns with this legislation, on balance it does limp things forward somewhat and therefore we will not be opposing it. Politics has been the key reason why the Murray-Darling Basin has got into such a terrible mess. Unfortunately, the process that has been followed to get to this point at the federal level has also involved a lot of politics, and that is one of the reasons why it is still far from perfect. That is politics across the board. None of us is immune from all of that, but it is a point that still needs to be made.
The point also needs to be made that the process for consultation with regard to the Water Bill 2007 was once again very poor, with the legislation itself only appearing last week and the holding of yet another one-day, last-minute, rushed Senate committee hearing. I can recall being part of the committee meeting to determine who the witnesses might be for a hearing that was to be held less than 24 hours later, with the apparent assumption that people could actually pull together adequate submissions in less than 24 hours. That sort of thing is ludicrous, and the fact that we are doing it so often that people are actually starting to think it is satisfactory is becoming a real worry.
But that is an individual example of a wider problem. There has obviously been engagement, particularly between the Commonwealth and state governments, and landholders to a certain extent, over the course of this year, but the point still needs to be made about the specifics of legislation. It is one thing to talk through all the issues; it is another to then properly examine the actual legislation when it appears. There has not been opportunity to do that. The one-day, totally rushed Senate committee hearing of last Friday happened to occur on exactly the same day as the one-day, totally rushed, completely inadequate Senate committee hearing into the Northern Territory emergency response legislation. Having both those hearings on the same time made it completely impossible for me, someone who has carriage of both areas, to participate in even that limited, inadequate one-day hearing.
Nonetheless, I was able to read the submissions, such as they were and rushed though they were, and the transcript from the hearing. The Democrats agree with a range of concerns that were expressed, particularly those put forward by environmental organisations and the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists. The scientific basis of those concerns should be particularly acknowledged. As I said, there is a lot of politics in this at the state and federal levels and a lot of vested interests among people who rely on the water, particularly producers but also communities more broadly. I say vested interest not in a nasty sense but as a simple statement of fact—people do have a vested interest in maintaining some access to the water, and naturally that can influence their perspective. That makes the view of scientists all the more important. They, as much as anybody and more so than most, are as objective and evidence based as possible.
Their views were that, whilst this legislation has the potential to move things forward, it still has some significant problems and things could certainly be done better. Some of that is due to the fact that agreement has not been reached with all of the state governments, Victoria in particular. I am not passing judgement on who was right and who was wrong in that one. It was a bit hard to tell, frankly, from the information received at the Senate inquiry or from the public arena. To some extent it really does not matter; the Senate has to deal with the legislation before it. But there is no doubt that if we could get a more clear-cut, cooperative approach across all states it would help move things forward.
Another key concern that the Democrats have is that, despite the atmosphere of urgency that has been placed around this legislation—we have to push it through this week after an inadequate Senate committee hearing—there is not actually a lot of urgency within the legislation itself. There is a very long lead time before a lot of the significant shifts in water consumption will be able to be made, which is a concern, along with what appears to be a capacity for too much rubberiness in terms of targets. On top that is the inevitable reality that you still have quite a mess. We will have the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority; we will still have the old Murray-Darling Basin Commission; state governments and the federal government will still have some responsibility. I know the federal government would wish otherwise, but that is what we are faced with. It really does need to be sorted out.
For me the big question mark with this legislation was whether passing it now would at least move things forward towards sorting this situation out. What can sometimes happen is people put so much effort into getting something in place that they then stop and all further improvements halt there, and you lose the momentum to continue towards the full reform that needs to happen. I think on balance there has been so much difficulty in getting movement in this area over so long a period that even this type of move forward is such that the opportunity should be taken.
Having said that, it would have been appropriate to have had a few extra weeks to properly examine the legislation and allow others to do so and to provide their views and then have the Senate consider it in September. But politics once again intervened and that has not happened.
Another very significant flaw in the legislation is that it does not provide for people to use legal processes to ensure the requirements of the legislation are enforced. In an area that is so politicised, that is a real problem. But there are some positives in the legislation. The linkage and use of powers relating to the protection of Ramsar wetlands and biodiversity protection is a step forward.
I think the legislation could have been strengthened, and I know Senator Siewert has some amendments that seek to do that. In particular, I think it could have been further integrated with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which does provide strong and very clear powers at the federal level. Those powers are not used often enough, I might say, but they are certainly there, and to link them more clearly would have been desirable. That includes, as I said, provision for individuals or affected people to have standing, as they do under the federal environment laws. It is only because of those standing provisions in the federal environment act, on a number occasions, that enforcement and proper assessment has occurred. I think that provision really should be in this legislation as well.
There are a range of other aspects to the legislation. As I said, it is certainly an imperfect beast. But, on balance, whilst we still need as the Senate chamber to try and improve it using the opportunity we have before us today, it is not so flawed that the Democrats will stand in the way of it. But we certainly signal that there is still a lot of improvement that needs to happen, and I think that the federal government would accept, at least up to a point, that this needs to be only a first step and that we need to push on with further momentum after this.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-08-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Labor has consistently supported national leadership in water policy and water reform…there is no doubt that what is required is effective legislation to ensure the restoration and protection of the Murray Darling Basin…
National water reform began with the COAG agreement in 1994 led by the Keating Labor Government, and the Murray Darling Basin Act 1993.
Sadly, the situation we are faced with today in many parts of Australia and in my home state of South Australia, with significant water restrictions in our cities and regional country towns, means even young children are concerned about the water crisis we face. There is no doubt about the critical condition of this most precious resource.
I have said previously that if there was a report card presented to the Howard Government, it would not be one that you would want to take home.
It would read: ‘Eleven years of inaction in the face of Australia’s greatest environmental challenge.’
Like many of my fellow Australians, I have long been aware of the escalating water crisis gripping our nation.
Everyone in this chamber now must accept that addressing such water issues as efficiency … allocation … quality … research and rights, is crucial and compelling.
Our rivers are overtaxed and because of their degeneration, indigenous animal and bird species and plants are facing extinction.
But while the Murray-Darling Basin becomes an even-more inhospitable host to unique flora and fauna … conversely introduced pests and weeds are thriving.
Almost 3 million people live within the Basin region, which generates approximately 40 per cent of the agriculture dollars earned in Australia.
The blight of climate change is only adding to our water woes … a fact that makes the Government’s unique and disturbing blend of indifference, indecision and infighting on this subject even more incomprehensible.
The situation is dire … we must work for change before even more irreparable damage is done.
The Commonwealth’s Water Bill 2007 is a step in the right direction … a step towards addressing some of the Murray-Darling Basin’s long-range problems.
At the one day public hearing of the Senate standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on this Bill, the South Australian Representatives, Mr Scott Ashby, Deputy Chief Executive, Departmental Affairs, Department of Premier and Cabinet and Mr Robert Freeman, Chief Executive Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation made it clear that South Australia supports a national approach to the management of the Murray-Darling Basin through an independent expert based authority.
However, concerns were raised that a number of elements important to South Australia were lost in this version of the bill including that:
It does not address the issue of critical human needs.
It does not include an end-of-basin flow target.
It does not include a deadline for the basin plan.
It does not include a No-net increase in cost provision for Basin states.
It does not include compulsory consultation.
South Australia’s position is clearly that as far as possible the Bill and associated IGA should reflect and reinstate the full package of reform principles as agreed by First Ministers in February 2007, and subsequently negotiated at senior officer level.
In his letter to the Prime Minister, South Australia’s Premier, Mike Rann highlighted the following as issues that the legislation and the IGA should enure:
The establishment of an independent, expert-based authority to prepare a Basin management plan, recommend allocation caps and undertake other functions previously agreed;
Eligibility qualifications of members of the Authority are reflected in legislation;
Any decision by the relevant Commonwealth Minister ever-rule the new Authority be tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament;
Preservation of South Australia’s existing entitlement flow of 1,850 GL per annum;
Basin States face no-net increase in costs under the new arrangements and agreed arrangements regarding compensation and liability are retained;
Land use planning decisions remain with state and local government authorities;
Commonwealth funding is directed on an objective and scientific basis to the areas of greatest need within the Basin;
All states are treated consistently in the implementation of the National Plan;
A review of the new arrangements in 2014
As an interim measure, until replaced by provisions of a Basin Plan approved by the relevant Commonwealth Minister, The IGA to provide for an average of 200 Gigalitres  per annum of river “health and maintenance” flows to be delivered by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder at the mouth of the River Murray.
As an interim measure, until such time as this requirement can be addressed appropriately through the Basin Plan, the Commonwealth to make alternative arrangements for the emergency provision of water to meet critical human needs, which would be reflected in the IGA.
The proposed Bill to set a deadline for the adoption of a Basin Plan by the Commonwealth Minister, not being later than two years after the commencement of the legislation.
Under the Bill before us, a new Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be established to develop and oversee the implementation of a water management plan.
As part of the plan, there will be a new cap on water withdrawals in the Basin … water trading rules … a water quality and salinity plan … and an environmental watering plan.
Other moves will include increasing the amount of water information available nationally, in partnership with the Bureau of Meteorology … regulating the Basin water market … and establishing processes for accrediting catchment-level water plans to make sure Basin Plan goals are achieved.
Our hope is that this Bill will provide a structure under which the Basin can be nursed back to good health.
Only then can we secure a prosperous future for the communities who rely on the river system.
Labor unequivocally supports the need for greater federal leadership in water policy … especially in cases where resources traverse state borders.
But our call for action in this area is not new. For decades we have called for, and backed, moves to improve water planning and resources.
Since the 1980s, Labor has spoken out about the need for national leadership on water.
And under the watch of the Keating Labor Government, true national water reform began with the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement and Bill of 1992, and the historic bi-partisan COAG Agreement of 1994.
There was no doubt Paul Keating understood the importance of this network of waterways. In December, 1992, he said:

‘‘The Murray-Darling is Australia’s greatest river system, a basic source of our wealth, a real and symbolic artery of the nation’s economic health, and a place where Australian legends were born.


‘‘Nowhere is the link between the Australian environment, the Australian economy and Australian culture better described.’’

Here we are 15 years later … and while warning signs on the health of our country’s main river system have been stark and clear for some time … only now is the current Government taking any action.
But while the proposition before us is worthy of encouragement into law … it is disappointing … and I’m disappointed to have to say, anything but watertight.
This recent legislation has been conceived in haste and out of expedience with a Federal election looming large.
Yes … the holes in this potentially lifesaving bucket are worrying to say the least…
The Howard Government has failed to consult in good faith with the stakeholders – including the states – over the final version of the Bill, which has been altered dramatically, and is disappointing in comparison to what it delivers…
The legislation also disappoints on the front of providing pertinent protections to my home state of South Australia …
Professor Mike Young, the Research Chair in Water Economics and Management at the University of Adelaide and member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, believes the Basin Plan’s goals list … as in Clause 20 … should be extended to carry ‘‘a requirement to consider the downstream consequences and ensure the water flows through the entire system’’.
As well as an apparent failure in the field of environmental flows … there’s the mysterious Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) associated with the Bill.
The Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (ECITA) … to which the Bill was referred … was not given a copy of the agreement.
In fact it has not yet been released …the States have not received a copy of the agreement,  despite the fact that the documented intended function of the IGA will be to steer water-based federal and state relations, make sure water plans work well, and to guide investment in the Murray-Darling system.
There are many questions raised by the reviewed Bill … as noted by ECITA committee members, including myself.
Why do we have both a Murray Darling Basin Authority, and a Murray Darling Basin Commission?
How will compulsory water entitlement reductions work under section 77 … which deals with payments to water access entitlement holders … and how are they different to compulsory acquisition?
When will the Government circulate the all-important Inter-Governmental Agreement?
What will the risk-sharing arrangements be with the states and why should the states carry more risk than was agreed to with the Prime Minister in early July?
Why aren’t the water needs for towns and cities in the Basin and the other down-stream consequences of water planning dealt with in the Bill?
Surprisingly people from many vantage points have expressed disquiet about legislation that is aimed in the right direction, is sorely deficient in detail…and lands slightly off target…
These shortcomings have brought together farmers and environment groups, irrigators and academics, Indigenous community representatives and governments.
For the sake of the Murray-Darling Basin…for the people who rely on it for their living and those who rely on it simply for their life sustaining water, Labor will not stand in the way of the passage of this legislation…
But that doesn’t mean that we don’t believe more needs to be done. We have not just sat idly back, we have made plans of our own.
In December 2006, Labor’s Shadow water minister Anthony Albanese released the discussion paper Protecting our precious natural environment and water supplies.
The basis of that paper … and the heart of Labor’s attitude to the water crisis … was to focus ‘‘natural resource programs on national priorities, streamline decision making and make sure that it is water that flows… rather than red tape’’.
While the Government seems to be overflowing with cynics and sceptics, Labor’s benches are full of believers.
We believe strategies dealing with climate change and with water are inextricably linked.
We believe the nation’s water resources need and deserve more than a spare-change commitment by the Government.
We believe it is essential to work cooperatively with the states and all interest groups to develop and instigate the plans and policies necessary for long-term solutions to the Murray-Darling Basin crisis.
In addition, Labor Senators agree that what is required for ongoing national water reform is:
A cooperative and constructive approach with state governments to assist water reform and investment in urban and rural water infrastructure;
The full implementation of the National Water Initiative principles agreed to in 2004:
Fixing of the over-allocation of water licences and establishing coherent, streamlined rules which ensure the problem of over allocation never recurs:
Recognition that economic instruments including water trading are necessary to address the fact that water has been over-allocated, under-valued and misdirected;
Proper consultation with key stakeholders in the Murray Darling Basin, including all water users, farmers, water scientists, environment groups and the broader community to ensure the adoption and consistent use of efficient agricultural practices:
Returning the sufficient water to the rivers in the Murray Darling Basin to ensure the long term health of all rivers, wetlands and all connected groundwater systems in the basin and as a result, ensure the health of the communities and businesses that rely on the health of those rivers and
Measures to ensure industrial and urban water users adapt to maximise water efficiency.
We believe meaningful change is worth the hard work it takes.
We believe Australia’s future… the future of children and our livelihood and the survival of some of our most treasured and fragile natural wonders … depends on it.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-08-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Labor supports the need for greater Commonwealth leadership in water policy and has consistently called on the Government for action. Consequently, we will support this Bill as a step in the right direction.  However, Labor has concerns that this Bill does not go far enough to ensure security of water supplies for the people and businesses that rely on the Murray Darling Basin.
The Murray Darling Basin occupies fourteen per cent of Australia’s total area and produces some 40% of the value of our agriculture. Thousands of households and businesses rely on flows from the Basin. Its wetlands provide habitats for many threatened animal and plant species. If these wetlands dried up, some of those species would become extinct. For all of these reasons and more, we need to implement changes that will ensure the continuing good health of the Basin and the rivers that flow through it.
The health of Australia’s rivers has deteriorated over the last one hundred years due to a number of factors, ranging from over allocation of water for horticulture to planting of commercial and domestic flora that requires more water than native varieties. Rural research has gone a long way towards improving the efficiency of irrigation, yet a proportion of inefficient systems such as unlined channels on sandy soils remain and these contribute to inefficient use of  the Murray and other water courses in the Basin that are used for irrigation.
Other significant influences on river health have been:
Our growing population which has increased our water extractions by 500% since the 1920s;
The manipulation and diversion of flows, largely for irrigation, leading to a severe impact on the natural environmental flow.   According to CSIRO, the mean annual discharge from the Murray Mouth for the last ten years has been about 2,700 gigalitres, whereas without diversions the average annual figure would be about 12,000 gigalitres;
Salinity, pests and weeds which affect the health of major rivers in the MDB including the invasion of carp which have caused the decline of native fish species; and
Climate change.
The climate change issue deserves special attention. As we have already begun to see, when the Earth’s temperature increases at an accelerated rate, our  weather conditions become unpredictable and severe. 
The impact includes both devastating floods and long droughts. Numerous reports have been released identifying climate change as a genuine threat to the Murray-Darling Basin’s health, but the Government has taken over ten years to even consider responding to the threat. We need a comprehensive climate change adaptation plan for the Basin so that it can continue to provide for our country through drier and hotter climates.
According to an expert review panel appointed in 2001, the Murray River needs 1,500 gigalitres more water per year to be a healthy, effective river. But we have only seen an approval to purchase 20 gigalitres for return to the Murray. This is evidence that once again, the Government does not see the environment as a priority.
Labor has a much better record on water and on climate change  than the current Government. Before the election of the Howard Government, the Labor Governments were dealing with the issue of water, particularly in regards to the Murray Darling Basin. In 1987 Labor created the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement in a partnership between governments and the community. In 1993 a new agreement was reached and legislation was passed in relation to management of the Murray-Darling Basin. In 1996, Queensland became involved and took part in all discussions.
It was also Labor that negotiated the first national drought policy, which we did in 1992. Unfortunately this good work was not carried on or built upon, and 11 years after the election of the current Government we are discussing a water bill for the first time during the term of this Government.
Not only has the Government not introduced water legislation, but in the 2003 budget it cut funding to water initiatives. Though this should hardly be surprising, remembering we are dealing with a Government that refused to acknowledge climate change existed until it was swayed by public opinion. We are, after all,  talking about a Government which will still not  ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
As a representative of South Australia, the state that is the driest and that is home to  the mouth of the Murray River, I feel very strongly about the importance of this Bill.  Every South Australian has an affection for the Murray. It is part of our heritage, integral to our economy and a much visited holiday destination. Tell any South Australian that you are “going up the River” for the long weekend and they will know exactly what you mean and where you are going.
There are also many South Australians who live in the Riverland where fruit trees, in particular citrus, are grown as well as grape growing and winemaking. We are fortunate to have the benefits of the Murray Mouth, the Lower Lakes and the Coorong in our wonderful state. We are not as fortunate when it comes to rainfall.
The South Australian Labor Government has attempted to manage current water resources wisely, but is facing an uphill struggle as rainfall is increasingly sparse and unpredictable. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, “in the Mt Lofty Ranges catchment areas of South Australia’s main reservoirs, the winter of 2006 was the driest on record, and the first two months of spring were the driest since 1914.”
In South Australia, despite having average rainfalls this year, inflows into rivers are still well below the long term average. July inflows, for example, were 450 gigalitres compared to the long term July average of 1190 gigalitres. Catchments take a long time to recover after severe shortfalls of rain over a period of time. Another reason that water management should have been dealt with consistently by this Government instead of by the  legislation-by-press-release method we saw with this Bill, and which seems to be the policy setting method preferred by the Prime Minister when he knows that public opinion is turning against the Government
Obviously no Government can directly control rainfall, but Governments can decrease and, hopefully, stop the deterioration of our rivers. To ensure all Australians have access to water, it is crucial that we work to save not only the Murray Darling Basin, but all of our water systems.
The South Australian Labor Government supports a national approach to the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, but expressed significant concerns in its submission to the Senate Enquiry to this  Bill. The South Australian Government  noted the Bill  does not implement all of the National Plan for Water Security.
Of considerable concern is the open-ended adoption date for the Basin Plan. The plan places limits on water extractions to provide for long-term sustainability. The SA Government believes “the Water Bill 2007 should set a deadline for adoption of the Plan of two years after the legislation takes effect”. This is necessary because without the Basin Plan in place, nothing will change.
The South Australian Labor Government also stated the Water Bill 2007 in its current form does not include mandatory provisions for meeting critical human water needs. Without this provision, we won’t be able to supply a sufficient amount of water during shortages to towns and cities throughout SA, Victoria and NSW which rely on the river.
Another matter raised by the South Australian Government is the changes to the institutional arrangements. It is concerned that states will have increased responsibilities without being provided with the necessary level of consultation. The South Australian Government believes that it will be critical that states are appropriately consulted regarding membership of the newly created Murray Darling Basin Authority and key legislative changes.
There is also an urgent need for better research and data to enable the nation to plan properly for water security. The  February 2006 CSIRO paper “Water for a Healthy Country : The Shared Water Resource of the Murray Darling Basin” , identified, among other things the need to:
Establish water requirements for environmental needs (Living Murray)
Develop hydrology models to consider ecosystem health consequences of changing flow regimes
Quantify the effects which improved irrigation practices have on the volume of return flow to river systems
Urgent clarification of such parameters will lead to appropriate allocation of funding to restore the health of the Murray Darling Basin. It will also  assist with the framing of regulations and practices to ensure there is sensible use of water resources for agricultural production, clean water supplies, and environmental protection.
Lastly, something that I seem to be mentioning every time I speak on a Bill is the lack of detail provided in the legislation. Unfortunately, this Bill is no exception. In fact, key stakeholders were not even provided with a copy of the legislation before its tabling last week.
I note the additional comments of the Labor Senators who participated in the Senate Enquiry into this Bill with regard to the refusal of the Prime Minister to provide the proposed Intergovernmental Agreement to the Committee to assist its deliberations.
A Bill of such high national importance needs detail, it needs proper examination and it needs to be written with adequate consultation. Rushing the Bill through both houses, allowing people little over a day to make a submission to the  Senate Committee does not allow for these things.
This Bill is a move in the right direction, but there are many more steps that need to be taken to help protect and improve our water supplies. The additional comments of the Labor Senators included in the Senate Committee Report of the Bill outline those additional steps.
I look forward to seeing  more comprehensive water legislation in the future,  however I believe we will need to see a Labor Federal Government for that to happen.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-08-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

For many decades, Australians ignored clear warnings about the health of the Murray Darling Basin. When I returned to South Australian in 1983, I worked in an office next door to the then Member for Hawker, Mr Ralph Jacobi. Ralph Jacobi was a passionate advocate on several fronts, but one of his major campaigns was redressing some of the damage that had been done to the Murray Darling Basin. He was successful in raising awareness of the need for action by the federal Parliament. He was especially effective in getting a number of influential South Australians interested in the matter. I only regret that not enough of his vision was carried out at that time. Here we are, nearly a quarter of a century later, still trying to get some concerted plan to deal with the management of the Basin.
In my State of South Australia, early action was taken to regulate water use and allocation. South Australia put in place a self imposed cap on diversions from the Murray River in 1969. Successive State governments have worked with agricultural interests and other users to develop more effective management regimes. Some action caused friction and dissent but focus was maintained on the overriding interests of improving the health of the system. So, for example, much more efficient irrigation systems were introduced along the Murray River. Unfortunately, not enough was done, at least partly because users upstream were not able to be brought on board. As we are on the lower reaches of the system we had early first hand experience of the effects of the over allocation and declining health of the Murray Darling. Salinity affected formerly arable land and the potability of the water, and flora and fauna along the river deteriorated.  The Murray Darling Basin is critical to South Australia not only for much of our productive agriculture, and tourism, but also for urban use including drinking water for Adelaide.
South Australia has therefore been very eager to work with other Basin States to manage the system better. Consequently I support this Bill and am pleased that the federal government is prepared to contribute a significant amount to the budget required. I do share the frustration though of many stakeholders that this new management regime is not optimal. The announcement was made hastily, and the resulting Bill was put together quickly. The government of South Australia in its submission to the Senate inquiry on the Water Bill 2007 identified some significant concerns:
mandatory provisions for meeting critical human water needs were lost
environmental returns are not guaranteed
there is an open ended adoption date for the Basin Plan
no allowance is made for increased implementation costs faced by states
more complex institutional arrangements are established.
Again and again, reports have been made and plans prepared with poor results. If the commonwealth government is prepared to take the radical step of assuming management of the whole Basin, then it should put in place sensible and measurable outcomes and deadlines for action. The commonwealth is assuming control, but it will find it difficult to achieve its objectives without putting a reasonable proposal before the States. 
It should also put in place the measures required to ensure implementation. I find it difficult to believe that the reforms required will be possible without some form of compulsion but the government continues to dance around this issue because it has political difficulties. Having made the announcement of the takeover and basked in the political benefit of riding to the rescue of the Murray Darling, the government now finds itself dealing with the negative political consequences. Or rather finds itself trying to avoid the negative political consequences. It suffers from internal divisions and confrontation with some of its National Party colleagues.
This matter is far too important for short term politics to impede progress and once the election is over I urge the government, which I naturally hope will be a Labor government, to direct strenuous urgent efforts to ensure the management of the Basin works effectively, and with the powers it needs to achieve concrete results.
There are many competing interests within the Basin. All can make compelling cases for their use of the water. If the federal government is to intervene to achieve progress and implement reform, using its sweeping powers to make it happen, it must make fair, firm and justifiable decisions. If any decisions it makes, particularly early in the regime, are found to be flawed then management will become very difficult. The only way, I believe, to avoid errors is to base those decisions on sound scientific evidence and make the process very transparent.
One of the best results to come out of the recent focus on water resources is that some money has been devoted to a study of what resources there are and monitoring how they are used. There is probably far more to be learned about the nature of water reservoirs and the behaviour of the Murray Darling river system. The ecology of the area must be very complex, and I am certain that the more that is learned about the nature of the system, the better the decisions will be on how to manage it. There is, for example, still considerable debate about the quantity that should be assigned to the so called environmental flow – that portion of water that is needed to flow unallocated down the river to maintain the health of the ecosystem.
There is also much more to be done in research to assist agricultural interests who will have to cope with a severely curtailed water allocation. Ongoing research and development has been the framework for much of Australia’s agricultural advantage, and I am confident that our scientists and technologists will be able to assist farmers to maintain their crops or switch to more appropriate crops. Adequate funding should be made available to ensure that this research and development is possible, not from the funds made available for the Basin management, but from increased funds for the scientific community.
It is disappointing that after bold statements about taking control of the Murray Darling and getting something done at last, it appears from several submissions to the Senate inquiry that there is a widespread view that the new regime is overly complex. A bureaucratic system chews up funds, and unnecessary complexity runs the risk of having another scheme bogged down in endless discussion and reporting. The time for action really has come.
There is great goodwill in many quarters to ensure this Bill achieves its stated objectives, and many support it despite its flaws. I am one of those, and I hope I live to see the late Ralph Jacobi’s vision implemented.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-08-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise today to speak on several issues raised by the Government’s twin Water Bills. Labor believes in strong national leadership in this area, and acknowledges the step that this Bill takes. We are therefore supporting these pieces of legislation. However, there are several concerns about the manner and form of the particular Bills before us today. Notwithstanding the obstacles appearing in negotiations with the States, there have been some significant short comings in the development of this legislation. I would like to speak to some of these as well as outline specific issues affecting South Australia.
Water is, as can be clearly seen by any Australian, especially in recent years, a very serious and important national issue. The Murray-Darling Basin, spanning four States, over a thousand kilometres, and impacting on a myriad of diverse interest groups, is a water resource worthy of careful scrutiny and prudent management.
Indeed the Basin has been on the agenda for a most of our history. As early as 1886 the need for water management was debated in the States. The Shadow Minister, Mr Albanese in the other place, reminded us of the involvement by the Commonwealth in the negotiations with the States in 1915 and later of the 1980s, the landmark Murray-Darling agreement of 1992 and the subsequent Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993. 1994 saw the COAG agreement on national water reform and in 2004 the National Water Initiative. In the same COAG meeting the Intergovernmental Agreement on Addressing Water Overallocation and Achieving Environmental Objectives in the Murray-Darling Basin was agreed. 
Perhaps it is obvious to say that there has been much concern and discussion about the need for nationally coordinated water management in this area.
Recently the matter of Global Warming has brought into focus the need to guard our natural environment and resources, especially in areas that have been taken for granted in the past such as air and water supply and quality.
Yet in the face of all this discussion and compelling reality, the Federal Government waited until 25 January 2007, the first month of this election year, to announce a significant commitment to securing the Murray-Darling Basin for the future.
It was difficult to criticise Prime Minister Howard when he stood up on that day and pledged 10 billion dollars to save and manage the Murray-Darling. Labor gave our “in-principle bipartisan support”, we have long seen national water security, and national water leadership as being important future-focused issues. That the Coalition needed an election year to address this issue was something forgivable considering Mr Howard’s substantial financial announcement.
Labor’s in-principle support for the Government’s plan reflects our willingness to support the idea and objective of the Government’s policy. But, in our view, measured decisions and prudent management of the Murray-Darling Basin are the only way to move forward on this matter of national importance. Unfortunately we have not seen this reflected in the Government’s actions since the Prime Minister’s January announcement.
We now know that the Prime Minister did not consult either the Treasury or Cabinet before his announcement, demonstrating from the outset the kind of reckless present-minded decisions that have seen the Murray-Darling Basin descend into an environmentally unsustainable state.
Turning the Senate’s attention to the Bills before us today, and specifically the Water Bill 2007, we see another example of abrupt decision making and inadequate consultation. I am referring of course to the manner in which the Bill was presented to the Parliament, the pressure exerted by the Government for a speedy passage of the Bills, the subjugation of the Bill to just a one day hearing, and the general lack of parliamentary scrutiny.
Unfortunately, this approach to law-making is becoming more the rule than the exception under this Government. It seems it regards the Parliament as a mere rubber-stamp – not as a place for careful scrutiny of legislative measures. This is exacerbated by the fact that the Government has the numbers in the Senate and can therefore dictate the timing of debate and ensure that the legislation passes without amendment. This is exactly what we do not need when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin. Almost 250 pages of legislation regarding such an important investment in the future management of the water supply of over 2 million people not given the appropriate scrutiny which is expected by the Parliament and the Australian people. For the Murray-Darling it has the potential to be extremely damaging.
Unfortunately this is what we have come to expect from this Government.
It is no wonder that there have been criticisms raised by Farmers Federations, Irrigators, leading environmental scientists and even the Queensland National Party. Not to mention various State Governments.
South Australia sits in an interesting position as it is touched by the very end of the Murray-Darling Basin. In the one-day Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts committee hearing last Friday the South Australian Government outlined its particular concerns about this Bill. I would like to reiterate some of those concerns.
Firstly, as Senators are well aware, Australia is in the grip of a particularly severe drought. In times like these there can be serious critical human need for water, perhaps in larger quantities than may be sustainable in the longer term. In extreme dry periods it may be necessary to raise caps or even suspend them. This has happened this year with the Murray-Darling Basin agreement and associated Acts which have been set-aside. It is therefore predictable that the same may be necessary in relation to the Water Act. It would be preferable to have an emergency provision included in the Water Act to cope with such a situation and to ensure consistency and preserve the longevity of the legislation.
Secondly, as I mentioned earlier South Australia sits at the end of the Murray-Darling Basin. For this reason and for the practical significance of having an end-of-basin flow target in achieving environmental goals, it is preferable that such a target be incorporated into the legislation. I say this however while acknowledging that the Basin plan should contain such a goal as well as general flow goals and other such targets. Like the South Australian Government I see no reason why the Commonwealth Government could not place some general and important long term goals in place for end of flow outcomes, as running guidelines to direct and coordinate the efforts of the Basin Authority in creating the Basin plan. Perhaps they really do have “goal-phobia”.
Thirdly, and related to my second point, there is no particular deadline attached to the creation of the Basin Plan. As “the plan” is such a pivotal instrument in the management of the Murray-Darling Basin it should not of course be rushed. However, we should equally ensure that it not be left to an open-ended deadline leaving the Murray-Darling in the same unsustainable situation for potentially several years. Mr Turnbull spoke of a two year period in his second reading speech, this is fine, but it would seem prudent to place some form of deadline in the legislation itself.
Fourthly, concerns were raised about the costs involved in the implementation of the Basin Plan. Again, if we cast our minds back to the 25th of January, to that grand and impressive figure of 10 billion dollars over 10 years, questions appear about exactly where that money will be spent. The Prime Minister outlined that the jurisdictions would suffer no additional cost as a result of this plan. There is however no assurance of that in the Water Bill before us. Similarly, so far we have in the May budget a mere $53 million of that $10 billion commitment being flagged for the upcoming financial year. There has been no specific plan outlined for the distribution of funds for this endeavour and it once again demonstrates a lack of sensible practical planing that is so desperately needed to secure the Murray-Darling.
Finally, the South Australian Government submitted their views about the lack of legislated requirement for consultation between the States and the Federal Government.  It should be noted that section 93 of the Water Bill requires consultation with the States to be included in any regulation made concerning water charge rules. However, this is the only compulsory consultation in the Act. Given the nature of the Basin, the deep stake that the States hold in its welfare and the significant effects the management of the Basin can have on the people of those States, it would seem appropriate to have some form of legislated requirement for consultation with State Governments regarding any major changes in the operation of the legislation.
In conclusion I would like to state once again Labor’s view that the Murray-Darling Basin and Water generally form some of the most important and precious resources in Australia. It is an issue that affects so many Australians, crosses State boundaries and is so universally appreciated that national leadership is the best and most appropriate way to move forward. In supporting this bill Labor is acknowledging the need of Australia to better manage and preserve our environment. This Bill begins to address these issues and while more can be done and better ways found, it is a step in the right direction.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-16,"—The issue of the management of Australia’s shared water resources is one of the utmost importance. This issue is made all the more fraught in the Murray-Darling Basin by the problems of the overallocation of the system, particularly during periods of wet years; the complex governance arrangements within the basin; the sheer number of players involved; significant differences in the complex and varied systems of water allocations and water rights across the different jurisdictions; and the prospect of significant reductions to available water and increasing uncertainty in the face of climate change. While there has been recognition of the problems facing the Murray-Darling system for decades, it is fair to say that governance arrangements in the basin have been characterised by inertia and a lowest common denominator approach to resolving conflict. Quite frankly, it has been a basket case.
The agreement on the National Water Initiative in 2004 was a major conceptual step. However, despite knowing how bad the problem was and what was needed to fix it, the necessary on-the-ground progress in reforming water management in the basin has not happened. The announcement of the National Plan for Water Security by the Prime Minister in January 2007 represented a recognition of the seriousness of the issue, with a commitment of $10 billion, but was another disappointing example of the continuing politicisation of the issue, coming as it did without consultation and with significant strings attached in the lead-up to a federal election.
Given the crucial importance of these issues and the significant amount of public money that is now at stake, it is particularly disappointing that so little time has been afforded to proper consultation over these bills, particularly when they have changed so significantly over the last month or so and that the time given for the committee inquiry to review the legislation was so short. Also, as Senator Bartlett said, the inquiry was held on the same day as the Northern Territory emergency response bills inquiry, which meant that for those of us who are on both committees it was extremely difficult. As people can see from our minority report, we are also concerned that during the committee inquiry, although a number of very serious issues were addressed, not all of the significant issues were addressed.
We believe that there are significant amendments that need to be made to the Water Bill 2007. There are very positive aspects of this bill, including commitments to determine sustainable extraction levels, a shared planning framework and a whole-of-basin perspective, realising the promises of the NWI and creating greater water security for all stakeholders. There is an opportunity to overcome the inertia and infighting that has characterised basin governance, and a commitment to meeting international commitments by using our treaties power. However, as I have just said, the Greens believe that the bill in its current form has a number of significant weaknesses. We believe that many of these weaknesses could be addressed through legislative amendment, and I welcome a brief opportunity to suggest some constructive improvements that members of the Senate may wish to consider.
To this end, the Greens will be putting forward a number of amendments, which I hope will give us the opportunity to further discuss some of the complexities of this bill. I hope that these amendments will be taken on board, because they address some of the issues that I am about to talk about. The problems that we see with the bill include the long lead time before the basin plan effectively comes into operation, which has been brought about by the recognition of existing plans for the lifetime of those plans. Most of them go to 2014 but some—in Victoria, for example—go to 2019. Other problems include the lack of clear environmental targets and time lines, the risk that the return of environmental flows could be too late to prevent irretrievable damage to some important ecosystems, the creation of yet another large bureaucracy within the basin and the complexity of having multiple agencies and institutions with overlapping jurisdictions, the lack of independence of the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the provisions that allow the minister to direct the MDBA in setting the sustainable diversion limit and in developing the environmental watering plan.
Other problems include the risk that institutional arrangements within the bills may effectively freeze reforms, possibly delaying them for many years; the extent to which many of the reforms are now dependent on the content of the intergovernmental agreement, the IGA; the possibility that the process of reaching agreement could drag out and even further delay on-the-ground outcomes; the lack of community consultation and engagement, in particular in the IGA but also in the legislative process; the lack of consultation with Indigenous stakeholders; the manner in which the debate has become politicised, with particular reference to compulsory acquisition, which I will come back to later; and, finally, the risk that investment decisions could be strongly influenced by political considerations
This is a once-in-a-very-long-time opportunity. We believe that we need to take the time to get this particular piece of legislation right, because it has been a long time in coming. One of the biggest questions for us is: will the response be quick enough? The Australian Greens are particularly concerned by the time frame of the proposed interventions. On the one hand, the government is pressing the urgent nature of the issue and saying that this is the reason that the bills need to be pushed through the legislative process in a short space of time in this session. On the other hand, the decision to recognise and protect existing catchment plans effectively means that there will be little change in the basin until after 2014. For many of our threatened ecosystems and for our rural communities in which our farmers are struggling with uncertain seasonal water allocations, this delay could mean that action is too late to significantly help our farmers, to preserve our precious environmental assets and to protect irrigation industries.
In theory, the Prime Minister has already committed to spending $6 billion to improve irrigation infrastructure and $3 billion to address overallocation and buy back environmental water. However, much of this investment is now contingent on all the states signing up to the intergovernmental agreement. I am concerned that the need to negotiate this complex and fraught intergovernmental agreement could result in considerable delays in undertaking needed water reform and returning environmental flows. This is why the Australian Greens are calling on the government to immediately begin buying back water from willing sellers, which would increase both the amount of environmental water available and the certainty of existing water entitlements by reducing the extent of overallocation. The purchase and return of water to environmental flows needs to be addressed urgently as the combined impact of extended drought and overallocation is severely threatening the resilience of many of our iconic ecosystems.
There is a real risk that we may soon pass thresholds beyond which these systems cannot bounce back. The Greens are particularly concerned that there is nothing within the legislation which guarantees speedy action in implementing both the basin cap and the environmental watering plan. As the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists stated in their submission to the inquiry:
We are concerned that if existing plans are protected then little change will be seen within the Basin until after 2014, by which time many of the environmental assets and the rural wealth of irrigation could be destroyed. This task is urgent.
We note that the Victorian government indicated that its recently revised plans, which it expects the government to honour, will run through to 2019—that is, another 12 years. There is nothing within the bill to ensure that the first basin plan is completed within two years of the establishment of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I am aware that this was discussed in the committee, but the Greens very strongly recommend that the government addresses this issue during this discussion and that the minister gives an undertaking that he will direct the MDBA to finalise its first basin plan within two years of its establishment.
The Australian Greens are concerned about the lack of consultation and the lack of recognition of Indigenous rights and interests in the bill. We share Indigenous people’s concerns that the Water Bill 2007 should include explicit recognition of traditional owners’ inherent rights to land and water and provide a consistent approach for Indigenous participation in natural resource management. We also believe that the legislation should include provisions of water for cultural purposes.
To save the ecosystems of the Murray-Darling Basin, we need to set a robust and ecologically sustainable limit on diversions. That, quite clearly and simply, is the key task that confronts us in reforming water use within the basin. The bill does not guarantee any environmental outcomes. The Australian Greens are concerned by the lack of environmental goals and time lines within the bill and with its failure to require end-of-basin and end-of-valley targets. While it will be the job of the MDBA to put in place the specifics of these targets and plan how they will be achieved, we believe that the very failure to stipulate that there should be environmental targets and to indicate the principles upon which such targets and plans should be reached is a major shortcoming.
In setting the basin cap and determining a limit on diversions from the basin that is ecologically sustainable, it is essential that we have a good understanding, based on the best possible science, of both the hydrology of the system—that is, how much water is in the system—and of the ecological requirements for the health and resilience of the system—that is, how much needs to be set aside. This is a very important point. The Australian Greens are concerned that, as it stands, the CSIRO study into sustainable extraction limits is effectively focused primarily on hydrology, only providing half the data needed to set the cap. Determination of the level of sustainable extraction—the cap—must be based on both the knowledge of total available water and the science of what is required for ecosystem health.
We remain concerned that there seems to be an assumption that the cap will be a magic, fixed figure, whereas we believe it likely that the requirements of adaptive management to maintain and enhance resilience will mean that this figure is likely to vary. It is critical in setting the limit on diversions that we ensure that we are accounting for the needs of ecological communities in critically low- or medium-flow years and the need to protect and enhance the resilience of these systems after periods of extended drought, and that we are taking into account the impacts of climate change in both the reduction in the amount of water within the system and its increased variability, including more extreme weather events—that is, more droughts and flooding rains.
This is why the Australian Greens believe that the bill needs to directly address the need for a robust, ecologically sustainable diversion limit for the basin and outline robust criteria to guide the development of those limits. This is why we believe that it is important to use median figures which reflect the reality of flows in the system more effectively than long-term averages, particularly for the more variable, and often ephemeral, event driven systems of the northern basin. This is why we believe that it is critical that we set end-of-system and end-of-valley flow targets. Further, this is why we believe that the MDBA must be given direct responsibility for ensuring environmental outcomes and for systematically monitoring the health and resilience of the system and its dependent ecological communities. Professor Cullen, who gave evidence to the committee inquiry, said:
I fear that the inflows into the Murray-Darling have dropped by about 40 per cent over what has been the reasonably long-term average.
…            …            …
I believe we need to adjust to this water scarcity and learn to live without a number of wet years. It is probably more serious in that we have now run all the storages to empty and it is quite possible that some of those storages will not refill without a run of quite unusually wet years. They will not fill in average years. We are not dealing with a stable system. We are dealing with one that has quite a lot less water and which might be continuing to decline.
There is clearly a need for better science on ecosystem resilience and for more work on its adaptive management. Emerging knowledge on the resilience of our drought adapted ecosystems now makes it seem likely that after a big drought there may be an environmental requirement for a high-flow flushing event onto the floodplains and through the wetlands to ensure recovery and restore resilience. We believe that there are two critical issues that need to be considered: how we manage to protect and enhance the resilience of our riverine, flood plain, wetland and estuarine ecosystems; and whether the proposed governance systems and water-sharing arrangements are flexible enough to deal with the requirements for ecosystem survival in low-flow and critical-flow years in the face of climate change predictions. To this end, the Australian Greens recommend that the government commit to funding the best possible science into how to maintain and enhance the resilience of our river ecosystems and into how to deal with climate shift. We also recommend that water-sharing arrangements be reviewed to ensure that they are compatible with the requirements for managing resilience. The Australian Greens will be moving amendments to require information gathering on ecosystem health and resilience by the MDBA and to add consideration of these issues to the objects of the bills.
The Australian Greens support the contention of the Wentworth group that the option of compulsory acquisition needs to be kept on the table as an option of last resort. We believe that we need a mechanism to allow acquisition of water on just terms, and that ruling out compulsory acquisition as an option of last resort may not be in farmers’ best interests when they are faced with a need to relocate or restructure. Compulsory acquisition offers the possibility of compensation on just terms—in other words, more than market value—and exemption from capital gains tax. The Greens will be moving to strike out section 255 to enable compulsory acquisitions as an option of last resort.
We are also concerned about the independence of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The Australian Greens are particularly concerned by the issues relating to the independence of the MDBA and the proposed powers of ministerial oversight and direction. We are concerned that, as the bill stands, the minister can direct the authority in setting both (1) the sustainable extraction level and (2) the environmental water plan. We believe that the powers of the minister to intervene in the exercise of the authority’s functions in the basin plan and to create exemptions to the basin plan by regulation compromise the MDBA’s independence and authority. We therefore will be putting forward amendments to address these issues. The Greens also believe that a Commonwealth environmental water holder needs to be free from inappropriate limits.
We believe that the responsibilities of the authority also need to be looked at. We support the comments of the Wentworth group on the need to ensure that the MDBA is explicitly given responsibility for meeting the environmental objectives laid out in the objects of the act. The Australian Greens will be seeking to amend the bill to ensure that the authority is given responsibility for meeting these objectives of the act. We believe that this makes sense and is the only reasonable option. We also note the suggestion by the Wentworth group that part 5 of the bill should be amended to direct the authority to progressively establish a central, secure basin register of water entitlements, and we will be seeking to amend section 103 of the bill to that effect. The Wentworth group said:
The commonwealth should build a top class water registry system for surface and groundwater systems, with appropriate guarantees. All commonwealth water should be on such a registry, and irrigators should have the opportunity to migrate to this registry if they wish to have greater certainty as to titles.
In the short time I have left, I would also like to address the issues around international commitments. The Greens welcome the recognition within the legislation of Australia’s commitments to a number of international conventions, including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, about which I have spoken in this place at length; the Convention on Biological Diversity; and the various migratory bird conventions. We are concerned, however, that the legislation should not merely be consistent with these international obligations but should be seeking to give effect to them. In seeking to use Australia’s commitments to these international conventions as a way of invoking the Commonwealth’s external affairs powers, the Commonwealth has an obligation to ensure that it is fully implementing its commitments under these conventions.
The Australian Greens believe that the basin plan and water resource plans needs not only to be consistent with and give effect to relevant international agreements but also to be consistent with and give effect to plans and strategies developed for implementing those commitments under the EPBC Act. We believe that water resource plans should be required to implement relevant Ramsar management, recovery or threat abatement plans. As you would expect, the Greens will be moving amendments to this end. We also believe that the legislation should specifically implement important and relevant elements of the climate change convention, and we will be moving amendments to put this into effect. This is particularly important given the impact that climate change will have—and we contend is already having—on the basin.
The Greens will also be moving amendments to deal with the issue of public-standing provisions. We believe that, to ensure that the authority and the minister can be held accountable in exercising their public interest functions under the legislation, the water legislation should be amended to provide for public-standing provisions equivalent to those in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. This will allow interested persons to be able to assist in the enforcement of the legislation by applying for injunctions if someone has engaged, is engaging or is proposing to engage in conduct that would constitute a contravention of the act. We believe that the amendments that we are proposing will significantly improve this legislation. I will be talking about the specific amendments in the Committee of the Whole.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-08-16,"—I want to speak on the Water Bill 2007 today from a Victorian perspective. The lack of support of the draft bill from the Victorian government and their differences of opinion on it have been well canvassed in the press. I support Victoria’s position on this legislation. The Murray-Darling Basin is in crisis—there is no doubt about that. It is facing ecological collapse, with 90 per cent of wetlands having been lost, and a similar level of loss of populations of waterbirds. Three-quarters of the river red gum forests in the lower Murray are now dead, dying or highly stressed. When we combine this with toxic algal blooms and salinity problems, we have a serious problem at hand. Add to this a 40 per cent decline in the inflows reaching the Murray-Darling Basin and instability in the weather patterns due to climate change impacts and it is clear that the situation is serious. Healthy rivers are obviously vital to our prosperity and economy. A healthy Murray-Darling River basin is vital to both of those.
The Victorian government says it supports national leadership in the Murray-Darling Basin management and it is also committed to the sustainable management of the Murray-Darling Basin. It agreed to negotiate with all governments to improve the management and is proactively implementing the National Water Initiative. Victoria argues that it has established state based processes and policy which have been developed and agreed with the Victorian community. This includes annual water resource planning, annual allocations and control of river flows, land use planning in the Murray-Darling Basin and managing the associated economic development and community impacts. Victoria does, however, object to the removal of state rights and the overriding of the state processes and policy that have been negotiated with the community, have been proven to work and, most critically, have been able to manage urban agriculture and environmental allocations through the worst of the recent drought.
The Victorian government says that it agrees to giving the Commonwealth the constitutional powers and ability to set and reset a cap across the Murray-Darling Basin and to set subcaps catchment by catchment, with compliance to be enforceable through the Federal Court. It also supports giving the ACCC power to advise on water-pricing policy structures and to control market behaviour across the basin. It supports the powers to prevent any changes to water shares amongst states and the ability to hold environmental water in Victoria and to be not hindered in its use for environmental purposes. It accepts the ability to access any necessary information to determine whether the caps are being complied with and the ability of the Commonwealth to enforce compliance via the Federal Court.
A terms sheet establishing these principles and complete drafting instructions was, as I understand it, provided to the Commonwealth so that its legal advisers could see how we plan to alter Victorian laws to allow the Commonwealth to achieve its stated objective of sustainable water management across the basin. All of these terms were outlined in the Victorian terms sheet and provided to the Commonwealth, but so far the Commonwealth has not bothered to respond to those points. The representative of the Victorian government, Mr Peter Harris, said at the 10 August hearing:
The rejection by the Commonwealth of this approach was curiously framed. It did not respond to our proposals. Rather, it issued a demand for compliance with its own draft legislation, to which Victoria had never been a party. We were given no choice but to reject such a demand. I can table this terms sheet if the Senate would like that.
Victoria has rejected complete transfer of powers to the Commonwealth over our water sources because we have a very reliable water allocation system. Victoria’s irrigators and environmental groups agreed with the government that the certainty with which we had endowed their entitlements in negotiations over water reform between 2002 and 2004 was to be preferred to an unknown system of Commonwealth control. The Victorian water allocation system is a reflection of Victoria’s agriculture and relatively dense urban concentration within the basin, just as the more flexible allocation models of other jurisdictions reflect their agriculture and pattern of urban settlement. This is the heart of why state allocation systems vary.
In Victoria we allocate water already in the dam. As a result, we have a very high proportion of our water in high security and we closely restrict water access by providing allocations under bulk entitlements to water authorities. We keep within caps under the Murray-Darling Basin agreements because we simply cannot legally offer entitlements in excess of bulk entitlements, and bulk entitlements in turn match caps. The nature of our high regional population and our higher value permanent planting style of agriculture is vital to Victoria, and thus our system has always been more controlled and more reliable. As I mentioned, neither our farmers nor our environmentalists were prepared to give up this reliability, particularly after water allocations in Victoria held up so well during the worst ever irrigation system in 2006-07.
We believe Commonwealth negotiators never understood the nature of this issue, which is at the heart of Victoria’s objection. This was not ever about money. Victoria did not seek a special deal on funding. The Victorian government is actually spending today the first of more than $1 billion in real funds on irrigation modernising in Victoria over the period between now and 2012.
So I think it is fair to say that Victoria is more advanced with development, water resource planning and water management policy than other states. It has a water allocation system that is reliable and is moving at least towards sustainable practices, balancing consumption of water and the environment.
Victoria also argues that it is more advanced in controlling interception activities and farm dams and including within water planning plantation forestry, farm dams and groundwater, and flood-plain harvesting. Victoria has made commitments to the healthy river agreements and a red-gum policy and systematic assessment of river health.
The Victorian allocation system may be reasonably good, but in my experience the infrastructure in most irrigation areas is still fairly poor. The Victorian government has committed $1 billion to infrastructure, and an irrigation committee will be deciding where and how that will be spent. I understand it will create roughly 225 gigalitres of water savings which will be shared in thirds between the environment, the farming community and urban users. That seems to me to be a good start. Much more needs to be spent, but at least we are on the way.
Victoria’s irrigators and environmental groups are backing the Victorian government, preferring the certainty of the water allocation to the unknown system being proposed by the Commonwealth. The Victorian government reports that there has been a lack of consultation with key stakeholders and there is a lack of involvement of subject matter experts. Of course, allocating only one day to the Senate inquiry has not assisted in the understanding of the implications of this bill.
That there has been no consultation with state governments to discuss and resolve community and state government concerns is, I think, a disgrace. I understand that there has not even been consultation with the National Water Commission, the Commonwealth Department of the Treasury or the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, so I think that the Victorian government is right to be cautious about the haste with which the Commonwealth is passing these provisions. There has been very much an attitude from the Commonwealth of, ‘Trust us; we’ll address that issue in time,’ but that is not an adequate response to what are quite reasonable questions from the Victorian government, such as how the cap would be set and issues of seasonal allocations.
In reality there are a number of key instruments and details missing from this bill. They include the intergovernmental agreement, which has not been developed—certainly no-one appears to have seen it so far. There is no clear statement from the Commonwealth on policy objectives, beyond obtaining the referral powers from the Murray-Darling states. And there is no statement of environmental protection, for example. Victoria wants clear objectives for water resource security for environmental protection and the enhancement of environmental values. There is no clear indicator of the extent of the control and the definition of the Murray-Darling Basin. As it stands, the interpretation could be that the Commonwealth will control the catchment area north of the Dividing Range to north-west Victoria, an area that includes the Goulburn Valley, north Gippsland, Wodonga, Seymour, the Grampians, Western Desert, the Mallee, Mildura, Campaspe, Loddon, Coliban, Ovens and Keilor valleys and catchment areas. That is two-thirds of the landmass of Victoria.
There is no specific plan for improving the health of the Murray River, and the bill fails to recognise mechanisms established by governments under the Living Murray and Snowy River initiatives. We do not know how the Commonwealth will set seasonal allocations. Currently, allocations in Victoria are made under a conservative regime, more conservative and secure than other states. And it is not clear who is going to manage and set the level of the allocations to the irrigation community. We do not know how the four per cent exclusion from water trading will be handled. The original intent from the National Water Initiative was to retain this four per cent to maintain the integrity and resilience of farming communities; however, that too would seem to have been compromised.
Other problems include the compromising of established water resource planning for a catchment and making allocations outside the longstanding process established between the Victorian government and the Victorian community; making way for ‘interception allocations’ like farm dams and weirs without addressing how these activities will be policed; and the absence of a definition of a sustainable level of extraction of water from the Murray-Darling Basin. A legislated guarantee is needed to protect Victorian irrigators and the environment from any impacts on Victorian water entitlements or loss of production caused by the Commonwealth proposal.
Other concerns include the additional administrative overhead of $1 billion that does not result in any water benefits, protection of water rights or drought management. If this legislation is to be effective, the Commonwealth needs to conduct proper consultation and work cooperatively with state governments rather than rushing to pass the bill in an election year. It is also worth noting that the urgency to pass the Water Bill is not reflected in the time lines set out in the $10 billion funding package, which spans a period of over 10 years.
Because Victoria is advanced in its progress and management of water resources, allocations and resource and development planning, there are differences between state practices, and this may genuinely mean that there is a need to bring all the states into a consistent basin structure. But the Water Bill will be meaningless without a commitment to time lines and targets for water recovery. The Victorian government agreed to the ACCC managing and overseeing the enforcement of water rights. But of key concern is ensuring the Water Bill enshrines the independence and power of the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority to keep water use at a sustainable level and to make sure the environment gets its fair share. We need to see a strong, truly independent authority that has the power to enforce a sustainable cap on the amount of water taken from our rivers and to deliver the water needed to restore river health. Also of critical importance is the need to preserve and capitalise on the expertise, experience and intellectual capital of the personnel from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to ensure ongoing involvement with the new authority.
The federal legislation still needs more work if it is to deliver on its promise to fix the problems of overuse and overallocation of our river systems. The Murray needs at least 1,500 billion litres by 2012. We need to be able to manage within that figure and define what a sustainable level of extraction is going to be, and also to manage for seasonal and annual variations. The intergovernmental agreement needs to be finalised as soon as possible and in a spirit of cooperation. This will only be achieved if federal and state governments get serious about buying back water entitlements and ensuring that the market works. This will not happen if the Commonwealth takes over all the functions. To be effective and to move to full implementation of the National Plan for Water Security this must be based on a cooperative approach between the states and the Commonwealth. There are still critical roles for the state and local governments in this planning.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1

I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate today and to stress my strong support for this Bill and for the Government’s approach to water.
The State Labor Governments’ in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia should hang their collective heads in shame for allowing the situation to deteriorate to such an extent that the Commonwealth is required to step in to address a matter of national concern. That the action required is urgent is not in dispute and on that basis it beggars belief that the Brumby Labor Government in Victoria continues to play cheap politics.
The Victorian community quite rightly judges the Brumby Labor Government as totally abrogating its short, medium and long term responsibilities to the people of Victoria.
I will now turn to the extraordinary decision of the Brumby Labor Government to build what has been called the North-South Pipeline. This is a pipeline running from the Goulburn Valley via the Eildon Reservoir to Melbourne. There is extraordinary and justified anger about this proposal from many regional and rural communities. It is proposed that Melbourne will steal 75 gigalitres of water from the Goulburn system and in doing so will potentially seriously impact on the Bendigo pipeline which will put at risk Bendigo’s future critical water needs.
The North-South pipeline will reduce the water supply available for the Bendigo pipeline which is due to feed Lake Eppalock from next month. The threat to the supply is because there will be less water available in the Goulburn system because of the Melbourne pipeline. This is particularly so until the water savings I am about to refer to are made.
The Brumby Labor Government has justified the theft of the 75 gigalitres on the basis of savings being achieved from the piping of irrigation channels. This work is not even due to start for several years and given the Brumby/Bracks Labor Governments’ appalling record on infrastructure delivery it can be expected that there will be considerable further slippage.
The Brumby Labor Government believe they can achieve 225 gigalitres in water savings with a third of this water going to Melbourne, a third for environmental flows and a third to farmers. It is criminal that Melbourne gets first call on these proposed water savings and it is even more criminal that Melbourne will receive this water before the savings are even achieved.
There is one person who has been strangely silent in relation to the impact of the North-South pipeline on Bendigo. That person is Steve Gibbons who has refused to stand up to the Brumby Labor Government and in doing so he has failed the people of Bendigo. The question that the people of Bendigo will be asking is why their Federal Member of Parliament puts the interests of his State ALP colleagues ahead of the people who elected him.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2007-08-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

This is an historic Bill and I congratulate the Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for his bold vision.
We now have a genuine opportunity to have the Murray Darling Basin managed in a sustainable fashion.
The Bill has overwhelming support.  Of course some would like to make further changes, but it is certainly true to say virtually all stakeholders want this legislation in place.
Four Labor governments, the ALP Federal opposition, farmers organisations and many environmental groups support the Bill.
In short, a remarkable consensus has emerged. But there is one stakeholder that has fought tooth and nail to derail this historic reform. I refer to the State Government of Victoria.
As result of the wreaking activities of the Victorian Government the original proposal announced in January seeking a referral of powers from the States in now not practical and the Commonwealth has now had to legislate to bring about the necessary changes.
Nevertheless, as Mr Turnbull points out, through this legislation the Commonwealth will obtain about 75% of the reforms we set out to achieve. While we are disappointed with the Victorian Government’s lack of cooperation, this reform, this legislation, represents the biggest, most important reform of water management in our history.
It is 100% better than the current arrangements in the Murray-Darling Basin.
As I indicated, everyone has offered their contributions to the development of the proposed bill. There has been an extensive consultation process prior to finalisation of the Bill. 
But, the Victorian Government has been singularly uncooperative in that process.
Almost from the word go, it appeared that the Victorian Government was prepared to wreck this proposal.
But, while Mr Bracks was apparently giving early signals Victoria was prepared to support the plan, it is now apparent that they were never going to negotiate in good faith.
And I don’t expect things will be getting any better given the attitude of Premier Brumby.
Premier Brumby’s attitude has been reflected in the attitude of Victorian Public servants.
Numerous meetings have been held with state officials over the last 5 months to finesse the proposal. I understand the Victorian officials made virtually no contribution to the deliberations of these committees.
The Bill was considered by the Senate Environment, Communications, IT and the Arts Committee on Friday.  I am sorry to report to the Senate that the performance of Mr Harris, Secretary of the Department of Sustainability and Environment in Victoria, surprised a number of members of the Committee.
Mr Harris’ comments were strangely political for a public servant.
All the senior Public Servants from other states were careful not to enter into political debates. But not Mr Harris. His efforts to score political points were poorly received.
He also made several statements that were hard to reconcile.
For example, he argued that the Victorian Government position enjoyed widespread support from the farming and irrigation communities as well as environmental groups.
But the Victorian Farmers Federation and the Northern Victorian Irrigators—the two peak bodies representing irrigators in Victoria have publicly supported the Commonwealth Bill.
The environmental groups appearing before the committee, while, certainly raising some issues, still wanted the bill to proceed immediately.
So Mr Harris’s claim of widespread support for the Victorian Government’s position seems to be totally unfounded.
 Mr Harris’s evidence in relation to Victorian initiatives to upgrade infrastructure was also unsatisfactory. He indicated that Victoria had committed $1 billion to a water reform package to upgrade Victoria’s infrastructure. 
But when I questioned him on this he admitted that it amounts to just over $150 million per year, over 6 years.
If I was a Victorian irrigator I would certainly want to carefully monitor the delivery on this promise.
Then, by his own admission, he explained that really the Victorian Government needs a further $1 billion to undertake the necessary upgrades.  The Victorian Government needs to spend $2 billion to upgrade their aging and very leaky water infrastructure.  Yet they have committed to invest half this amount over the next 6 years.
In short the Victorian Government has at least a $1 billion black hole when it comes to investing to upgrade their water infrastructure.
By stalling, by refusing to cooperate, Premier Brumby is rejecting the biggest and most important reform of water management in Australian history.
The weak performance of the Victorian Government on the National scene is not surprising particular given its mishandling of domestic water supplies to Melbourne.
We are now in the tenth year of the worst drought in one hundred years. Victoria is facing a water crisis. Where, has been the forward planning?
What we have is a dog of a project, the North-South pipeline, which is being imposed on the good people of the Goulburn Murray Valley.
It is already a huge issue in Victoria.
Prior to the election Brumby and Thwaites strongly criticised the Liberals proposal for a desalination plant. But now they have embraced this concept. But as is the practice with Victorian Government initiatives, there are already problems over implementation including the location of the plant.
Water policy is going to be a major area of public debate in Victoria in the years ahead.
The performance of the Victorian Government to date, in particular its efforts to wreak the National approach to the Murray Darling basin gives little confidence in their capacity to deal with the massive water challenges facing the state.
With an incoherent water policy, despite a desperate lack of water, I cannot see why the Victorian Government is so eager to reject the Commonwealth Water Bill, and the significant investment that comes with it.
Premier Brumby has everything to gain and nothing to lose by supporting the Plan, and were it not for election year politics, he would readily admit this. 
This is a vital piece of national legislation, and not just for our generation but for the next as well.

Second Reading of Water Bill 2007 and consequential amendments
I record my support for the Water Bill 2007 and associated legislation, which forms part of one of the most important reform packages as it relates to the state of South Australia in recent times.
The ongoing health of the River Murray and, as a consequence the entire Murray Darling Basin, is of vital importance to South Australia. Our irrigators and many primary producers depend on it, parts of our tourism industry depend on it, and indeed the city of Adelaide depends on it for urban water supply.
Importantly, the beautiful natural environment of our state depends on it too, especially the unique wetlands of the Coorong, which are found at the end of the Murray Darling system, near the Murray mouth. Being at the end of the system, the Coorong is especially vulnerable to the reduced flows the river has been experiencing.
In some states the debate about the river and its usage is dominated by the demands of irrigators and primary producers. And, having worked in the wine industry, where grape growers rely on the river system in many regions, not just in South Australia, I appreciate the importance of treating those whose living is derived from the river, and who generate much wealth for our country from the river, both fairly and equitably.
However, in South Australia we are acutely aware of the need to balance more than the needs of irrigators, we must also balance the needs of those in urban areas who rely on it and, most importantly, balance the environmental demands to sustain the river well into the future. I believe this package and the associated package achieves this balance.
This action is needed because of decades of mismanagement of the river and the emerging realisation that the consequences of this mismanagement will have severe and long term effects.
Our founding fathers—those who established this great Commonwealth of Australia through the federation of states in 1901—got much right, but they got it wrong when it came to the management of our waterways, especially the mighty Murray-Darling system.
By placing the powers of management in the hands of the states, they put the river at the mercy of vested interests. Over the years those vested interests have over-allocated the available water, allowed the prolonged occurrence of inefficient irrigation practices and starved it of effective environmental flows.
It didn’t have to be this way. At the 1897 Constitutional Convention in Adelaide a draft of the constitution under debate included a proposed clause 50 (XII), which gave the new Commonwealth jurisdiction over:
“Fisheries in Australian waters beyond territorial limits and in rivers which flow through two or more States.”
Regrettably, it was not to be. As one of the founding fathers, Charles Cameron Kingston, a former South Australian Premier and an inaugural member of this parliament, said at the time:
“it augurs ill to Federation that the representatives will not trust the Federal Parliament representing all the States, in which Victoria and New South Wales will have a much larger representation than we can have, in connection with this matter in which we feel so deeply, and on which we have sought so long and vainly to obtain a recognition of our rights. It is a pity indeed that the decision we have arrived at has been reached. I hope it may be reconsidered, and that a measure of hope may be held out that the Federal Parliament will be trusted with federal questions of the gravity involved in the use of the waters of the Murray”.
Yes, even then South Australians were arguing passionately for national control over the Murray.
Just as future generations are always beneficiaries of the achievements of those who have gone before them, it also falls to future generations to address the mistakes of the past. That is what the Howard Government is doing with our water reforms.
This Bill must be considered in tandem with the National Plan for Water Security announced by the Prime Minister in January this year. This plan commits the government to investing $10.05 billion to modernise irrigation infrastructure, address over-allocation problems, reform the management of the basin and ensure the collection of accurate, effective data into the future. To make the plan work, the Commonwealth sought a referral of powers from the States.
The plan was widely greeted within the community, especially the South Australian community. As is to be expected with any significant government policy announcement, the Opposition was also quick to greet it and agree with it. In fact it sparked the spectacle of the Opposition Leader going on a national tour to sell the Prime Minister’s plan to the Labor Premiers. This was all part of his claim to being able to achieve a new kind of federalism.
One by one, after discussions with the Prime Minister and Minister Turnbull and media stunts with the Opposition Leader, the states fell into line and committed support for the plan. But not Victoria, where self interest and political opportunism continued to be placed ahead of the national interest and the health of this great river system.
Mr Rudd failed to bring Victoria on board. His new, cooperative federalism was dead before it ever got off the ground. And he has rarely spoken of the water plan ever since. Both he and his other state Labor colleagues have lacked the courage to publicly criticise Victoria’s position. They have put their Labor mates ahead of this important environmental issue.
Without Victoria’s referral of powers a new approach was needed. And so we have the package before us today. This package, which utilises the external affairs and corporations powers of the Commonwealth to achieve implementation wherever possible, remains a good package. It will deliver improvements. The original plan was better and preferable, but with Labor acting as a spoiler we must accept this as a strong, viable alternative.
This Bill will establish the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. An independent, expert body, it is charged with the responsibility of developing an evidence-based Basin Plan that balances the needs of all stakeholders, including the health of the rivers. The Basin Plan will include an Environmental Watering Plan, which section 28 of the Bill says must “safeguard existing environmental water” and “plan for the recovery of additional environmental water”. Further, it must “protect and restore the wetlands and other environmental assets of the Murray-Darling Basin” and “protect biodiversity dependent on the Basin water resources”.
The Bill will expand the role of the Bureau of Meteorology, to ensure that the new authority and other policy makers have accurate data and information at their disposal, and establishes a role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in managing the market for water trading and water pricing.
These are critical reforms that, when undertaken in tandem with the significant investment announced by the Prime Minister, will save water, put more control in the hands of experts rather than vested interests, improve environmental outcomes and guarantee the water entitlements of South Australia and its urban users. The reforms of this government will increase the chances of the system surviving into the long term, which will be of benefit to all stakeholders, right along the system.
I was pleased to participate in the inquiry into this Bill by the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Standing Committee. I note that after hearing from industry, agriculture, environmental, scientific and government interests the Committee concluded that although there was broad support for the Bill, it recognised “the preference of most stakeholders for the original referral of powers model”.
Once again we see just how much the Labor Government in Victoria was out on a limb, standing in the way of progress on this matter. The Victorian Government sent public servants to appear before the inquiry and attempt to justify their position. Yet in a shameful performance these public servants resorted to political points when it suited them, while hiding behind their policy makers at other times. Meanwhile, the other Labor states sat back, muted and unwilling to criticise their Labor mates.
It is also worth noting that those in this place who are always the first to claim the high ground on environmental matters – the Australian Greens and Australian Democrats – failed to ask a single question during the full day of hearings and were almost completely absent during the entire day. These reforms, the approach of the Howard Government and of Government Senators demonstrates clearly who really cares about getting practical outcomes for the environment.
Despite the pathetic performance of the state governments, I would like to record my thanks to the other witnesses for their constructive input into the inquiry, especially given the short time available to them. I also thank Dr Ian Holland and the Committee staff for their valuable work on this inquiry.
I have every faith that this Bill and the associated National Plan for Water Security is a good measure. It deserves to be passed and it deserves the support of all Senators. But, as Labor has forced a compromise upon us, we must ask if it will be good enough? We must question whether the Labor States, especially Victoria, will cooperate with the inter-governmental agreement that will accompany this Bill when the election has passed, or if they will continue to play politics with the river?
I hope we do get the best out of this package and quickly see the benefits of it. I prefer to be optimistic about these things, even though that optimism might be misplaced where the Labor Party is involved. The river needs this to succeed. The surrounding environment needs it to succeed. And the river communities, especially those in South Australia, need it to succeed.
But if it doesn’t, then a future government must take this matter to the people and seek the powers in the constitution that should have been there from day one. If it takes a referendum to ensure sound management of the Murray-Darling Basin once and for all, then ultimately that is what we should have. As Kingston continued to argue, in relation to power over the Murray River, at the 1898 Melbourne Constitution Convention:
“we ought to give to the Federal Parliament which we propose to call into existence the power, when it deems fit, to legislate on this question in order to remove this fertile source of friction between colonies.”
Indeed we ought.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-08-16,"—I rise to talk about water and to briefly outline a couple of areas. I acknowledge the comments that have been made by colleagues in the Senate today in the debate on the Water Bill 2007 and related bill. The thing about water is that it is a resource. You have to exploit a resource if you want to have a nation of wealth. Here today we are not sitting on a rug on the grass; we are sitting in a building, and it exploits a resource. Water is political. Water is the ultimate in politics because it is the conduit of wealth, it is the conduit of everything that sustains an area—it sustains jobs, it sustains economies. In a period of drought it also very much reflects the pressures that certain people are under. The financial pressure for some people in this drought is absolutely immense—in fact, I would go so far as to say that for some people it will be terminal.
The issue in Queensland has always been that we were the last to develop our water resources and therefore we have been playing catch-up to where New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia were. It is always important to put on the record that Queensland is the second lowest user of water in the basin. It uses less than five per cent. The only state or territory that uses less than us is the Australian Capital Territory. And one of the greatest uses of the resource in this town is as something to look at—Lake Burley Griffin. So everybody is exploiting the resource, and I would say that everybody is parochial about their exploitation of the resource.
We know that when you deal with an asset that people have borrowed money against the pressures are exacerbated. People have borrowed money against an asset and they have the expectation that that asset will be maintained, and they have borrowed money in a completely legal framework to develop that asset. It is absolutely fundamental in any economy that you underwrite the sustainability and the sanctity of what an asset is. If there is an asset that you have a mortgage against—an asset that you have spent most of your life paying off, an asset that is a conduit of wealth in a family from one generation to the next—and that right is taken away, then we have fundamentally changed the basis of a conservative society; we have usurped the right of ownership. It is very important in this bill that we deal with that right of ownership—and I believe we have—and that inherent belief of so many people that the asset that they own and have paid for is theirs and that, if somebody wants it, they have to buy it; they cannot take it from them.
If there is a strong community belief in and aspiration for the water to be allocated to other resources and a belief that that is for the betterment of the nation, then the nation must be prepared to put the money aside to purchase that asset. There cannot be an expectation that it can take that asset, because that is theft. We have had to deal with that in Queensland under vegetation laws, where assets owned by the individual have been vested in the state. Once they are vested in the state without payment—the belief in communal ownership of assets—that is communism, and I do not believe anybody supports that idea anymore. So, if you want it, you should buy it.
I would like to thank the minister for his support throughout debate on this bill. I will be completely frank: at times it was a very robust relationship, and I suggest that some of the 27 amendments before us today have resulted from pressures that were conveyed to me and Senator Boswell by the Queensland Nationals in relation to issues that they wanted brought to the fore. We have given of our best endeavours to do that, and those issues are reflected in some of the amendments that we have here today.
This has been an arduous and drawn-out process. In reality we note that this plan has bipartisan support. It is through consultation and discussion with the minister that the property rights of Queensland irrigators had to be secured. I would like to thank the minister for his work; he never closed the door to further consultation. It is also a reality—and I have to say this on the record for those in Queensland who are listening—that, in relation to some of the amendments that you may have wished me to pursue, I would possibly be the only voice; they would not get any further. There is a bipartisan feel behind this and there was no point of leverage that we could express. We had to do it through consultation and negotiation; it was the only alternative at our disposal.
There is at the end one issue, and I have notified the minister that I will put on record how it should be addressed. Of the 26 resource operation plans, 22 finish before the Commonwealth liability comes into place on 1 January 2015. This includes all four plans in South Australia, all four plans in Queensland, 14 out of the 18 in New South Wales, and because Victorians are not listed they will not be scheduled to the act. We need to allay the fear of this timing difference between the cessation of a plan and the start of the Commonwealth compensation on 1 January 2015. There is an inherent black hole in there, and it has to be addressed because that is the uncertainty that drives bank managers to be concerned and to start putting a discount on your asset. It has to be addressed.
We need to allay the fear that this timing difference has been carefully protected as an outclause for government responsibility for compensation over a government decision to reduce entitlement. I ask the minister to put on record how we will deal with this, as has been suggested by an intergovernmental agreement, and to commit the government to a bona fide resolve to pursue resolution on this issue. I will not ask a question in committee on this issue, as I expect the issue to be addressed in the minister’s closing remarks. I believe that, from negotiations that have been held over a period of time, that is the last outstanding issue that needs to be addressed, and I look forward to that comment. I look forward to the commitment by this chamber and the government to make sure that what we have is a future of sustainability and a future of the enshrinement of the property rights of water.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-08-16,"—The coalition federal government has taken the difficult and brave step of putting its hand up to fix the Murray-Darling water system. This is a historical, nation-building move backed by $10 billion. For over 100 years the Murray-Darling Basin has been managed between four states, with each state competing against the other to obtain the best outcome for their state. Over time this has led to a host of problems, including overallocations and neglected infrastructure.
For the first time there will be one Murray-Darling Basin Authority for the whole Murray-Darling Basin to plan the basin’s water resources, making decisions for the benefit of the basin as a whole rather than just for a state interest. The authority will prepare the basin plan in consultation with the basin states, including Queensland, and the wider community. This plan and the funding of the plan would not have been possible if not for the responsible economic management and disciplined policies of our federal coalition government—and I would like to mention that Labor has opposed every one of the government’s reforms and policies that have made our economy strong.
So far Labor and Kevin Rudd’s only ‘visionary’ input to Australia’s water solutions has been to cancel the construction of the Wolffdene Dam in Queensland in 1989 when he was an adviser to Wayne Goss, who at the time was the Labor Premier of Queensland. I am sure those in the south-east corner of Queensland, who are now on level 5 water restrictions, are still thanking him for that little piece of insight.
The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, has worked tirelessly with representatives from involved industries on a day-to-day basis to ensure that the Water Bill 2007 was workable and acceptable. He and his staff have also always been available for discussing and resolving the issues that my Queensland constituents and industry representatives have raised with me and Barnaby Joyce over this legislation.
The bills follow on from and incorporate the principles of the National Water Initiative and deliver on key proposals as per the National Plan for Water Security, which was announced by the Prime Minister on 25 January this year. From the announcement, there were some concerns from Queensland irrigators and their associated representatives. Since the announcement was made, Barnaby Joyce and I, and other coalition members, have been working constantly with them to address their concerns.
Water rights, as assets, underpin the value of any farming property. Without the surety of their water assets, their property values do not hold up. This issue is important to their future. As legislators, we need to ensure that we put a high value on these assets as an investment in the future of whole regions. With this in mind I requested the Prime Minister to a write a letter to the Premier of Queensland confirming that resource operation plans that were negotiated with the Queensland government would be honoured. The Prime Minister wrote that letter on 25 March 2007. The letter was the basis of our commitment to Queensland irrigators. When the Water Bill first came out, it did not meet the commitments detailed or implied in the letter. After many amendments and many consultations that Barnaby Joyce, the Queensland irrigators and I held with the office of the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, we now have a Water Bill that meets our commitment to Queensland irrigators.
It came down to two remaining concerns, which we resolved the other day. The first concern was that the Queensland resource operation plan would finish in September 2014 and the Commonwealth would not accept the risk liability until the beginning of 2015, leaving what the irrigators believed would be a three-month gap. As we cannot amend the state legislation, the Commonwealth will be requiring the agreement of the states—through intergovernmental agreements—to bring forward the risk liability. In Queensland’s particular case this will be to September 2014. That is the best that we have been able to do and I believe it should give the irrigators sufficient comfort—but it was not for the want of trying that we did not push it further.
The other remaining issue was an overland flow issue. There are a whole range of different water entitlements in Queensland and the irrigators were worried that some of these entitlements, including overland flows, were outside the national water plan’s definition of ‘tradeable entitlements’. The Commonwealth was sure that they were covered by the definition in the legislation but, in good faith, to remove all doubt we have included the word ‘authorised’ in 26 different parts of the legislation to ensure that the definition of ‘entitlements’ is covered. It now complies with the way that it is written in the Queensland legislation—so there can be no doubt. We have also included a further explanation of the definition in the explanatory memorandum just to be absolutely certain.
Around 15 to 20 issues have been addressed since the drafting of the Water Bill. We now have written confirmation from the QFF and the NFF of their support for the amended legislation. We have done our best—we can go no further. I believe that we have done our bit for the irrigators. We have achieved our commitment.
I will clearly state that the bill ensures that there will be no compulsory acquisition of water entitlements or allocations. The National Plan for Water Security underwrites property rights pertaining to water entitlements and prohibits compulsory acquisitions. Existing water entitlements will not be affected. The current state water share plans under the Murray-Darling Basin agreement will be guaranteed. This includes the resource operation plans in Queensland. The bill will establish a new role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor and enforce rules for water charges and market rules in the basin.
The bill gives us funding of over $3 billion to address overallocation and overuse of water resources in the basin. An amount of $1.6 billion has been allocated to on-farm efficiencies in irrigation in the Murray-Darling Basin. This is a comprehensive bill encompassing a range of sensible, practical initiatives for water reform that will benefit the Australian community long after we are all gone. It is not a quick political fix to a popular issue, as indicated earlier. We have worked hard to create this bill. It is yet another example of how the federal coalition’s good management will secure the future for the environment, the communities and the industries that rely on the Murray-Darling Basin.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-08-16,"—I want to briefly address the Water Bill 2007, which is the first water reform program that has been introduced into the parliament in 106 years. This is a nation-building bill, not just for our generation but also for generations to come. This bill will ensure the sustainability of one of our great national assets—one of our great natural assets. It will underpin our nation’s water resources and secure the future of industries and communities and the environments on which they rely.
I want to congratulate my Liberal colleague Malcolm Turnbull on his consultation, his determination and his ability in getting this bill to the parliament. It has not been easy. He consulted with all forms of politicians, with various industry groups, with the states—which is something in itself—and he has come up with this bill. I am proud that my Liberal colleague has been able to deliver a bill that many before him have not been able to. This bill contains the key proposals that are outlined in the National Plan for Water Security, which was announced by John Howard on 25 January this year. It addresses the modernising of irrigation and the overallocation and overuse of water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin, and it is supported by a $10 billion investment.
Forgive me: I get very frustrated and angry when I hear some of the speeches in this chamber from people who allegedly have some idea about this bill. Senator Allison did not even bother to attend the committee hearings on this bill, and her speech was loaded with inaccuracies. It seemed clear to me that her speech had been written by the Victorian government. She went on at length about the problems in the Murray-Darling Basin system and why they had not been addressed before this. But when there is a piece of legislation before the parliament that actually addresses the problems, she says, ‘There’s not enough consultation and it should have been delayed.’ She was also inaccurate in suggesting that the Victorian farmers were opposed to the bill. Clearly, if she had been at the committee hearing she would know that the Victorian farmers support the initiatives and the direction of the bill.
Everybody at the committee was concerned that the bill did not go as far as it could, but the only reason that it did not was that the Victorian state Labor government would not come in and play ball. Every other state government in the basin was prepared to cede its powers. Victoria would not, for what I can only determine, having heard the evidence, were pretty cheap political purposes. It should be rammed home: yes, there are some deficiencies in this bill; yes, everybody would have liked it to contain other things—and it would have contained other things had the Victorian government been prepared to cede powers as every other government did.
Senator Allison was criticising the bureaucracy and the duplication. Sure, we all know that. Most of that duplication and additional bureaucracy would have gone had the original intention been put into place. As for suggestions by several of the opposition speakers that there was not consultation, the consultation on this bill was enormous; in fact, the consultation—a bit like the with Aboriginal children’s legislation we have just been dealing with—has been going on for the last 20 or 30 years. But people have not been prepared to go ahead with it because it might offend some sensitivity; someone might not have been spoken to. Here is a government that on two issues this week has addressed the difficult positions, the difficult things, that people have been talking about for decades. We are doing it this week but what do we get from those who profess an interest in and a concern for the Murray-Darling Basin system? A criticism and an urge to delay it till we have yet further talks—more talks, more consultation; don’t do anything.
I was pleased in the committee session to be able to say to those who were sort of mirroring or predicting the concerns that Senator Allison was raising: ‘If this bill is this bad, do you want me to vote against it? Do you want me to propose that the bill be put aside, bearing in mind that there will be an election before the end of the year? By the time the new government led by Mr Howard is put in place and starts consultation you’ll be in the middle of next year, and it’ll be this time next year before we think about passing a bill; is that what you want?’ To a man, to a woman, the people at that inquiry all said: ‘No, do not talk anymore; do not delay. Go ahead with this because, while it is not perfect because of the Victorian government’s intransigence, it is a great start.’
I have often said I think we have been a bit wimpish. I would much rather have had a referendum put to the Australian public on this question—that the national government should take over management of our Murray-Darling Basin system, which crosses four states and is so important to all four. I have for several years attended meetings of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, and my attendance at those meetings simply confirmed that people were not interested in the Murray-Darling Basin system. The national government was, but the states all went there with particular agendas that were very parochial or, worse still, political. The state Labor ministers would gang up on the Commonwealth, hijacking them at times, just to score political points. As I sat through those meetings, I used to think: if only we could get a national arrangement that looked after the health of the river, the interests of those who are served by it, then we could get something done. And this bill does it. It establishes an independent authority which will have considerable powers, but not as many powers as we would have had if Victoria had come on board. We are still hopeful that, once this bill is passed and the intergovernmental agreement is made, Victoria may come on board and we can fix some of the difficulties in this bill that have been caused by the Victorian government’s intransigence.
We have the constitutional power for this bill. It is not as good as it would have been had the states ceded their powers, but we have been able to get this bill on the back of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The new authority will be one basin-wide institution. It will be responsible for planning the basin’s water resources and making decisions in the interests of the basin as a whole, not along state lines. As a Queenslander and one who travels widely in the Murray-Darling Basin part of Queensland, I know that most people in the basin—and Australia—want to have a system that is fair and healthy and that serves all of those that it is meant to serve.
The basin plan will be one of the tasks of the new authority, and the central element will be the introduction of a sustainable, integrated cap on groundwater and surface water diversions. The basin plan will set the limits on the quantity of water that may be taken from the basin water resources as a whole and for particular water resource plan areas. The cap will be enforceable by the authority in the interests of everybody. A Commonwealth environmental water holder will be established to ensure that water recovered through the rollout of the irrigation efficiency program and structural adjustment program of the national plan will be used for environmental water purposes, and this independent person or body will hold the water for the environment.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be involved, as my colleagues have mentioned. The Bureau of Meteorology, which I once had the honour of leading in a ministerial sense, will also be very involved. They will be putting their expertise into collecting up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive information on water use and availability across Australia. This is going to be critical to the input to the basin plan.
The bill provides for metering of stock and domestic water use under the basin plan. As the minister has previously confirmed, there is no intention to require metering of stock and domestic bores, except in very special circumstances where a groundwater system is under stress or where there are local disputes about water sharing. Those issues were canvassed in the National Water Initiative. In very rare cases where the metering of stock and domestic bores is warranted, the cost will not be borne by the landowner other than with his or her agreement. Governments will pick up the bill there.
Our objective remains to have a comprehensive Commonwealth water law. We will seek to negotiate that law through the intergovernmental agreement with the basin states. Under that agreement, the states will refer powers to underpin this comprehensive legislation within 12 months of signing.
—That is a long 10 minutes.
—Senator Sterle, your understanding of the time is about as good as your understanding of procedures in this parliament—very poor and very wanting. In spite of the interjections that seek to delay my speech beyond the 10 minutes that I allocated myself, I want to applaud the bill, applaud the minister and congratulate the Prime Minister on at last doing something about one of the major issues that have been confronting Australia since Federation. I commend the passage of the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2007-08-16,"—Firstly, I have to put on the record that I am a farmer and declare my interest—I have a water licence, unlike probably most people who are speaking to the Water Bill 2007. I strongly support this bill and the minister. I am aware that over many years—I got a water licence in 1968—water has been catastrophically mismanaged in Australia by governments of all persuasions. We are now going through the routine again of trying to find someone to blame, as we did with the Indigenous matter. We are all to blame. Every government in New South Wales has mucked up water, and a lot of that has been due to the fact that they did not understand the science of water—even the simplicity of the connectivity between groundwater and overland river water. We are just coming to terms with that now. In the US, that issue has been locked up in the courts for 20 years; it has provided a lawyers’ feast.
The Murray-Darling Basin, which this bill is about, represents 6.2 per cent of Australia’s run-off and 23,000 gigalitres, of which 13,000 gigalitres is extracted. It is seriously overallocated. So, whatever way you want to do the sums, the sums are not going to add up. So this legislation is very important to enable us to come to terms with that. In the committee hearing the other day, we were very grateful that all state governments were represented, with their correct bureaucracies, but not one of them has done any modelling on what it means if the CSIRO science is right and we lose between 3,500 and 11,000 gigalitres of run-off over the next 30 or 40 years. No-one has even thought that through, which is all the more reason why we need this legislation.
Victoria owned up that they were prepared to put in $1 billion and that they needed a further $1 billion. But, as I said many weeks ago, they are bloody stupid for not signing up. They can pretend that they are representing the interests of the irrigators but the fact is that the two representative bodies for irrigators at the hearing said that they agreed with the government’s position. You can hide behind all the bloody garbage in the world you like, but the fact is that this is very important legislation.
At the hearing the other day, I asked Peter Cullen to describe what an irrigation area in 2020 might look like. Also, given that there is a 50 per cent vagary in the science, the best of the worst-case scenarios is that somewhere between 3,500 gigalitres and 11,000 gigalitres will disappear from the system. What does that mean? I know what it means: it is going to be a catastrophe. We need to come to terms with that. If I can put in a little plug for the north, that is why we are looking at developing it.
I would also like to talk about some of the things in the legislation that are wrong and some of the things that might have to be handled federally, which is going to take more than political courage and require some robust use of this process. As we are not going to talk about this legislation in committee, I want to mention two things that ought to be changed in the legislation. I am not a lawyer. I am a worn out wool classer and a welder. In section 172(1), we should insert ‘The authority has the following functions: (a) to pursue the objectives of the act’ so as to give it more power. All those layers of lawyers out the back here might think there is something flawed with the English in that statement. It is a very simple statement. If we do not want this new body to turn into another Wheat Export Authority, which is a complete bloody failure, we need to give it some teeth. Also, in section 178(6), which refers to appointments, why can’t we say that members ‘may be’ and not ‘must be’ part time? If the right bloke comes along in the right circumstances, why wouldn’t we give ourselves the option to make him a full-time member? Best of luck to the wordsmiths.
For many years we have had a group of people in New South Wales above the wetlands and the Macquarie Marshes thieving water. We all know who they are. I asked the question in the committee hearing the other day, and the people from New South Wales said, ‘Senator, we’re working on that.’ Everyone knows who they are. You can go there and take beautiful colour photos of the water being diverted. As they send the water down to the Macquarie wetlands, you see it being diverted out onto pastoral properties. These are the sorts of things which, despite the politics, we have to have enough courage to deal with, and that is why I support this bill.
Another concern—and I will not describe the sort of sandwich which we have been given by the states, but is a pretty messy sandwich—is the hideaway of the problem that has occurred in places such as the Hay shire. Because of the separation of the water title and the land title, the rate burden will be taken from the people with the most capacity to pay the rates and given to the people who have the least capacity. The state government in New South Wales have no idea what to do about it. They put a moratorium in place for two years, they have provided no solutions and, I presume, they are hoping that under this act it will be the Commonwealth’s problem, which we will inherit from them—and I guess it will be. I can give one example of that for rate based purposes. A picture paints a thousand words. For example, a place in the Hay district—and I must confess that I have had a place there since 1967—has a 28,000-megalitre water licence. It has thousands of acres of irrigation in country that naturally and normally is dryland. There would be a sheep to four acres. It is beautiful sheep country. But now, it is probably four sheep to the acre, with the irrigation water.
Because of what is occurring in New South Wales with the separation of land and water titles and many of those water titles disappearing into office blocks in Sydney and all over the place—people up on the Gold Coast making a living out of them and all sorts of carpetbaggers—the people of Hay will be asked by the Shire of Hay, after the moratorium has been lifted, to pay rates for the wealth that is created by those water licences. So this particular property will get an 80 per cent reduction in its rating notice, and in the bill it has to pay, and that will be loaded onto people who have no water on their land. That is a crazy situation. As some members on this side of the chamber will be aware, I raised that issue in the party room the other day and the best we could get out of it was, yes, it is a problem. I would like to know what we are going to do about it.
Senator Barnaby Joyce will not be surprised to hear me say that the draft ROPs in some of the river systems in Queensland have had no science applied to them. They pretend the science has been applied. Peter Cullen was present in the committee hearing the other day. He is the standard bearer for the ROP in the Balonne, and he has been the most misquoted scientist in Australia. I think there should be a corruption inquiry if the draft ROP for the Balonne is implemented. I cannot see how an independent chair of the process can be a co-owner of the largest water licence that will be issued under the draft—it is still in draft form—with no science applied to it, for overland flow, in a system where the land flow eventually returns to the main stream, so it is the riparian right of someone downstream. This is a national disgrace. Do not ask me how it is compliant with the National Water Initiative, the ROP and the water resource plan of 2003. Do not ask me how it is compliant, because it is not. I asked John Cherry, who represents the Queensland farmers, that question the other day in the committee hearing—and, Senator O’Brien, you heard him—and he said, ‘We can’t answer that.’ And, when I asked the Queensland bureaucrats, they said, ‘We can’t answer that.’
How do you get an entitlement conversion to a licence, based on earthworks and capacity to harvest water when you do not have that capacity? What do you do? You have a commercial-in-confidence arrangement with your upstream neighbour and do it that way. I think it is a disgrace. As Peter Cullen said the other day, before that ROP is implemented there should, at the very least, be a full scientific study of that system. I have spoken to people such as Bobbie Brazil at the top of the system. They have given up. They said, ‘We couldn’t work it out with the bottom mob, so we just let them go.’ We need a full scientific review of that ROP before it is implemented. I think it would be a catastrophic fraud of the public purse to issue a licence for some 400,000 gigalitres and have to then retrieve it because we do not have the science. These sorts of issues will have to be dealt with under this plan and it will take a lot of guts to do it.
There are all sorts of state planning decisions, which is pretty scary. Given the emergency circumstances at present—and there is a catastrophic circumstance confronting many of our permanent plantings in the Murray Valley—you cannot help but feel overwhelmed by the concerns that farmers would have down there, given what Mother Nature is dishing out, according to the science. If you have a little mole on your arm and the doctor says, ‘It’s a melanoma, son; you’d better get it taken off,’ I think I would get it taken off. The scientists are telling us there is going to be a decline of between 25 and 50 per cent in the run-off in the Murray-Darling Basin, and we ought to have a plan to deal with that.
We had the announcement in Albury that they will tip the outflow from the Albury paper mill into the river, so the people down at Corowa, I presume, will be drinking the outfall. I do not know what science has been applied to that decision, but it sounds mighty odd to me. Much of this comes about because of the economic intimidation argument, so everyone is scared of the politics of it all. I understand there will be a full scientific review of the outfall of the Tasmanian pulp mill. I will look with great sensitivity at what it all means. I know that 200 tonnes a year of the most serious carcinogens and chemicals, out of 60,000 tonnes a day, will flow into Bass Strait. If I were a fish swimming around there, I would probably grow three heads and five legs.
So there is a lot of stuff that has to be dealt with. No-one should be in denial that we need this bill, and I commend the courage of the government. To say that it is somehow a political exercise is incorrect. This is another thing that is in the national interest for us to do. Obviously if there were no state borders we would not be here having this legislation; we would manage the system as Mother Nature designed it. Mother Nature did not design it to change the rules when it got to the bloody border. So there you go. I fully endorse the bill. I am very grateful to the minister for the way he has accepted approaches from people like Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce and for being patient with people like me. But my plea is that it just does not turn into another bureaucratic process that eats its head off.
—I think Senator Heffernan should withdraw the word ‘bloody’.
—I withdraw it.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-08-16,"—Family First believes Australia needs a plan to help fix the nation’s water problems and the key to that is fixing the Murray-Darling Basin. That plan needs to strike the right balance between the needs of all water users, including the main water users, who are the irrigators. Seventy per cent of water use is for irrigated agriculture, so there is a good argument that investment in infrastructure to help irrigators save water is one of the most important things we should do.
The Murray-Darling Basin is the home of Australia’s largest river system and the 15th largest river system in the world. It provides Australia with 40 per cent of its food supply and is often referred to as ‘Australia’s food bowl’. In a time of climate change and on what we hope is the tail-end of one of our worst droughts on record, the need for us to ensure that the Murray-Darling continues to be the lifeblood of Australia’s food bowl is all the more important.
We face a real problem within the Murray-Darling Basin. The amount of available water is falling and demand for water by irrigators, farmers, towns, industry and for environmental flows exceeds supply. Something needs to be done to address this problem. Currently the Murray-Darling Basin Commission sets a cap on the amount of water that can be taken out of the basin each year. These caps are not sustainable. They do not take into account all water sources, such as surface and ground water, and there is no way for the commission to enforce these limits. It is clear the system is broken and it needs to be fixed. We need a holistic strategy that treats the entire basin as one water supply and not just the sum of many parts. We need a strategy that can put an end to the difficulties faced by states, catchment areas and other groups that depend on the Murray-Darling Basin for their livelihoods. We need a system that can enforce caps on the amount of water taken out of the basin each year, with penalties that ensure compliance.
Family First believes this bill addresses many areas of concern. The plan proposes a single authority and sets a sustainable and enforceable limit on the amount of water that can be taken out of the basin. The government would give the Bureau of Meteorology power to assess and set the water information standards. It would also appoint the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to take control of water market trading with the aim of ensuring a fair and equitable market administered by an independent body.
While all states acknowledge the need for the federal government to assume control of the Murray-Darling Basin, there is obvious disagreement from some of the states, notably my home state, Victoria. Family First understands the Victorian government’s position. There is some merit in the Victorian government’s argument that it should not refer its powers to the Commonwealth. Simply, the state does not want to refer its powers to the Commonwealth because it has worked hard to establish a good irrigation plan. Over many years Victoria has built a reliable and highly structured water allocation system. It has kept its end of the bargain and has stayed within the set caps. Victoria’s farming industry is different from other Murray-Darling states. To have a successful dairy and horticulture industry, as Victoria has achieved, you need to secure water. Victorians cannot easily change to other crops to adjust to a water shortage. As a result, the Victorian government is concerned that the federal plan would replace its existing system with an inferior version that would not cater for these special needs in Victoria. Family First encourages both federal and Victorian governments to continue working towards reaching an agreement as soon as possible. Victorian farmers are concerned that because they have managed their water well they are at the greatest risk of losing from a national water deal.
It is important to have an overarching authority to look after water in the Murray-Darling, but changing the system is a risk to Victorian irrigators. They need to be convinced that change is worth while, and you cannot convince people of that unless you are willing to give them enough detail so they can see that for themselves. Why should the farmers and irrigators sign up to a deal where they bear the risk and have no guarantee of benefits? Seven months after the federal government’s announcement they still do not have that detail.
Family First is also concerned about the concept of water markets. What happens to farming families when they sell their water and their land is separated from water? Does the trading of water rights undermine the family farm? Does it mean that big business farms that can afford to buy water will survive while smaller family farms will not? Family First believes the Murray-Darling Basin plan sets out a direction for the future of our most important water asset. Without action, the Murray-Darling faces an uncertain future and therefore the irrigators and towns that draw their water from the system face a similar uncertain future. The government is likely to face significant hurdles in the adoption of this plan with the states, especially through challenges to the constitutional right of the Commonwealth to assume the control detailed in the bill.
While the bill is significant, the pending intergovernmental agreement will be almost as important, as it will address many of the details of the operation of the plan. It is disappointing that the IGA is not available so we can all scrutinise that detail. Family First has consulted widely on this legislation with irrigators, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the Victorian Premier, the minister and other groups. There is room within this plan for a positive outcome for all players, from the federal government through to the individual irrigators. Even though this plan is not the complete solution, it is a start. Family First will, therefore, support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-08-16,"—In the summing up, I will talk generally and then will seek to deal with some of the matters that were raised by honourable senators. The reforms embodied in the Water Bill 2007 before the Senate today represent the most significant reform to water management in the Murray-Darling Basin in over 100 years. For the first time in the basin’s history, one institution will be responsible for planning the basin’s water resources, requiring planning decisions to be made in the interests of the basin as a whole and not along state lines. The Water Bill and the National Plan for Water Security will accelerate the 2004 National Water Initiative, signed by all Australian governments. This bill will greatly enhance the Commonwealth government’s capacity to implement its commitments under international agreements such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The current governance model for the basin, which has remained largely unchanged since 1915, requires the agreement of all basin jurisdictions before any reforms can be implemented. It enables the parochial interests of one state to stand in the way of the common good. The waters of the basin do not respect state borders, nor should the way we manage them. The Water Bill establishes an expert independent Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The authority will develop a basin plan that will enable the waters of the basin to be managed as one interconnected system. The central element of the basin plan will be the introduction of a sustainable and integrated cap on groundwater and surface water diversions. The basin plan will set enforceable limits on the quantity of water that may be taken from the basin’s water resources as a whole and from particular water resource plan areas. The authority will consult widely with communities, irrigator groups and other stakeholders in the exercise of its functions, including the formulation of the basin plan.
The bill establishes a new role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in developing and enforcing consistent rules for water charging and operation of the market across the basin, consistent with principles agreed in the National Water Initiative. A Commonwealth environmental water holder is established by the bill. It will be the custodian of water access entitlements obtained by the Commonwealth through the savings generated under the irrigation refurbishment program and the overallocation funding provided for in the national plan. Under this bill, the Bureau of Meteorology will collect up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive information on water use and availability across Australia. The cooperation of basin states remains an integral element of this reform and for the effective implementation of the Water Bill.
I take this opportunity to thank the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts for their work on the inquiry into the Water Bill as well as the representatives of stakeholder groups, scientists and officials who appeared before the committee and made submissions to the inquiry. The bill has enjoyed strong support from a wide range of groups, including environmental interests as well as irrigators, which I think is a reflection of the government’s commitment to consultation throughout the formulation of this legislation.
Let me say that this is the first reform of its kind—the first time the Commonwealth government has reformed water management in Australia to give the Commonwealth powers over water management. This is the first fundamental reform of its kind and this historic legislation is only possible because the Howard government had the courage to implement it. Where the Victorian Labor government would not cooperate in the interests of the basin, the Howard government was determined to move forward with this much-needed reform. The reforms in this bill are needed to meet the future challenges facing water management in the Murray-Darling Basin, one of this nation’s great natural assets. With scientists predicting a hotter and drier future for southern Australia, these reforms will ensure the viability of the basin’s water-dependent industries. They will ensure healthy and vibrant basin communities and they will ensure the sustainability of the basin’s natural environment.
I will turn to some of the contributions that were made. I did have a few notes that I jotted down in relation to the Greens and Democrat contribution but, if I might say, Senator Ian Macdonald dealt with them quite well. I thank him for that contribution and remind honourable senators of that and indicate that I say, ‘Hear, hear!’ to that.
In relation to one other matter, I remind honourable senators that we have three-year parliamentary terms. As soon as you are in the last year of a parliamentary term, according to the opposition, everything that the government does seems to be election driven. It really seems, according to those opposite, that, after two years have clicked over, the government ought to just free-wheel, not introduce any new initiatives and not do anything. Of course, if we did that it would be a tired old government without any initiatives and without any legislative programs. So you do have a legislative program, you come up with new initiatives and of course then, according to the opposition, it is all election driven. What I would invite honourable senators to do is actually look at the legislation, see what is in it and judge it on its merits.
Senators Joyce and Boswell made contributions. I will respond to the matters raised by Senator Joyce. The Commonwealth will meet the commitments it made with the adoption of the national plan in February, but on the basis of the full referral of powers for implementing the plan. The Commonwealth has no intention of exposing irrigators or the states to liabilities they would not have assumed had the original intent to implement the national plan with full referral of powers by all basin states been realised. We intend addressing the issue of the National Water Initiative liabilities for new knowledge applied to water plans through the intergovernmental agreement. It is not appropriate that these be dealt with in the legislation. We are fully aware that in the case of Queensland, relevant water plans expire in September 2014. The challenge for the IGA will be in ensuring an appropriate share of liabilities between the Commonwealth and the states ahead of 2015. We will present the draft IGA to the states this week. Senator Joyce asked what is to guarantee that a future government will respect these arrangements. As the senator will know, we in this place—unfortunately, we think sometimes, but chances are it is fortunate in the total scheme of things—cannot commit future governments to any policies, programs, intergovernmental agreements or even legislation. Historically governments have respected commitments made through intergovernmental agreements.
—Except Western Australia in relation to the regional forest agreement.
—Yes—a point that I do acknowledge, but I will move on. Senator Heffernan raised some issues. I indicate to those opposite that my dealing with these matters in the second reading debate will mean that they will not be contributing through the committee stage. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s main role is the preparation and enforcement of the basin plan. Clause 20 of the bill sets out the purpose of the basin plan, which is to provide for the integrated management of the basin water resources in a way that promotes the objects of the act. The government considers that this requirement gives the MDBA responsibility for meeting the objects of the act within the scope of its functions. The government notes that meeting some of the objects of the act is more a responsibility of the ACCC or the Bureau of Meteorology than a responsibility of the MDBA.
In relation to clause 178, I indicate to the honourable senator that the structure of the authority reflects the workload and functions of the body. Should a full referral of powers be made then the structure of the authority would be reconfigured consistent with its expanded functions to include full-time membership. Retaining part-time membership of the authority will ensure that expenditure on its resourcing is commensurate with its functions.
In relation to Senator Fielding’s contribution, the final contribution, I engage with him in relation to the assertion that no detail has been presented. This is wrong. There have been seven months of consultation. There were over 50 meetings on the detail of the bill, including with irrigators across the basin. It would be fair to say, unfortunately, that the Victorian state officials provided little or no contribution. My colleague Minister Turnbull met several times with the National Farmers Federation, who represented the irrigators across the basin. Having made those comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WATER BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-08-16,"—by leave—I want to make a brief correction to something I said, just so it is on the record. In my speech I referred to amendments in the Senate; they were amendments in the other place, not in the Senate.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-16,"—I rise to speak on the APEC Public Holiday Bill 2007. I indicate that Labor will be supporting the bill because it relates to the security arrangements surrounding APEC. Australia was a foundation member of APEC and Labor were a driving force behind its establishment, so we are strong supporters of APEC and we welcome its return to Australia. But we acknowledge that there are serious security implications with holding it in Australia. This bill provides for a public holiday on 7 September 2007 to allow for the smoother and safer running of the event in Sydney. We will be supporting the bill so these arrangements can be put in place, which include the public holiday in the relevant local government areas. This bill seeks to recognise the public holiday for people under federal industrial instruments, to ensure that they are entitled to the public holiday. I understand that the state parliament will be doing a similar thing for those who are under state industrial arrangements.
Of course, the complexity of this is multiplied by the Work Choices legislation and the concerns about those whose entitlement to public holidays has been affected. We are moving a second reading amendment which seeks to highlight the concerns about Work Choices and, more importantly, about protection of public holidays and penalty rates for working on public holidays. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
                  “but the Senate condemns the Government’s failure to:
              (a)    ensure fairness at work and fairness beyond work through its inherently unfair Work Choices laws;
              (b)    provide proper protections from important Australian national public holidays, such as Anzac Day; and
              (c)    recognise the adverse impacts these unfair laws have had on working Australians, their families and the wider Australian community”.
Given the time, I will not delay the Senate by speaking to that at any length. I note, however, that the government have a range of amendments, which seems to indicate that there are still some concerns about this legislation and whether they have got it right. I will reserve my remarks on that until I hear what the minister has to say about that. Perhaps those amendments have already been incorporated—I am not sure. Anyway, Labor will be supporting the bill, and I have moved the second reading amendment.",SENATE,<title>APEC PUBLIC HOLIDAY BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-16,"—The Australian Greens also support the APEC Public Holiday Bill 2007, which is to ensure that public servants who are in the area affected by APEC on 7 September when it is officially declared a holiday get their due entitlements.
However, it is a proper time to assess whether or not this enormous disruption to the city of Sydney is warranted when there were such good alternatives available. Australia is much bigger than downtown Sydney, but to close down downtown Sydney—and there will be added disruption now because President Bush is coming two days early: it turns off your mobile phones automatically in some places as he sweeps by—
—Thank goodness.
—‘Thank goodness,’ says Senator Evans, but I suspect he will not be in Sydney. The cost of closing a city of the size and importance of Sydney, including its financial district, is extraordinary. It will run into hundreds of millions of dollars. It ought to be accounted for. APEC is a conference which could be described as, amongst other things, having a commitment to globalisation and market forces—that is, user pays—but there is no user pays involved in this at all. There is going to be an enormous cost on the community but no recompense for that. Part of the cost is involved in this legislation before us today. As an amendment to the opposition’s second reading amendment, I move:
At the end of the amendment, add:
“and considers that businesses should be compensated by the Federal Government for the economic loss caused by holding APEC in Sydney”.
On behalf of Senator Nettle I foreshadow a further second reading amendment, which is:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but given the enormous disruption and cost, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference should not have been held in the central business district of Sydney”.
This is common sense. There has to be some common sense brought into play, particularly in an age when such enormous security measures are taken. We have a fence being built in Sydney now. In the olden days they had the Great Wall of China. Then somebody came up with the Berlin Wall. Now Israel is partitioning Palestine. So Sydney suddenly gets a wall because President Bush is coming. Really? It is all so avoidable. Australia has such splendid places for conferences like this to be held without shutting down the business district of its major business city—excuse me, Melbourne. Maybe the supply of four-star hotels would do, if there were not enough five-star hotels. I understand that is one of the problems—really.
When the public domain, and the private domain on this occasion, is taken over in this way, there has to be some consideration taken. The Prime Minister is good on plebiscites. I wonder whether he considered a plebiscite with the denizens of central Sydney over this particular proposal. No, he did not—no consultation was taken here at all. I think we could have got a much better outcome, and a much more comfortable time here for the leaders from overseas, at other venues in this wonderful, great country of ours.",SENATE,<title>APEC PUBLIC HOLIDAY BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-08-16,"—To briefly recap: to facilitate the holding of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings being hosted in Sydney over the week of 2 to 9 September 2007, the New South Wales government has declared—and I stress: the New South Wales government has declared—a one-off APEC public holiday for the Sydney metropolitan area on Friday, 7 September. This bill ensures that all employees in the federal workplace relations system to whom the APEC public holiday applies receive on that day the public holiday entitlements provided under their industrial instrument.
The bill provides that any reference in federal industrial instruments to a public holiday is taken to include the APEC holiday. That is, it deems 7 September this year as a public holiday for these instruments. This means that all federal system employees who are affected by the APEC holiday will receive the same public holiday entitlements for this day as they would receive for other public holidays under their instrument.
Can I refer to the contributions that have been made in the form of the amendments. First of all, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate referred to industrial law changes. Part of that referred to the failure to recognise the adverse impacts that these laws have had on working Australians. I suppose such impacts include the creation of 380,000 new jobs in this country, the lowest rate of industrial disputation since records were taken and a 20.8 per cent increase in real wages under this government. If they are failures, we are glad to own them.
In relation to the foreshadowed amendment by the Greens, can I say that, as I understand it, the Mayor of Sydney is supportive of APEC and the New South Wales Premier is supportive of APEC. You have the three levels of government—local, state and federal—supporting it being held in Sydney. In those circumstances clearly it does have the support of the people, albeit that there will be some inconvenience associated with it.
The Greens are suggesting that businesses should be compensated for the economic loss caused by holding APEC. It will be interesting to see whether they are also supportive of businesses that make substantial economic gains as a result of the bonanza they will be reaping from APEC—such as the transport sector, restaurant sector, hospitality sector, hotel sector—somehow having to make an extra contribution to the Australian government. I think not.
In relation to the question of user pays with these conferences, basically it is user pays, because you do not have APEC in Sydney each and every time; it goes around all the various countries, so at the end of the cycle each country has borne, if you like, the financial burden—if there is such a burden. I think there are many positive economic spin-offs. If I can use this term, the love is shared around all the various APEC member countries. As a result I do not think that is a valid argument, with respect.
I indicate that the government commends the bill to the Senate and opposes the second reading amendment and the foreshadowed amendment.

In moving this amendment I point out, for Senator Abetz’s assistance, that the estimation of the cost of the APEC conference to Australia by the New South Wales Business Chamber has been put at over $1 billion and the negative impact on business has been estimated to be as much as $327 million.
