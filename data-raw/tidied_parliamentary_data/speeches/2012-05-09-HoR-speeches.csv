Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (13:45):  I appreciate the opportunity to rise and pay tribute to the guides in Parliament House who bring our school groups around. On this particular occasion I would like to welcome the Lakes Entrance Primary School students who are in the southern gallery at the moment.


I think I speak for all members when I say that we deeply appreciate the work the guides do. In this case, Monique is showing the children from Lakes Entrance around and giving them a very good understanding of our democratic process. I think it is a very important role that the guides play in this House, along with the Parliamentary Education Office. 


I think it is so important that young people in our community have the opportunity to come to our parliament and to perhaps see the positive side of the work we do as members of parliament, and also to see the rough and tumble of question time in just a few minutes.


I am sure that all members feel greatly honoured and privileged to represent their constituents in this place, and there is no better occasion than greeting a school group from your own electorate to get a sense of home coming to Canberra. I appreciate the children from Lakes Entrance's being here today and I welcome them in the public gallery and look forward to working with them into the future.


If I could have one message to the Lakes Entrance Primary School students who are here today, it would be to encourage them to take this opportunity in their educational life. Schools are a place where dreams come true. If you work your hardest and strive to be your absolute best, I am sure you can go on to achieve great things in life. I welcome you to Canberra and I hope you enjoy the rest of your visit.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:08):  Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to move a motion. It is:


That the House requires the Member for Dobell to make a statement to the House immediately, for a period not exceeding 10 minutes, about the matters arising from Fair Work Australia’s inquiry into the Health Services Union that relate to him.


Leave not granted.




Mr PYNE:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Sturt moving immediately—That the House requires the Member for Dobell to make a statement to the House immediately, for a period not exceeding 10 minutes, about the matters arising from Fair Work Australia’s inquiry into the Health Services Union that relate to him.


In question time today, the Prime Minister again turned her back on the members of the Health Services Union and instead stood up for the member for Dobell. We know that she could have announced today that she would ask the New South Wales Labor Party to pay back  to HSU members $267,000 of their money that was used in the campaign for Dobell in 2007. But we know that she will not, because, at this particularly precarious time for her leadership, while people like the minister for workplace relations and the member for Griffith are breathing down her neck, she will not take on Sussex Street.


Standing orders should be suspended today because the most urgent matter facing the parliament is its integrity and its reputation, and right now sitting in this chamber is a member—the member for Dobell—who has continued to fail to explain to the parliament his side of the story in one of the most tawdry matters that this parliament has ever had to witness or to deal with. Eight months ago, on 9 September 2011, the member for Dobell said, 'I will make a comprehensive statement in the near future.' He said that he would make a comprehensive statement in the near future, and now—eight months later—we are still waiting to hear it. We have moved on six occasions suspensions of standing orders to allow the member for Dobell to make a statement in this House so that we as members of parliament can be informed of his side of the story, and on six occasions the Labor Party and the crossbenchers have combined to defeat those suspensions of standing orders. Standing orders must be suspended so that we can debate this motion and pass this motion and so that the member for Dobell can keep his promise that he would make such a statement.


The Prime Minister has ducked and weaved on this issue faster than the full forward of the Western Bulldogs. We know now that the member for Dobell in fact excused himself from the caucus and that it was the member for Dobell who offered to suspend his membership of New South Wales Labor Party, and yet the Prime Minister in her statement to the press that she referred to in question time today insisted that in fact she had taken action. We know now that the Prime Minister was being her usual tricky self—tricky Julia.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Manager of Opposition Business will withdraw, and he will refer to the motion before the House.




Mr PYNE:
  I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. The reason standing orders must be suspended and this motion debated is that the parliament has a right to know why we should not have suspended the member for Dobell yesterday. He needs to be given the opportunity today in this parliament to speak for just 10 minutes to put his side of the story so that we know as members of parliament that we should not have suspended him yesterday—a motion that was defeated by the Labor Party, who yet again sided with the member for Dobell, as the Prime Minister did today. It will give the member for Dobell, if this motion is carried, the opportunity to explain that fabled line that must be crossed—a line that the Prime Minister could not explain and that Jason and the Argonauts would find difficult to find should they seek to look for it. The Prime Minister said on 30 April, and I referred to this in question time:


… I can tell you very clearly now what that election will be about. It will be about who you stand for, whether you stand for the privileged few or whether you stand for working Australians and their families.


The member for Dobell can explain in this House today whether he is one of the privileged few that the Prime Minister is standing up for or one of the battlers—one of the battlers in the HSU; one of the 77,000 average members of the HSU who get paid something like $500 a week while this member for Dobell raked in $500,000 of HSU members' money over a period of time.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt is shouting, and there is no need, and he is straying greatly from the suspension.




Mr PYNE:
  The reason that standing orders should be suspended is that the allegations which have been made against the member for Dobell and the findings that have been made by Fair Work Australia about the member for Dobell are so serious that they must be tested in this parliament and he should be required to make a 10-minute explanation to this parliament, because these are the most serious allegations that a member of parliament can face. They are allegations of corruption. They are allegations of the misuse of HSU members' money. They are findings of Fair Work Australia.


He needs to explain how it is that, when he was the national secretary of the HSU and when he was negotiating for his members to receive a meal allowance of $11.40 a day, he was using the HSU credit cards to pay $550 for meals at Forty One in the Sydney CBD and spending thousands of dollars of members' money. While they are on their meal allowances of $11.40, he is spending their money on overseas travel, on escort agencies, on fine dining and on personal items. We as members of parliament have a right to know his side of the story which so besmirches the reputation of this parliament. He needs to explain how it is that while he could find $276,000 of HSU members' money to spend on his own election in Dobell he was facilitating an agreement so that his workers could clean bedpans in aged-care facilities and hospitals at $500 a week. All members of the HSU would have liked to be the member for Dobell if they had known they could have found $276,000 of their own money to campaign for it, but no. He was lucky enough to be the national secretary and a favoured son of Sussex Street. Consider this. This is the reason that the suspension of standing orders should be carried so that he can explain himself to the House: it would have taken an HSU member 12 weeks of cleaning a hospital to pay for the escort services that the member for Dobell is alleged to have paid for—according to findings of Fair Work Australia—with their union dues in just one night. 


To vote in favour of this motion would be a demonstration of support for the 77,000 members of the Health Services Union. To vote against it is a vote for continuing the protection racket that exists around the member for Dobell and that has protected him in this place through three years of questioning from the opposition. If the Prime Minister truly believes that the next election will be about who stands for the privileged few and who stands for working Australians, she would want to stand up for working Australians today and direct her caucus to support this motion. Why wouldn't she want to do that? Why wouldn't the crossbenchers and the Labor Party caucus vote for a motion that simply calls on the member for Dobell to have 10 minutes to explain his side of the story in one of the most tawdry episodes ever to besmirch the parliament? To vote against this motion—to vote this motion down, if that is the decision of the Labor Party and the crossbenchers—will mean essentially a continuation of the protection racket of the member for Dobell. What is the motivation for that in the Labor Party? He is no longer a member of their caucus. Why would the Labor Party stand up today and argue against a motion that asks an Independent member to explain himself to the parliament? The truth is that he is not an Independent member at all. He is as much a member of the Labor caucus today as he was 10 days ago. The Labor Party continues to accept his vote. They know that he is as much a Labor man today as he was 10 days ago. Nothing has changed except that the Prime Minister found out about the Fair Work inquiry report—when it was coming out and what was in it—and she did everything she could to try to dispatch this tar baby which has so damaged her government. 


I cannot imagine anyone in the House wanting to turn their back on the 77,000 members of the HSU by voting against this motion, and I cannot imagine some of the members of the Labor Party caucus of good conscience seriously wanting to see their vote recorded as part of the continuing protection racket that protects the member for Dobell. The member for Banks is a good man; he knows in his conscience that it is wrong to continue to protect the member for Dobell, and I have known him for 20 years. He knows that members of the HSU deserve better than that, and I call on him and other members of the caucus to stand with the opposition and require an explanation. If they do not, they will confirm what Mark Latham once said— (Time expired)

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:18):  I second the motion. Standing orders must be suspended, because the allegations contained in the Fair Work Australia report go to the heart of the integrity of this parliament. The report has found, amongst other things, that the member for Dobell misused the funds of the Health Services Union to support his election to this parliament. This is a very serious allegation. Let me be clear. A member of this parliament has been accused of a serious fraud that underpins his presence in this place. That is why standing orders must be suspended, because this finding alone surely calls into question the member's legitimacy in this chamber. We are not talking about trivial sums of money. We are not talking about small amounts of union resources. Fair Work Australia has found that the member for Dobell misappropriated around $270,000 for the purposes of his campaign for the 2007 election so he could take a place in this chamber. 


There must be serious doubt about whether the member for Dobell would have been successful in his preselection and in the 2007 general election had he not misused those union funds, as found by Fair Work Australia—the government's own creation. This is not a matter that can be swept under the carpet or ignored, and that is why standing orders must be suspended, because the Prime Minister has repeatedly vowed her personal support for the member for Dobell. Recently she claimed that a line had been crossed that necessitated the suspension of the member for Dobell from the Australian Labor Party—although the Prime Minister is yet to answer the question as to whether Labor is still paying his legal fees.


The Prime Minister also claimed that she understands that 'matters concerning Mr Thomson have caused Australians to become concerned about standards in public life'. The Prime Minister said that Australians are 'seeing a dark cloud' when they look at this parliament. If we conclude—and for the sake of this debate let us assume the Prime Minister's version is truthful—that the Prime Minister judged the investigation and the findings of Fair Work Australia sufficiently serious to render the member for Dobell unfit to attend meetings of the federal Labor caucus, how is it that the Prime Minister believes that the member for Dobell is fit to continue to take his place in the parliament?


He is unfit for the Labor Party room but the Prime Minister believes that somehow he remains a fit and proper person to take his place in the parliament and to continue to provide his vote in support of this government.


It is important to note that the member for Dobell has consistently proclaimed his innocence. As recently as 29 April the member for Dobell said: 'I am confident that in a reasonably short period of time the truth will out and I will be vindicated.' It is worth noting that that statement was prior to the release of the Fair Work Australia report—and, rather than being vindicated, the member for Dobell has been subjected to dozens of damning findings of alleged serious misconduct during his time as the National Secretary of the Health Services Union. The fact that these allegations are crucial elements of the circumstances involving the election of the member for Dobell to this parliament, necessitates an explanation from the member to this House.


Standing orders must be suspended to provide the member with the opportunity to explain why he considers the Fair Work Australia report to be a 'joke' and why it found that he had illegally used $200,000 of HSU funds to employ staff to work on his election campaign and $70,000 to directly support his election campaign, $103,000 of unexplained cash withdrawals and dining, entertainment and the procurement of prostitute expenses of more than $80,000. It is a matter of the gravest importance for the parliament for one of the elected members to have been found by an independent government authority of having fraudulently funded their campaign to gain admittance to our national parliament. Those of us elected into parliament are greatly honoured to have the opportunity to serve our electorates. I respectfully urge the members of the crossbench to support this motion; otherwise, the dark cloud will be a dark winter of discontent. (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:24):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.



Mr Abbott interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Leader of the Opposition will stop constantly interjecting across the table. The Leader of the House has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition is happy to interject but was not happy to be associated with this motion to suspend standing orders before the House today. Just like yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he can allow the opposition to get down into the gutter day after day and somehow it has nothing to do with him—distancing himself from it. But the fact is we know that there is no process, no convention, no tradition and no institution that this Leader of the Opposition will not trash in his pursuit of power.


What we see day after day—now for the 53rd occasion—is an attempt to suspend standing orders. This is the day after the national government has handed down our budget. It is a significant budget that returns the budget to surplus whilst providing support for wealth creation and opportunity. Today we had one question about the budget from the shadow Treasurer and one question from the shadow finance minister about the budget, and that is it—nothing else to say on the day after the federal budget. Surely, that is unprecedented in Australia's history?


What this motion is really about is trying to ensure that time is taken up rather than getting on to the substance that we should be dealing with arising out of the budget produced last night. This morning on the schoolkids bonus budget bill debate, we had two opposition members down to speak—just two. But as the day went on the list grew. Up to 19 speakers from the opposition are now on the list, dragging out debate because they do not want the TV news tonight to show them saying no to families. That is what they want to do. That is their priority. The fact is that that is the issue that we should be getting on to after we have the MPI from the opposition—which is of course also about the budget.


The opposition come in here day after day and want, in terms of their motion to suspend standing orders, this parliament—they have backed off from yesterday's motion but it is still pretty consistent—to determine what are quite rightly legal matters. We do have a separation of powers. Indeed, their rhetoric is completely inconsistent with what they said prior to their own issues. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, in speaking about Mary Jo Fisher, said:


The matter is now before the courts where I understand it will be contested and she should be extended the presumption of innocence.


That is what he said on 24 July 2011. And then of course we know that he went on to say that she did not vote on anything, even though we know that she voted on everything, including the clean energy bills.


Indeed, Senator Robert Hill had this to say about Mal Colston: 'We should not forget the rules of natural justice in this matter.' John Howard had this to say about Mal Colston:


... at the moment he’s been treated worse than anybody else who’s charged with a crime. I mean nobody else has been treated like that. He is, at the moment, being denied the presumption of innocence.


But you do not need to go any further than the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition had this to say on 9 March 2007 about Mr Laming:


The matter is really now before the police and perhaps the Criminal and Misconduct Commission in Queensland, and let's let those authorities make their investigations and come to any conclusion.


He's a backbench member of parliament and I think he's entitled to stay in the parliament until these bodies have come to their conclusions.


Indeed, in 2007, former Prime Minister John Howard said about those same issues that using parliamentary privilege to make allegations against political opponents is 'the cheapest game in the book'.


The member for Dobell has indicated that he will make a statement in his own time and he should be left to do that. That is what the member for Dobell has said and that is entirely appropriate given the circumstances. Craig has said he will make a statement; he should be left to do that. That is what we would expect under all circumstances. But if we go down the road of trying to present this place as judge and jury then we destroy the separation of powers and the balance between political representatives and the judicial wing, which is a very dangerous step indeed. When the member for Sturt got on his feet and asked for leave to move a motion, for a second there I thought about letting him do it. I thought about granting him leave and then amending it so that he could explain to the parliament his association with James Ashby and what went on in the Speaker's office that evening and in subsequent liaisons between Mr Ashby and various members of the coalition.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the suspension motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The fact is we should not go down the road of saying that this place should replace appropriate judicial processes, or pass resolutions calling upon people who have legal rights and who are entitled to get legal advice which is not prejudiced by any decision of this parliament. I said yesterday that if any of the allegations—which are serious—against the member for Dobell are proven, then he should face the full force of the law. But it is not up to this parliament to determine what those circumstances are. It is not up to this parliament to make judgements about a whole range of issues or legal actions which are before the court, whether they concern members of the government, members of the opposition or crossbenchers—either the member for Indi or any other member of parliament. It is not up to us to go down that track.


I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition understood that, given his history of understanding the importance of independent judicial processes, rather than assuming that allegations, once made, are proven. That is why we should reject the suspension of standing orders. The member for Dobell has indicated that he will make a statement before the parliament; it should be left at that. Think about the consequences of a majority government being able to make decisions in their tactics committee about doing things which change the democratically elected balance of a parliament. Think about the consequences of that. That is why this suspension motion should not be supported.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:45):  Last night the Treasurer introduced his fifth budget, which he was proud to say stayed true to his Labor ideals. I have to say it was a true Labor budget. It was confused and full of deceit, made promises and broke promises, and failed to mention that it was increasing tax and increasing debt. This will be remembered as the carbon tax budget—except there was no mention of the carbon tax in the budget speech. It will raise $24 billion in this budget.


Importantly, it is also the case that the handouts that the government announced last night, which were dressed up as student tax rebates or increases in family tax payments, are all about the carbon tax and have nothing to do with the proclaimed intention. Equally importantly, it was a budget that had no coherent economic strategy to drive growth in the economy, to lift productivity or to create jobs.


Australia is crying out for leadership to restore confidence to get its economy performing at its very best. Economic growth under Labor has been very poor, averaging 2½ per cent or less in its first three years. This is an underwhelming record at a time when Australia is benefiting from the highest terms of trade in several generations and record demand for its exports from overseas. Productivity has stalled. GDP per hour worked in the final quarter of last year was lower than two years earlier. And what about jobs? In 2011, there was no growth at all. It was the first time in 20 years that no new jobs had been created.


So what has the Treasurer done to restore stronger growth, kick-start productivity growth and lift job creation? The answer is that he has set the bar pretty low. He has promised that the economy will grow by 3¼ per cent next year. That is on the upside of trend, and we would be able to generate growth of at least trend or even higher after years of below-trend growth if we created the conditions for businesses to invest, grow and take on more workers. Clearly the Treasurer has no confidence that he has the skills or the policy to do that. His track record suggests that he will undershoot even his relatively low bar. In last year's budget he forecast growth this year of four per cent. He has now revised that down to three per cent. But even this looks too strong given the weak growth in the first half of the year and market estimates for another tepid quarter of growth in March.


Certainly the Treasurer's ambitions for job creation suggest he really expects only modest economic growth. The unemployment rate is now expected to increase from the current 5.2 per cent to 5.5 per cent and remain there for two years. On the morning of budget day—just yesterday—the Treasurer said, 'It makes sure we support jobs.' I remember last year, when he said the budget was all about 'jobs, jobs, jobs' and he forecast growth in jobs of 500,000 over two years. Not only has he failed to reach that target; he is nowhere near it, with an expected and revised estimate of just 200,000 jobs being created. His track record suggests that we should be sceptical even of that more modest ambition.


And yet the Treasurer wants us to believe it is a 'jobs budget'. Of course, he has had many descriptions. It started off as a 'tough budget', but he does that every year. Then he said it would be a 'responsible budget'. Then he said it would be 'a budget that will whirl the economy back to a fiscal surplus'. Then he alluded to the fact that it was a 'Robin Hood budget'. And then it was 'battlers' budget'. This, of course, is the way the Labor Party does it. They use that invective to try to describe something that they cannot describe themselves.


The biggest flaw with this budget is its reliance on the continuation of the mining boom. It assumes that the terms of trade will stay close to highs so that company tax receipts and mining tax receipts continue to be high. The terms of trade assume a decline in 2012-13 of 5.75 per cent, and 3.25 per cent the following year. However, the government's own sensitivity analysis confirms that a fall in the terms of trade of around four per cent would reduce the underlying cash surplus by $3.4 billion in the first year and $7.1 billion after that. A relatively small decline in the terms of trade from record highs is going to wipe out the government's claimed surpluses. This just shows how critical the mining boom is to the government's fiscal strategy and how precariously balanced the budget is.


I could compare this government's lack of vision with the coalition's strong agenda to drive economic growth, productivity and employment. Our first step in government will be the restoration of sound public finances by cutting the waste, reducing the spending and paying down public sector debt. Secondly, we will lower taxation to enhance the rewards for effort and to reduce the fiscal drag on the economy. Thirdly, we will have a strong productivity agenda with higher labour force participation, reduced red tape and the facilitation of further restructuring of industry. Fourthly, we will facilitate even stronger engagement with our trading partners, with a particular focus on Asia. The coalition has clear plans to grow the economy and create jobs. We have done it before and we will do it again.


As I said, the Treasurer claimed at first that this would be a tough budget, as he does every year. First, of $33.6 billion of so-called savings over the forward estimates, more than half are increased or new tax measures. There are six new or increased taxes in the budget, taking the grand total since the government came to office to 26 new or increased taxes. The government always reaches for the tax lever in order to fill a budget hole. Second, spending this year will be $100 billion higher than when the coalition left office, and yet Labor said that the Howard coalition was a big-spending government. At no stage in the last few years, or over the next four years, does the government get anywhere near the levels of the last year of the Howard government in terms of percentage of GDP in expenditure. This is not a tight budget. How can it be when there has been an alarming deterioration in the numbers over the past year? Last year's budget forecast was an underlying deficit of $22 billion for this year. That has now doubled to $44 billion, the third highest deficit on record. The cumulative deficit under Labor since they have been in office is $174 billion. 


What is worse is that the tiny surplus of just $1.5 billion that they are claiming they will deliver next year has clearly been manufactured. First, it relies on a $39 billion surge in revenue, of which $34 billion is tax. Second, they have shuffled money out of 2012-13 into the current financial year. We first identified this in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, but the government have dreamed up new measures. These include the schoolkids bonus, shifting around $662 million from next year into this year, and $1.2 billion of financial assistance grants to local government that has been brought forward from July to June in order to avoid next financial year. Of course, the government have raided the hollow logs, taking $750 million extra out of government business enterprises next year as a special dividend, including from the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


The heart of the deceit in this budget is that the debt continues to rise even though the government claim it is going to be in surplus. How can that be? The Treasurer had a rather awkward moment in question time today when asked about how much gross debt is going to be. When it was related to the debt limit that is imposed by this parliament, predictably he got the figure wrong by responding with market value instead of face value. That is what you would expect from this Treasurer. He does not understand the markets. He accuses us of not understanding them, but he does not understand them. What we do know is that, if projects like the National Broadband Network and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation were included in the budget bottom line, on his own numbers the budget would remain in deficit to 2014-15. That is one of the reasons that net debt continues to rise next year and the year after to a peak of $145 billion, the highest on record. That is why the government have flagged that they will need to increase the debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion. What is it with the Labor Party and credit cards? Whether it be a credit card from a union or a credit card from the Australian people, they cannot help but smoke the credit cards. In this case, they are doing it with taxpayer money. 


They are indifferent to the impact of that sort of challenge. Last year the Treasurer called the increase in debt 'tiny'. He went on to say, 'It's very low,' minutes later on 2GB. Later on Sky News he was asked the peak debt level and he did not know the answer. I can assure the Treasurer that the taxpayers of Australia think debt is a very big deal. Repaying the debt is a big task, and the Treasurer claims he will pay it off by the end of the decade. I said earlier today on radio, 'Pigs might fly'—although I concede that pigs are more likely to fly these days, because last night they increased the pig slaughter levy, which is another hidden tax increase. To pay off the debts the government will have to deliver surpluses bigger than one per cent of GDP for the next six years. The cost of interest is $8.2 billion a year to 2015-16—that is, $22 million a day that Australian taxpayers have to find just to pay the interest on Labor debt.


But what about the broken promises? The government not only made new promises last night but broke the promises they had already made. The one that is ringing in our ears is the commitment to company tax cuts. The Prime Minister herself said only two months ago in this House:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.


On over 70 occasions the Treasurer has said that he would be introducing legislation to cut company tax. We are waiting for it. The Greens have already indicated that they would support company tax cuts for small business. But no: the Treasurer is trying to lay it on us by blaming us for not passing it. The legislation never came to the parliament. It is like the Malaysia solution. We are still waiting for the legislation the Prime Minister was daring us to vote against. We are also still waiting for this company tax cut legislation which the Prime Minister says we voted against. We have not even seen the legislation. I thought the government had abandoned its plan to cut company tax, paid for with another tax, but the budget is still warm—delivered only last night—and the Prime Minister was on Sky News's Agenda saying: 'We're open to company tax cuts. We'll engage in further discussion.' So she is changing the budget. Normally under Labor the budget lasts from Lateline to lunchtime, but it did not quite make it past the clock on this day.


What we find is that Labor are playing and fiddling with the numbers. They are shuffling money about. The education tax rebate now has nothing to do with education and the family tax benefit part A and the allowance increases have nothing to do with giving people a fairer share of the mining tax. They are all about compensation for the carbon tax, the tax that dare not speak its name in the budget or in the budget speech. There is no clear, articulate strategy to grow the economy. There is nothing that reduces the cost of living for everyday families and there is nothing in the budget that creates jobs. There needed to be an economic strategy that Australians could believe in, that helped to give Australians confidence that the volatility offshore is not going to affect their everyday lives. Instead it was a budget that had handouts but claimed to be tough. It was a budget that has left Australians confused. It was a budget to save Julia Gillard's job instead of the jobs of everyday Australians. (Time expired)

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (16:00):  It gives me great pleasure to rise to contribute to this matter of public importance. The matter before the House goes to the question of the government's economic management. I am very proud to stand here just the day after the Treasurer handed down a budget that will return to surplus. We all know that there is no greater symbol of the strength of an economy than being able to demonstrate that a budget is returning to surplus. That is something that we are very proud of. 


It is interesting that the member for North Sydney's contribution today had a lot of huff and puff and the usual bluster that you get from him. It is his modus operandi. But when it came to actually putting some facts on the table, there was not a lot happening. He squibbed the central challenge that the coalition have to face on the question of a surplus because the central question that has to be answered by those opposite is whether or not they are committed to a surplus. That is the point that he did not address. It is an important point, a point whose answer I believe the Australian people have a great and strong interest in knowing. Are the coalition committed to a return to surplus?



An opposition member:  Well why?




Mr BRADBURY:
  I hear the member opposite say, 'Well why?' Perhaps his colleagues can take him aside and give him a lecture in economics 101. I am sure the member for Dunkley would be able to simplify economic principles in such a way as to explain to the member opposite the importance of returning the budget to surplus.


But on this question of a return to surplus, those opposite have been a bit shifty and very inconsistent. Let us have a look at some of the commentary that we have seen from them. When asked this question of whether or not the coalition would return the budget to surplus, the member for Goldstein—who is with us in the chamber—said, 'Well, it just depends.' So there we have it from the member for Goldstein. It just depends. When the member for North Sydney—who has just left the chamber—was asked the question, he said, 'Maybe.' Then when the Leader of the Opposition was asked the question, he said, 'Well ,we will do it as quickly as possible.' But then when Senator Abetz was asked the question, he said, 'Look, we're not in the business of making extravagant promises.'


The promise that Senator Abetz says is extravagant is exactly what this government has delivered—a surplus budget. We will return the budget to surplus. We have done that in the budget was handed down. But we have heard the various mixed messages from those opposite on this question of whether or not they are committed to returning the budget to surplus.




Mr Robb:
  Defending your budget.




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member for Goldstein says he is defending our budget. That is nice of him to do that. But contrary to the already conflicting messages from those opposite that I have just stated, I note that on 18 April 2012 on ABC 24 the member for Hasluck said, 'I'm not totally supportive of finding a surplus at this point in time,' just to add even more confusion to the picture. The member for Goldstein raises his eyebrows as if to say the member for Hasluck is not a contributor to the economic team, but they could not do any worse, so maybe they should give him a seat at the table when it comes to being a contributor to the economic team.


On the question of economic management this government has a very proud track record. The member for North Sydney alluded to the question of jobs. Let us talk about jobs. Let us talk about the very significant role that government played in intervening and investing in supporting jobs through the global financial crisis. Since we have come to power, 750,000 jobs have been created in this country. At the same time, through the global financial crisis, 27 million jobs have been shed across the global economy. Those opposite do not want to hear this. They do not want to hear about the jobs that we have saved, working with the Australian people, working with the business community, investing in the skills and the labour of those who are actively participating in our workforce. They do not want to talk about that because they are not interested in the jobs of hardworking Australians.


In fact, when we handed down the stimulus package, when we came into this place and we voted for the package, the Leader of the Opposition did not even bother to turn up. He missed the vote. When he was quizzed about why he missed the vote, it became evident that he was up in the parliamentary dining room having a few drinks with, amongst others, the former Treasurer and he fell asleep. He fell asleep and missed the vote on the stimulus package. This is the package that we have heard those opposite seek to discredit so much, what has been  one of the most effective responses to the global financial crisis. People all around the world are looking at what has been achieved in this country and the fact that today we are looking at an economy that has grown significantly from the economy that existed pre-GFC. Many economies around the world are struggling to return to pre-GFC levels, yet Australia has gone well and truly above that. At the same time we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation and the benefits of contained inflation were recently passed on in the form of a cut to the cash rate. The member for Goldstein is in the business of giving the green light to the banks to jack up interest rates. He is the No. 1 cheerleader when it comes to making the case for rate hikes. He might have been pulled into line. He went suspiciously quiet for a couple of weeks. I did not hear any response from him when the Reserve Bank did cut the cash rate. He was missing. We could not find him anywhere.


I want to talk about our record. That 50 basis point cut and the interest rate cuts that have been passed on to working Australians mean that a family in Australia today with a mortgage of $300,000 is paying $3,000 a year less in repayments. So, if you are the average family out there in Australia, you are paying less on your mortgage today than when those geniuses opposite were in office. Let's look at taxation. Those opposite make the allegation that we are the highest-taxing government. Taxation, as a proportion of GDP, is lower today than it was when they left office. In fact, if you look right across the forward estimates, taxation as a share of GDP—that is, overall levels of taxation—are lower under us than they were when those opposite were in power. So, when they talk about the new taxes, that is all good and well, but look at the tax base. Look at how much tax is being collected as a proportion of the economy. When you look at that you will see that this government is a lower-taxing government than that which preceded it. From 1 July, someone on $50,000 a year will be paying $40 a week less in tax. We have established that we are paying less on mortgages because interest rates are lower. We have established that people are paying less tax because tax is lower today than it was when we came to office.


Let's have a look at pensioners. What is the position of a single age pensioner? Let's have a look at that. As a result of the changes that we made—a historic increase in the pension—a single age pensioner today is receiving $4,000 a year more than they were in 2009. You can go back even further to when those opposite were last in office and it is an even bigger increase. But from 2009 to today, a single age pensioner has $4,000 a year more than they had in 2009.


Those opposite talk about management of the economy. Let's talk about the things that we have done that impact on the lives of working men and women around this country. Let's look at the education tax refund, which we have sought to refine and put into a form that delivers an even greater benefit to a greater number of people. Those on the other side did not support the education tax refund in the first place. It was not their idea, and if it is not their idea they will not support it. But now we have decided that there is a better way to deliver it, and they want to stand between the Australian government and the Australian people to block people getting that relief. They talk about cost-of-living pressures, and there are many cost-of-living pressures that families are facing out there, but when it comes to providing genuine, timely and targeted relief in the form that we are proposing, they want to vote against it. How can you justify coming into this place and voting against delivering cost-of-living relief to families? How can you do that? They should go back to their electorates and look the families in their electorates in the eye. They should be ashamed of what they are doing. They know no bounds with their inconsistency.


Those opposite came into this place day after day opposing a tax cut for business. I see the shadow minister for small business is sitting opposite. He is hanging his head in shame. I can appreciate the shame that he feels. When it came to supporting a tax cut for business, the Liberal Party—historically, at least allegedly, the party of business and small business—said no. They said, 'We can't support a tax cut when the revenue has come from the mining tax.' That is their principle. They are very principled people on the other side. They say, 'If the revenue comes from the mining tax, we don't care what you spend it on—even if it's a company tax cut—we can't support it.' That is what they say. We say, 'If you're going to block the company tax cut, we'll redirect the revenue that we collect with the mining tax and we'll deliver cost-of-living relief to families.' And what do those opposite say? They say, 'We think that's a good idea.' As much as I applaud them supporting the government's measure, there is a significant inconsistency there. The inconsistency is that they said that they would vote against the MRRT and would vote against all the expenditure measures, but now they are saying that they will support the expenditure measure.


When you have a $70 billion black hole—



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member for Goldstein intervenes. He does not want to talk about the black hole, although it was $70 billion. The member for North Sydney passed around a few different details. He told someone it was $50 billion, he told someone else it was $60 billion and he told someone else it was $70 billion. When the $70 billion figure was released and leaked, he knew that it was the member for Goldstein. That is the inconsistency and the division that exists in relation to economic management on the other side. They will not commit to a surplus.


The member for Goldstein is going to go to the dispatch box shortly and he will tell us whether those opposite are committed to a surplus. In fact, last night he was saying, '$1.5 billion—that's not a surplus. $15 billion is a surplus.' So, when are they going to deliver a $15 billion surplus? They have a $70 billion black hole, which, as a result of the member for Goldstein's interview last night, has just become an $85 billion black hole. Our $1.5 billion surplus will increase over the forward estimates. The member for Goldstein says, 'Well, that ain't a surplus.' The challenge for the opposition is that tomorrow evening the Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity to come into this place and set out an alternative plan. It is important that he does that because he has some work to do. There is a $70 billion crater—they know it, and they are hoping that they skate into office without telling people about it. That alone would be a terrible thing to do if that were where their plans ended, but, unfortunately, that is not where their plans end. They have already announced a so-called commission of audit. We know there is a $70 billion black hole—or $85 billion according to the interview of the member for Goldstein. They set up this special commission of audit so that, if they get elected, they will come forward and rip the guts out of services, rip the guts out of payments and rip the guts out of benefits that hardworking Australians around this country rely upon.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:15):  Wasn't that pathetic! This is the Assistant Treasurer of Australia. This is the deputy to the Treasurer in the construction and the implementation of this budget. On the afternoon after they presented a budget he had 15 minutes to speak and he spent no time defending the budget. The matter before the House is 'the failure of the government to properly manage the budget' and we have seen absolutely no time spent defending it. So you should walk out; that was a most pathetic performance. Go and read the budget papers and come back and tell us something about it.


The member for Lindsay also said that this government has presided over Australia being the leading country after the global financial crisis. We did get through the global financial crisis in much better shape than other countries because of the state of the economy when that crisis hit. There was no debt; in fact, there was $70 billion of net assets and the unemployment figure had a 4 in front of it. That is why we got through that crisis the way we did. By the time this government started to spend, spend, spend, the economy was already raging out of that crisis because of the exchange rate, which fell to 60c in the dollar and saw us with the biggest trade surplus in our history in that first quarter of 2009, and because the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered interest rates by over three per cent. Those factors are why we got out of that crisis. It had absolutely nothing to do with the stimulus spending which subsequently occurred and pushed up interest rates, costing Australian workers billions and billions of dollars since because of the way this government has run the economy.


The Assistant Treasurer, again, should be across these things, but the International Monetary Fund just a few days ago released the state of the books of countries around the world on a comparative basis. Of course, six developed countries are reported to have structural surpluses today. A structural surplus is something that the Treasurer would salivate over, but, of course, Australia still has a significant structural deficit. If the prices come off commodities anytime in the next year because of all sorts of things that might happen outside of our control, this government has left us deeply vulnerable. This budget has done nothing—it has provided no strategy to pay down the debt; it has provided no strategy to grow the economy, create and protect jobs, and restore confidence. Nothing in this budget will address those issues. That is why we still have a structural deficit, unlike six other developed countries that have structural surpluses today. We are not coming out of this global financial crisis better than the rest of the world; we are being led by others now that went into it with much bigger debt levels than we had.


Last night, the Treasurer said that this is a Labor budget 'to its bootstraps'. I do not know about old Labor, but this certainly is a new-Labor budget to its bootstraps. It is a budget you cannot trust. It is a budget riddled with deceit. It is a budget of deception by omission. It is a budget which cooks the books. It is a budget that increases debt. It is a budget where many of the so-called savings are in fact tax increases. Can you believe it? They are parading them as disciplined savings, but they are tax increases. It is a budget which resorted to bribes—grubby bribes to try and cover up the biggest carbon tax in the world. It is a budget with broken promises. It is a budget that makes many promises but at the same time breaks many promises. It is a budget which has the world's biggest carbon tax at its heart. It is a budget devoid of any strategy to pay down debt, to grow the economy, to create jobs and to restore confidence. It is a budget motivated by politics, not genuine economic principles. It is a budget motivated by political survival. That is all it is. It is a budget for this week and next week and the week after; it is not even a budget for the next six months. It is a budget to keep the Prime Minister in the job of Prime Minister while those behind her try and sort out who might replace her. It is nothing more and nothing less than a political document. This truly is a new-Labor budget: no trust, deceit, more spending, more taxing and more borrowing.


Let me explore a couple of those points a little more. It is a budget you cannot trust. Of course, my colleague pointed out the fact that there have been five different levels of deficit anticipated and forecast over the last 18 months, up from $12 billion to $44 billion—and, of course, the year has not even finished. I bet we will find by September that it is even bigger than $44 billion. How can people trust this government to get a $1.5 billion surplus after all of the fiddles that it has done and after all the moving of cash here, there and everywhere off budget? How can the community trust this government when the deficit this year has gone from $12 billion to $44 billion with five different estimates through the last 18 months and the government has gotten everyone of them wrong?


Also, how can Australians have any confidence in the revenue?


I say today, the total revenue could not possibly go up by 11.8 per cent. That is impossible yet they expect people to believe it. This whole budget depends on that 11.8 per cent growth estimate. Welfare will grow by more than 3.8 per cent because of this budget. The Australian dollar, coal prices and resource share prices are all forward indicators and they are all going down. Add to that two new socialist governments in Europe. Unemployment is tracking up again in the US and we have a totally dysfunctional government.


This is a government which is divided in so many respects. Everyone is reporting that the Prime Minister's office cannot talk to the Treasurer's office. You have this deep division. You have people grouping as possible pairs to run for the leadership in the next few months. This is a deeply divided government and it is why they are making so many errors of judgment. It is why they are so dysfunctional. There can be no trust. Just today we saw the consumer confidence figures released. Consumer confidence, despite the Reserve Bank reducing interest rates by half of one per cent—a very significant amount and more than what was anticipated by most commentators—today has dropped a further 2.1 points. What all this says is that people do not believe this government. They do not trust this government. It is why we have a crisis of confidence amongst households and why we have a crisis of confidence amongst businesses.


Now we turn to the debt situation, one of the most outrageous things. Australia has a high debt in terms of what is good for Australia. I am sick of people saying, 'Why don't you compare yourselves to basket cases in Europe?' What we need to do is apply a measure against Australian standards. We have a high debt in terms of what is good for Australia because we need in Australia—and always have needed—a debt relatively small compared with the rest of the world. We are a small, open economy which is influenced heavily by commodity price movements; not the US, not big companies in Europe—they have large domestic economies. We need a low relative debt.


We have seen in this budget an increase in the debt ceiling to $300 billion. This is a government which knows nothing but spending and borrowing and taxing. We have seen it again in this budget. The Office of Financial Management confirmed that it has lost confidence in the government because they have asked the Treasurer to increase the debt ceiling to $300 billion as a buffer.


This is truly a new-Labor budget to its bootstraps: no trust, deceit, more spending, more taxing and much more borrowing. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:25):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Goldstein because he always delivers such nuggets. Just a few moments ago we heard 'this government spends, borrows and taxes' like no other government does that. What is it supposed to do? They tax, they spend and they occasionally borrow. That is the way governments all over the world operate. And now we are being lectured about budget management from those opposite.


I do not quote Paul Keating much. I should quote him more but I do not. He had a great mind. When you look at the figures in this budget, they are truly a beautiful set of numbers. Look at the economic stats in this budget and what we have been able to deliver. Growth is at 3½ per cent—most other countries in the world would love to have the growth that we have. Our economy is 16 per cent bigger than what it was at the start of the GFC. Not many countries can boast that. Inflation is contained, interest rates are lower than what we inherited and we had the member for Lindsay and the Assistant Treasurer indicate what impact that has had on households. We have a AAA rating only a short space of time after one of the world's largest economies, the US, was unable to maintain its rating. We have three agencies giving us a AAA rating, and investment is at $450 billion.


I am particularly proud of jobs growth. Seeing more jobs created, especially in western Sydney—my part of Sydney—is absolutely critical for the people that I and others represent. There were 750,000 jobs created as a result of the economic policies and the economic climate that we put in place. There is five per cent unemployment here and 10 per cent in the Euro zone.


The most critical point is the budget surplus of $1.5 billion. We said we would do it and we did it. We said we would deliver it and we have managed it. People will talk from time to time, regardless of which side of politics is in government, about a budget bounce. Budget bounces, frankly, are illusory. The big thing about this is that we delivered a critical economic objective in reaching a surplus. We can now give the Reserve Bank the room to provide the type of stimulus that is now required because we have gone through an economic period that needed fiscal stimulus. We have gone through that phase and it is now about being able to loosen up monetary policy and see business make investment decisions which cost less to finance; that is why that is so important.


We have seen taxation as a proportion of GDP at some of its lowest levels. It is now 22.1 per cent, down from the 23.7 per cent that we inherited. And we have done that effectively while swimming with one hand tied behind our backs. There is $150 billion in revenues. Tell me a government that would be able to survive having $150 billion of revenue sucked out and still be able to deliver a budget that is in surplus? We delivered a surplus, we targeted spending and we still have tax lower than when those opposite were in government.


Look at those opposite. Every time there is a bad economic statistic, they relish it. They lick their lips at any bad economic statistic. And they shrink away from good economic statistics like Dracula from sunlight—Count Hockular. They are up there all the time avoiding any good economic statistic such as higher growth, lower inflation or lower interest rates. Their first response on any occasion is to try and undermine confidence, bag out what has gone on, distort facts and ignore reality, but they are also continuing a tradition: in government, when were those opposite ever able to cut expenditure? In fact, in their last five years of government spending continued to increase at four per cent on average. They were unable to cut expenditure. They are coming here today and talking to us about the need to be able to manage the budget, but they were unable to even cut spending and kept increasing spending in those last four years. We have cut it: $33.6 billion—$100 billion of savings delivered by us. They could not then; they could not now.


They, for example, reckon they can find $70 billion in savings themselves. In a simple test last year, we were trying to help Queenslanders recover after the worst floods that they have ever experienced. We proposed a one-year levy that those opposite opposed bitterly. They said that we should not be spending on helping out Queenslanders via a levy. They resisted it every step of the way and said they could find the savings themselves; they could find savings to the tune of $6 billion. A number of deadlines were set, but they were never able to identify the savings and achieve them. That is on $6 billion, and they reckon they will find $70 billion of savings.


The member for North Sydney talks about this being a confused budget. I think it is wrong that he is trying to shift his confusion of numbers and numerical literacy over to us. When you look at it, take their form: they call for help for manufacturing workers and cut $500 million from industry assistance; they call for costs of living relief and are now opposing the schoolkids bonus; and they call for tax relief and have opposed the corporate tax rate cuts that we put forward. There is no confusion on our side. We know what needs to be done, but every step of the way we are opposed by them. They claim they have the ear of corporate Australia. They claim they represent them, but they have thrown corporate Australia under the bus the minute they could because they put their own political interest first instead of supporting a cut to corporate tax.


Confusion—today, in this debate, the member for North Sydney talked about how the Greens supported a tax cut for small business and was suggesting that those opposite would have supported that, a differential in corporate tax rates. Having tiered corporate tax rates is what they were talking about.


Confusion—look at our ERC and what it has been able to deliver. Our ERC is delivered as surplus ahead of most other economies. We have performance and growth way better than other economies. Our ERC has been able to operate like that. Their ERC operates like an entrapment exercise: handing out dodgy figures to see who will leak it to the media first to get that 'gotcha' moment. That is their ERC—their ERC operates like an entrapment exercise where the member for Goldstein is not trusted by the member for North Sydney, and they are overseen by a man, the Leader of the Opposition, who even his own colleagues describe as 'not having a real good feel for economics' or 'economically illiterate'. This is their ERC.


Confusion—the Leader of the Opposition bags out the economy here but trips over to London and says, 'Our economy has genuine bragging rights.' What is it with long-haul flights and the opposition? Their feet do not even touch foreign soil before they are in their own mouths. Then you have the member for North Sydney going on and suddenly having this thought bubble: 'We should have a welfare system like Asia. We should look at Korea. We should have a welfare system that is just like the Korean welfare system.' I am sure that that would be a cracker of an argument for all those people who get carers support, the people who need that type of assistance—unemployment support and Austudy—and all those people who, when you look at the complexity of our system, would just love to know that we should model it on Korea and effectively cut out $90 billion in one swoop.


Confusion—today Joe Hockey was asked, 'What is the difference between you introducing a baby bonus and the schoolkids bonus?' You could not make this stuff up. I think it is important we read back in the Hansard what was said today. On 3AW the host asked, 'Are you being critical of the schools bonus?' This is directed to Joe Hockey: 'What is the difference between the baby bonus that you introduced and the schools bonus?' The member for North Sydney says, 'There's a vast difference,' And the host says, 'What?' The member for North Sydney says, 'You have to have a baby.' This is the piercing logic that we have from those opposite, who tell us we should manage the budget better, and the Leader of the Opposition was also challenged on this point today: how is the schools bonus any different to the baby bonus, for example? The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Look, they just are; just accept it.' These are the geniuses among those opposite, who are lecturing us about budget management and cannot get it right themselves. I am grateful that they brought this MPI up, because we need more laughs in this place. I am very thankful that you have been able to bring that to the House. (Time expired)

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (16:35):  Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I am wondering if you can help me find this budget. We have had two speakers from Labor supposed to be talking about the government's ability or otherwise to properly manage the budget, and it turns out it is like flared pants: it was out of fashion before it even started. We have had two speakers unable to turn their minds to a budget that is not even 24 hours old. This is quite a remarkable spectacle where the government has rolled out the member for Lindsay, one of the leading lights—Admiral Bradbury, as he is known by his friends—to talk about it. He is part of the Expenditure Review Committee. He could not even talk about the budget. Then the member for Chifley comes out—I always enjoy following the member for Chifley—talking about tiered tax rates. He has forgotten already that the government actually promised a tiered tax rate in relation to company tax reductions—a tiered tax rate for an earlier introduction for small business—but that promise disappeared before it was even enacted.


What has happened to the budget? Has someone pinched this Labor budget? Has someone stolen it, so that the Labor members dare not speak the name of the budget that is not even 24 hours old? We hear this fiscal fiction being talked about, but not in terms of what is in it, not in defending the parameters and not in explaining those herculean assumptions about revenue projections that invariably never get met, resulting in revenue write-downs. They live in this la-la land where they think they are going to have these enormous growths in revenue—the fiction that underpins these so-called budget projections—and then they are not met, and the government and Treasurer go around wringing their hands saying, 'We have had these revenue write-downs.' He has been hit by reality. You can only maintain this fiction for so long. You can only keep talking about a surplus that keeps going further and further away. 


It was 1989 when Labor last delivered a surplus. The No. 1 hit of the year was Mick Hucknall's—Simply Red's—If You Don't Know Me By Now. The Australian public know Wayne Swan by now. They know this Treasurer and they know this government. They know that they can talk a great game about a surplus but you never get to see one. They can forecast the most extraordinary revenue projections that never materialise, and then they wring their hands saying, 'We've had revenue write-downs,' and, 'We've been hit by reality.' That is the problem with this government and their budgeting: they get hit by reality. You can only hide from it for so long. 


But the fiscal fiction gets worse. You would be as astounded as I was if you saw Monday night's Lateline Business. It was less than 24 hours before the government delivered its budget speech and the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness and Minister for Small Business was asked a fairly straightforward question. The presenter said, 'Let's look at the Sensis small business survey.' It found that 92 per cent of small businesses do not think that government policies are helping them. Do you know what his answer was—less than 24 hours before the Treasurer's budget speech? He said:


… we've done some recent things already by announcing the cut in the small business company tax rate from 30 to 29 cents … 


This was less than 24 hours before the Treasurer came in here and spoke about the company tax cut disappearing. And this was someone who is on the government's Expenditure Review Committee. Isn't that extraordinary? Was he intentionally trying to create a distortion of reality or does he have NFI—'no fiscal idea' whatsoever? Is that what the problem was? He was on the Expenditure Review Committee and he could not even work out what was in the government's own budget. 


What is not in the budget and what we should be discussing is how it is going to contribute to growth, how it is going to nurture business confidence, how it is going to support job creation and how it is going to enhance economic security for Australian people. What does the government talk about? None of those things. In this budget the small business community was looking for something that would give it half a sense that the record 48 per cent increase in small business insolvencies in the last 12 months might be turned around; that the 300,000 jobs that have been lost in small business might begin to be recovered; and that the 14,500 small businesses that were employing people at the time Labor was elected, but now are not, might be able to have the confidence and courage to re-engage and employ Australian men and women. That is what the small business community was looking for and it got none of it. It got absolutely none of those things. 


Labor says it is 'truly a Labor budget'. I agree with them, because everybody knows that Labor loves to throw money into the wind. It has failed to do that effectively and I fear they will again fail to do that effectively with this budget. But that does make it a very Labor budget. What would have made it a good budget would have been some practical measures that would have supported growth, confidence raising, job creation and economic security and would have restored small business hope, reward and opportunity. But there was nothing in there about that.


Not only did the small business minister who has been spruiking the great influence he has within government not even know what was in the budget less than 24 hours before it was delivered, but all we could see was that there was a reheating of old commitments—nothing new. But what do small business know they are going to get? They are going to face the world's largest carbon tax. They are shaking in their boots about the world's largest carbon tax at a time when the economy that small business men and women and family enterprises are facing is already very challenging, when they are getting cost increases forced upon them and when nervous consumers are demanding discounts. Consumers want savings. They are demanding the sort of frugalness from small business that they would love to see from their government. Margins are thin. Foreclosures are happening. Insolvencies have increased 48 per cent on last year. There are empty shops in the main streets of Australia. Small businesses are looking for something to break the trajectory the government has put them on—government policy has driven small businesses into a ditch. They got none of that in this budget. 


Labor once again proved it is no friend to small business. The budget has got broken promises which will hurt small business and will hurt local employment. There was no relief from the world's largest carbon tax. It is going to whack their viability, their profitability and their capacity to employ like no other measure. There is no feel within this budget that the government has any sense of the struggling, the challenges and the difficult economic climate that small business is facing. There is no sense that cash handouts will change the economic paradigm, where people will think: 'Gee, there is an ongoing change in my circumstance. I feel more confident about making longer term decisions and about re-engaging in things that put me in a financially exposed situation but where I am more confident of my capacity to deal with them.' There is none of that whatsoever. There are none of those things that would bring about a change. Instead we have a few reheated announcements of sweeteners that are supposed to soften the burden and the pain, the harm and the hardship of the carbon tax—sweeteners that those in small business know in many cases offer them no assistance whatsoever. 


In this budget the government confirmed that 370,000 of our smallest businesses face higher tax on their income—not just companies, which seem to be the only kind of business Labor wants to talk to, but those self-employed people, those partners, those operating through trust and those men and women who are trying to create wealth and opportunity for their communities, their country and themselves. They used to get encouragement through an entrepreneurs tax offset. There used to be a 25 per cent reduction in income tax paid on those smallest businesses up to $50,000 and then a tapering of that benefit. That is completely gone. 


We then see the issue around accelerated depreciation. The government comes in here and says, 'Isn't this great!' Small business know they have to have cash ready to spend that money on eligible assets so they can get some cash-flow benefits at some stage down the track. Then the government comes in here and says to those 400,000 smallest businesses that used to get the ETO, 'You can go and buy a ute.' They need thirty grand of ready dollars to go out and buy a ute so 18 months later they might get a couple of thousand dollars of cash-flow benefit. Spend thirty grand for a couple down 18 months later. That is the kind of cash-flow logic that small business look at. They hear the government mouthing these words and they think, 'They really have no idea whatsoever.' Then there is the issue of the loss carry-back. Do you remember that the coalition proposed that? The coalition proposed that as a response to the global financial crisis and was ridiculed and condemned by Labor. But now they want to bring it back in.




Mr Dreyfus:
  So will you be supporting that?




Mr BILLSON:
  I am grateful to the member for Isaacs, who is conceding what we all understand—that is, the carbon tax represents a greater threat to small business than the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis was not providing a sufficient challenge for small business to have a loss carry-back scheme introduced, but the carbon tax represents a far greater challenge and that is why the government is now looking at it. We know this government has no interest in, and no commitment to, small business. If you want to see any evidence of that, just have a look at this budget and go back to the Minister for Small Business, who either has no idea what is going on or has intentionally been out there misleading the small business community. The small business men and women of Australia deserve much better than that.

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (16:45):  I am very pleased to contribute to the debate this afternoon. We on this side, when we consider the management of the budget and the management of the economy, have a very clear understanding for whom we are managing the budget and the economy. We have a very clear understanding that we come to this place representing families—families with children at school—who today we are prepared to support financially, and those opposite very clearly have said they will not. They have said it in a way that is demeaning to ordinary Australians, such as the 10,300 ordinary Australian families in my electorate who stand to directly benefit from this initiative proposed and supported uniquely by this side of the House.


We have a very keen understanding of the people who we manage the economy and the budget for when we come to this place and make a financial commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I really do hope for the future of people who suffer with a disability and for people who care for them that the rhetoric of those opposite stands up when they need to make financial commitments at a state level and, potentially at some stage in the future, at a federal level. I really do hope that those people stand up for the NDIS in the way that we have quite clearly stood up for the launch of the NDIS in this place and in this budget—that is, ahead of time and fulfilling the initial expectations of those people who have campaigned so strongly for it.


We know that we come to this place managing the economy and managing the budget for working Australians. We manage the economy and the budget for people who may find it difficult to get access to dental care, which is why we have made a significant commitment of $500 million in this budget to ensure that we provide adequate responses to people who are on waiting lists around the country. We provide them with dental care, which will enable them to have a better quality of life and which will perhaps enable them to participate more fully in employment—we all know that dental difficulties present people with confidence issues and difficulties in securing and maintaining employment.


We know that we come to this place and make a commitment to working Australians when we manage the economy and when we manage the budget. We also know that those opposite, while they profess to support families and they have professed so many times to support business, come to this place and oppose measures that practically assist families and assist business. In this budget we have indicated our support for business, notwithstanding the opposition coming to this place and opposing the company tax cut that we have endeavoured to put in place to try to support people who they regard as members of their constituency. Although we have been unable to secure that given the opposition from both the Greens and the Liberal Party—an unusual alliance—we have endeavoured to provide small business with some relief in this budget through the loss carry-back arrangements.


We have been very clear in this budget about the way that we want to manage the economy and about the way that we want to manage the budget for ordinary people, people who are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. Unfortunately the opposition come here with not even a piecemeal plan for the economy and for the budget of this nation. In fact, when you look back at the budget reply from last year it was extraordinary and really quite commendable because it did two things that I thought were impossible: it neither looked at the budget, nor was it a reply to the budget. So once again the Leader of the Opposition did the unthinkable, the unimaginable, and came into this place and spouted off. In fact, a member of my family remarked that it was not so much a budget reply as an interpretive dance, something titled 'How the budget made Tony feel'. I suspect that we are going to see the same again this year with lack of substance and, frankly, a lack of interest in families, in business, in ordinary Australians and in anything and anyone other than mining magnates in this country. We have a very clear picture of the opposition on this and it will be revealed, I am sure, on Thursday night as we all expect that the priorities of the opposition will be revealed again in their budget reply and they will indicate exactly who they stand for in this country.


It is very important to reflect on the circumstances that we came to office to find because it really was a scorched earth situation on so many fronts. We came to office at a time when the Howard government had presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row. For people who have a $300,000 mortgage today, that means that practically you would be paying around $3,000 less per annum than you were under the years of the Howard. When John Howard left office and we came to office, tax as a proportion of GDP was running at 23.7 per cent. As a result of this government's efforts, in the next year it will be at 22.1 per cent. That amounts to $24 billion less tax that Australians are paying. We see an opposition come to this place and talk about themselves as being pro-business, pro-family and pro-company. They have opposed the company tax cut and they are opposing measures that we are putting in place to practically respond to the needs of families and the cost-of-living pressures for people who are sending their children to primary and secondary school. They come into this place and we find that, in fact, they have been a higher taxing government on the last occasion that they were on these benches than we have been. It is quite revealing to have a look at not only the priorities of this government in its budget, but also the legacy of those who left us with very little when we came to office. They left us with very little that means anything to Australian working people: very little in education, very little in housing very little in health. I will have a look at each of these in turn. We inherited an education system that was chronically underfunded when we came to office, particularly in trades training. It was an education system which had not benefited from meaningful, capital investment for decades. We responded. We have now completed the biggest program of capital investment in schools in Australia's history. It stands to the benefit of those who are in those schools and learning. It will stand to the benefit of future generations.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms SMYTH:
  It has stood to the benefit of those workers who are engaged in construction of those projects and I do note members of the opposition laughing and interjecting throughout this. It reveals to me their sense of priority, both for workers and for participants in our education system—people who we hope, on this side, will go on to secure jobs and have a valuable future in the Australian economy and the Australian community. Unfortunately it is not a priority that is emphasised by those opposite.


We are building trade training centres; we have made a significant commitment to that and will continue to do so. We know that those opposite chronically underfunded the education system and that their proposals now are to strip money out of the education system, specifically in trade training.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  You closed the TAFE colleges!




Ms SMYTH:
  Those commitments have been publicly indicated. For the edification of those opposite who are interjecting, you may choose to have a look at that, maybe on Google. It seems you continue to object to our trade training centres and our other proposals just as you continue to object about our computers in schools arrangements. We inherited a health system which the Leader of the Opposition had de-funded and run into the ground.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):  The member for Hughes will listen in silence.




Ms SMYTH:
  We faced a GP and nurses shortage and Australians know that we have responded by investing heavily in things like hospitals, GP superclinics and regional cancer centres. We have invested in the training of GPs, we have invested in the training of nurses and we have done so because we came to office at a time when all of these things had been undermined or left wanting by the Howard government and, in many instances, by the same people who are sitting on opposition benches today.


We inherited a housing and homelessness crisis when we came to office. We responded swiftly. We responded in one way with the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which is intended to increase the supply of affordable rental housing by 50,000 dwellings across the country by June 2014. That is us taking the lead, to give people affordable housing, making sure they do not have to worry about that, making sure that they can carry on productive lives, making sure that they are supported and their families are supported. Those are the kinds of financial priorities that we have and have had since coming to office. Those opposite may like to note that we have made a continued commitment. We have made a commitment of $3.6 billion in the 2013 budget alone, delivering record investments in affordable housing and in investments to address homelessness.


Once again, we carry on our commitment in managing the budget and managing the economy for ordinary Australians who have the kinds of needs in education, health and housing that Labor people know need to be responded to. It is the reason we have put together a budget against the backdrop of very difficult financial circumstances. They are circumstances where we have faced continuing global financial instability, which the opposition continues to wipe out of its memory, and where we have faced natural disasters around the country, which the opposition continues to wipe out of its memory. We have managed to maintain these objectives and make financial commitments that make a difference to the lives of ordinary Australians for whom we are managing the budget. I hope to see exactly for whom the opposition is managing the budget tomorrow night.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:55):  I rise to add my contribution to the discussion on this matter of public importance—in particular, the failure of the government to properly manage the budget. This budget comes down to who you trust. As a nation, who do we best trust to run the economy? What we have been hearing is rhetoric from the government with reference to a delivered surplus or delivering a surplus. Guess what? The reality is, with reference to this delivered surplus, it is a budget with a forecast next year for a budget of $1.5 billion. They have not actually delivered a budget, but that is the rhetoric and the spin. The spin doctors of Labor are better than ours. They will have you believe, through some of the speakers, that they have actually delivered a budget. In the next couple of weeks we will get to see the effect of Labor's forecasting, with the real deficit they will produce.


I will take you back a little bit, to the 2010-11 MYEFO. In the next couple of weeks, the Labor government forecasted that they will be looking at a $12 billion deficit. In 2011-12, in the budget, they revised those figures to $22.6 billion. That was just 12 months ago. Then we had the MYEFO budget, six months ago, for the 2011-12 MYEFO. They revised their deficit figures again to $37 billion. Who knows what the deficit is going to look like? I would say it will be well in excess of $40 billion.


When you look at the government's capacity to accurately forecast a figure into the future, be it a surplus or whatever, you need to look at their credibility and track record of effectively being able to forecast. On those figures, when it comes to dealing with the deficit or potential surplus, they do not—they could not hit the side of a barn with a forecast. You will also hear the Labor government make the comment about having the fastest fiscal consolidation in history. With the four largest record deficits that this government has produced, I use the analogy that with the fiscal consolidation—for those of you who do not understand what it is, it is the capacity for a government to pay down debt—what you are going to see is similar to a contestant going on the Biggest Loser and whacking on 50 kilos before they go on the show, in order to rip it down a lot quicker.


The amount of spending that this government has undertaken, and which has left us with a massive debt, is going to assist the government when talking about its fiscal consolidation. But it comes back to trust. This budget is about trust. It is about whether or not the nation can trust this government. It is whether or not the people of my electorate can trust this government. It is the hardworking mums and dads who are suffering under the cost-of-living pressures. It is the business houses that are struggling under 26 new taxes. And the government says it is representing families and has given a budget for families. If you want to help families, get your hands out of their pockets—stop taxing them. There are 26 new taxes. This is unprecedented. Farmers are copping it as well, and I have a number of them in my electorate. Then the government goes on and asks us to trust them with their assumptions as to their forecast $1.5 billion surplus. When you make your assumptions on the top of a resources sector peak and commodity prices are starting to come off, you leave yourself vulnerable as a nation on trying to find the coin. If you go back and have a look at this government's track record, the way they will try to create the illusion of a surplus—which I really do not believe will happen—will be through a process of cooking the books.


But when it comes to trust, who can forget the Prime Minister of our nation, before the last election, staring down the barrel of a camera and saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Who can forget that? And when you are working out who you can trust, ask: can you trust this Prime Minister?


But do not let the Treasurer, who has put this budget up, get off scot-free, because within days of the Prime Minister making that comment, he was also asked about the carbon tax and his comment was:


We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.


So here you have a Treasurer, with a track record of not being able to be trusted, walking into this parliament, delivering a budget which talks about some hypothetical surplus in the future and trying to convince the nation that they are worth trusting. Well, I implore this nation to think very hard about who they trust when it comes to the management of the economy.


I want now to speak briefly about the off-book expenditure and the tricks that this government will use to try and create the illusion of a surplus. I will try to bring it back into a business context. One example of off-budget expenditure that the government are using is the NBN—around $36 billion—and another is the clean energy fund, which is about $10 billion—$2 billion a year over five years. So when you look at the way they are doing it, it would be the equivalent of someone in a family budget not eating—showing on their balance sheet that they did not eat for the whole year but that they bought a big wodge of groceries and stuck them in the pantry for the first half of the year and then saying that in the second half of the year they will go and do another grocery run. It is accounting trickery and it is deceit shown by this government.


The government talks about the cash rate and says that it was lower under Howard. I want to make the point as a business owner: I encourage Labor to go and talk to their businesses and go and talk to those people with mortgages. I would be surprised if you did not find out that no-one can borrow money at the cash rate. So while you make the point that the cash rate may have been lower under Howard, what we need to really focus on is the spread and what the variable rate is; and I can assure you that the variable rate under this government does not come anywhere near what we had it at under Howard.


As to spending ratio, as a percentage, to GDP instead of the tax to GDP: again, these are just tricks—




Mr Dreyfus:
  What—tax to GDP is a trick?




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  No—spending as a ratio of percentage to the GDP instead of tax. The point I want to draw your attention to is your spending—spending to GDP.


The Assistant Treasurer recently made a comment on Sky that running the budget was not that dissimilar to running a household budget. With the full record deficits, could you imagine buying an $800,000 home, not making a payment on it for the first four years and then going in in the fifth year and saying, 'Listen, I would really like to service some of my debt, and I've got $2.60 to give you,' because basically that is what it comes back to as a percentage when you start looking at the $1.5 billion potential surplus that may eventuate in the future—to start drawing down some of these record deficits that this government is continuing to bash us around the head with.


I cannot lose the opportunity of speaking about the increase in the debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion. Today we were advised in the House that, 'We just need to have a buffer.' Well, did we need to have a buffer when we took it from $150 billion to $200 billion? Did we need to have a buffer when we took it from $200 billion to $250 billion? But guess what? They are saying they are not going to draw down on that. They just need it there as a buffer. When you go and have a look at the budget forecast, they have actually taken a provision for the interest to service that debt into the future. In 2015 they are making provisions for the interest on that debt, which they try and tell you that they are not going to draw down on. Who can you trust? When it comes to this government, when will they learn that you cannot tax and legislate a nation into prosperity?


In closing, I just want to make a quick comment on the AAA credit rating. When Standard and Poor's and Moody's give credit rating assumptions for nations around the world, they give us a thing called a comparative rating. Why is it that, when we were in government and had money in the bank, and no debt, and now here we have a nation with unprecedented debt and very little capacity to service, with structural deficit—




Mr Dreyfus:
  This'll be good! You never got a AAA rating while you were in government!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):  Order! The member will be heard in silence.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  With comparative credit rating, as other nations around the world soften, by default, Australia ends up with a AAA credit rating. It is unprecedented, unthinkable, that this government would blow their own horn to say that they are managing the economy when they are producing record deficits. I will make the point that they are structural deficits.


In closing, I would also make this point: electricity prices under this government are up 66 per cent since Labor was elected, gas prices are up 39 per cent, food prices are up 11 per cent, petrol prices are up 11 per cent, education and health costs are up 25 per cent. My message to the government is: get your hands out of the pockets of mums and dads; get your hands out of the pockets of businesses and let them flourish. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The discussion is now concluded.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (17:40):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed development and construction of housing for Defence members and families at Weston Creek, ACT.


Defence Housing Australia, DHA, proposes to develop an 8.3 hectare prime property in Weston Creek, Australian Capital Territory. Land is in reasonably short supply in Canberra, and the rezoning of land to residential in the Greater Molonglo area, of which Weston Creek is a part, has opened up an opportunity for DHA to secure land and develop new housing which meets Defence standards in Canberra.


The site is located approximately two kilometres from the Australian Defence College, within 12 kilometres of the Canberra CBD and has quick access to the Tuggeranong Parkway. The proposal is for DHA to develop the site for residential construction, consistent with the approved Weston Creek Estate Development Plan. Following the site development, the proposal envisages construction of 50 dwellings for the Department of Defence over a 12-month period. The remaining sites will be sold for complementary development.


The development of the site involves the provision of infrastructure of 73 single-dwelling lots, of which 50 will be used by Defence families, plus three multi-unit sites which are expected to yield up to 47 dwellings. The first stage will provide this infrastructure and involves the design and construction of roads, stormwater drainage, sewer, water, natural gas, telecommunications and electricity. Once the infrastructure is completed, construction of the 50 dwellings for Defence will be undertaken.


The project costs of $39 million, inclusive of GST but excluding cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the sale and leaseback program. Subject to parliamentary approval, sewer construction is expected to commence in January 2013, with dwellings construction to be completed by December 2014. I commend the motion to the House.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:02):  This tax law amendment bill was introduced into this place on 21 March by the Assistant Treasurer. I will say at the outset that the opposition will not be opposing this bill. It has five schedules. I will very briefly run through each of them as the minister did during his introduction back in March.


The first schedule disallows a deduction against rebatable benefits from 1 July 2012. This relates to a 2010 High Court case that held that study expenses incurred in gaining student Youth Allowance were able to be deducted from assessable income. In summary, that case changed what had been the previous law and practice prior to that decision. It was the position not only of this government but of previous governments, including the Howard government, that study expenses not related to employment were not tax deductible. Following the High Court decision, the government announced in the 2011-12 budget that it would disallow deductions from 1 July 2012, although it would allow them for 2010-11 and prior income years in line with the court decision. This change restores the tax position to what it was prior to that High Court decision or what the understanding of it was.


The second schedule relates to limited trading stock exemptions for superannuation funds and removes the trading stock exemption to the capital gains tax primary code rule for certain assets of a complying super fund. The Assistant Treasurer outlined this schedule in some detail in his introductory speech.


The third schedule is a tax exemption for ex gratia payments to New Zealand non-protected special category visa holders. Essentially, it exempts income tax ex gratia payments to New Zealand non-protected special category visa holders paid in relation to the floods in January of this year. This schedule is necessary for consistent treatment with other previous natural disasters and payments in this regard and is non-controversial.


Schedule 4 enacts a decision that the government announced, I am pretty sure, in the MYEFO with respect to the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset.


The final schedule, as is always the way with these tax laws amendment bills, is a series of miscellaneous changes to address what are always termed 'minor technical deficiencies'. In this case, it is in the MRRT legislation, we are told, and a series of other drafting issues that are necessary.


As I indicated at the outset, we will not be opposing the bill. Of course, as we have pointed out, the MRRT bills as passed were legislatively flawed—and the government knew it when they put them forward—and schedule 5 deals with very technical issues. Each of the four unrelated schedules relate to fairly technical tax issues and, as is almost always the case, the coalition comes to these debates wanting to see improvements in the technical aspects of the tax legislation, and this is no different.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (18:07):  Tax reform is continuous because it is essential that the government of the day ensures that our taxation system is fit for the purpose. Included in those purposes is regulating and encouraging activity, raising revenue and, in certain circumstances, discouraging certain activity, such as smoking cigarettes and the like. The measures contained within this series of bills go to each of those points. In most respects, they appear to have the support of all members of this House—and that is welcomed, because there have been instances where legislation intended to reform the tax system has not enjoyed support on all sides of this House—and it is probably why the Treasurer was able to stand up in his budget speech last night and deliver a budget which is going to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and at the same time provide additional funds for much needed social purposes. This is in complete contrast with those on the other side, who have a gaping $70 billion black hole in their budget. The reason there is a $70 billion black hole in their budget is that they are not willing to do the hard yards—in particular when it comes to putting in place responsible savings measures. 


There are five schedules in the Tax Law Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012; the first of which has the intention of putting in place amendments which will restore the intended operation of the GST law. This was made necessary because of an adverse decision in the Department of Infrastructure and Transport case. It will ensure that the supply by a healthcare provider paid for by an insurer or a government entity is treated as GST-free supply, where the related supply from the healthcare provider to an individual is GST-free health supply. The amendments avoid increased compliance costs arising for taxpayers in the multiparty arrangements involving suppliers of health related goods and services, and have been supported by industry. 


The second schedule also deals with GST treatment of appropriations. The amendments again restore the policy intent of GST law following another adverse decision in 2009 of the full Federal Court in the TT-Line case. The amendments will ensure that payments under a government appropriation relating to the non-commercial activity of government related entities are not subject to GST. This was the understanding of the law prior to the TT-Line decision. The amendments will ensure that there is no increase in compliance or cash-flow costs for government entities and that the Commonwealth, states and territories will not need to change their budgetary processes.


Schedule 3 of the bill is a savings measure. Schedule 3 goes to the superannuation concessional contributions cap. It attempts to put back the indexation that would otherwise have applied for the concessional contributions cap. It was expected that the indexation would increase the concessional contributions cap from $25,000 to $35,000 per annum in the year 2013-14. The pause in indexation essentially means that the cap will not now increase until 2014-15. As the higher concessional contributions cap for individuals aged 50 and over and the non-concessional contribution cap only move with changes in the general contributions cap, these contributions caps will not change in 2013-14. They are expected to generate savings in the order of $485 million over the forward estimates period. It is an important savings measure and again one that enables us to deliver a budget which will return to surplus. 


The fourth schedule goes to the situation where taxpayers either accidentally or inadvertently make contributions in excess of the concessional contributions, thereby attracting a greater tax upon those contributions. The measures in this bill will enable the tax office to refund—on the request of the taxpayer, without attracting any more than the marginal tax that would otherwise apply to those superannuation contributions—those excess superannuation contributions as if they had not been paid as superannuation and are just taken as any normal form of income. 


The fifth and sixth schedules go to the disclosure of superannuation information. The sixth schedule in particular is important because it places an obligation on employers to advise when the superannuation guarantee contributions are going to be made to their employees. This is important. It works hand-in-hand with the Fair Work legislation because it sends a trigger to the individual employee enabling them to check that their superannuation contributions have been made.


The ATO reports that the vast majority of employers are paying in accordance with their obligations their superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees. But the 2010-11 annual report reported that there were in excess of 17,000 individual employee complaints in relation to suspected non-payment of superannuation entitlements. Nearly $269 million in unpaid superannuation entitlements was collected and deposited into employee superannuation accounts as a result of these complaints and the investigations by the tax office, and there were around $140 million in penalties. Whilst it may only be one per cent of the employer population that is not complying with their obligations, the impact on employees is profound, and that early signal to the employee, which enables them to check if they fear their superannuation contributions are not being made, saves a lot of heartache for the employee. It ensures that their entitlements are paid in full and on time and alerts the tax office, as well as the employee, to other issues that may be going on inside the firm. I am very pleased that each of these schedules is enjoying the bipartisan support of all members in this place—as indeed they should. I commend this legislation to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:16):  It is my pleasure tonight to rise on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. This bill is an important part of the government's economic reforms—a set of economic reforms that are laying the foundation for Australia's prosperity. It is a set of reforms that recognise we are here not just to help in solving immediate problems but also to put in place long-term solutions. I see the Assistant Treasurer in the chair here, and I would note in particular the aged care reforms, a set of reforms that are long overdue and that recognise that for too long the Howard government put bandaids on an aged care system that really needed root and branch reform. I commend him for his work on aged care reform.


In the area of tax laws, this Labor government is committed to improving the tax schedule. We put in place the Henry review—a comprehensive review in the spirit of the 1975 Asprey review—which really looked right across the tax code at reforms that were needed. One of those reforms was the abolition of the dependent spouse tax offset, and this bill continues that. In an earlier bill, this parliament chose to abolish the dependent spouse tax offset, except for taxpayers with a spouse born on or before 1972. Now that date is taken back to 1952. That is an appropriate change, recognising the change in our society since the dependent spouse tax offset was put in place. It recognises that a dependent spouse tax offset was a measure that might have been appropriate in a day when most men worked and most women were homemakers, but is not appropriate in modern Australia.


In the same spirit, we are continuing to modernise a range of different tax measures. Today this House has been debating the abolition of the education tax refund and its replacement with the schoolkids bonus. That again was an updating of the tax and benefit system, and it was an updating that recognised that the education tax refund was not being claimed by one million of the 1.3 million Australians who were eligible for it. Those opposite in the debate today were arguing that the one million out of 1.3 million Australians who were not claiming the tax refund in full somehow did not want the money. Well, they would have been the first to have met an Australian who did not want $410 for a primary school child and $820 for a secondary school child. What is more likely, and the reason that we reformed that particular provision, was that Australians were simply too time poor and busy to be able to keep the receipts necessary to make those claims. One of my staff related to me a conversation she had had with friends of hers who had three young children and who were simply unaware of the education tax refund. They were on family tax benefit part A: they were doing it tough and they needed the money, but they did not know about the provision and they were not getting those benefits.


As John Maynard Keynes once said: 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?' We on this side of the House looked at the facts and they were incontrovertible. One million out of 1.3 million Australians were not claiming the education tax refund. It just was not good enough, and we replaced it with the schoolkids bonus—a measure which goes to all Australians. Those opposite are concerned that the schoolkids bonus will not be spent on education expenses, but it is very clear when you look at Australian families that they are spending substantial amounts of money on their children's education.


It is unusual to see those opposite arguing that money going to families should be tied. If you like, it is a conservative notion, not a liberal notion. If you are a small 'l' liberal, then you believe in putting money in the hands of families. You trust them to do with that money what is best. If you are a conservative you do not trust families. It is the spirit of conservatism that gave rise in the United States to the food stamp system, a notion that you cannot just give poor people money, you have to give them tied money—money that is tied to spending on food. We in Australia have not had things like food stamps because we have trusted low-income Australians to do the right thing with money that is given to them by the government. That is the same spirit that embodies the schoolkids bonus. It is a spirit that says if you put money in the hands of parents of school-aged children they will do the right thing with that money, but it is not necessary to tie that money to educational expenditure to get a better outcome. Those opposite, taking the conservative path, distrust low- and middle-income Australians to do the right thing by their kids. We on this side of the House are taking the small 'l' liberal approach, the market-based approach—as on so many issues—by taking the view that Australians will do the right thing with money that is placed in their hands. We have seen the clear contrasts in this budget process. We have seen the strong recognition from the IMF of Australia's fiscal position and a broad recognition across economic commentators that Labor has a lower tax-to-GDP ratio than the Howard government did—that it is Labor that delivered real spending cuts. It is a real contrast, in that sense, with what happened in the Howard government under mining boom mark 1. The Howard government never had to face the tough decisions. It saw the money roll in and it just rolled it out the door. 


It is Labor which has made tough decisions about what we are not going to continue funding. The government is about values, priorities and making choices for things you are not going to do. That is a great Labor tradition, with finance ministers Peter Walsh, Lindsay Tanner and now Penny Wong. What it chooses not to do marks out a party as much as what it chooses to do. But in this budget we are choosing to invest in critical areas of the economy—in skills and training, in a national broadband network, in spreading the benefits of the mining boom, in putting a price on carbon and in returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13.


Those opposite are like deer in the headlights. That is probably a little unfair to deer. Let us think about fish out of water. They are flip-flopping like fish out of water. We saw this in the famous budget reply of 2010. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would identify savings, and then the member for North Sydney said that he would identify savings and then the member for Goldstein was going to do it. Finally, the fish flopped here and there and was just left with an adviser at the back of the room shaking his head.


We saw it with the $70 billion black hole. The member for Goldstein and the member for North Sydney went to-and-fro on talk show after talk show on whether or not the $70 billion black hole was a real figure. Sometimes they said: 'Yes, it's our figure. It's a big target to meet.' Sometimes they said, 'That's a Labor hoax.' They were flip-flopping like a fish out of water. We have seen it in the question of entitlements. When we look to means-test benefits, such as family tax benefit part B, the baby bonus and the private health insurance rebate, those opposite say we are playing the politics of envy. They say that we are engaging in class warfare when we put in place means tests at $150,000. The shadow Treasurer went overseas and said, 'We'd like to have a Hong Kong style welfare state.' That is a pretty substantial cut to benefits, one would think. Then the Leader of the Opposition came out immediately and said: 'Oh, no. The coalition won't be cutting benefits.' They are flip-flopping like fish out of water.


When it comes to economic policy there is really only one member of their frontbench who does not look like a fish out of water and that is the member for Wentworth. He delivered a very thoughtful speech at a Melbourne institute event I attended here in Canberra. He spoke about his views on a sovereign wealth fund. I disagree with his conclusion that Australia needs a sovereign wealth fund but he put, quite provocatively, the argument that under the Howard government spending had sometimes got out of control, and argued that this could be the case for other governments. I can imagine his colleagues afterwards, saying: 'What were you doing up there on the surface? Surely you should be down here with us, down here swimming in the warm waters of populism.'


We know what their view is on costings. We have had very clear statements that the coalition are now going to eschew the parliamentary budget office—the same parliamentary budget office that Senator Joyce and the member for Higgins said they would back. They backed off that because they realised how deep their budget crater is. They realised the problem they got themselves into last time, when they went to the election and were later found to have an $11 billion black hole in their costings. 


In response to Treasury finding the $11 billion black hole we saw the member for Mackellar and the member for Goldstein traducing the reputation of Ken Henry, a great Australian who was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by Peter Costello. Their response to Ken Henry finding that the coalition costings did not add up was a bit like the rich kid whose maths teacher finds a mistake in his homework—he immediately goes to the principal and asks for the maths teacher to be fired. They were in here attacking Ken Henry and attacking the Department of the Treasury for what they said was politicised work. It was nothing of the sort. The Department of the Treasury engaged in the same costings process for the coalition that it has engaged in for other political parties. 


The coalition have now moved to an audit commission. That audit commission is simply a phrase to disguise the fact that their costings will not be audited this time. Why will they not be audited? It is because when they went to the last election they discovered that audit has a legal meaning. If you want an accounting firm to audit your costings, it must afterwards say that they have been audited. I spoke yesterday in this place about the shadow Treasurer's attempts to suggest that there was such a thing as a small 'a' audit and that somehow the coalition could engage in a small 'a' audit rather than a large 'A' audit. Unfortunately, there is no such thing.


That is where we find ourselves, with the coalition, at the moment: all promises to special interests but an inability to make the hard decisions that government requires. Government does require often unpopular decisions to be made. Certainly we would not be claiming that every decision made by this government has been greeted with universal acclaim by the Australian people. But that is true of all the major economic reforms in Australian history. Great reform is not invariably greeted with cheering in the streets. It requires steady argumentation. It requires engaging the Australian people in a long conversation about why reforms are necessary.


You can imagine the Leader of the Opposition had he been leader when Australia was to float the dollar. He would have immediately engaged in fearmongering about foreign speculators. We know those opposite have engaged in fearmongering on foreigners. We see that with foreign ownership debates. 'What are foreign currency speculators doing determining the level of our dollar?' the Leader of the Opposition might have then said. In fact, we know he opposed the floating of the dollar as late as a decade after the dollar had been floated. But we now know that that was an enormously important economic reform. It acted like a shock absorber for the Australian economy. When international shocks come along, a floating exchange rate is enormously important to the prosperity of Australians.


Can you imagine if the Leader of the Opposition had been leader when Australia put in place substantial tariff cuts—tariff cuts that halved the price of a pair of kids' school shoes, tariff cuts that puts thousands of dollars in the pockets of Australian households? They were tariff cuts which could, all too easily, have been demonised by a populist looking for short-term gain. You can imagine what the Leader of the Opposition would have done— (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:31):  I rise to speak, very quickly, in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. This bill is another step forward in the Gillard government's mission to reform the tax system and make it fairer for all Australians. It brings in 2011-12 budget measures aimed at fostering a prosperous and even-handed taxation system—an improved system that supports all Australians.


Australian Labor governments continue to lead the way. We have led our country through global economic uncertainty to today, where it stands as a powerhouse economy on the world stage, the envy of Europe and the OECD, as acknowledged by the leader opposite—when he is in Europe.


We have ensured our fiscal position remains strong despite the global financial crisis. Unlike many other nations, we have successfully avoided recession and prevented serious job losses. This alone is a record of which to be proud. But not only did we safeguard our budget position and Australian jobs; we oversaw outstanding employment growth and a record investment pipeline of $456 billion, as I heard from the Treasurer today, despite the gloom and doom predictions of those opposite of what would be happening in the minerals sector when we brought in the MRRT.


More than 750,000 jobs have been created since the Labor government was first elected. Obviously there is more to be done. It is a patchy economy; we know that. While others pause we push ahead in the interests of the Australian people, and that is what this legislation is all about.


A key Australian value is the concept of a fair go. This bill moves to correct inequity in the tax system created by the High Court decision in the Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis case. It simply is not fair that taxpayers with the same level of income will have different deduction entitlements depending on whether they receive a taxable government assistance payment. The Anstis decision violates the basic principle that expenses incurred in generating income that is effectively tax-free should not then be deductible—that is, no money into the public purse should prohibit you from taking money out of the public purse. Overturning the High Court decision is the right thing to do in order to make the system fairer for everybody.


The Gillard government is committed to helping Australian students on income support, but this must be done efficiently and effectively. Providing assistance via the transfer system is more targeted and timely. The university students of Australia have not been forgotten by Labor governments. I stress that. After a decade of underinvestment by the Howard government, Australian universities were in a dire state when Labor came to power in 2007. That is why we increased funding to universities by more than 50 per cent.


Griffith University is one of Australia's most innovative tertiary institutions and its Nathan campus is located right in my electorate; I drive past it every day when I go to work. I have spoken of Griffith University many times in this chamber, and I am very proud of its numerous achievements. Many students at Griffith are already well supported by the Gillard government's measures. For example, we provide start-up scholarships worth $2,100 to students receiving youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy living allowance. We have lowered the youth allowance age of independence and we are helping many first-year students who must live away from home to study with relocation scholarships worth up to $4,000. This assistance, plus $1,000 in subsequent years, will go a long way to making sure that Moreton students who can no longer live at home get the best start to their tertiary education. I thank the Gillard government for its focus on nurturing tomorrow's leaders.


Another function of this bill is to remove the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat certain assets—primarily shares, units in a trust and land—as trading stock. This measure will reduce present ambiguity around the application of the trading stock provisions.


Another aspect of this bill which speaks to the fundamental principle of fairness in Australia is tax exemptions for payments to individuals impacted in recent flooding in New South Wales and also in my home state of Queensland. The Gillard government is making ex gratia payments to New Zealand special category visa holders who have been impacted by the 2012 floods exempt from income tax. This is in line with the payments' counterparts, the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments, which are also exempt. We made these payments exempt for eligible New Zealand residents during the summer of sorrow in 2010-11, and again for those struck by Cyclone Yasi in February last year. New Zealanders living in western Queensland need our help to cope with the financial hardship wrought by the 2012 floodwaters just like their Australian neighbours.


Natural disasters have rocked Queensland in recent times but have served to show the world the compassion and resilience that exists in Australian communities. This spirit was evident in the faces of many people in my own electorate who were hit hard by the 2011 floods. I welcome all measures to help everyone affected by this most recent natural disaster, as my community is only just starting to get back on its feet.


On a different note, but still on the theme of doing the right thing, this bill extends the phasing out of a truly outdated tax offset, the dependent spouse tax offset. This relic of the tax system is better placed in a black-and-white television show than in modern-day Australia. The dependent spouse tax offset was introduced at a time when a husband was expected to maintain a spouse, even without children, and there were limited employment opportunities for women. Considering that the leader of our country and our head of state are women, this is definitely no longer the case in modern Australia. Our action to phase out this offset is based on a recommendation from the Australia's Future Tax System Review. Actions such as this are vital as we update the tax and transfer system to better align with community expectations. It is important that all Australians who can work do so. However, we know it can be unreasonable for a spouse who has been out of the workforce for a very long time to be expected to find work. That is why we are keeping the current system for spouses who were born before 1 July 1952. In the 2011-12 budget the Gillard government introduced the carer spouse and invalid spouse tax offset to ensure that taxpayers who maintain a spouse who is unable to work because of their invalidity or carer obligations are not affected by these long overdue changes. We have also taken the limited employment opportunities in regional areas into account, making sure that taxpayers eligible for the zone tax offset will not have their entitlement affected.


Finally, this bill makes miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. These changes are part of our commitment to look after the tax system. Such changes are made from time to time to correct technical or drafting issues, remove anomalies and correct unintended outcomes in the tax legislation; in this case the changes address minor technical issues which have been identified with the minerals resource rent tax legislation. Such bills have been aimed at delivering practical measures to support individuals, families and small businesses across Australia. We must continue to improve the quality of our systems, continually evaluating processes to ensure they suit the aims of modern Australia. This bill is a fine example of the Gillard government's commitment and I commend it to the House.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:38):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 implements the government's 2011-12 budget measure to disallow deductions against government assistance payments. The measure reinstates the principle that stood prior to the High Court decision, in the Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis, that taxpayers should not be able to claim a deduction for expenses they incur in qualifying for government assistance income. Disallowing deductions against rebateable benefits recognises that these benefits are effectively tax free because of the operation of the beneficiary tax offset. 


This measure is important as it restores equity in the tax system so that individuals with the same level of income pay the same amount of tax. The measure is also important as it provides certainty to taxpayers on the scope of eligible deductions. The government provides targeted and timely assistance to the students who need it the most through the transfer system. Measures this government has introduced include start-up scholarships for new students, relocation scholarships for students who need to live away from home to study and a reduction in the age of independence for youth allowance to 22 from 1 January 2012.


Schedule 2 amends the income tax law to clarify the tax treatment of certain assets owned by a complying superannuation entity, including shares, units in a trust and land. These changes remove the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat these assets as trading stock, which is consistent with the general industry practice of treating shares on capital account.


Schedule 3 provides an exemption for ex gratia payments made to certain New Zealand visa holders affected by the recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland. Exempting these payments from income tax maximises the amount of payments that individuals receive and is consistent with the tax exemption provided to the equivalent payments to Australians, which is the Australian government disaster recovery payment. It is also consistent with the exemption provided for ex gratia payments to certain New Zealanders affected by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi.


Schedule 4 of this bill implements the government's 2011-12 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure to phase out the dependent spouse tax offset for dependent spouses born on or after 1 July 1952. The dependent spouse tax offset needs to be reformed to allow for Australia's modern and growing economy. This reform is an important measure to reduce the disincentive for dependent spouses without children to undertake paid employment. Taxpayers with a dependent spouse aged 60 or over on 1 July 2012 will not be affected by this measure, nor will dependent spouses with children, or taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces or overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure.


Schedule 5 rectifies some minor technical and machinery errors which have been identified in the taxation laws. The government periodically progresses miscellaneous amendments like these as part of its care and maintenance of the taxation laws. I commend the bill to the House.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:02):  This tax law amendment bill was introduced into this place on 21 March by the Assistant Treasurer. I will say at the outset that the opposition will not be opposing this bill. It has five schedules. I will very briefly run through each of them as the minister did during his introduction back in March.


The first schedule disallows a deduction against rebatable benefits from 1 July 2012. This relates to a 2010 High Court case that held that study expenses incurred in gaining student Youth Allowance were able to be deducted from assessable income. In summary, that case changed what had been the previous law and practice prior to that decision. It was the position not only of this government but of previous governments, including the Howard government, that study expenses not related to employment were not tax deductible. Following the High Court decision, the government announced in the 2011-12 budget that it would disallow deductions from 1 July 2012, although it would allow them for 2010-11 and prior income years in line with the court decision. This change restores the tax position to what it was prior to that High Court decision or what the understanding of it was.


The second schedule relates to limited trading stock exemptions for superannuation funds and removes the trading stock exemption to the capital gains tax primary code rule for certain assets of a complying super fund. The Assistant Treasurer outlined this schedule in some detail in his introductory speech.


The third schedule is a tax exemption for ex gratia payments to New Zealand non-protected special category visa holders. Essentially, it exempts income tax ex gratia payments to New Zealand non-protected special category visa holders paid in relation to the floods in January of this year. This schedule is necessary for consistent treatment with other previous natural disasters and payments in this regard and is non-controversial.


Schedule 4 enacts a decision that the government announced, I am pretty sure, in the MYEFO with respect to the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset.


The final schedule, as is always the way with these tax laws amendment bills, is a series of miscellaneous changes to address what are always termed 'minor technical deficiencies'. In this case, it is in the MRRT legislation, we are told, and a series of other drafting issues that are necessary.


As I indicated at the outset, we will not be opposing the bill. Of course, as we have pointed out, the MRRT bills as passed were legislatively flawed—and the government knew it when they put them forward—and schedule 5 deals with very technical issues. Each of the four unrelated schedules relate to fairly technical tax issues and, as is almost always the case, the coalition comes to these debates wanting to see improvements in the technical aspects of the tax legislation, and this is no different.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (18:07):  Tax reform is continuous because it is essential that the government of the day ensures that our taxation system is fit for the purpose. Included in those purposes is regulating and encouraging activity, raising revenue and, in certain circumstances, discouraging certain activity, such as smoking cigarettes and the like. The measures contained within this series of bills go to each of those points. In most respects, they appear to have the support of all members of this House—and that is welcomed, because there have been instances where legislation intended to reform the tax system has not enjoyed support on all sides of this House—and it is probably why the Treasurer was able to stand up in his budget speech last night and deliver a budget which is going to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and at the same time provide additional funds for much needed social purposes. This is in complete contrast with those on the other side, who have a gaping $70 billion black hole in their budget. The reason there is a $70 billion black hole in their budget is that they are not willing to do the hard yards—in particular when it comes to putting in place responsible savings measures. 


There are five schedules in the Tax Law Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012; the first of which has the intention of putting in place amendments which will restore the intended operation of the GST law. This was made necessary because of an adverse decision in the Department of Infrastructure and Transport case. It will ensure that the supply by a healthcare provider paid for by an insurer or a government entity is treated as GST-free supply, where the related supply from the healthcare provider to an individual is GST-free health supply. The amendments avoid increased compliance costs arising for taxpayers in the multiparty arrangements involving suppliers of health related goods and services, and have been supported by industry. 


The second schedule also deals with GST treatment of appropriations. The amendments again restore the policy intent of GST law following another adverse decision in 2009 of the full Federal Court in the TT-Line case. The amendments will ensure that payments under a government appropriation relating to the non-commercial activity of government related entities are not subject to GST. This was the understanding of the law prior to the TT-Line decision. The amendments will ensure that there is no increase in compliance or cash-flow costs for government entities and that the Commonwealth, states and territories will not need to change their budgetary processes.


Schedule 3 of the bill is a savings measure. Schedule 3 goes to the superannuation concessional contributions cap. It attempts to put back the indexation that would otherwise have applied for the concessional contributions cap. It was expected that the indexation would increase the concessional contributions cap from $25,000 to $35,000 per annum in the year 2013-14. The pause in indexation essentially means that the cap will not now increase until 2014-15. As the higher concessional contributions cap for individuals aged 50 and over and the non-concessional contribution cap only move with changes in the general contributions cap, these contributions caps will not change in 2013-14. They are expected to generate savings in the order of $485 million over the forward estimates period. It is an important savings measure and again one that enables us to deliver a budget which will return to surplus. 


The fourth schedule goes to the situation where taxpayers either accidentally or inadvertently make contributions in excess of the concessional contributions, thereby attracting a greater tax upon those contributions. The measures in this bill will enable the tax office to refund—on the request of the taxpayer, without attracting any more than the marginal tax that would otherwise apply to those superannuation contributions—those excess superannuation contributions as if they had not been paid as superannuation and are just taken as any normal form of income. 


The fifth and sixth schedules go to the disclosure of superannuation information. The sixth schedule in particular is important because it places an obligation on employers to advise when the superannuation guarantee contributions are going to be made to their employees. This is important. It works hand-in-hand with the Fair Work legislation because it sends a trigger to the individual employee enabling them to check that their superannuation contributions have been made.


The ATO reports that the vast majority of employers are paying in accordance with their obligations their superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees. But the 2010-11 annual report reported that there were in excess of 17,000 individual employee complaints in relation to suspected non-payment of superannuation entitlements. Nearly $269 million in unpaid superannuation entitlements was collected and deposited into employee superannuation accounts as a result of these complaints and the investigations by the tax office, and there were around $140 million in penalties. Whilst it may only be one per cent of the employer population that is not complying with their obligations, the impact on employees is profound, and that early signal to the employee, which enables them to check if they fear their superannuation contributions are not being made, saves a lot of heartache for the employee. It ensures that their entitlements are paid in full and on time and alerts the tax office, as well as the employee, to other issues that may be going on inside the firm. I am very pleased that each of these schedules is enjoying the bipartisan support of all members in this place—as indeed they should. I commend this legislation to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:16):  It is my pleasure tonight to rise on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. This bill is an important part of the government's economic reforms—a set of economic reforms that are laying the foundation for Australia's prosperity. It is a set of reforms that recognise we are here not just to help in solving immediate problems but also to put in place long-term solutions. I see the Assistant Treasurer in the chair here, and I would note in particular the aged care reforms, a set of reforms that are long overdue and that recognise that for too long the Howard government put bandaids on an aged care system that really needed root and branch reform. I commend him for his work on aged care reform.


In the area of tax laws, this Labor government is committed to improving the tax schedule. We put in place the Henry review—a comprehensive review in the spirit of the 1975 Asprey review—which really looked right across the tax code at reforms that were needed. One of those reforms was the abolition of the dependent spouse tax offset, and this bill continues that. In an earlier bill, this parliament chose to abolish the dependent spouse tax offset, except for taxpayers with a spouse born on or before 1972. Now that date is taken back to 1952. That is an appropriate change, recognising the change in our society since the dependent spouse tax offset was put in place. It recognises that a dependent spouse tax offset was a measure that might have been appropriate in a day when most men worked and most women were homemakers, but is not appropriate in modern Australia.


In the same spirit, we are continuing to modernise a range of different tax measures. Today this House has been debating the abolition of the education tax refund and its replacement with the schoolkids bonus. That again was an updating of the tax and benefit system, and it was an updating that recognised that the education tax refund was not being claimed by one million of the 1.3 million Australians who were eligible for it. Those opposite in the debate today were arguing that the one million out of 1.3 million Australians who were not claiming the tax refund in full somehow did not want the money. Well, they would have been the first to have met an Australian who did not want $410 for a primary school child and $820 for a secondary school child. What is more likely, and the reason that we reformed that particular provision, was that Australians were simply too time poor and busy to be able to keep the receipts necessary to make those claims. One of my staff related to me a conversation she had had with friends of hers who had three young children and who were simply unaware of the education tax refund. They were on family tax benefit part A: they were doing it tough and they needed the money, but they did not know about the provision and they were not getting those benefits.


As John Maynard Keynes once said: 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?' We on this side of the House looked at the facts and they were incontrovertible. One million out of 1.3 million Australians were not claiming the education tax refund. It just was not good enough, and we replaced it with the schoolkids bonus—a measure which goes to all Australians. Those opposite are concerned that the schoolkids bonus will not be spent on education expenses, but it is very clear when you look at Australian families that they are spending substantial amounts of money on their children's education.


It is unusual to see those opposite arguing that money going to families should be tied. If you like, it is a conservative notion, not a liberal notion. If you are a small 'l' liberal, then you believe in putting money in the hands of families. You trust them to do with that money what is best. If you are a conservative you do not trust families. It is the spirit of conservatism that gave rise in the United States to the food stamp system, a notion that you cannot just give poor people money, you have to give them tied money—money that is tied to spending on food. We in Australia have not had things like food stamps because we have trusted low-income Australians to do the right thing with money that is given to them by the government. That is the same spirit that embodies the schoolkids bonus. It is a spirit that says if you put money in the hands of parents of school-aged children they will do the right thing with that money, but it is not necessary to tie that money to educational expenditure to get a better outcome. Those opposite, taking the conservative path, distrust low- and middle-income Australians to do the right thing by their kids. We on this side of the House are taking the small 'l' liberal approach, the market-based approach—as on so many issues—by taking the view that Australians will do the right thing with money that is placed in their hands. We have seen the clear contrasts in this budget process. We have seen the strong recognition from the IMF of Australia's fiscal position and a broad recognition across economic commentators that Labor has a lower tax-to-GDP ratio than the Howard government did—that it is Labor that delivered real spending cuts. It is a real contrast, in that sense, with what happened in the Howard government under mining boom mark 1. The Howard government never had to face the tough decisions. It saw the money roll in and it just rolled it out the door. 


It is Labor which has made tough decisions about what we are not going to continue funding. The government is about values, priorities and making choices for things you are not going to do. That is a great Labor tradition, with finance ministers Peter Walsh, Lindsay Tanner and now Penny Wong. What it chooses not to do marks out a party as much as what it chooses to do. But in this budget we are choosing to invest in critical areas of the economy—in skills and training, in a national broadband network, in spreading the benefits of the mining boom, in putting a price on carbon and in returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13.


Those opposite are like deer in the headlights. That is probably a little unfair to deer. Let us think about fish out of water. They are flip-flopping like fish out of water. We saw this in the famous budget reply of 2010. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would identify savings, and then the member for North Sydney said that he would identify savings and then the member for Goldstein was going to do it. Finally, the fish flopped here and there and was just left with an adviser at the back of the room shaking his head.


We saw it with the $70 billion black hole. The member for Goldstein and the member for North Sydney went to-and-fro on talk show after talk show on whether or not the $70 billion black hole was a real figure. Sometimes they said: 'Yes, it's our figure. It's a big target to meet.' Sometimes they said, 'That's a Labor hoax.' They were flip-flopping like a fish out of water. We have seen it in the question of entitlements. When we look to means-test benefits, such as family tax benefit part B, the baby bonus and the private health insurance rebate, those opposite say we are playing the politics of envy. They say that we are engaging in class warfare when we put in place means tests at $150,000. The shadow Treasurer went overseas and said, 'We'd like to have a Hong Kong style welfare state.' That is a pretty substantial cut to benefits, one would think. Then the Leader of the Opposition came out immediately and said: 'Oh, no. The coalition won't be cutting benefits.' They are flip-flopping like fish out of water.


When it comes to economic policy there is really only one member of their frontbench who does not look like a fish out of water and that is the member for Wentworth. He delivered a very thoughtful speech at a Melbourne institute event I attended here in Canberra. He spoke about his views on a sovereign wealth fund. I disagree with his conclusion that Australia needs a sovereign wealth fund but he put, quite provocatively, the argument that under the Howard government spending had sometimes got out of control, and argued that this could be the case for other governments. I can imagine his colleagues afterwards, saying: 'What were you doing up there on the surface? Surely you should be down here with us, down here swimming in the warm waters of populism.'


We know what their view is on costings. We have had very clear statements that the coalition are now going to eschew the parliamentary budget office—the same parliamentary budget office that Senator Joyce and the member for Higgins said they would back. They backed off that because they realised how deep their budget crater is. They realised the problem they got themselves into last time, when they went to the election and were later found to have an $11 billion black hole in their costings. 


In response to Treasury finding the $11 billion black hole we saw the member for Mackellar and the member for Goldstein traducing the reputation of Ken Henry, a great Australian who was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by Peter Costello. Their response to Ken Henry finding that the coalition costings did not add up was a bit like the rich kid whose maths teacher finds a mistake in his homework—he immediately goes to the principal and asks for the maths teacher to be fired. They were in here attacking Ken Henry and attacking the Department of the Treasury for what they said was politicised work. It was nothing of the sort. The Department of the Treasury engaged in the same costings process for the coalition that it has engaged in for other political parties. 


The coalition have now moved to an audit commission. That audit commission is simply a phrase to disguise the fact that their costings will not be audited this time. Why will they not be audited? It is because when they went to the last election they discovered that audit has a legal meaning. If you want an accounting firm to audit your costings, it must afterwards say that they have been audited. I spoke yesterday in this place about the shadow Treasurer's attempts to suggest that there was such a thing as a small 'a' audit and that somehow the coalition could engage in a small 'a' audit rather than a large 'A' audit. Unfortunately, there is no such thing.


That is where we find ourselves, with the coalition, at the moment: all promises to special interests but an inability to make the hard decisions that government requires. Government does require often unpopular decisions to be made. Certainly we would not be claiming that every decision made by this government has been greeted with universal acclaim by the Australian people. But that is true of all the major economic reforms in Australian history. Great reform is not invariably greeted with cheering in the streets. It requires steady argumentation. It requires engaging the Australian people in a long conversation about why reforms are necessary.


You can imagine the Leader of the Opposition had he been leader when Australia was to float the dollar. He would have immediately engaged in fearmongering about foreign speculators. We know those opposite have engaged in fearmongering on foreigners. We see that with foreign ownership debates. 'What are foreign currency speculators doing determining the level of our dollar?' the Leader of the Opposition might have then said. In fact, we know he opposed the floating of the dollar as late as a decade after the dollar had been floated. But we now know that that was an enormously important economic reform. It acted like a shock absorber for the Australian economy. When international shocks come along, a floating exchange rate is enormously important to the prosperity of Australians.


Can you imagine if the Leader of the Opposition had been leader when Australia put in place substantial tariff cuts—tariff cuts that halved the price of a pair of kids' school shoes, tariff cuts that puts thousands of dollars in the pockets of Australian households? They were tariff cuts which could, all too easily, have been demonised by a populist looking for short-term gain. You can imagine what the Leader of the Opposition would have done— (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:31):  I rise to speak, very quickly, in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012. This bill is another step forward in the Gillard government's mission to reform the tax system and make it fairer for all Australians. It brings in 2011-12 budget measures aimed at fostering a prosperous and even-handed taxation system—an improved system that supports all Australians.


Australian Labor governments continue to lead the way. We have led our country through global economic uncertainty to today, where it stands as a powerhouse economy on the world stage, the envy of Europe and the OECD, as acknowledged by the leader opposite—when he is in Europe.


We have ensured our fiscal position remains strong despite the global financial crisis. Unlike many other nations, we have successfully avoided recession and prevented serious job losses. This alone is a record of which to be proud. But not only did we safeguard our budget position and Australian jobs; we oversaw outstanding employment growth and a record investment pipeline of $456 billion, as I heard from the Treasurer today, despite the gloom and doom predictions of those opposite of what would be happening in the minerals sector when we brought in the MRRT.


More than 750,000 jobs have been created since the Labor government was first elected. Obviously there is more to be done. It is a patchy economy; we know that. While others pause we push ahead in the interests of the Australian people, and that is what this legislation is all about.


A key Australian value is the concept of a fair go. This bill moves to correct inequity in the tax system created by the High Court decision in the Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis case. It simply is not fair that taxpayers with the same level of income will have different deduction entitlements depending on whether they receive a taxable government assistance payment. The Anstis decision violates the basic principle that expenses incurred in generating income that is effectively tax-free should not then be deductible—that is, no money into the public purse should prohibit you from taking money out of the public purse. Overturning the High Court decision is the right thing to do in order to make the system fairer for everybody.


The Gillard government is committed to helping Australian students on income support, but this must be done efficiently and effectively. Providing assistance via the transfer system is more targeted and timely. The university students of Australia have not been forgotten by Labor governments. I stress that. After a decade of underinvestment by the Howard government, Australian universities were in a dire state when Labor came to power in 2007. That is why we increased funding to universities by more than 50 per cent.


Griffith University is one of Australia's most innovative tertiary institutions and its Nathan campus is located right in my electorate; I drive past it every day when I go to work. I have spoken of Griffith University many times in this chamber, and I am very proud of its numerous achievements. Many students at Griffith are already well supported by the Gillard government's measures. For example, we provide start-up scholarships worth $2,100 to students receiving youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy living allowance. We have lowered the youth allowance age of independence and we are helping many first-year students who must live away from home to study with relocation scholarships worth up to $4,000. This assistance, plus $1,000 in subsequent years, will go a long way to making sure that Moreton students who can no longer live at home get the best start to their tertiary education. I thank the Gillard government for its focus on nurturing tomorrow's leaders.


Another function of this bill is to remove the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat certain assets—primarily shares, units in a trust and land—as trading stock. This measure will reduce present ambiguity around the application of the trading stock provisions.


Another aspect of this bill which speaks to the fundamental principle of fairness in Australia is tax exemptions for payments to individuals impacted in recent flooding in New South Wales and also in my home state of Queensland. The Gillard government is making ex gratia payments to New Zealand special category visa holders who have been impacted by the 2012 floods exempt from income tax. This is in line with the payments' counterparts, the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments, which are also exempt. We made these payments exempt for eligible New Zealand residents during the summer of sorrow in 2010-11, and again for those struck by Cyclone Yasi in February last year. New Zealanders living in western Queensland need our help to cope with the financial hardship wrought by the 2012 floodwaters just like their Australian neighbours.


Natural disasters have rocked Queensland in recent times but have served to show the world the compassion and resilience that exists in Australian communities. This spirit was evident in the faces of many people in my own electorate who were hit hard by the 2011 floods. I welcome all measures to help everyone affected by this most recent natural disaster, as my community is only just starting to get back on its feet.


On a different note, but still on the theme of doing the right thing, this bill extends the phasing out of a truly outdated tax offset, the dependent spouse tax offset. This relic of the tax system is better placed in a black-and-white television show than in modern-day Australia. The dependent spouse tax offset was introduced at a time when a husband was expected to maintain a spouse, even without children, and there were limited employment opportunities for women. Considering that the leader of our country and our head of state are women, this is definitely no longer the case in modern Australia. Our action to phase out this offset is based on a recommendation from the Australia's Future Tax System Review. Actions such as this are vital as we update the tax and transfer system to better align with community expectations. It is important that all Australians who can work do so. However, we know it can be unreasonable for a spouse who has been out of the workforce for a very long time to be expected to find work. That is why we are keeping the current system for spouses who were born before 1 July 1952. In the 2011-12 budget the Gillard government introduced the carer spouse and invalid spouse tax offset to ensure that taxpayers who maintain a spouse who is unable to work because of their invalidity or carer obligations are not affected by these long overdue changes. We have also taken the limited employment opportunities in regional areas into account, making sure that taxpayers eligible for the zone tax offset will not have their entitlement affected.


Finally, this bill makes miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. These changes are part of our commitment to look after the tax system. Such changes are made from time to time to correct technical or drafting issues, remove anomalies and correct unintended outcomes in the tax legislation; in this case the changes address minor technical issues which have been identified with the minerals resource rent tax legislation. Such bills have been aimed at delivering practical measures to support individuals, families and small businesses across Australia. We must continue to improve the quality of our systems, continually evaluating processes to ensure they suit the aims of modern Australia. This bill is a fine example of the Gillard government's commitment and I commend it to the House.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:38):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 implements the government's 2011-12 budget measure to disallow deductions against government assistance payments. The measure reinstates the principle that stood prior to the High Court decision, in the Commissioner of Taxation v Anstis, that taxpayers should not be able to claim a deduction for expenses they incur in qualifying for government assistance income. Disallowing deductions against rebateable benefits recognises that these benefits are effectively tax free because of the operation of the beneficiary tax offset. 


This measure is important as it restores equity in the tax system so that individuals with the same level of income pay the same amount of tax. The measure is also important as it provides certainty to taxpayers on the scope of eligible deductions. The government provides targeted and timely assistance to the students who need it the most through the transfer system. Measures this government has introduced include start-up scholarships for new students, relocation scholarships for students who need to live away from home to study and a reduction in the age of independence for youth allowance to 22 from 1 January 2012.


Schedule 2 amends the income tax law to clarify the tax treatment of certain assets owned by a complying superannuation entity, including shares, units in a trust and land. These changes remove the ability of complying superannuation entities to treat these assets as trading stock, which is consistent with the general industry practice of treating shares on capital account.


Schedule 3 provides an exemption for ex gratia payments made to certain New Zealand visa holders affected by the recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland. Exempting these payments from income tax maximises the amount of payments that individuals receive and is consistent with the tax exemption provided to the equivalent payments to Australians, which is the Australian government disaster recovery payment. It is also consistent with the exemption provided for ex gratia payments to certain New Zealanders affected by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi.


Schedule 4 of this bill implements the government's 2011-12 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure to phase out the dependent spouse tax offset for dependent spouses born on or after 1 July 1952. The dependent spouse tax offset needs to be reformed to allow for Australia's modern and growing economy. This reform is an important measure to reduce the disincentive for dependent spouses without children to undertake paid employment. Taxpayers with a dependent spouse aged 60 or over on 1 July 2012 will not be affected by this measure, nor will dependent spouses with children, or taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces or overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure.


Schedule 5 rectifies some minor technical and machinery errors which have been identified in the taxation laws. The government periodically progresses miscellaneous amendments like these as part of its care and maintenance of the taxation laws. I commend the bill to the House.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (18:59):  It is the day after the federal budget—a budget which sees this government talking the talk of fiscal consolidation but walking the walk of reckless spending and of injecting money into their latest vote-buying exercise, whatever it takes. What a walk of shame this is. When I read through the details of this budget I am in despair and disappointment about its effect on my electorate of Farrer. The budget is dominated completely by the carbon tax—even though it was not really mentioned by the Treasurer in his speech. It is, without doubt, the elephant in the room. 


On 6 July last year, I extended a very warm welcome to the Prime Minister to come to my electorate to talk to my constituents face to face about her government's proposed carbon tax. My letter was penned in this House 309 days ago. I have had no reply; the invitation is still open for acceptance. The carbon tax is the overriding concern for families and individual members of my electorate, and there is a good reason. They know that it will push up the prices of everything—especially electricity, groceries and health care. If you want an idea of how this carbon tax will hit them—one you might not immediately think of—there is no better example than my home town of Albury, where the local council has just factored in the impact of the new carbon tax. The irony is that in the very first year Albury City Council expects to have a zero carbon tax liability. Despite there being apparently no impact, Albury has just drafted its budget for 2012-13 and it will bump up rates by over $150 a year per household. The mayor reported that the increases are needed to meet future carbon tax liabilities and increasing electricity and fuel costs. There will be an eight per cent increase in our electricity charges alone due to the carbon tax. The council has also calculated that the extra cost to recover for future local waste collection will be an extra $35 per annum per household for domestic waste. From day one, year one, my constituents are being hit, and that is before they even leave their house.


I was in Broken Hill at the fabulous Agfair last weekend, meeting the people of the far west of New South Wales. It was with them in mind that I looked through the budget last night and I found one thing—one item of any specific note for my electorate, which covers a third of rural New South Wales. The University of Sydney Department of Rural Health in Broken Hill has received money in the federal budget for part of a regional health package: $4.7 million. It was a project that I and many others supported and we are grateful. The Rural Doctors Association has welcomed the investment, with a big 'but'; the chief executive said that the budget does not do enough to ensure that rural communities have enough medical staff. The infrastructure spending might be still in place—just—but the actual incentives to get medical allied doctors et cetera to the bush is not there. On ABC Radio today, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Bernie Ripoll, said that the government is focused on keeping doctors in rural jobs. But why does this government get it wrong time and again? That was the program that was cut back in last night's budget.


Over the next four years, $5.454 billion is being stripped from Defence. This cut, of around 10 per cent, is the biggest single reduction in Defence investment since the end of the Korean War—but in entirely different strategic circumstances. I have Bandiana Army Base in the electorate of Indi, close to me in Albury-Wodonga. There is Kapooka in the electorate of Riverina, and the member for Riverina is concerned about that. There is also Mulwala, which is where propellant is manufactured for explosives and bullets that are used overseas. I will be watching very closely to make sure that none of these facilities is affected by this budget.


I also place on record my great concern for the veterans not only from the Korean and Vietnam wars but also from Iraq, Afghanistan and our peacekeeping forces, who need care and attention from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The government had better not be cutting one single dollar from looking after our returned service men and women.


There is disappointing news from the Murray-Darling Basin in my electorate, and I will talk about that at another time. Essentially, the government is allocating over $1 billion to water buybacks post 2015— (Time expired)

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (09:30):  I recently held my second annual McPherson Community Achiever Awards at the Burleigh Waters Community Centre to formally recognise the work done by many of the unsung heroes of the McPherson community. The work done by each of this year's 45 outstanding recipients reinforces the strong community spirit we have on the Gold Coast. I believe Gold Coasters are very well recognised for their community spirit—and, in fact, their generosity of spirit—and this was clearly on display at the McPherson Community Achiever Awards.


This year's recipients have been recognised for their roles in a number of organisations, and I will name just a few of those. There was surf lifesaving, the Lions and Lioness clubs, the Gold Coast Orchid Society, RACQ CareFlight, our local RSLs, the Gold Coast Kidney Support Network, St Vincent de Paul, the Gold Coast Post Polio Support Network, Scouts, bowls clubs, Neighbourhood Watch and Crime Stoppers. We also had a nomination—a successful recipient—of a teacher at the Mudgeeraba Special School, for her very outstanding work with our special needs children.


Each recipient made a unique contribution to the community and in many different ways added to the lives of those who are the most vulnerable. Some recipients were recognised for their work as volunteers in the community, and others were recognised for going above and beyond the call of duty in their work. I would like to acknowledge each of those recipients again: Steve and Lyn Boyle, Ross Bussell, Lyn Calligros, Jared Clarke, Fred Craddock, Liz Connolly, Bronwyn Drinkwater, Glen Edmonds, Norma Evans, Elizabeth Fitchett, Peter and Lisa Gallagher, Peter Garrett, Scott Gilbert, Patrick Gillett, Lyn Glover, Dion Harris, Daren Healey, Sandra Hill, Stuart Hogben, Alex Jih, Daniel Kent, Vic Knowles, Barbara Lee, Zita Lepahe, Marsha Maynard, Joe McKone, Brian Milligan, Erin Mitchell, Merv Newman, Shelley Nolan, Carole Palesy, Werner Piehler, Jamie Quinn, Mark Ross, Elaine and Irving Schuster, Barbara Selby, Sonia Smith, Sheila Storrs, Paul Trewartha, Sue Wickham, Allan Williams and Jill Wych.


Once again, I would like to congratulate them on their very outstanding efforts and all they do for the community. The contributions made by each of these recipients and those of hardworking volunteers across the country go largely unrecognised. The McPherson Community Achiever Awards were my opportunity to thank those people for their outstanding contributions to the community.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (10:02):  I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012 and the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No.2) 2012. I note that these bills represent the third tranche of changes introduced by the government to give effect to the antidumping announcements it made in the middle of last year. So, appreciating that it may drag out this debate for far longer than is necessary, I do not intend to restate many of the points and arguments that I have made on each of the recent previous occasions that antidumping has been the subject of debate in the House and the Federation Chamber.


Suffice it to say that the coalition does, again, intend to give its support to the government on each of these two bills. In fact, we have been pushing for revisions to the antidumping regime since before the 2010 election—in other words, from long before the government finally announced its own changes. We have consistently said that we support changes to the current antidumping regime wherever those changes are sensible and practical. And we are happy to accept that this tranche of legislation meets those tests.


We are glad, in particular, to support the changes that give the minister a wider ambit and range of options in applying duties to goods that are considered to have been dumped in Australia. If the removal of limitations upon the calculation of the so-called 'normal value' of the relevant good or goods works as I think the government intends, that is also a positive step. We also have no problem with altering the minister's powers in such a way as to provide more scope and flexibility for antidumping duties to be extended beyond their originally nominated termination date. That said, we need to be very careful that that particular amendment is not ultimately used as an excuse for procrastinating and delay, because it is critically important for all of us to recognise that some of the current processes are simply too slow and cumbersome and undermine the very purpose of an antidumping regime in the first place. Anything that potentially adds to that problem of the slow and cumbersome culture is obviously a step backwards. On that note and at the risk of repeating myself again from earlier debates, I also want to make the point that the coalition believes it is critical that those administering Australia's antidumping dumping system be provided with new resources, not money shifted into the branch from other areas of Customs and especially not at a time when large cuts have already been made to other areas of the agency, including some of the deepest cuts in its history in last night's budget.


The important thing that a government can do in the first instance in the area of effective antidumping policy is provide an appropriate level of administrative support because it is that step more than any other which will help to bring cases to a speedy resolution, including by increasing the opportunity to use preliminary affirmative determinations. Just in passing, I also want to quickly note that clause 9 of the explanatory memorandum for the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill says:


The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dumping Duty Act to make it easier to understand and less complex.


With that in mind, I would suggest in good faith to the government and to the relevant officers from Customs that they may want to have a look at the wording of some of the clauses and references in the explanatory memorandum—in particular, I think they may want to revisit clause 7.1 of the explanatory memorandum for the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill No. 2. I may well have overlooked or misunderstood or misinterpreted something but, on the face of it, I think some words may be missing from that sentence or, at the very least, some words may need to be changed in order to clarify the precise meaning of that clause for most people who come to read and try and understand what it means. As it stands, at least to my eyes, the first part of the sentence does not make sense and that is in addition to a small problem with pluralisation in the last part of the sentence as well.


On the first page of that same explanatory memorandum there is also a reference to where the regulation impact statement for the bill can supposedly be found. But if I am reading that wording exactly, it says that statement can be found in the explanatory memorandum for yet another bill. And then to complicate matters it gives what I think is the wrong title of that other bill. On top of that, the explanatory memorandum for the bill to which, I can only presume, it is referring does not seem to contain a regulation impact statement anyway. So when we are dealing with quite complex legislation and when one of the clearly stated aims of these changes is to make things easier to understand, confused drafting like this does not help.


Not delving all that far back into history, there were many examples of poor drafting and poorly chosen wording in explanatory memoranda. For example, the infamous recent bills in the innovation portfolio that the government used to erroneously change the R&D tax concession into a R&D tax credit. Given the horrible confusion and severely botched processes to which all of that has ultimately contributed—and I might add to which there is still no clarity in many areas—I would urge the minister and Customs in the strongest possible terms to steer violently away from that type of drafting.


I would like to restate the coalition support for each of these bills and to say that we will happily stand ready to continue to make a range of very practical, very sensible improvements to Australia's antidumping arrangements to ensure that they are accessible and that they are effective in preventing goods being dumped in Australia. That is the very least that industry expects—just a system that actually works and that is not too expensive or too complicated to access. Indeed, if we are privileged enough to be elected to government at the next election we look forward very much to the potential opportunity as a coalition to implement the antidumping policy we announced publicly in November of last year, which has received widespread industry acclaim.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:09):  I speak in support of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 and the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012. On 20 April 2012, Capral CEO Phil Jobe met with the federal Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare, and me. Bundamba aluminium business Capral is quoted in the Queensland Times calling on us to bring forward this legislation. Mr Jobe said:


Chinese manufacturers are currently exploiting and circumventing existing legislation … The anti-dumping laws haven't been updated in over a decade, so it's good to see that under this government they are being brought up to date.


A key weakness in Australia's approach to dumping is the abject failure of the previous Howard coalition government and its unmitigated disaster in the recognition of China as a market economy as a precondition of FTA negotiations. That has restricted the ability of local authorities to apply subrogated or proxy pricing in cases where normal values cannot be easily assessed. China, for example, makes it very difficult in this regard. Customs has not been adequately funded or resourced in the past and is really fighting this issue—as are stakeholders like the AWU, Capral and other organisations—with one hand tied behind its back because of the complete and utter disaster of the Howard coalition government in the recognition of China as a market economy. This has resulted in a limited and partial application of relatively small dumping duties in some cases, compared to Canada and the United States, which adopt a very different approach to that of Australia in this regard.


In this country we need a properly resourced and independent antidumping agency responding to dumping and to complaints of stakeholders like the AWU, Capral and others. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is the only agency responsible for antidumping and countervailing investigations in Australia. The Trade Measures Review Officer provides an independent administrative appeal mechanism in relation to these matters. This is probably amongst the most complicated laws you could possibly imagine. For example, Capral itself has been involved in litigation in this regard and has had to spend considerable money on the services of a very eminent QC on numerous occasions to give advice and to represent them in these types of matters.


Paul Howes, the national secretary of the AWU, has said the oversight by Customs historically in this regard has been manifestly inadequate. This is primarily the fault of a failure in the past to address and resource problems of jurisdiction within Customs. Paul Howes says there is insufficient legislative coverage and weak governance in the department. As I said, the United States and Canada have adopted a quasi-judicial approach to the application of this type of legislation in the assessment of any injury, material or otherwise, to domestic industry. We have not adopted that approach. It all comes back to the ground rules and the establishment by the Howard coalition government in relation to the FTA and recognition of China as a market based economy.


In the past, the trade measures branch of Customs has been a little akin to the Swansea licensing bureau in Yes Minister—a poor cousin to colleagues focusing on border protection activities. The consequences are dramatic. We have seen importation of Chinese aluminium extrusion products dramatically impact upon Australian industry. Capral at Bundamba in Ipswich has 300 workers but, sadly, the plant utilisation is about 60 per cent. It is the result of experiencing unfair competition from Chinese imports. There has been a loss of well over $250 million of revenue in this sector. There has been the elimination of production activities and, as I say, suboptimisation of utilisation of plant in Australian facilities—for example, at Capral at Bremer Park in Bundamba, Ipswich. The Chinese have further expanded downstream their fabrication products. Our antidumping decisions in the past have actually buoyed the Chinese exporters. As Phil Jobe said to me in numerous meetings, they cannot believe their luck. We have seen a rising Australian dollar, and this has threatened the Australian industry. The consequences are that Chinese extrusion companies are supplying primary aluminium at rates that are about 20 per cent lower than prevailing world rates. They are simply setting artificially the yuan rate, which a lot of commentators say is 20 to 30 per cent lower than it should be. In addition to that they are subsidising their industries dramatically, dumping lower-than-cost products into Australia. It is unfair for our workers, it is unfair for our employers and it is unfair for our industry. We have seen Chinese aluminium exporters aggressively capture well above 35 per cent of the Australian market in recent years. On a per capita basis, according to the evidence I have obtained, Chinese extrusion exports to Australia are more than five times higher than to any other country, and that is a direct result of failures in the past.


So we need to believe in fair trade as well as free trade. This is not about protectionism. This is about creating the opportunities for our very skilled workers and our very skilled operators, like those at Capral, to make sure we have a level playing field so that we can compete competitively. It is not about breaching our obligations under the WTO rules. It is about making sure that countries comply with those rules and that they do not unfairly dump products into our country in breach of those rules. We are rolling out some of the most effective improvements to Australia's antidumping regime in more than a decade to improve its effectiveness. At the same time, we are reaffirming our commitment to the world trading rules.


We believe in free trade in this country, but we believe that trade should be fair. We do not believe it is fair to Australian workers and Australian manufacturers that China—or any other country—exports its goods to Australia at prices below the price it charges in its home market or below cost. That materially injures Australian businesses and puts Australian jobs at risk. So we have announced a number of reforms, and the legislation before us today is the third tranche of those reforms. I am quite committed as a local federal member in my area to making sure we protect Australian jobs. By that I mean making it fair so that employees, whether  union members or non-union members, of companies like G James Glass & Aluminium, Capral and others in the Ipswich area and the western corridor are given a fair shake with respect to the operation of businesses.


I am pleased that Minister Clare has met with Phil Jobe and stakeholders to make sure we can do everything we can in the legislation to protect Australian jobs and give Australian manufacturers a fair go. Specifically, the legislation before the House today gives the CEO of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service—the minister—the power to act on the basis of all facts available in determining whether a countervailable subsidy has been received and the amount of the countervailing subsidy if adequate information has not been provided to Customs by the country of origin or the company being investigated. A lot of these companies are Chinese state-run companies. The legislation also removes the limitation to the exclusion of profit when considering a normal value of a good and removes the need for a separate review of antidumping measures and a continuation inquiry when they occur in close proximity to one another. That is one of the biggest problems in this area: there is inquiry after inquiry after inquiry—one after another—which comes at a cost to the stakeholders.


One of the great reforms we put in place earlier was to empower organisations like the AWU and Capral to have standing—locus standi, to use the legal expression—to take countervailing measures and to use litigation. In the past, they often did not have the standing they needed. So we are going to do a number of things. We are allowing the minister to use additional forms of interim dumping duty beyond the single duty that is currently provided for. The new forms of duty to be outlined in the regulations are ad valorem duty, a fixed amount of duty or a floor price mechanism. These are part of the announcements that we made in the middle of June 2010 when we described it as streamlining the antidumping system. There are a number of improvements. I think the increase of 45 per cent in Customs staff working on antidumping issues is welcome. I think that has been important in the past. They have not been funded properly with adequate resources. The 30-day time limit which we have imposed for ministerial decisions on antidumping cases is very important. In the past it took ages and ages for decisions to be made and this puts a limit so that the minister can actually make decisions in that regard.


There are a lot of things that we have done. There is stronger compliance. That is one of the things that these bills do. I met with Phil Jobe recently and we talked about the measures at the ports and the waterfront and how they get around our duties and customs. I know that Phil has met with the minister to talk about what we can do in a practical way, a non-legislative way to actually stop Chinese and other companies from getting around our border protection mechanisms.


I think it is important that industry and trade experts have the power, the resources, the expertise, the knowledge and the muscle legislatively and financially to be able to get behind and investigate these complaints. I think there needs to be greater flexibility. I practised as a lawyer for more than 20 years and I am telling you that, when I read the legislation here, I read the litigation, I read the decision making and I read the QC's advice, this is about one of the most complex areas of law. It really is extraordinarily complex. We need a more rigorous appeals process. We need to be supported by more resources and I am glad we are doing that. I am glad we are taking a more flexible approach in terms of the standing of people to do it.


We are making big efforts. There is a lot more to be done. We need fair trade as well as free trade. We need to make sure that workers in the western corridor and across my electorate of Oxley get a fair go in this regard. I am pleased that Minister Clare has come to the plant in Ipswich. He said that Capral's plight was indicative of the manufacturers across the country. In the Queensland Times of 20 April this year he said:


Australian manufacturers are under a lot of pressure. Some of that is due to the high Aussie dollar, and illegal dumping adds extra burdens and extra pressure to these businesses.


I know that, the workers know it, the government knows it and we are acting through this legislation.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:22):     I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 and the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012. Firstly, the coalition supports these bills. They are measures making sensible and practical changes which will help in a small way to address the inherent weakness of Australia's antidumping laws. Our support for this legislation exposes another myth that is perpetuated by this Labor government that we in the coalition oppose everything. Where we see legislation that has merit, such as that in these bills, we will support it but, where we see legislation proposed that has been poorly thought through or is nothing other than a political fix and is not in the best interests of Australia, the coalition will make no apology for vigorously opposing such legislation.


These bills are the third tranche of legislative changes to Australia's existing antidumping regime that Labor has made during this term of parliament and I understand that there are at least one or two additional bills to be introduced later this year. Why has it been necessary for these changes in our antidumping laws to be made in four or more separates tranches spread over 12 months? This remains a mystery that perhaps only the government can answer. It would have been far more efficient for all, especially Australian industry, if these changes to our antidumping regime had been made in one block of legislation, but unfortunately efficiency and this Labor government are not words that are often found in the same sentence. Going to the specifics of the bills, they firstly amend the dumping duty act in order to allow the minister to use different forms of interim dumping duties from those currently used. This change is consistent with the World Trade Organisation's antidumping agreement, which currently does not mandate the method for calculating the level of duty where an interim dumping duty is imposed. These amendments will enable the minister to impose either an ad valorem duty or a fixed amount of duty, a combination of the two or a floor price. Currently, the minister can only use a combination form of interim dumping duty, which is a fixed component or a variable component. This legislation simply gives the minister greater ability to impose the penalty duty required.


The bills also add new provisions to the act which will implement proposals to amend the subsidies provision in the Customs Act to better reflect the definitions and the operative provision of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. In addition these bills amend division 6A, the 'Continuation of anti-dumping measures', of the act, which will enable measures to be amended, including by altering the level of applicable duty, if the minister decides to continue them. Currently, the only means of amending measures that are to be continued is the conduct of a separate review of the measures in close proximity to the continuation inquiry. Again, this gives greater flexibility in dealing with the problem of dumping. In addition, the bills repeal section 269TAC(13) of the Customs Act to remove the current limitations on determining profit when constructing the normal value of the relevant goods alleged to have been dumped in a foreign country. This deletion implements the government's response to recommendation 3.4 of the International Trade Remedies Forum report on the effectiveness of market situation provisions in the Customs Act.


Despite these changes, there are still many practical difficulties in determining when goods are actually dumped. For example, how do you calculate the normal price of a good? In markets where prices change frequently, responding to market conditions, is it the price last week? Is it the price last month? Is it the price last year? For commodities, is it what the price will be in the future? What about exchange rates? How do you calculate how a firm has actually calculated the exchange rate? A company may use an internal hedge, especially in the current market, where we have seen such extreme volatility in exchange rates. Further, how do you calculate the price in the domestic market, where different costs may result in the same goods being sold at different prices in different regional markets within one country?


Then there are the terms of sale. Price differentials, which often may seem to be price discrimination, may be explained by a difference in trading terms. If goods are purchased under a letter of credit this obviously has a different price, as if they were sold on trading terms with 30- or 60-day open terms. There are also credit risks and statutory warranties. All these factors need to be considered in the pricing of goods. Further, how do you actually apply a quantity discount? This is another calculation that Customs must make in determining whether goods have been sold below cost. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for an Australian Customs official to determine whether a good has been exported into Australia at a price that is different or lower than the exporter's home market.


When determining whether goods are being sold at higher prices in the Australian market, we need to make an apples-with-apples comparison. But this is very difficult because often the goods and products exported to Australia are simply not the same as those being sold in the home market. So where an apples-with-apples comparison cannot be made, although Customs officials can look to the price charged by an exporter in another country and make the calculation based on a combination of the exporter's production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins, it is simply impossible for Australian Customs officials to accurately determine what the price would be if the goods were theoretically only available in a foreign market. Thus, any estimation of prices by Customs is purely an arbitrary figure. These are just a few examples of the difficulties that our Customs officials face when implementing this legislation. A recent example of the problems in determining this arose in the electorate I represent where a dumping investigation was undertaken by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service upon an application lodged by Advance Cables, Olex Cables and Prysmian Power Cables and Systems Australia on behalf of Australian industry producing like goods into an alleged dumping concerning electrical cables exported to Australia from the People's Republic of China. I am sure these firms felt that the goods were being dumped into the Australian market at below the cost of what they were made for in China. However, as a result of Customs and Border Protection's investigations, Customs determined that the electric cables exported from China to Australia had not been dumped and therefore terminated the investigation. 


We must also recognise that an effective and workable dumping regime treads a very fine line. An antidumping regime that is too harsh and is too complex can easily be used as a protectionist measure, which harms Australian industry and harms Australian jobs. For example, many Australian manufacturers rely on imported components to manufacture goods in Australia. However, an antidumping regime that is too complex can result in these manufacturers being tied up in red tape, defending dumping claims for a vital business input which they need in their processes here in Australia.


We also need to be aware that this could also work against us in Australia. When most Australian exporters go overseas and try to sell their goods on overseas markets they do their pricing with a sharper pencil and that would be against World Trade Organisation rules. However, these modest amendments to Australia's antidumping laws are not a cure against the many factors that are causing the declining competitiveness of Australian industry. The facts are that while many Australian companies may consider that goods are being dumped into Australia because they seem cheap, the reality is that as a nation we are giving away many of our competitive advantages.


In business, you can only succeed if you have a competitive advantage and you safeguard it, for your competitive advantage is your lifeblood. A company may be able to survive for a while if it has competitive parity but if this turns into a competitive disadvantage, extinction is just around the corner. In Australia, our labour costs are traditionally a competitive disadvantage. We will never be able to compete—nor do we want to—with China and India on labour costs. But one of our greatest competitive advantage is our low-cost electricity supplies. Abundant supplies of high-quality black coal, generating low-cost electricity, is one of the few competitive advantages we have here in Australia. But this government, in an act of economic treason, has surrendered this national competitive advantage. A recent report released by the Energy Users Association of Australia shows average electricity prices in Australia are now amongst the highest in the world and, once the world's biggest carbon tax takes effect, Australian industry will be paying the world's highest electricity prices. Interestingly, South Australia, which boasts about having more wind turbines than anywhere else in Australia, can now also boast that they not only have the highest electricity prices in Australia but have the highest electricity prices in the world.


It is important to note that, under the World Trade Organisation's definition, 'dumping' is not just selling goods below cost for an anticompetitive purpose. The WTO's definition of dumping also includes merely selling a good for a lower price in a foreign market than is charged for the same good in the exporter's domestic market. Effectively, antidumping legislation attempts to ensure that a firm makes the same level of profits in an export market as it does on a domestic market for the sale of the same good.


Under World Trade Organisation agreements, dumping is rightfully condemned if it causes or merely threatens to cause material injury to a domestic Australian industry. Essentially, when it all boils down, dumping is merely geographic price discrimination on an international basis—the selling of the same goods at different prices in different markets where the markets are able to be segmented by international borders. If we are to stand here in this parliament, with speaker after speaker condemning dumping—geographic price discrimination—across international markets because it causes or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian business, we must also condemn geographic price discrimination when it occurs internally within our borders, especially where it causes or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian business. Otherwise, if we fail to do so, we are nothing more than hypocrites. While it is important that we have effective laws to deal with geographic price discrimination when it occurs across political boundaries and internationally, I say it is equally important that we also have strong laws when it occurs internally in Australia. Yet, unlike other countries, Australia has no provisions in our competition laws to deal with anticompetitive geographic price discrimination when it occurs across different markets within Australia. In the home of free market capitalism, the USA, the Robinson-Patman Act has a specific provision against geographic price discrimination. This act provides, in part:


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce … to sell, or contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor …


These laws simply do not exist in Australia's competition laws.


We should never forget that under these laws it was the notorious Standard Oil company, that was broken up into 34 separate companies, all competing against each other, found to engage in the practice of geographic price discrimination. The strategy used by Standard Oil was to sell oil below cost in one domestic market to drive the competitor's profits down and force them to exit the market, while in another area, where other independent businesses had already been driven out of the market, they raised prices. This would be unlawful across international borders. In America where it is done internally within their borders it is also unlawful. Unfortunately, here in Australia we have nothing to prevent it under our competition laws.


Further, while these bills seek to address goods being sold into Australia at lower prices than their cost in the home market it would appear the real problem we have in Australia is not with goods being sold at lower prices but with goods being sold at higher prices—virtually a reverse dumping. It is clear now that Australian consumers pay some of the highest prices in the world for goods. Take as one example Coca-Cola, which is a syrup manufactured in the USA and shipped to licensed bottlers in over 200 countries worldwide. Yet here in Australia the everyday price of Coke in our supermarkets is 50 to 100 per cent higher. Again, it appears that Australian consumers are paying higher prices for goods exported from overseas countries, not the opposite. So if we need to have this legislation in place to deal with antidumping we also need to investigate why Australian consumers are paying higher prices, because that also places us at a competitive disadvantage.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:37):  I listened with interest to the contributions from the member for Hughes on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I welcome many of the things that the honourable member had to say, particularly his observations about geographic price discrimination within the federation. I can only hope that he will have the same enthusiasm as he did in the issue of geographic price discrimination for tradeable goods when it comes to geographic price discrimination for the sale of labour around the federation. Whilst I welcome the comments he has made on the sale of goods I know that his party, at least, has been a vociferous objector to the removal of price discrimination when it comes to the sale of labour around the federation. Indeed, the Liberal Party is a great defender of the rights of the states to have price differentials and even regional differentials for the sale of labour. Maybe that is a conversation I can pursue with the honourable member at another time when a more appropriate bill comes before this House.


During the parliamentary recess I had the benefit of visiting a number of businesses and factories within my electorate, and I had a number of discussions with one local businessman by the name of Roger Farrar, who runs an aluminium powder-coating business within my electorate, based in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, in Moss Vale. Roger Farrar operates a good private business. He is a good employer. He set the business up himself. He built the powder-coating oven himself and it is one of the most energy-efficient powder-coating ovens in New South Wales. He is a good operator, with a good business. His main markets for the extruded, powder coated aluminium are window- and door-framing businesses. They sell in turn to the commercial construction market. Often it is government organisations here in Canberra and elsewhere who are fitting out their new buildings with his products.


Roger Farrar has made the very pertinent point to me over a number of discussions that the dumping of cheap goods from Asia into the Australian market is killing jobs and killing businesses like his. He has no objection to free trade; he has no objection to fair trade. What he does have an objection to is the abuse of our open system of trading with the rest of the world, the abuse by local consumers and foreign exporters, because that is destroying certain industries within this country—particularly small businesses like his which do not have huge stocks of capital to fall back on in tough times and use to trade their way out of economic difficulties. A small job that Mr Farrar loses because of the availability of cheap, dumped aluminium goods can mean the difference between his business's survival or otherwise.


This story can be repeated many hundreds of times around the country, and it is one of the motivating factors behind us bringing this third tranche of bills before the chamber today. Our system of anti-dumping laws operates within both national and international legal systems. That is to say that our laws themselves are open to challenge by our trading partners and members of the World Trade Organisation. The decisions that we make in the administration of those laws are also open to challenge and are reviewable in appropriate forums here in Australia and internationally. So we need to ensure that whatever we do complies with our international obligations but also enables a system of review. I make no bones about the fact that, if a bias should exist within our laws, it should be a bias which enables a complainant manufacturer here in Australia to fairly access the system of review and to be able to do that in an efficient way, because a remedy delayed is a remedy denied, and a remedy denied means the difference between life and death for many of the businesses in this trade-exposed area.


I am very pleased that this third tranche of bills goes to some of those issues. It does operate within our international obligations. It makes sure that the laws that we introduce into this parliament are impervious to international challenge but provides a freeing up, if you like, or a bias, to make it easier for our domestic manufacturers to challenge what they believe to be illegal and unfair trading advantages for our international competitors.


Nothing in this legislation should be seen by any of our international trading partners as an attack on the relationship we have with them. As speaker after speaker has said in this place, we are a trading nation and as a nation we benefit without doubt from the free exchange of goods and services and capital between this country and our trading partners. It is one of the things that lie behind our almost unique prosperity in a challenged economic world.


There are three to four issues that this current legislation addresses. First is the issue which I think the member for Hughes quite succinctly described, enabling the CEO of the customs and border protection authority or the minister to compare apples with apples. It does that by enabling them to free up the relevant matters that they must take into account when assessing whether a relevant countervailing available subsidy has been received by an alleged dumper of goods into the Australian market. That will make it easier for us to assess whether a dumping incident has occurred. It is not always straightforward, as the member for Hughes has quite rightly said and as the minister said in his second reading speech on this legislation. A person in the street can look at this, apply a common-sense approach to it and say quite simply that a subsidy or an assistance has occurred which is against the spirit of the law but might not be against the letter of the law. What that part of this legislation is attempting to do is free up those relevant considerations, again consistent with our international obligations.


The second part of the legislation goes to ensuring that we provide an expanded power to both the CEO and the minister in relation to continuation inquiries. This is achieved by enhancing the powers that the CEO and the minister have to conduct a continuation inquiry to allow similar results to those currently available in review of measures. Through this amendment, the Customs and Border Protection Service will be able to recalculate the level of duties of an antidumping measure during a continuation inquiry. It will streamline the process, meaning that there will be quicker outcomes for all interested parties.


A third, and important, measure is providing greater flexibility when assessing the normal profit or normal value of an item which is said to have been dumped on our market. If we are alleging that a good has been dumped on our markets at prices below which it would be offered in its home market or elsewhere, then it is important to have a means for assessing what the normal value, and therefore the normal profit, for producing and selling that good will be. This operates on the principle that people do not produce goods out of a desire to be engaged in a philanthropic endeavour. They produce goods to make profits, to distribute those profits amongst their shareholders and to run a functioning business here or elsewhere. So it is important to be able to assess the normal value and profit of a good in order to assess whether it has been dumped into the Australian market.


Finally, the fourth measure is providing flexible remedies to ensure that the remedy fits the crime and that the remedy will properly address the issue that is at the heart of our objective behind this legislation, which is not to provide some backdoor form of protection except and unless that protection is against unfair trade practices—protection against dumping, protection against predatory regional pricing and protection against pricing which is simply designed to damage established businesses here in Australia.


I think they are all important measures. They rightfully deserve and, I understand, have gained the support of all members within this place, which is very pleasing indeed. The member for Hughes wonders out loud why three to four separate tranches of legislation have been introduced by the government when a singular compendium of bills could have done the job. There is a pretty simple answer to that—that is, we wanted to act as soon as possible on this issue. I am being pressed by businesses and employee representatives, unions within my electorate, to ensure that the parliament acts as soon as possible. When we have measures that are ready to go, it is only proper that we introduce them into the parliament as soon as possible. Even if the entire package is not ready, if we have a discrete area of laws that can be introduced into the parliament which will provide some relief, then it is only proper that we introduce that legislation as soon as is practical. And that is exactly what we have done. I will finish on this point, Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill: these are all important reforms. They build on and stand on the shoulders of the reforms that have been introduced into this parliament and passed into law. But the best laws in the world will only work if they are properly policed. I welcome the fact that the minister and the government have doubled the number of staff that are available to the Customs Service to properly police this important area of law. I would like to see us go further. I would like to see us go much further in this regard. It is not only about doubling the number of staff but ensuring that we have continuity of employment in this area so that staff can build up the requisite expertise in identifying breaches of these laws to ensure that they can be efficiently and effectively dealt with. If you have a small number of staff, or even a larger number of staff that are constantly turning over, they do not build up that expertise or the relationship or the knowledge which is necessary to effectively police these important laws.


The second point I would make in relation to this is: whatever we can do to streamline the legal processes is highly desirable. I can say with great authority that businesses do not lightly take anti-dumping action. What they are effectively doing when they are taking anti-dumping action is taking on one of their customers or prospective customers and saying that they think that those customers or prospective customers have cheated them out of a job. That has a longstanding impact on the relationship that business has with a prospective customer so they do not take that action lightly. But when they do take it, they want a quick remedy, an appropriate remedy, one that enables them to get back into that market and re-establish their relationships with their customers in an effective way and in a way that sends a pretty strong signal right around the place that you might have, as a purchaser of goods, some short-term advantage in procuring these cut-price goods and, in some instances, cut-quality goods, but in the long term you are doing the wrong thing. This is a message to businesses the country round: in the long term you are doing the wrong thing. You are removing not only the jobs and livelihoods of sustainable businesses throughout the country, but in the long term you are opening yourself up to having yourself over a barrel in the future. These businesses might be willing to dump their goods on the Australian market for whatever reason in the short term to perhaps remove domestic competition down the track, but you can be quite sure that in years to come the prices of those goods will rise and there will be no domestic competition available for those people to go to any alternative. So there is a message to business in this as well, that they have a responsibility.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:53):  I rise to voice my support for these two bills, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I particularly thank the member for Throsby for his contribution. I suppose it will be interesting to see how the member for Hughes's contribution is taken in the light of his attempt, as I understand him, to rewrite the rules of Federation, which is quite a brave thing to do. He made no mention of a referendum, but it was an interesting exploration of law and how the states interact. I think he might find some value in having a reread of his Constitution.


The bills before the chamber are part of the Gillard government's multifaceted approach to improving Australia's antidumping system. These are some of the most important improvements to Australia's antidumping regime in more than a decade. Industries, companies and workers suffer when goods from overseas are dumped into the Australian market, companies such as the ones I see when I drive through Moreton, especially in Rocklea, Archerfield, Salisbury and Acacia Ridge. It only hurts Australia in the long run if our manufacturers are forced to shut down so that competition is removed and they put their employees out of work to make way for cheaper overseas products. As the member for Throsby touched on, normally if an Australian business is closed down, and there is no competition, prices rise and all consumers suffer. So it is vital that we have a fair and effective antidumping regime. This is about protecting jobs across Australia and especially, I would say, in my own manufacturing area of Moreton. Already, manufacturers face challenges such as the high dollar—although I see it has come off the boil a little bit lately—and this incredible patchwork economy where we see those businesses in my electorate that service the mining industry booming. The only builders who are working are doing renovations for people who work in the mining industry. Others are doing it tough. So I have some great businesses that are booming and others who are really doing it hard. Obviously, if we look around the world we see slowing global demand as a result of the global financial crisis. There are a few green shoots there but also a few troubling signs as well if we look at perhaps France and Greece and some of the political decisions that might be made over there.


In Moreton, many of my manufacturers are still feeling the impacts of the 2011 floods that devastated their industrial zone in Rocklea in particular but also in Archerfield and some sections of Acacia Ridge and Yeronga. Recently I had a chamber of industry event—the Southside chamber and the Archerfield chamber combined—with the Minister for Small Business, Brendan O'Connor. Many of the business people there talked about how they were coping with recuperating from the floods. They also pointed out the people who were not there who did not recover and had closed down because of the damage from the floods. Internationally known companies like Steve Parish, the photography and printing business, are now out of business because of the effect of the floods—and the high dollar and the tourism downturn.


I am proud to be part of the Gillard government that is focused on supporting small business with investments and job creation. This antidumping legislation is only part of the story. We see that the proceeds of the mining tax have enabled the government to give small business the ability to write off any new business asset worth up to $6,500. This will be worth more than $1 billion across the sector and I am sure many of my businesses will appreciate that. They will be able to write off the first $5,000 used in the purchase of a motor vehicle thereby freeing up cash flow and giving them room to invest. That is also good news for the Moorooka Magic Mile of Motors, which is in my electorate.


We are also giving the Small Business Advisory Service program an extra $27.5 million over four years to continue supporting small businesses with vital advice and assistance. Since it was introduced, this program has provided over 354,000 separate advisory services to more than 187,000 small businesses around the country. As we know, small businesses are the employers and the engine room of the economy. More than 90 per cent of the users of this service, when surveyed, said that they would recommend the service to other small businesses.


We are establishing a key point of contact for small businesses in their liaison with government in the form of a Small Business Commissioner, as announced by Minister O'Connor. Small business owners will be able to get the information and advice they need thanks to the national information and referral service. It will also give them access to other services including help to resolve disputes. Obviously, having a minister in cabinet looking after this small business portfolio is also a good thing. We have moved to establish a $29.8 million manufacturing technology innovation centre to create networks with small businesses, industry bodies, major manufacturers and research organisations. These measures demonstrate the government's commitment to helping the many businesses currently under pressure. We will continue to work closely with these industries to help them overcome the many current challenges.


The reforms in these particular antidumping bills are based on feedback from businesses, unions and workers who interact with Australia's antidumping system. Their focus is to make sure our antidumping system is better aligned with the laws and practices of other countries, particularly those that play fairly, and to help provide certainty and confidence for businesses and local jobs.


Australia is a nation of trade. We benefit from access to overseas markets for our export goods and services—mining and agriculture are just some of them. We welcome the imports that flow through to Australian businesses. Therefore, we cannot just throw up trade barriers. That is the old way, the way of Australia before Federation, although some of the comments from the member for Hughes suggest he wants to go back to a time before 1 January 1901. This short-term populism of throwing up trade barriers would only deliver long-term pain. Every sensible economist knows that, although we do have a few people opposite who do talk about raising trade barriers quite regularly.


The Gillard government wants to uphold confidence in international trade and that means having confidence in the rules. These bills make clear that the CEO of Customs and Border Protection and the minister have the express power to take all facts available into account when determining whether a countervailable subsidy has been received or in determining the amount of a countervailing subsidy when the parties being investigated by Customs fail to provide relevant information within a reasonable period or significantly impede the investigation of an inquiry. This is a common-sense approach to the needs of business. This reform ensures that our antidumping system better reflects the World Trade Organisation agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures.


Secondly, these bills remove the need for a separate review of antidumping measures and continuation inquiries occurring in close proximity to each other. This reform will streamline the process, meaning quicker outcomes for all interested parties, particularly the workers of Australia. These bills also put into practice the recommendation of the International Trade Remedies Forum to take away the current limitation to the inclusion of profit when calculating the normal value of a good in its country of origin in certain circumstances. This allows greater flexibility for Customs to more accurately determine the normal value of goods.


Finally, these bills allow different forms of interim duty to be applied from those currently used. The types of interim dumping duty which could be used will include an ad valorem duty, a fixed amount of duty, a combination duty or a floor price mechanism.


In conclusion, better support can be given to our employers and employees with an up-to-date, rigorous and better resourced antidumping system and, at the same time, we can reiterate Australia's commitment to play according to the world trading rules. Unfortunately, not all of our competitor trading nations play fair, and that is why we have this legislation. These reforms will provide better access to the antidumping system, faster remedies and faster decisions, improved quality of decision making, greater consistency with other countries and stronger compliance with antidumping measures. For this reason I commend the minister for introducing the bills to the House.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:01):  I thank members who participated in this cognate debate on two bills—the Customs Amendment Anti-Dumping Improvements Bill (No. 2) 2012 and the Customs Tariff Anti-Dumping Amendments Bill (No. 1) 2012. As members have said, they represent the third tranche of legislation that implements the government's reforms to Australia's antidumping system that were announced by my predecessor in June of last year. These reforms are designed to provide better access to the antidumping system for the Australian industry and to ensure any applicable remedies are available as quickly as possible.


As I said when I introduced these bills, the fourth and the final tranche of legislation to implement the antidumping reforms that were announced last year will be introduced in this session of parliament. The fourth tranche will contain reforms in three broad areas. It will further amend the subsidies provisions of the Customs Act to ensure they better reflect the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures. They will establish an ant circumvention framework in Australia and they will also strengthen the provisions that deal with non-cooperation.


In putting together this legislation, we are working closely with industry through the International Trade Remedies Forum. This group met here, in Parliament House, last week. I told them amongst other things that the reform does not end with the implementation of the fourth tranche of legislation, and I will be working with them on more reforms to improve our antidumping system.


I thank opposition members for their support for these bills and I commend them to the House.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (10:02):  I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012 and the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No.2) 2012. I note that these bills represent the third tranche of changes introduced by the government to give effect to the antidumping announcements it made in the middle of last year. So, appreciating that it may drag out this debate for far longer than is necessary, I do not intend to restate many of the points and arguments that I have made on each of the recent previous occasions that antidumping has been the subject of debate in the House and the Federation Chamber.


Suffice it to say that the coalition does, again, intend to give its support to the government on each of these two bills. In fact, we have been pushing for revisions to the antidumping regime since before the 2010 election—in other words, from long before the government finally announced its own changes. We have consistently said that we support changes to the current antidumping regime wherever those changes are sensible and practical. And we are happy to accept that this tranche of legislation meets those tests.


We are glad, in particular, to support the changes that give the minister a wider ambit and range of options in applying duties to goods that are considered to have been dumped in Australia. If the removal of limitations upon the calculation of the so-called 'normal value' of the relevant good or goods works as I think the government intends, that is also a positive step. We also have no problem with altering the minister's powers in such a way as to provide more scope and flexibility for antidumping duties to be extended beyond their originally nominated termination date. That said, we need to be very careful that that particular amendment is not ultimately used as an excuse for procrastinating and delay, because it is critically important for all of us to recognise that some of the current processes are simply too slow and cumbersome and undermine the very purpose of an antidumping regime in the first place. Anything that potentially adds to that problem of the slow and cumbersome culture is obviously a step backwards. On that note and at the risk of repeating myself again from earlier debates, I also want to make the point that the coalition believes it is critical that those administering Australia's antidumping dumping system be provided with new resources, not money shifted into the branch from other areas of Customs and especially not at a time when large cuts have already been made to other areas of the agency, including some of the deepest cuts in its history in last night's budget.


The important thing that a government can do in the first instance in the area of effective antidumping policy is provide an appropriate level of administrative support because it is that step more than any other which will help to bring cases to a speedy resolution, including by increasing the opportunity to use preliminary affirmative determinations. Just in passing, I also want to quickly note that clause 9 of the explanatory memorandum for the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill says:


The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dumping Duty Act to make it easier to understand and less complex.


With that in mind, I would suggest in good faith to the government and to the relevant officers from Customs that they may want to have a look at the wording of some of the clauses and references in the explanatory memorandum—in particular, I think they may want to revisit clause 7.1 of the explanatory memorandum for the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill No. 2. I may well have overlooked or misunderstood or misinterpreted something but, on the face of it, I think some words may be missing from that sentence or, at the very least, some words may need to be changed in order to clarify the precise meaning of that clause for most people who come to read and try and understand what it means. As it stands, at least to my eyes, the first part of the sentence does not make sense and that is in addition to a small problem with pluralisation in the last part of the sentence as well.


On the first page of that same explanatory memorandum there is also a reference to where the regulation impact statement for the bill can supposedly be found. But if I am reading that wording exactly, it says that statement can be found in the explanatory memorandum for yet another bill. And then to complicate matters it gives what I think is the wrong title of that other bill. On top of that, the explanatory memorandum for the bill to which, I can only presume, it is referring does not seem to contain a regulation impact statement anyway. So when we are dealing with quite complex legislation and when one of the clearly stated aims of these changes is to make things easier to understand, confused drafting like this does not help.


Not delving all that far back into history, there were many examples of poor drafting and poorly chosen wording in explanatory memoranda. For example, the infamous recent bills in the innovation portfolio that the government used to erroneously change the R&D tax concession into a R&D tax credit. Given the horrible confusion and severely botched processes to which all of that has ultimately contributed—and I might add to which there is still no clarity in many areas—I would urge the minister and Customs in the strongest possible terms to steer violently away from that type of drafting.


I would like to restate the coalition support for each of these bills and to say that we will happily stand ready to continue to make a range of very practical, very sensible improvements to Australia's antidumping arrangements to ensure that they are accessible and that they are effective in preventing goods being dumped in Australia. That is the very least that industry expects—just a system that actually works and that is not too expensive or too complicated to access. Indeed, if we are privileged enough to be elected to government at the next election we look forward very much to the potential opportunity as a coalition to implement the antidumping policy we announced publicly in November of last year, which has received widespread industry acclaim.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:09):  I speak in support of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 and the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012. On 20 April 2012, Capral CEO Phil Jobe met with the federal Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare, and me. Bundamba aluminium business Capral is quoted in the Queensland Times calling on us to bring forward this legislation. Mr Jobe said:


Chinese manufacturers are currently exploiting and circumventing existing legislation … The anti-dumping laws haven't been updated in over a decade, so it's good to see that under this government they are being brought up to date.


A key weakness in Australia's approach to dumping is the abject failure of the previous Howard coalition government and its unmitigated disaster in the recognition of China as a market economy as a precondition of FTA negotiations. That has restricted the ability of local authorities to apply subrogated or proxy pricing in cases where normal values cannot be easily assessed. China, for example, makes it very difficult in this regard. Customs has not been adequately funded or resourced in the past and is really fighting this issue—as are stakeholders like the AWU, Capral and other organisations—with one hand tied behind its back because of the complete and utter disaster of the Howard coalition government in the recognition of China as a market economy. This has resulted in a limited and partial application of relatively small dumping duties in some cases, compared to Canada and the United States, which adopt a very different approach to that of Australia in this regard.


In this country we need a properly resourced and independent antidumping agency responding to dumping and to complaints of stakeholders like the AWU, Capral and others. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is the only agency responsible for antidumping and countervailing investigations in Australia. The Trade Measures Review Officer provides an independent administrative appeal mechanism in relation to these matters. This is probably amongst the most complicated laws you could possibly imagine. For example, Capral itself has been involved in litigation in this regard and has had to spend considerable money on the services of a very eminent QC on numerous occasions to give advice and to represent them in these types of matters.


Paul Howes, the national secretary of the AWU, has said the oversight by Customs historically in this regard has been manifestly inadequate. This is primarily the fault of a failure in the past to address and resource problems of jurisdiction within Customs. Paul Howes says there is insufficient legislative coverage and weak governance in the department. As I said, the United States and Canada have adopted a quasi-judicial approach to the application of this type of legislation in the assessment of any injury, material or otherwise, to domestic industry. We have not adopted that approach. It all comes back to the ground rules and the establishment by the Howard coalition government in relation to the FTA and recognition of China as a market based economy.


In the past, the trade measures branch of Customs has been a little akin to the Swansea licensing bureau in Yes Minister—a poor cousin to colleagues focusing on border protection activities. The consequences are dramatic. We have seen importation of Chinese aluminium extrusion products dramatically impact upon Australian industry. Capral at Bundamba in Ipswich has 300 workers but, sadly, the plant utilisation is about 60 per cent. It is the result of experiencing unfair competition from Chinese imports. There has been a loss of well over $250 million of revenue in this sector. There has been the elimination of production activities and, as I say, suboptimisation of utilisation of plant in Australian facilities—for example, at Capral at Bremer Park in Bundamba, Ipswich. The Chinese have further expanded downstream their fabrication products. Our antidumping decisions in the past have actually buoyed the Chinese exporters. As Phil Jobe said to me in numerous meetings, they cannot believe their luck. We have seen a rising Australian dollar, and this has threatened the Australian industry. The consequences are that Chinese extrusion companies are supplying primary aluminium at rates that are about 20 per cent lower than prevailing world rates. They are simply setting artificially the yuan rate, which a lot of commentators say is 20 to 30 per cent lower than it should be. In addition to that they are subsidising their industries dramatically, dumping lower-than-cost products into Australia. It is unfair for our workers, it is unfair for our employers and it is unfair for our industry. We have seen Chinese aluminium exporters aggressively capture well above 35 per cent of the Australian market in recent years. On a per capita basis, according to the evidence I have obtained, Chinese extrusion exports to Australia are more than five times higher than to any other country, and that is a direct result of failures in the past.


So we need to believe in fair trade as well as free trade. This is not about protectionism. This is about creating the opportunities for our very skilled workers and our very skilled operators, like those at Capral, to make sure we have a level playing field so that we can compete competitively. It is not about breaching our obligations under the WTO rules. It is about making sure that countries comply with those rules and that they do not unfairly dump products into our country in breach of those rules. We are rolling out some of the most effective improvements to Australia's antidumping regime in more than a decade to improve its effectiveness. At the same time, we are reaffirming our commitment to the world trading rules.


We believe in free trade in this country, but we believe that trade should be fair. We do not believe it is fair to Australian workers and Australian manufacturers that China—or any other country—exports its goods to Australia at prices below the price it charges in its home market or below cost. That materially injures Australian businesses and puts Australian jobs at risk. So we have announced a number of reforms, and the legislation before us today is the third tranche of those reforms. I am quite committed as a local federal member in my area to making sure we protect Australian jobs. By that I mean making it fair so that employees, whether  union members or non-union members, of companies like G James Glass & Aluminium, Capral and others in the Ipswich area and the western corridor are given a fair shake with respect to the operation of businesses.


I am pleased that Minister Clare has met with Phil Jobe and stakeholders to make sure we can do everything we can in the legislation to protect Australian jobs and give Australian manufacturers a fair go. Specifically, the legislation before the House today gives the CEO of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service—the minister—the power to act on the basis of all facts available in determining whether a countervailable subsidy has been received and the amount of the countervailing subsidy if adequate information has not been provided to Customs by the country of origin or the company being investigated. A lot of these companies are Chinese state-run companies. The legislation also removes the limitation to the exclusion of profit when considering a normal value of a good and removes the need for a separate review of antidumping measures and a continuation inquiry when they occur in close proximity to one another. That is one of the biggest problems in this area: there is inquiry after inquiry after inquiry—one after another—which comes at a cost to the stakeholders.


One of the great reforms we put in place earlier was to empower organisations like the AWU and Capral to have standing—locus standi, to use the legal expression—to take countervailing measures and to use litigation. In the past, they often did not have the standing they needed. So we are going to do a number of things. We are allowing the minister to use additional forms of interim dumping duty beyond the single duty that is currently provided for. The new forms of duty to be outlined in the regulations are ad valorem duty, a fixed amount of duty or a floor price mechanism. These are part of the announcements that we made in the middle of June 2010 when we described it as streamlining the antidumping system. There are a number of improvements. I think the increase of 45 per cent in Customs staff working on antidumping issues is welcome. I think that has been important in the past. They have not been funded properly with adequate resources. The 30-day time limit which we have imposed for ministerial decisions on antidumping cases is very important. In the past it took ages and ages for decisions to be made and this puts a limit so that the minister can actually make decisions in that regard.


There are a lot of things that we have done. There is stronger compliance. That is one of the things that these bills do. I met with Phil Jobe recently and we talked about the measures at the ports and the waterfront and how they get around our duties and customs. I know that Phil has met with the minister to talk about what we can do in a practical way, a non-legislative way to actually stop Chinese and other companies from getting around our border protection mechanisms.


I think it is important that industry and trade experts have the power, the resources, the expertise, the knowledge and the muscle legislatively and financially to be able to get behind and investigate these complaints. I think there needs to be greater flexibility. I practised as a lawyer for more than 20 years and I am telling you that, when I read the legislation here, I read the litigation, I read the decision making and I read the QC's advice, this is about one of the most complex areas of law. It really is extraordinarily complex. We need a more rigorous appeals process. We need to be supported by more resources and I am glad we are doing that. I am glad we are taking a more flexible approach in terms of the standing of people to do it.


We are making big efforts. There is a lot more to be done. We need fair trade as well as free trade. We need to make sure that workers in the western corridor and across my electorate of Oxley get a fair go in this regard. I am pleased that Minister Clare has come to the plant in Ipswich. He said that Capral's plight was indicative of the manufacturers across the country. In the Queensland Times of 20 April this year he said:


Australian manufacturers are under a lot of pressure. Some of that is due to the high Aussie dollar, and illegal dumping adds extra burdens and extra pressure to these businesses.


I know that, the workers know it, the government knows it and we are acting through this legislation.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:22):     I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 and the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012. Firstly, the coalition supports these bills. They are measures making sensible and practical changes which will help in a small way to address the inherent weakness of Australia's antidumping laws. Our support for this legislation exposes another myth that is perpetuated by this Labor government that we in the coalition oppose everything. Where we see legislation that has merit, such as that in these bills, we will support it but, where we see legislation proposed that has been poorly thought through or is nothing other than a political fix and is not in the best interests of Australia, the coalition will make no apology for vigorously opposing such legislation.


These bills are the third tranche of legislative changes to Australia's existing antidumping regime that Labor has made during this term of parliament and I understand that there are at least one or two additional bills to be introduced later this year. Why has it been necessary for these changes in our antidumping laws to be made in four or more separates tranches spread over 12 months? This remains a mystery that perhaps only the government can answer. It would have been far more efficient for all, especially Australian industry, if these changes to our antidumping regime had been made in one block of legislation, but unfortunately efficiency and this Labor government are not words that are often found in the same sentence. Going to the specifics of the bills, they firstly amend the dumping duty act in order to allow the minister to use different forms of interim dumping duties from those currently used. This change is consistent with the World Trade Organisation's antidumping agreement, which currently does not mandate the method for calculating the level of duty where an interim dumping duty is imposed. These amendments will enable the minister to impose either an ad valorem duty or a fixed amount of duty, a combination of the two or a floor price. Currently, the minister can only use a combination form of interim dumping duty, which is a fixed component or a variable component. This legislation simply gives the minister greater ability to impose the penalty duty required.


The bills also add new provisions to the act which will implement proposals to amend the subsidies provision in the Customs Act to better reflect the definitions and the operative provision of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. In addition these bills amend division 6A, the 'Continuation of anti-dumping measures', of the act, which will enable measures to be amended, including by altering the level of applicable duty, if the minister decides to continue them. Currently, the only means of amending measures that are to be continued is the conduct of a separate review of the measures in close proximity to the continuation inquiry. Again, this gives greater flexibility in dealing with the problem of dumping. In addition, the bills repeal section 269TAC(13) of the Customs Act to remove the current limitations on determining profit when constructing the normal value of the relevant goods alleged to have been dumped in a foreign country. This deletion implements the government's response to recommendation 3.4 of the International Trade Remedies Forum report on the effectiveness of market situation provisions in the Customs Act.


Despite these changes, there are still many practical difficulties in determining when goods are actually dumped. For example, how do you calculate the normal price of a good? In markets where prices change frequently, responding to market conditions, is it the price last week? Is it the price last month? Is it the price last year? For commodities, is it what the price will be in the future? What about exchange rates? How do you calculate how a firm has actually calculated the exchange rate? A company may use an internal hedge, especially in the current market, where we have seen such extreme volatility in exchange rates. Further, how do you calculate the price in the domestic market, where different costs may result in the same goods being sold at different prices in different regional markets within one country?


Then there are the terms of sale. Price differentials, which often may seem to be price discrimination, may be explained by a difference in trading terms. If goods are purchased under a letter of credit this obviously has a different price, as if they were sold on trading terms with 30- or 60-day open terms. There are also credit risks and statutory warranties. All these factors need to be considered in the pricing of goods. Further, how do you actually apply a quantity discount? This is another calculation that Customs must make in determining whether goods have been sold below cost. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for an Australian Customs official to determine whether a good has been exported into Australia at a price that is different or lower than the exporter's home market.


When determining whether goods are being sold at higher prices in the Australian market, we need to make an apples-with-apples comparison. But this is very difficult because often the goods and products exported to Australia are simply not the same as those being sold in the home market. So where an apples-with-apples comparison cannot be made, although Customs officials can look to the price charged by an exporter in another country and make the calculation based on a combination of the exporter's production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins, it is simply impossible for Australian Customs officials to accurately determine what the price would be if the goods were theoretically only available in a foreign market. Thus, any estimation of prices by Customs is purely an arbitrary figure. These are just a few examples of the difficulties that our Customs officials face when implementing this legislation. A recent example of the problems in determining this arose in the electorate I represent where a dumping investigation was undertaken by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service upon an application lodged by Advance Cables, Olex Cables and Prysmian Power Cables and Systems Australia on behalf of Australian industry producing like goods into an alleged dumping concerning electrical cables exported to Australia from the People's Republic of China. I am sure these firms felt that the goods were being dumped into the Australian market at below the cost of what they were made for in China. However, as a result of Customs and Border Protection's investigations, Customs determined that the electric cables exported from China to Australia had not been dumped and therefore terminated the investigation. 


We must also recognise that an effective and workable dumping regime treads a very fine line. An antidumping regime that is too harsh and is too complex can easily be used as a protectionist measure, which harms Australian industry and harms Australian jobs. For example, many Australian manufacturers rely on imported components to manufacture goods in Australia. However, an antidumping regime that is too complex can result in these manufacturers being tied up in red tape, defending dumping claims for a vital business input which they need in their processes here in Australia.


We also need to be aware that this could also work against us in Australia. When most Australian exporters go overseas and try to sell their goods on overseas markets they do their pricing with a sharper pencil and that would be against World Trade Organisation rules. However, these modest amendments to Australia's antidumping laws are not a cure against the many factors that are causing the declining competitiveness of Australian industry. The facts are that while many Australian companies may consider that goods are being dumped into Australia because they seem cheap, the reality is that as a nation we are giving away many of our competitive advantages.


In business, you can only succeed if you have a competitive advantage and you safeguard it, for your competitive advantage is your lifeblood. A company may be able to survive for a while if it has competitive parity but if this turns into a competitive disadvantage, extinction is just around the corner. In Australia, our labour costs are traditionally a competitive disadvantage. We will never be able to compete—nor do we want to—with China and India on labour costs. But one of our greatest competitive advantage is our low-cost electricity supplies. Abundant supplies of high-quality black coal, generating low-cost electricity, is one of the few competitive advantages we have here in Australia. But this government, in an act of economic treason, has surrendered this national competitive advantage. A recent report released by the Energy Users Association of Australia shows average electricity prices in Australia are now amongst the highest in the world and, once the world's biggest carbon tax takes effect, Australian industry will be paying the world's highest electricity prices. Interestingly, South Australia, which boasts about having more wind turbines than anywhere else in Australia, can now also boast that they not only have the highest electricity prices in Australia but have the highest electricity prices in the world.


It is important to note that, under the World Trade Organisation's definition, 'dumping' is not just selling goods below cost for an anticompetitive purpose. The WTO's definition of dumping also includes merely selling a good for a lower price in a foreign market than is charged for the same good in the exporter's domestic market. Effectively, antidumping legislation attempts to ensure that a firm makes the same level of profits in an export market as it does on a domestic market for the sale of the same good.


Under World Trade Organisation agreements, dumping is rightfully condemned if it causes or merely threatens to cause material injury to a domestic Australian industry. Essentially, when it all boils down, dumping is merely geographic price discrimination on an international basis—the selling of the same goods at different prices in different markets where the markets are able to be segmented by international borders. If we are to stand here in this parliament, with speaker after speaker condemning dumping—geographic price discrimination—across international markets because it causes or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian business, we must also condemn geographic price discrimination when it occurs internally within our borders, especially where it causes or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian business. Otherwise, if we fail to do so, we are nothing more than hypocrites. While it is important that we have effective laws to deal with geographic price discrimination when it occurs across political boundaries and internationally, I say it is equally important that we also have strong laws when it occurs internally in Australia. Yet, unlike other countries, Australia has no provisions in our competition laws to deal with anticompetitive geographic price discrimination when it occurs across different markets within Australia. In the home of free market capitalism, the USA, the Robinson-Patman Act has a specific provision against geographic price discrimination. This act provides, in part:


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce … to sell, or contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor …


These laws simply do not exist in Australia's competition laws.


We should never forget that under these laws it was the notorious Standard Oil company, that was broken up into 34 separate companies, all competing against each other, found to engage in the practice of geographic price discrimination. The strategy used by Standard Oil was to sell oil below cost in one domestic market to drive the competitor's profits down and force them to exit the market, while in another area, where other independent businesses had already been driven out of the market, they raised prices. This would be unlawful across international borders. In America where it is done internally within their borders it is also unlawful. Unfortunately, here in Australia we have nothing to prevent it under our competition laws.


Further, while these bills seek to address goods being sold into Australia at lower prices than their cost in the home market it would appear the real problem we have in Australia is not with goods being sold at lower prices but with goods being sold at higher prices—virtually a reverse dumping. It is clear now that Australian consumers pay some of the highest prices in the world for goods. Take as one example Coca-Cola, which is a syrup manufactured in the USA and shipped to licensed bottlers in over 200 countries worldwide. Yet here in Australia the everyday price of Coke in our supermarkets is 50 to 100 per cent higher. Again, it appears that Australian consumers are paying higher prices for goods exported from overseas countries, not the opposite. So if we need to have this legislation in place to deal with antidumping we also need to investigate why Australian consumers are paying higher prices, because that also places us at a competitive disadvantage.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:37):  I listened with interest to the contributions from the member for Hughes on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I welcome many of the things that the honourable member had to say, particularly his observations about geographic price discrimination within the federation. I can only hope that he will have the same enthusiasm as he did in the issue of geographic price discrimination for tradeable goods when it comes to geographic price discrimination for the sale of labour around the federation. Whilst I welcome the comments he has made on the sale of goods I know that his party, at least, has been a vociferous objector to the removal of price discrimination when it comes to the sale of labour around the federation. Indeed, the Liberal Party is a great defender of the rights of the states to have price differentials and even regional differentials for the sale of labour. Maybe that is a conversation I can pursue with the honourable member at another time when a more appropriate bill comes before this House.


During the parliamentary recess I had the benefit of visiting a number of businesses and factories within my electorate, and I had a number of discussions with one local businessman by the name of Roger Farrar, who runs an aluminium powder-coating business within my electorate, based in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, in Moss Vale. Roger Farrar operates a good private business. He is a good employer. He set the business up himself. He built the powder-coating oven himself and it is one of the most energy-efficient powder-coating ovens in New South Wales. He is a good operator, with a good business. His main markets for the extruded, powder coated aluminium are window- and door-framing businesses. They sell in turn to the commercial construction market. Often it is government organisations here in Canberra and elsewhere who are fitting out their new buildings with his products.


Roger Farrar has made the very pertinent point to me over a number of discussions that the dumping of cheap goods from Asia into the Australian market is killing jobs and killing businesses like his. He has no objection to free trade; he has no objection to fair trade. What he does have an objection to is the abuse of our open system of trading with the rest of the world, the abuse by local consumers and foreign exporters, because that is destroying certain industries within this country—particularly small businesses like his which do not have huge stocks of capital to fall back on in tough times and use to trade their way out of economic difficulties. A small job that Mr Farrar loses because of the availability of cheap, dumped aluminium goods can mean the difference between his business's survival or otherwise.


This story can be repeated many hundreds of times around the country, and it is one of the motivating factors behind us bringing this third tranche of bills before the chamber today. Our system of anti-dumping laws operates within both national and international legal systems. That is to say that our laws themselves are open to challenge by our trading partners and members of the World Trade Organisation. The decisions that we make in the administration of those laws are also open to challenge and are reviewable in appropriate forums here in Australia and internationally. So we need to ensure that whatever we do complies with our international obligations but also enables a system of review. I make no bones about the fact that, if a bias should exist within our laws, it should be a bias which enables a complainant manufacturer here in Australia to fairly access the system of review and to be able to do that in an efficient way, because a remedy delayed is a remedy denied, and a remedy denied means the difference between life and death for many of the businesses in this trade-exposed area.


I am very pleased that this third tranche of bills goes to some of those issues. It does operate within our international obligations. It makes sure that the laws that we introduce into this parliament are impervious to international challenge but provides a freeing up, if you like, or a bias, to make it easier for our domestic manufacturers to challenge what they believe to be illegal and unfair trading advantages for our international competitors.


Nothing in this legislation should be seen by any of our international trading partners as an attack on the relationship we have with them. As speaker after speaker has said in this place, we are a trading nation and as a nation we benefit without doubt from the free exchange of goods and services and capital between this country and our trading partners. It is one of the things that lie behind our almost unique prosperity in a challenged economic world.


There are three to four issues that this current legislation addresses. First is the issue which I think the member for Hughes quite succinctly described, enabling the CEO of the customs and border protection authority or the minister to compare apples with apples. It does that by enabling them to free up the relevant matters that they must take into account when assessing whether a relevant countervailing available subsidy has been received by an alleged dumper of goods into the Australian market. That will make it easier for us to assess whether a dumping incident has occurred. It is not always straightforward, as the member for Hughes has quite rightly said and as the minister said in his second reading speech on this legislation. A person in the street can look at this, apply a common-sense approach to it and say quite simply that a subsidy or an assistance has occurred which is against the spirit of the law but might not be against the letter of the law. What that part of this legislation is attempting to do is free up those relevant considerations, again consistent with our international obligations.


The second part of the legislation goes to ensuring that we provide an expanded power to both the CEO and the minister in relation to continuation inquiries. This is achieved by enhancing the powers that the CEO and the minister have to conduct a continuation inquiry to allow similar results to those currently available in review of measures. Through this amendment, the Customs and Border Protection Service will be able to recalculate the level of duties of an antidumping measure during a continuation inquiry. It will streamline the process, meaning that there will be quicker outcomes for all interested parties.


A third, and important, measure is providing greater flexibility when assessing the normal profit or normal value of an item which is said to have been dumped on our market. If we are alleging that a good has been dumped on our markets at prices below which it would be offered in its home market or elsewhere, then it is important to have a means for assessing what the normal value, and therefore the normal profit, for producing and selling that good will be. This operates on the principle that people do not produce goods out of a desire to be engaged in a philanthropic endeavour. They produce goods to make profits, to distribute those profits amongst their shareholders and to run a functioning business here or elsewhere. So it is important to be able to assess the normal value and profit of a good in order to assess whether it has been dumped into the Australian market.


Finally, the fourth measure is providing flexible remedies to ensure that the remedy fits the crime and that the remedy will properly address the issue that is at the heart of our objective behind this legislation, which is not to provide some backdoor form of protection except and unless that protection is against unfair trade practices—protection against dumping, protection against predatory regional pricing and protection against pricing which is simply designed to damage established businesses here in Australia.


I think they are all important measures. They rightfully deserve and, I understand, have gained the support of all members within this place, which is very pleasing indeed. The member for Hughes wonders out loud why three to four separate tranches of legislation have been introduced by the government when a singular compendium of bills could have done the job. There is a pretty simple answer to that—that is, we wanted to act as soon as possible on this issue. I am being pressed by businesses and employee representatives, unions within my electorate, to ensure that the parliament acts as soon as possible. When we have measures that are ready to go, it is only proper that we introduce them into the parliament as soon as possible. Even if the entire package is not ready, if we have a discrete area of laws that can be introduced into the parliament which will provide some relief, then it is only proper that we introduce that legislation as soon as is practical. And that is exactly what we have done. I will finish on this point, Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill: these are all important reforms. They build on and stand on the shoulders of the reforms that have been introduced into this parliament and passed into law. But the best laws in the world will only work if they are properly policed. I welcome the fact that the minister and the government have doubled the number of staff that are available to the Customs Service to properly police this important area of law. I would like to see us go further. I would like to see us go much further in this regard. It is not only about doubling the number of staff but ensuring that we have continuity of employment in this area so that staff can build up the requisite expertise in identifying breaches of these laws to ensure that they can be efficiently and effectively dealt with. If you have a small number of staff, or even a larger number of staff that are constantly turning over, they do not build up that expertise or the relationship or the knowledge which is necessary to effectively police these important laws.


The second point I would make in relation to this is: whatever we can do to streamline the legal processes is highly desirable. I can say with great authority that businesses do not lightly take anti-dumping action. What they are effectively doing when they are taking anti-dumping action is taking on one of their customers or prospective customers and saying that they think that those customers or prospective customers have cheated them out of a job. That has a longstanding impact on the relationship that business has with a prospective customer so they do not take that action lightly. But when they do take it, they want a quick remedy, an appropriate remedy, one that enables them to get back into that market and re-establish their relationships with their customers in an effective way and in a way that sends a pretty strong signal right around the place that you might have, as a purchaser of goods, some short-term advantage in procuring these cut-price goods and, in some instances, cut-quality goods, but in the long term you are doing the wrong thing. This is a message to businesses the country round: in the long term you are doing the wrong thing. You are removing not only the jobs and livelihoods of sustainable businesses throughout the country, but in the long term you are opening yourself up to having yourself over a barrel in the future. These businesses might be willing to dump their goods on the Australian market for whatever reason in the short term to perhaps remove domestic competition down the track, but you can be quite sure that in years to come the prices of those goods will rise and there will be no domestic competition available for those people to go to any alternative. So there is a message to business in this as well, that they have a responsibility.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:53):  I rise to voice my support for these two bills, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2012 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I particularly thank the member for Throsby for his contribution. I suppose it will be interesting to see how the member for Hughes's contribution is taken in the light of his attempt, as I understand him, to rewrite the rules of Federation, which is quite a brave thing to do. He made no mention of a referendum, but it was an interesting exploration of law and how the states interact. I think he might find some value in having a reread of his Constitution.


The bills before the chamber are part of the Gillard government's multifaceted approach to improving Australia's antidumping system. These are some of the most important improvements to Australia's antidumping regime in more than a decade. Industries, companies and workers suffer when goods from overseas are dumped into the Australian market, companies such as the ones I see when I drive through Moreton, especially in Rocklea, Archerfield, Salisbury and Acacia Ridge. It only hurts Australia in the long run if our manufacturers are forced to shut down so that competition is removed and they put their employees out of work to make way for cheaper overseas products. As the member for Throsby touched on, normally if an Australian business is closed down, and there is no competition, prices rise and all consumers suffer. So it is vital that we have a fair and effective antidumping regime. This is about protecting jobs across Australia and especially, I would say, in my own manufacturing area of Moreton. Already, manufacturers face challenges such as the high dollar—although I see it has come off the boil a little bit lately—and this incredible patchwork economy where we see those businesses in my electorate that service the mining industry booming. The only builders who are working are doing renovations for people who work in the mining industry. Others are doing it tough. So I have some great businesses that are booming and others who are really doing it hard. Obviously, if we look around the world we see slowing global demand as a result of the global financial crisis. There are a few green shoots there but also a few troubling signs as well if we look at perhaps France and Greece and some of the political decisions that might be made over there.


In Moreton, many of my manufacturers are still feeling the impacts of the 2011 floods that devastated their industrial zone in Rocklea in particular but also in Archerfield and some sections of Acacia Ridge and Yeronga. Recently I had a chamber of industry event—the Southside chamber and the Archerfield chamber combined—with the Minister for Small Business, Brendan O'Connor. Many of the business people there talked about how they were coping with recuperating from the floods. They also pointed out the people who were not there who did not recover and had closed down because of the damage from the floods. Internationally known companies like Steve Parish, the photography and printing business, are now out of business because of the effect of the floods—and the high dollar and the tourism downturn.


I am proud to be part of the Gillard government that is focused on supporting small business with investments and job creation. This antidumping legislation is only part of the story. We see that the proceeds of the mining tax have enabled the government to give small business the ability to write off any new business asset worth up to $6,500. This will be worth more than $1 billion across the sector and I am sure many of my businesses will appreciate that. They will be able to write off the first $5,000 used in the purchase of a motor vehicle thereby freeing up cash flow and giving them room to invest. That is also good news for the Moorooka Magic Mile of Motors, which is in my electorate.


We are also giving the Small Business Advisory Service program an extra $27.5 million over four years to continue supporting small businesses with vital advice and assistance. Since it was introduced, this program has provided over 354,000 separate advisory services to more than 187,000 small businesses around the country. As we know, small businesses are the employers and the engine room of the economy. More than 90 per cent of the users of this service, when surveyed, said that they would recommend the service to other small businesses.


We are establishing a key point of contact for small businesses in their liaison with government in the form of a Small Business Commissioner, as announced by Minister O'Connor. Small business owners will be able to get the information and advice they need thanks to the national information and referral service. It will also give them access to other services including help to resolve disputes. Obviously, having a minister in cabinet looking after this small business portfolio is also a good thing. We have moved to establish a $29.8 million manufacturing technology innovation centre to create networks with small businesses, industry bodies, major manufacturers and research organisations. These measures demonstrate the government's commitment to helping the many businesses currently under pressure. We will continue to work closely with these industries to help them overcome the many current challenges.


The reforms in these particular antidumping bills are based on feedback from businesses, unions and workers who interact with Australia's antidumping system. Their focus is to make sure our antidumping system is better aligned with the laws and practices of other countries, particularly those that play fairly, and to help provide certainty and confidence for businesses and local jobs.


Australia is a nation of trade. We benefit from access to overseas markets for our export goods and services—mining and agriculture are just some of them. We welcome the imports that flow through to Australian businesses. Therefore, we cannot just throw up trade barriers. That is the old way, the way of Australia before Federation, although some of the comments from the member for Hughes suggest he wants to go back to a time before 1 January 1901. This short-term populism of throwing up trade barriers would only deliver long-term pain. Every sensible economist knows that, although we do have a few people opposite who do talk about raising trade barriers quite regularly.


The Gillard government wants to uphold confidence in international trade and that means having confidence in the rules. These bills make clear that the CEO of Customs and Border Protection and the minister have the express power to take all facts available into account when determining whether a countervailable subsidy has been received or in determining the amount of a countervailing subsidy when the parties being investigated by Customs fail to provide relevant information within a reasonable period or significantly impede the investigation of an inquiry. This is a common-sense approach to the needs of business. This reform ensures that our antidumping system better reflects the World Trade Organisation agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures.


Secondly, these bills remove the need for a separate review of antidumping measures and continuation inquiries occurring in close proximity to each other. This reform will streamline the process, meaning quicker outcomes for all interested parties, particularly the workers of Australia. These bills also put into practice the recommendation of the International Trade Remedies Forum to take away the current limitation to the inclusion of profit when calculating the normal value of a good in its country of origin in certain circumstances. This allows greater flexibility for Customs to more accurately determine the normal value of goods.


Finally, these bills allow different forms of interim duty to be applied from those currently used. The types of interim dumping duty which could be used will include an ad valorem duty, a fixed amount of duty, a combination duty or a floor price mechanism.


In conclusion, better support can be given to our employers and employees with an up-to-date, rigorous and better resourced antidumping system and, at the same time, we can reiterate Australia's commitment to play according to the world trading rules. Unfortunately, not all of our competitor trading nations play fair, and that is why we have this legislation. These reforms will provide better access to the antidumping system, faster remedies and faster decisions, improved quality of decision making, greater consistency with other countries and stronger compliance with antidumping measures. For this reason I commend the minister for introducing the bills to the House.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:01):  I thank members who participated in this cognate debate on two bills—the Customs Amendment Anti-Dumping Improvements Bill (No. 2) 2012 and the Customs Tariff Anti-Dumping Amendments Bill (No. 1) 2012. As members have said, they represent the third tranche of legislation that implements the government's reforms to Australia's antidumping system that were announced by my predecessor in June of last year. These reforms are designed to provide better access to the antidumping system for the Australian industry and to ensure any applicable remedies are available as quickly as possible.


As I said when I introduced these bills, the fourth and the final tranche of legislation to implement the antidumping reforms that were announced last year will be introduced in this session of parliament. The fourth tranche will contain reforms in three broad areas. It will further amend the subsidies provisions of the Customs Act to ensure they better reflect the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures. They will establish an ant circumvention framework in Australia and they will also strengthen the provisions that deal with non-cooperation.


In putting together this legislation, we are working closely with industry through the International Trade Remedies Forum. This group met here, in Parliament House, last week. I told them amongst other things that the reform does not end with the implementation of the fourth tranche of legislation, and I will be working with them on more reforms to improve our antidumping system.


I thank opposition members for their support for these bills and I commend them to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (11:16):  I very much wanted to be associated with this condolence motion. Lionel Bowen retired from this parliament 22 years ago, and I dare say I am one of the few members of the House of Representatives who had the great privilege of serving with him. In a sense, I always felt a very special personal linkage with him, notwithstanding the fact that we served on different sides of the House.


Lionel Bowen was born in Sydney on 28 December 1922. He left school at 14 but completed his studies at night school and later obtained a law degree from my old alma mater, the University of Sydney. In those difficult times, many people achieved a great deal, despite the considerable disadvantage that they suffered in early life. My own father's career was similar in the sense that he had to earn scholarships and places in school and university in order to succeed. Lionel Bowen practised as a solicitor, as I did, working primarily in the area of local government. His firm, Bowen & Packham, was across the road from my firm, Berne Murray & Tout. There was a time when lawyers had to frequent each other's offices, usually to get moratorium certificates signed or certificates in relation to leases that a client of yours had received independent advice on, and frequently I attended Lionel's office—long before he became a member of parliament. That firm continued as Bowen & Gerathy at a later point in time.


From 1948 to 1962, Lionel Bowen was an alderman of Randwick Municipal Council. He was mayor between 1950 and 1951, and 1955 and 1956. I saw some synergies with the Ruddock family. My father entered local government—the Shire of Hornsby—in 1952, I think, and was there until he was elected to parliament in 1964. He also served a single term as mayor and another term as acting mayor. Lionel Bowen was elected to the Parliament of New South Wales and served there as the member for Randwick. Over that time, 1962 to 1969, he served with my late father. I made an error earlier: my father served from 1962 in the state parliament, until 1976. Lionel was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Kingsford-Smith in 1969 serving until his retirement shortly before the 1990 election. My father aspired to serve in the federal parliament. That was never to be. My wife used to say that I walked in his shoes in a sense with a much easier path albeit almost 39 years ago.


I served with Lionel Bowen from 1973 until 1990 as a member of the House of Representatives and I had the opportunity of seeing him serve as Postmaster-General from 1972 to 1974, Special Minister of State from 1973 to 1975, minister assisting the Prime Minister from 1973 to 1974, minister assisting the Prime Minister in matters relating to the Public Service from 1974 to 1975, and Minister for Manufacturing Industry between June 1975 and November 1975. That was while Labor was in government, and then it moved into opposition and in December 1977 he was elected the Labor Party's deputy leader. He was in that post until April 1990. He was Deputy Prime Minister from March 1983 to April 1990. He served as Minister for Trade, as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Commonwealth-State Relations, as Vice-President of the Executive Council and as Attorney-General from 1984 to 1990. In 1989 he passed Ben Chifley's record as the longest serving minister in governments of the Australian Labor Party.


I had the great privilege in 1977 to be elected chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, to review the act that had been introduced by Lionel Murphy. It was a very significant committee but what was most significant for me was that Lionel Bowen was the Labor Party's deputy leader and Lionel Bowen, as its shadow Attorney-General, saw fit to serve on that committee of the parliament. There is often some sensitivity by people who have served at a senior level and go back and serve on parliamentary committees. I think Lionel Bowen is an example of one gentleman who believed it was important to contribute to the parliament and the debates and the discussions in which we were involved and to contribute at the very highest level, whatever one's position in the parliament. I look back at some of the very kind remarks he made about me as chairman of that committee but I felt greatly privileged to be able to have him serving beside me in reviewing legislation that had been extraordinarily controversial in its time and in putting in place positive recommendations that survive even to today.


I think it is a great tribute, and I do not think this has been referred to before, that one of our significant courts buildings in Sydney is named after Lionel Bowen. I think he deserved it. I think that was right and proper. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1991. He served Australia for 42 years across three levels of government. I think somebody who was able to serve in the very diverse ways he did and who could see the very significant achievements that he had been able to make in government progressed deserves commendation for the great contribution he made to Australia. To his wife, Claire, to whom I have written and whom I saw on the occasion of the state funeral, I extend the condolences of the Ruddock family and I do so to all of the Bowen family.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:24):  I want to follow on from the remarks made by the member for Berowra and note the fact that across the parliament there has been unanimous respect for and acknowledgement of the contribution that was made by Lionel Bowen. As the member for Kingsford Smith, now serving in a seat that Lionel Bowen won after his time in both local and state politics, it is a very great privilege for me to be standing here with Lionel Bowen as one of my predecessors. It is also a great privilege for me to be able to reflect on the contribution that he made not only in the parliament but also in the electorate more broadly.


Lionel Bowen's career was a highly distinguished one, which is even the more remarkable given the humble conditions and circumstances under which he grew up. It is appropriate for me to note again just some of those achievements of high office. He was the Deputy Prime Minister from 1983 to 1990; the Attorney-General for a significant period of time; the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Commonwealth-State Relations; the Minister for Trade; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; the Special Minister of State; the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister; the Postmaster-General—his first appointment under the Whitlam government; the state member for Randwick for a number of years; the first Labor Alderman of the Randwick City Council; and, of course, a founding director of the Randwick Labor Club. His achievements are noted. They are recognised as being the mark of someone who had tremendous capacity and who gave himself to the service both of the Labor Party and of the country.


I want to reflect on some of the remarks that have been made by those people who worked with Lionel Bowen in his time. Bob Hawke, the former Prime Minister, said:


From his own intrinsic talents and characteristics emerged this remarkable man who now together we remember and we honour.


Former Prime Minister Paul Keating said:


Australia has been fortunate in having the conscientious service of someone so committed to the values of justice and equity and the public good in general.


Humility was written all over his calling card.


I noted the remarks of Johno Johnson, who has been a long-time loyal servant of the Labor Party, when he remarked of Lionel Bowen, whom he knew very well:


Office meant nothing to him unless he could serve people.


It is also the case that the qualities that Lionel Bowen displayed, qualities both of humility and of capacity, are rare. They are rare in this place, to be frank, and they are also rare in life in general. Here was somebody who was sure of himself but had a down-to-earth nature that not only was noted by his colleagues and his contemporaries but was something which is always reflected upon by anybody you meet, as I do as the current local member for Kingsford Smith, by anybody who met him on any occasion. He was someone whom they could relate to, who they felt connected with them and listened to them, who was able to empathise with them—and I will go on to say why I think that was the case—but who also had something to offer them by way of observation, assistance, if they were a constituent seeking help, and analysis by someone who was extremely capable and had considerable intellectual abilities.


I think one of the keys to understanding someone's career and character is to look to their early life. In the case of Lionel Bowen there is much that instructs us there. He certainly was born in what we would now describe as fairly challenging circumstances. He was an only child and, ultimately, the only child of a single mum. He left school at 14 to support the family and then worked overtime to become a solicitor and ultimately a politician, serving his local community for generations and generations. He was diagnosed with rheumatic fever at an early age, and it is probably fair to say that this would have had some influence on him as a young man. He trained as an artillery signalman but was taken out of active service because of the condition, and so ended up in the war working as an orderly at Sydney Hospital unloading the wounded from the ships. Here again is an experience that I know, from what his family have communicated, had some impact on him. He was a child of the Depression but also, in his adolescence, late teens and early 20s, a child of the World War II generation, and that certainly left its mark upon him.


The Bowen family are very well known in the electorate of Kingsford Smith. To Lionel's wife, Claire, and to their children and grandchildren, I again extend my warmest sympathies at the loss of Lionel. There is no doubt that they were aware of the tremendous capacity and character that Lionel had, but I think it would have come home to them even more vividly when we all gathered, along with former prime ministers, at St Mary's Cathedral for the state funeral. Recognition of the contribution he made was appropriately given. Lionel's son Tony remarked to me that he died in his favourite season, Easter, a time which reflected his religious adherence and when his great pursuit, the track, is also starting to gear up into full swing at the racing carnival.


After growing up in the circumstances in which he did, he ended up as a married man living in his three-bedroomed house in Kensington with some 10 people for a number of years, until the second-storey extension was added in 1974. In his time he played the role in the Labor Party of a constant, loyal, diligent and active participant in the political affairs of the party, and subsequently of the nation, at the highest level.


There are some aspects of Bowen's career that have not been remarked on up until now, and I would like to pay a brief tribute to them. One is the fact that he was very active in his early period in the parliament on issues concerning Cambodia, and subsequently the progress of the Cambodian nation following the terrible reign of the Khmer Rouge. Members opposite may recall some of that involvement. He was probably the first federal politician to suggest that a peacekeeping force be sent to Cambodia, something which at the time people looked at somewhat askance. Yet it is an example of how he identified with the people in that country, who had suffered such a great deal.


Lionel Bowen was someone who was both humble and confident. He was a very acute assessor of people's characters and as a deputy to Prime Minister Hawke, and in work with other prime ministers, he served in a way that gave them the opportunity to lead to the fullest of their abilities. That was truly a mark of his service here in the parliament and to the Labor Party.


I want to make one personal reflection, as I think it is appropriate to do so in this condolence motion. My first interaction with Lionel Bowen was when he was Attorney-General and approached me to sit on the 1998 Constitutional Convention. I thought that did some very good work, but ultimately we were not able to settle those issues, which were and remain very important to Australians. It was always a mystery to me as to why Lionel Bowen had approached me, and I subsequently found out that a couple of his sons—particularly Peter, but also Tony and, I think, the other kids—had listened to a lot of Midnight Oil in his house at Kensington over the years, and eventually it seemed as though Lionel's ears were pricked up as well.


I have to say that when I came into the party and the parliament I was welcomed both by the Bowen family and by Lionel. He was there to provide sage advice—and it certainly was sage advice—and I was extremely appreciative of the relationship that I was able to develop with him, even though I did not know him as well as many others. He made an extraordinary contribution to his community, to the Labor Party and to the Labor governments that he served, and he made an extraordinary contribution to the nation. He will be very well remembered.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (11:36):  It is an honour to join in the condolence motion for the late Hon. Lionel Bowen. I first met Lionel Bowen in 1995. He at that point was, of course, a former Deputy Prime Minister and a lion of the labour movement. I was a very junior ALP branch member of, at that point, seven years standing in the ALP—a young man who had yet to be elected to his local council and without a profile in the party. In what would become over the years a very typical mistake, I found myself sitting next to Lionel Bowen at a dinner to celebrate the election of the Carr Labor government. This mistake was due to an official assuming that I was his son and therefore seating me on the official table next to the former Deputy Prime Minister. I soon worked out that this mistake had occurred and suggested that I might take my leave and go and find a more appropriate seat at the very large function—a seat more befitting a very junior Labor Party branch member than the official table with the newly elected Premier and the former Deputy Prime Minister. Of course, Lionel would not hear a word of that. He insisted that I remain in my seat and spent considerable time chatting to me about matters of common interest. Lionel was always quick to encourage and loath to criticise. He enjoyed taking the time to chat. He shared his views with humility. He was keenly interested in the rejuvenation of the Labor Party after his retirement, and he had not an arrogant bone in his body.


The mistake that that official made on that evening was the beginning of my relationship with Lionel Bowen. Of course, a few years after that the ravages of the pernicious disease of Alzheimer's began slowly to take their toll on Lionel. But it has been very common at functions or meetings since I have entered parliament for people to come up to me and tell me that they went to school with my father or used to work for my father. I was initially quite surprised that so many people worked for the NRMA, until I realised after a number of these incidents that they were confused. But I would find that as a result of regularly being assumed to be related to Lionel Bowen I learnt a lot more about him even than in my own interactions with him. I would obviously tell disappointed interlocutors that in fact I was not Lionel Bowen's son, but they would invariably go on to tell me a story about Lionel, and invariably those stories would reflect on his humility, his integrity and his decency.


Lionel Bowen had, I think, the Chifley-like qualities of a great Labor politician: humility combined with passion and determination. His humility sometimes led him to be underestimated, but the record shows how wrong those who underestimated him were. He is one of the handful of people in Australian history to have served in all three levels of government: local, state and federal. He was a mayor at 28, going on at one point to be the longest serving Labor minister in Australia's history, a record subsequently surpassed only by Paul Keating, Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans. He was Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party for more than half his time in the federal parliament, and he came very close to becoming our leader in 1977, losing that ballot by six votes in the caucus. It is an interesting question of historical record as to what might have happened if he had in fact won that ballot. I suspect that his down-to-earth nature and his passion would have made him a very successful Labor leader, and the political history of Australia over the last 30 years may well have taken a very different turn.


His length of service and his high office does not tell the full story of his achievements and his passion. He was not a high-profile politician, despite his very high office. His role was often as a counsel and a sage behind the scenes. He was involved in the very difficult and emotional meeting in which Bill Hayden handed the leadership over to Bob Hawke. He took the view that it was the right thing for the Labor Party for him to waive his right under Labor Party conventions to name his portfolio, ceding the foreign affairs portfolio in opposition—very clearly, at that point, soon to be the government—to Bill Hayden.


He was driven to pursue social justice at least in part because of his childhood poverty. It has often been mentioned in his obituaries that his father was an alcoholic who abandoned the family when Lionel was at a young age. His mother also had to care for her brother, who had an acquired brain injury. Her father had passed away a few years before in the great Spanish influenza pandemic—which also killed my great grandmother. The family was borne into great poverty in that period. This, I think, informed his view that—as one of his sons eloquently said in a eulogy at the local church—'nobody should be wiped out simply due to his or her frailty'. That was a view Lionel Bowen kept throughout his political life and also his personal life. As I said, it has been commonly mentioned that his father abandoned the family. What is less mentioned is that at the place where his father is buried a gravestone marking the burial place reads: 'From your loving son Lionel'. His forgiveness of his father says more about him than any words we can muster here in this House.


Lionel Bowen is lost to us, but his records, his achievements and his great, great qualities live on as an inspiration. I extend my condolences to the family, as I have personally, and I record my personal admiration and the inspiration Lionel Bowen provided to many of my generation—even those of us who do not share his surname!—in this House.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr McCLELLAND
 (Barton) (11:43):  Lionel Bowen was one of the great parliamentarians, not only of the last century but since Federation. He was a man of enormous ability but always remained unpretentious and a genuine true believer in the principles of the Labor movement, and it is most fitting that the Australian parliament is honouring his memory in this motion. I am certainly proud of the fact that the Bowens—Lionel and his wife, Claire—and my parents, Doug and Lorna, were very good friends. In fact, Lionel and my father, Doug, virtually shared their political careers in the Labor Party together. When they joined the party Ben Chifley was its leader. Lionel entered the New South Wales parliament in 1962, and that was the year my father was elected to the Senate. Lionel came to Canberra in 1969. Just three years later—in December 1972, as we can remember, with the election of the Whitlam government—both of them became ministers. Lionel was the Postmaster-General and my father was Minister for the Media. In fact, in those early stages of the Whitlam ministry, they shared the one secretary of their respective departments, and Lionel and Doug sat next to each other in that first cabinet and remained good mates throughout.


In mid-1975, my father followed Lionel as Special Minister of State and he recalls Lionel as being someone who was always on top of his brief, as a good lawyer, not only in terms of detail but also in terms of tactics. For example, not long after Malcolm Fraser deposed Bill Snedden as Leader of the Opposition, Lionel warned those more complacent members of the Senate to watch it, because he would not be in the least surprised if Mr Fraser moved to block supply later in that year, and political history tells us that that is in fact what happened, leading to the dismissal of the Whitlam government on 11 November 1975. Lionel was one of the first members of the government who predicted that course of action.


Labor of course then went into opposition, but eight years later, in 1983, Bob Hawke won government. Lionel became his Deputy Prime Minister, and was probably one of the most loyal deputy prime ministers, in terms of riding shotgun for the Prime Minister, that Australia has ever seen. He also held the office of Attorney-General. At that time, my father was President of the Senate. They had a number of close mates, including Bob Hawke, Mick Young, Clyde Holding, John Brown and Ben Humphreys. My father tells me that they frequently dined together and that, if the walls of the Old Parliament House could speak, they would indeed tell quite a few stories, all of those men being larrikins in their own right. They kept in touch after parliament but, just as an indication of the personalities, my father recalls going around to see Prime Minister Hawke. In the small corridors of Old Parliament House, there outside the Prime Minister's office were Prime Minister Hawke, Minister Howe, John Brown, Mick Young and Lionel, all in deep concentrated thought and serious conversation. My father thought we were about to confront a national crisis, given the intensity of this conversation. But as he got closer to them he heard them say, 'Yeah, but who d'you think's going to win in the sixth?'


In the late 1980s, my father went to London as high commissioner and he speaks of the tremendous standing of Lionel on both sides of the British parliament. My father related to me one visit which I am sure Lionel's wife, Claire, will remember, where Claire and Lionel accompanied my father and mother to the town of Lyndhurst in Hampshire, where Lionel unveiled a wall mural depicting the early life of Arthur Phillip, who became Australia's first governor. Arthur Phillip had undertaken farming for a brief period when he retired as a captain of the Navy before being reappointed to captain the First Fleet to Australia.


From my point of view, I was greatly honoured to serve in the office of Attorney-General, an office that Lionel held with distinction. Indeed, in many ways I tried to emulate Lionel's principled and balanced style, and I can assure Lionel's family that respect for his legacy endures to this day in the Attorney-General's Department. But for time constraints, one could list Lionel's remarkable achievements and recall many humorous anecdotes about him. Lionel Bowen was indeed unique, modest, self-effacing and a devoted family man, a loyal and reliable friend, a proud representative of his country and a truly magnificent Australian. I also join my colleagues in paying my respects and indeed those of my family to the memory of such a great and distinguished man. Claire and her family must be very proud of him indeed.


Debate adjourned.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:12):  Firstly, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for introducing this very serious and important motion. I strongly support the motion that this House affirms its support for the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world, and its support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I also take this opportunity to make a few remarks about Australia's relationship with nonproliferation efforts and, in the context of this motion, to discuss the important work that the International Committee of the Red Cross has been doing.


Australia has long been a very tireless worker on the issue of nonproliferation. The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, developed the nonproliferation treaty as the world recognised that, following what had occurred in World War II and with the increasingly tense situation developing between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a strong collaborative effort was required to protect the future of our world. As the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the NPT, came into force in 1970, Australia set about ratifying the treaty, and we did so in 1973. I note the very significant work that the IAEA does in the areas of not only nonproliferation but also disarmament in general and the manageable use of nuclear research for peaceful purposes.


While Australia certainly could not be considered to be a nuclear power we do utilise nuclear technology for research purposes—for example, at the Lucas Heights research reactor in New South Wales. Domestically, the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office enforces our standards and facilitates IAEA activities in this country. I commend that office for carrying out the more practical concerns of today's motion. In our own country the safe utilisation of this technology is, of course, a serious issue that we must always consider for the future safety of all Australians.


The sentiment among the vast majority of nations is against the threat or use of nuclear weaponry. This has been increasing for some time. The International Court of Justice handed down the decision in 1994:


There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.


Furthermore, in 2007 the Five-Point Plan on Nuclear Disarmament was submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, which recognises the abhorrence of nuclear war. This global interest in nuclear disarmament continues to grow, with the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom reaffirming their responsibility to take concrete and credible steps towards irreversible disarmament at a United Nations conference on nuclear weapons in May 2010. More recently, as this motion notes, the United States and Russia ratified the measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms, New START, in February 2011. We have also seen further important treaties and bilateral cooperation between Australia and Japan on this issue. Again, as this motion states, I strongly support the consensus views expressed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in Report 106: Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.


Unfortunately, in 2012, there are ongoing significant political and military issues occurring from South America to South-East Asia. There is also significant political unrest in the Middle East, with some countries there having obtained or seeking to obtain a nuclear arsenal. Whilst Australia has maintained on an international diplomatic level our commitment to a nuclear-free Iran, the IAEA is in fact unable to verify whether their nuclear arrangements are indeed peaceful. In many ways, the uncertainty creates more alarm in the region and around the world. I strongly support the call in this motion for continuing efforts to establish a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction.


Significantly, in our area there are still ongoing attempts at nuclear testing in North Korea. As recently as late April there were more reports of North Korea's plan to conduct a nuclear bomb test. Our world does not want to contemplate nuclear war but, with the problems in Iran, North Korea and other parts of the world, we must have faith that diplomacy can overcome a nuclear threat, as it did during the Cuban missile crisis and as it has attempted to do in North Korea. That is why it must be the resolve of all countries that this issue does not go away, so it is up to world leaders such as Australia to put significant resources into encouraging other countries to join the cause. That is why I support the call for states outside the NPT to join the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states.


I would like to take the opportunity in this chamber to record the very significant contribution from the International Committee of the Red Cross in the area of nonproliferation and to acknowledge their continuing work. On Monday, 7 May, I was fortunate to gather with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to celebrate the launch of the Parliamentary Friends of the Red Cross. As a co-convenor of this group, along with my colleagues Mr Bruce Scott, Mr Graham Perrett and Senator Christine Milne, I look forward to working with the Red Cross to see how best this parliament can assist them in the very important work they do. On that day, we principally shared our appreciation for their assistance during the Queensland floods and other work they do around Australia.


The Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement have been at the heart of the issue of nuclear weapons and nonproliferation from the outset of this debate. By continuing to raise their grave concerns and through their role in developing international humanitarian law, the movement contributed to the creation of additional protocols to the Geneva conventions in 1977. These protocols strengthened the distinction between civilians and combatants and reaffirmed the commitment to no unnecessary harm being caused to civilians during times of war. Of course, the destruction caused by nuclear weapons would fail to meet the no unnecessary harm principle. In 2011, the Australian Red Cross launched its official campaign to raise awareness of the horrific humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. It is a campaign of great consequence, and we all know the absolute destruction these weapons can cause. This is positive progress and the International Committee of the Red Cross and other bodies associated with disarmament should be commended for their work in both helping to ensure increasing interest and capitalising on commitments from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.


Our leaders must focus on the devastating humanitarian cost, as the Red Cross does. Remember that a nuclear weapon does not discriminate. Its path of destruction includes civilians, hospitals, doctors, land for farming, food and water. A nuclear bomb not only wipes out a city; it also wipes out so much more. As the vice-president of the ICRC, Christine Beerli, noted:


… the debate about nuclear weapons must be conducted not only on the basis of military doctrines and power politics but also on the basis of public health and human security.


And further:


Nuclear weapons are unique in their destructive power, in the unspeakable human suffering they cause, in the impossibility of controlling their effects in space and time … and indeed to the survival of humanity. 


Those are compelling words. We cannot have this debate without considering the humanitarian cost, but neither can we ignore the world in which we live—the instability, the uncertainty and the threats which lie within our anarchistic international system.


Should a nuclear weapon fall into the hands of a terrorist organisation willing to use it, the consequences would be devastating. This is why I support the Prime Minister's motion and why I commend the International Committee of the Red Cross for its strong contribution to this issue.


In conclusion, one of the most iconic images throughout history is, undoubtedly, the ruined Hiroshima peace stone, standing alone amid the destruction of the city. I hope to see nuclear weapons become a part of our past, not our future and, for that reason, I strongly support this motion.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (18:21): I rise to speak on the motion, moved by the Prime Minister on 21 March this year, on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. I speak as a member of a government that has sought to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and that has played a very constructive role in global disarmament discussions, negotiations and engagement. I also speak as a long-time antinuclear activist and someone convinced that the risks posed by nuclear weapons and materials are grave. I have long argued that our efforts in Australia to advance the cause of genuine binding nuclear disarmament need to be as strong as possible.


It is in our national and global interests that the world rid itself of weapons that are so powerful so that they can never be used. Indeed, I do not think that deterrence, as we once knew it, any longer holds the weight or the coherence that it may once have done. We are a respected middle-size power and our contribution can be substantial and positive to disarmament efforts, especially at this point in the history of global nuclear disarmament politics. The fact is that, four decades after the nuclear non-proliferation treaty came into being, we are at a logjam. As former UN Secretary-General, Koffi Annan, phrased it, 'When it comes to effective nuclear disarmament, the world is at a stage of mutually assured paralysis.' Iran's nuclear ambitions are self-evident, as is the dangerous, quixotic behaviour of North Korea and the threat of the terrible use of a nuclear device by terrorism, given that increased access to and knowledge of nuclear materials is growing. At the same time, within the nuclear non-proliferation treaty regime, parties have not been able to find common ground on agreeing to advance concrete, timely actions for disarmament. 


Over a decade ago a review of the non-proliferation treaty saw parties agree to 'reduce nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons'. Since then, virtually nothing has happened. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, long seen as a reasonable bulwark to increased nuclear proliferation, still does not include a number of recalcitrant states—North Korea, Pakistan and India, the latter being a country we are now contemplating selling uranium to.


The motion we are debating calls for ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty by all states yet to do so and follows the 8 December 2010 UN General Assembly resolution, sponsored by all five nuclear weapon states, urging all states to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty. And with 179 in favour and only one against, I think the message is clear.


US President, Barack Obama, has indicated that the US will consider immediate and aggressive ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty. The International Court of Justice has unanimously held that states have an obligation to pursue and bring to conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects. Following vigorous debate, the 2011 ALP national conference decided to create a special exception of allowing export of uranium to India. I acknowledge and respect that that conference has made that decision, but I observe that this does not mean that such export ought to happen immediately. I think we have a window of opportunity to further press for ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by all those countries that have not ratified it, as expressed in clause 3(C) of the motion under debate, and consider that any sale to India could be deferred in the meantime.


I note that although nuclear cooperation agreements have been reached between the US and India, India, whilst maintaining its current moratorium on nuclear testing, in subsequent statements has reserved its right to test a nuclear weapon if it so chooses. This issue is challenging due to the actions of Pakistan and its unwillingness to accede to nuclear disarmament agreements. Of course, Pakistan is a very near neighbour to India. But it remains the case that as a valued neighbour, an increasingly important economic power and a democratic nation, India's ongoing rejection of this treaty is highly regrettable. Australia is well placed to be a strong supporter and an important actor in the realm of nuclear disarmament politics. I think the motion before us means that there should be reconsideration of ratification of the treaty by India now.


There has been recent debate around expanded approaches to nuclear disarmament. I will come to one of those shortly, but the fact remains that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, along with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, still represents the foundation of the global nuclear disarmament framework. Greater participation enhances the cause of disarmament. The motion before us also affirms support for a world free of nuclear weapons and recognises that we are closer to the unthinkable, the possible use of even a crude nuclear device that would cause untold misery and destruction.


In order for us to play a full and proper role in multilateral disarmament, not only should we continue with the endeavours underway—which now include additional actions identified by the Prime Minister at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul—but, as the motion notes, Australia should participate fully in a more comprehensive global approach to disarmament. The motion calls for an exploration of a legal framework for the abolition of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of a nuclear weapons convention. This would be a positive step, but I believe we should now move more quickly to lead the efforts to secure a new nuclear weapons convention.


This would recognise that every country must disarm and that a decisive circuit-breaker is needed to get the world onto a structured path to genuine total disarmament. A draft model for a nuclear weapons convention has been in place for some time. Indeed, it draws specifically from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and there is international and civil society support that has continued to grow from the mid-90s to the present. On moving to break the logjam, the treaty to ban landmines provides a clear example of what is possible in a relatively short period of time. Likewise, the chemical weapons treaty is an example of what is achievable when major powers buy in and take action.


To repeat, Australia is well placed to be a strong supporter of a nuclear weapons convention following speedy consideration of legal issues and a convention framework. We are parties with Japan and the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. We have contributed substantially through the first Canberra commission and subsequent engagements in policy. We are a member of the seven-nation initiative. We contribute our fair share to the International Atomic Energy Agency and there are a host of other important constructive actions that we are involved in. We are also a major exporter of uranium, the fuel of nuclear weapons.


While assorted multilateral negotiations move at a snail's pace, the need to completely eliminate nuclear weapons in a highly globalised world where terrorism opportunities are considerable has never been greater. The five-step approach laid out in the draft nuclear weapons convention would see the prohibition of developing, testing, stockpiling, threats to use nuclear weapons as well as the prohibition of the production of weapons-usable fissile material. Importantly, it applies to all states without exception. By the way, India has indicated a willingness to join. As the momentum builds internationally, it is very important that Australia not only gets on board but leads the way; continues to press for the remaining nations, who have not yet done so, to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; and commits to a nuclear weapons convention as an essential major step to abolishing nuclear weapons. The safety of our world and our future demands nothing less.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (18:30):  The background to this motion is that it was one of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which I chair, which investigated the issues concerning nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament in 2009 and reported on them in the treaties committee report, Report 106: Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for introducing and supporting this very important and very unusual bipartisan motion. 


I want to again thank my fellow committee members—one of whom is sitting beside me, the member for Shortland—not just for producing a 230-plus-page report, but also for their attitude of cooperation and determination to say something significant and worth while, which they demonstrated in the way they approached this task. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has members from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Nationals and the Greens, with very different perspectives on a range of nuclear and foreign policy questions, but each member of the committee wanted to play their part in protecting people from the nuclear threat and to ensure that Australia's voice is heard loud and clear around the world on these matters. So we worked through the issues until we achieved an agreed outcome, a platform for progress.


What is that platform? The committee wants to see the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in place. This treaty is incredibly important in halting the momentum for nuclear proliferation and ultimately ring-barking the nuclear weapons tree. We want all the uranium-exporting countries to require that the countries whom they export uranium to have an additional protocol to guarantee international atomic inspector access. We believe that the International Atomic Energy Agency's budget needs to be increased so that it can do its work properly and thoroughly. The committee examined proposals for a nuclear weapons convention and for a multilateral fuel bank. In each case more work needs to be done and we recommended the allocation of research and consultation resources towards the development of a nuclear weapons convention with a clear legal framework and enforceable verification.


It is important to understand that the friction between the nuclear haves and have-nots is alive and well. Throughout the history of the non-proliferation treaty, the nuclear haves have stressed nonproliferation—that is to say, making sure no other country gets nuclear weapons—while the nuclear have-nots have stressed disarmament—that is, obliging the nuclear-armed countries to get rid of their bombs. The countries of the non-aligned movement, essentially have-nots, are frustrated by the lack of progress on disarmament. Too often this difference of approach has led to international stalemate. Clearly, we need to have action on both fronts—nonproliferation and disarmament.


I am aware of resistance from within the non-aligned movement and the developing countries to the idea of the International Atomic Energy Agency carrying out the nuclear security function. But my view is that every country has a stake in stopping other countries from developing nuclear weapons. It is not enough to say that because we do not have nuclear weapons we are doing everything we can. The non-nuclear-weapon states could campaign for universal adherence to the additional protocol and should campaign for states to give up their aspirations for an indigenous enrichment capacity in favour of a multilateral fuel bank.


The road to nuclear hell is paved with defensive intentions. The United States developed nuclear weapons after it was attacked during the Second World War by Japan, and both the United States and Russia developed nuclear weapons as a defensive strategy during the Cold War. Because they have nuclear weapons, China, which at various times during the nuclear age has had poor relations with both America and Russia, developed nuclear weapons as well. Because China had nuclear weapons, India felt threatened and developed nuclear weapons. Because India had nuclear weapons, Pakistan felt threatened and developed nuclear weapons. The strength of religious fundamentalist groups in Pakistan has created an ever-present and alarming risk that nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of non-state actors, terrorists groups who have no respect for human life and who will take no notice of doctrines of deterrence and mutually-assured destruction in the way that governments might not unreasonably be expected to. We must do all that we can to break every link in this dangerous nuclear chain.


Back in 2009 President Barack Obama gave what is known as the Prague speech, setting out a vision of a world without nuclear weapons. It was more than welcome. The progress in discussions between the United States and Russia on a replacement nuclear weapons reduction treaty for START was also welcome. In February 2010 US and Russian negotiators reached an agreement in principle on a successor treaty to START that would reduce the number of deployed nuclear weapons to between 1,500 and 1,675 each from the 2,200 agreed in 1991. There would be a reduction in nuclear delivery systems, and there was a joint understanding signed by President Barack Obama and then President Dmitry Medvedev in July 2009 which led to this. We also had a new Russian military doctrine announced at that time, moving away from earlier rhetoric on nuclear use closer towards the sole purpose of nuclear weapons being to deter nuclear attack, and that declaration is a positive step too.


It is America and Russia who have the vast majority of the world's nuclear weapons, so other countries can hardly be expected to disarm if there is no leadership coming from America and Russia. But the efforts of America and Russia alone will not make the world safe from nuclear attack—far from it. They must be complemented by steps taken by the other nuclear powers to also disarm. China, India and Pakistan will, like America and Russia, need to have bilateral or trilateral discussions so that reducing their nuclear hardware will not be seen within their own countries as prejudicial to their national security. Our task is to re-energise the international political debate against a background of a decade or more in which the international community has been sleepwalking when it comes to nonproliferation and especially disarmament.


It is good news that the Australian government has been heavily involved in the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, co-chaired by the former Japanese foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi and the former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans, who has an outstanding international reputation and has done first-class work around the world, building the case for action. That commission released its report in late 2009.


Those developments, the announcements by Barack Obama and the negotiations with the Russians have been very good news. But there has been plenty of bad news on the nuclear front. North Korea has tested rockets that could be used for long-range missiles and conducted a nuclear explosion, in flagrant breach of the United Nations rules. Iran has also engaged in nuclear and ballistic missile activity. It locked out the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, whose job it is to make sure that countries producing nuclear power to generate electricity are not also trying to produce nuclear weapons.


The fact that we have now survived over 60 years of the age of nuclear weapons without descending into nuclear holocaust has been the cause of lot of analysis and discussion, with reference to the doctrines of deterrence and mutually assured destruction. I think one of the factors that should be acknowledged is the role of organisations around the world dedicated to peace, stubbornly refusing to recognise any legitimate role for nuclear weapons and helping to ensure that a climate in which the use of nuclear weapons might seem legitimate could not arise.


One of those organisations which I want to acknowledge this evening is the Australian Red Cross and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Late last year the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement met in Geneva to discuss a global resolution, and a landmark resolution was endorsed. This was done by representatives of 186 national societies from across the globe. Given the wide credibility that it has, I will take the liberty of reading it to the House:


Working towards the elimination of nuclear weapons:


The Council of Delegates,


deeply concerned about the destructive power of nuclear weapons, the unspeakable human suffering they cause, the difficulty of controlling their effects in space and time, the threat they pose to the environment and to future generations and the risks of escalation they create,


concerned also by the continued retention of tens of thousands of nuclear warheads, the proliferation of such weapons and the constant risk that they could again be used,


disturbed by the serious implications of any use of nuclear weapons for humanitarian assistance activities and food production over wide areas of the world,


believing that the existence of nuclear weapons raises profound questions about the extent of suffering that humans are willing to inflict, or to permit, in warfare,   


welcoming the renewed diplomatic efforts on nuclear disarmament, in particular the commitments made by States at the 2009 United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament, the 2010 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms,


welcoming also the commitments made by States at the highest levels in the above fora to create the conditions for a world free of nuclear weapons through concrete actions in the fields of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament,


…   …   …


drawing upon the testimony of atomic bomb survivors, the experience of the Japan Red Cross and ICRC in assisting the victims of the atomic bomb blasts in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the knowledge gained through the ongoing treatment of survivors by the Japanese Red Cross Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospitals, 


…   …   …   


… emphasizes the incalculable human suffering that can be expected to result from any use of nuclear weapons, the lack of any adequate humanitarian response capacity and the absolute imperative to prevent such use,


… finds it difficult to envisage how any use of nuclear weapons could be compatible with the rules of international humanitarian law, in particular the rules of distinction, precaution and proportionality,


… appeals to all States:


- to ensure that nuclear weapons are never again used, regardless of their views on the legality of such weapons,


-  to pursue in good faith and conclude with urgency and determination negotiations to prohibit the use of and completely eliminate nuclear weapons through a legally binding international agreement, based on existing commitments and international obligations … 


Robert Tickner from the Australian Red Cross has said that it is their hope that they are able to achieve cross-party support from all the major political parties in Australia for the principles raised in the resolution. I want to register my support for the important contribution the movement has made in seeking the development of international law to clarify the illegality of the use of nuclear weapons. 


There are so many nuclear weapons in the world that we can expect to be occupied for the remainder of our lives in the fight to get rid of them. We have a long way to go before we have to look too closely at what a world without nuclear weapons would actually look like. But I think it is necessary to have at least a little bit of a look at such a world, because otherwise we run the risk of bumping our heads up against resistance that seems illogical to us but is there all the same.


I believe that a world without nuclear weapons would be a safer world but the reality is that, in every country which possesses nuclear weapons, there are defence planners, policy makers and, indeed, ordinary citizens who are anxious that if they give up all their nuclear weapons they may be vulnerable to attack from another country—a country with superior conventional weapons, a larger army or a motive to attack them. Because of this, I believe that ultimate success in ridding the world of nuclear weapons will also depend on being able to achieve substantial disarming of conventional forces and weapons as well.


There needs to be more bilateral, multilateral and global discussion about reducing the size and reach of the armies of the world. We need to do more to address the underlying causes of war and terrorism. Analysts spend a great deal of time assessing the political and religious factors leading to the scourge of terrorism and of war in the modern world but they spend less time noting the underlying cause—conflict over scarce resources, scarce land, scarce water and scarce oil brought about by increasing population. So we need to be able to visualise a world without nuclear weapons, and that means thinking about what risks as well as benefits come with that and intelligently planning to address them. Borrowing a little from the late Edward Kennedy, the dream of a world without nuclear weapons is a dream that must never die. We must never accept that it is alright to live in a world where some people have the power to kill tens of millions of their fellow human beings and make the planet uninhabitable in a heartbeat.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:45):  I rise to support the Prime Minister's motion. In doing so I thank both her and the Leader of the Opposition for putting this unanimous motion to the parliament. It is a motion that I think is extremely important and one for which I do not think there is any option other than to support.


As a person who has been a long-term advocate for a nuclear-free world, I believe it is important that we move forward and take action. The Prime Minister's motion gives us a ground for doing so. But, more importantly, I think report No. 106 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—which I was privileged to be a member of the last parliament—really highlights the issues that revolve around nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. It highlights the actions that can be taken to get to a world without nuclear weapons.


When it comes to nuclear weapons, there is no winner. The country that has the biggest and the most weapons, the country that has the largest stockpile, is not the winner. Any nation that is depending on its nuclear war stock is never going to be a winner. Other countries around the world are not winners either. There is a definite divide within the international community between those who have nuclear weapons and those who do not have nuclear weapons. Those that have nuclear weapons want to make sure that the countries that do not have nuclear weapons remain in that position. I do not think that in itself does anything to move this debate any further forward. Nuclear weapons do not make our world safer. Nuclear weapons actually create an environment of instability and, at the same time, create an environment where the very safety of everybody on this planet is at risk.


Currently there are five listed nuclear powers. They are Britain, China, France, Russia and the US. There are three that lie outside the NPT. They are India, Israel and Pakistan. I would now add a fourth, and that is North Korea. We have seen over the last 12 months both North Korea and Iran flexing their muscles and moving to a situation where they are becoming a nuclear threat. Although I said that there are four nations, I should have added Iran as another nation that is in refusing to allow inspectors to come in and is openly boasting of having a nuclear weapons program.


We cannot be complacent. It is complacency that has led us into the position we are in now. The threat is still very acute. There is a combined stockpile of over 20,000 nuclear weapons. Of these, 5,000 warheads are launch-ready and 2,000 of these warheads are in a state of high operational alert. This places the very existence of the planet we live on at risk. I believe the motion the Prime Minister has moved acknowledges just how important this is.


On 2 July 2009 I attended the Conference on Disarmament. The thing I found most disturbing of all was that the debate that took place on that day was determining the agenda for discussion of nuclear disarmament. Moving the issue forward and actually working on disarmament was not happening, because those countries at the Conference on Disarmament could not even agree on an agenda and the format those discussions would take. I do not think that is good enough. I think it is very, very important that we get to a stage where all countries acknowledge that nuclear weapons are dispensable and that the way to deal with the threats of tomorrow is not through nuclear threats.


It is very important that we coax and coerce North Korea back into the NPT, because you cannot deal with issues such as this unless all the players are involved. So I strongly urge that part of the role that Australia plays in nuclear nonproliferation is to encourage and engage with all those countries that have nuclear weapons and that wish to engage in nuclear weaponry.


I would like to refer to the Treaties Committee that I mentioned earlier. In total there were 22 recommendations, and those recommendations were unanimous. They were the recommendations of a committee that had people from both sides of this parliament, and people with very diverse views. Recommendation 1 was that the government support and achieve the ratification of the CTBT by the United States Senate. We saw that as very important, and the committee was involved in a number of discussions around that. But that has not happened. It needs to happen, as do the other recommendations in this report. Diplomatic efforts to encourage ratification of the CTBT need to be pursued. Australia has a very strong role in that because of the relationship we have with the United States.


The committee also recommended that the government use all its diplomatic powers to promote negotiations on a verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty. The committee felt very strongly about the issues that were raised and the recommendations that were made. The committee had the support of the government at the time, and the Prime Minister reiterated her support for nuclear disarmament in her speech in the parliament. One of the recommendations I thought was very important was recommendation 5, which recommends that the Australian government encourage all other uranium exporting countries to require countries to which they export uranium to have an additional protocol in place. It is absolutely paramount that countries that receive uranium from Australia are parties to the NPT, and I strongly support the additional protocol. I do not think as a nation we should be exporting our uranium to anyone that has not signed up to the treaty.


There were a number of other important recommendations in the treaties committee report. The committee members that were involved in that inquiry, particularly those that visited other countries, felt that Australia really does have a leadership role. They felt that not enough was happening, that there were enough nuclear weapons in the international community to pose a real threat to the lives of everyone on this planet and that the one-upmanship of ensuring that those countries that have nuclear weapons and maintain those weapons was not really leading anywhere—along with the fact that it created that desire of those countries that did not have nuclear weapons to seek to obtain those weapons.


I refer to a paper by Professor Ramesh Thakur, Director for the Centre of Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament at the ANU. I see that the member for Fremantle is here. I know that she was responsible for having the professor come and talk to us. He put it very well:


The case for abolition is simple, elegant and eloquent. Without strengthening national security, nuclear weapons diminish our common humanity and impoverish our soul. Their very destructiveness robs them of military utility against other nuclear powers and of political utility against nonnuclear countries.


As long as any country has any, others will want some. As long as they exist, they will be used one day again by design, accident or miscalculation.


That very much sets out the scenario for nuclear weapons. 


The doctrine of deterrence does not work. The current treaties do not include groups involved in terrorism. War and terrorism need to be addressed in ways other than through nuclear weaponry and through nations demonstrating the level of power they have by the number of nuclear warheads they own. There need to be more multilateral and bilateral agreements entered into. Australia needs to take the lead and be involved in diplomacy, moving to a situation where we have a nuclear-free world. Australia has a close relationship with Israel—and I notice that nowhere is it mentioned the fact that Israel have nuclear weapons. They also need to be involved and agree to limitations on the nuclear weapons they hold.


This is a question that can easily be answered. We need to move. I fully admit that within my lifetime we will not reach the stage where we have a nuclear-weapon-free world—




Ms Parke:
  Why not?




Ms HALL:
  but I will do everything in my power to see that that happens. I was actually in Tahiti in 1995, when the nuclear testing took place there. Australia and New Zealand have always been leaders in the fight against nuclear weapons.


I will finish where I started, by congratulating the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on agreeing on the motion that is before the parliament; I just ask that the motion be given a few more teeth.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (19:00):  I am very pleased to speak on this critical issue, and I thank the Prime Minister for her timely motion in support of nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, which has in turn been seconded by the opposition leader. Every single point of the motion must be pursued with urgency if this most ominous of threats to worldwide peace and stability is finally to be eradicated. The spectre of nuclear war has haunted human civilisation for the past 66 years. By the time the Cold War ended, the US and the Soviet Union between them possessed more than 70,000 nuclear warheads.


In the 20 years since its creation, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, also known as the NPT, and the further related instruments that have flowed on from the agreement, including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, or CTBT, have operated to greatly reduce the stockpiles of nuclear weapons. But the fact remains that any outcome short of total disarmament is unacceptable, because it leaves us, the global community, at risk of suffering the effects of a nuclear explosion. No greater destructive event exists. As Professor Ramesh Thakur, Director of the Centre for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament in the Crawford School and Professor of International Relations, both at the Australian National University, has noted:


Since the end of the Cold War, the risk of a Russia-United States nuclear war has diminished, but the prospect of nuclear weapons being used by other nuclear-armed states or nonstate actors has become more plausible.


I also thank Professor Thakur for sharing his expert view on the gravity of the nuclear status quo when he addressed Australia's UN Parliamentary Group in March.


While the Cold War persisted, the rally cries and wide public calls for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament were loud and impassioned, but in the last couple of decades they have lessened. Grassroots protesters have, quite rightly, become a bit disillusioned by the slow pace of progress and by the apparent lack of political will that have come to prevail, notwithstanding the escalation of nuclear threats in the Middle East and Asia. As US senior statesmen Henry Kissinger, William J. Perry, Sam Nunn and George P. Shultz said in their collaborative efforts to re-energise the nuclear debate:


The accelerating spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear know-how and nuclear material has brought us to a nuclear tipping point. The world faces a very real possibility that the deadliest weapons ever invented could fall into dangerous hands.


The steps being taken to address these threats are not adequate to the danger. With nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous.


In September 2009, following its inquiry into nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, delivered its report—and I am very pleased that its 22 recommendations are acknowledged by the Prime Minister's motion. As the committee chair, the member for Wills, noted in his foreword to report 106:


We must do all that we can to try to break every link in this dangerous nuclear chain. Every one of us has a responsibility to help re-energise the international political debate, against a background of really a decade or more in which the international community has been sleepwalking when it comes to both non-proliferation and especially disarmament.


…   …   …


We must never accept that it is alright to live in a world where some people have the power to kill tens of millions of their fellow human beings, and make the planet uninhabitable, in a heart beat.


The prospect of the global community sleepwalking its way through a period in which the nuclear threat goes unchallenged or grows would be unacceptable to any thinking person. But, unless we see a resuscitation and intensification of the debate in due course, that is exactly the scenario we will face. On this point I again defer to the words of Professor Thakur:


… not one country that had an atomic bomb in 1968 when the NPT was signed has given it up. Judging by their actions rather than the rhetoric, all are determined to remain nuclear-armed.


…   …   …


To would-be proliferators, the lesson is clear: Nuclear weapons are indispensable in today’s world and for dealing with tomorrow’s threats


…   …   …


The most powerful stimulus to nuclear proliferation by others is the continuing possession of the bomb by some. Nuclear weapons could not proliferate if they did not exist; because they do, they will.


As the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties found in 2009, other countries can hardly be expected to disarm if there is no leadership coming from America and Russia, which harbour the vast majority of nuclear weapons. While the US has not yet ratified the CTBT, it was encouraging in 2010 to see the US and Russia negotiate, sign and ratify a new strategic arms reduction treaty, namely START II, which is intended to reduce nuclear arsenals by one third. I am hopeful that the START II process will eventually pave the way to significant near-term disarmament and that the proposed Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, an instrument that would prohibit the further production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices, will be implemented. But, clearly, we are some way from that. Professor Thakur has warned of a palpable and growing sense that START II could mark the end of nuclear disarmament progress instead of being the first step on the road to abolition.


The chairman of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, Tilman Ruff, associate professor in the Nossal Institute for Global Health, University of Melbourne, recently warned on ABC Radio that Australia needs to be mindful of not sending mixed messages, for example, wanting the US to keep a strong nuclear arsenal while also advocating nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. Professor Ruff asked: are we walking the talk or are we saying one thing and doing another?


In the view of many, including the Australian parliament, the world needs to be looking at an agreement for wholesale nuclear disarmament rather than being satisfied with the halting incremental steps that have been taken to date. A nuclear weapons convention, which would build on the 1968 NPT to prohibit the development, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, transfer, threat or use of nuclear weapons and provide for their elimination has been championed by ICAN and is supported by more than 200 nongovernment organisations in 60 countries as well as by more than 700 members of parliament from more than 75 countries who have joined the Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament Group.


I would like at this point to acknowledge the fine work of the Honourable Gareth Evans, co-chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament as well as the co-chairmanship of Japan to the commission building on the compelling case for action made earlier by the Canberra commission which said:


So long as any state has nuclear weapons, others will want them. So long as any such weapons remain, it defies credibility that they will not one day be used, by accident, miscalculation or design. And any such use would be catastrophic for our world as we know it. 


I applaud the Prime Minister for reinvigorating this critical debate, a debate in which Australia has always played and should continue to play a loud and active role.


Debate adjourned.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-05-09,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (19:09):  I rise to speak on the review of the 2011 annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and the committee's hearing with senior members of the Reserve Bank, including the bank's Governor Glenn Stevens, in February this year. As a proud member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics I relish the opportunity to participate and discuss monetary policy settings with my colleagues. The committee also has the opportunity to question the Reserve Bank on monetary policy settings, and that happens twice a year.


When questioning the Reserve Bank about monetary policy and the management of the Australian economy, we cannot ignore the government's fiscal policy settings. This is a feature of the report and has been a feature of much economic analysis subsequent to the report. Unlike the Labor Party, coalition members have a view that Australia's seemingly good fortune is not a derivative of Labor's fiscal management nor the government's finely tuned fiscal policy settings. Rather, the opinion of the coalition members—and we did seek to verify these views in the report with respect to responsible economic management—is that it is really a legacy of the former coalition government. 


That is not to say that it has all been bad, but the evidence was there from the Reserve Bank. Much of Australia's ongoing economic success and the resilience and strength of the Australian economy were also due to our geographic location more than they are from any brilliance by the current Treasurer. One of the reasons why our terms of trade are fantastic at the moment—record highs—is because of demand in our resources sector. Make no mistake: China wants our raw materials. Our trading partners want coal, they want iron ore, they want our bauxite. We are well placed as a nation to continue to serve them.


The testimony of the Reserve Bank governor was clear. Australia will continue to have economic challenges in the future as we undertake a very significant period of structural reform across the economy. When the Reserve Bank governor says that Australia will continue to have economic challenges in the future as we enter very significant periods, I counsel my colleagues, when pinning their economic credibility to a wafer-thin surplus in such a volatile market, that we should move into the economic arena with caution, in particular with our forecasting of budget surpluses or deficits.


We will continue to see pressures being placed on the banks with respect to their funding costs, and there will need to be continual revisions of interest rates and the official cash rate by the Reserve Bank to get the balance right between inflation and economic growth for Australia into the future. Since the report was tabled we have seen the inflation rate fall under the inflation range and we have seen the Reserve Bank move to stimulate the economy in the way of a movement in the cash rate.


However, talking of banks, it is perplexing to the Australian people that, while banks claim the cost of funds is a major source of their increasing costs, they still manage to somehow produce record profits. Since this report was tabled we have seen inflation move, as I mentioned before. I thank heaven for the independence of the Reserve Bank and its ability to act to stimulate the softening economy. I particularly note the comments in paragraph 2.9, page 7, of the report:


There are sectors of the Australian economy which are experiencing average performance. Some are weak relative to historical averages, others stronger.


In paragraph 2.13, it says:


Global growth is now expected to be below trend in 2012 …


I come from the electorate of Wright where I have very little or no linkages to the resources sector, so I do not experience the spin-off of the two-speed economy when the resources sector is going gangbusters. I have made the comment many times in the public arena that the electorate of Wright is the economic weathervane of the nation when it comes to that softer part of the economy—the mums and dads who have no linkages to the resources sector. I can assure the committee and the House that there are sectors in my electorate that are doing it extremely tough in the current conditions. With reference to the labour market, the RBA advises that the unemployment rate is drifting up, to 5.5 per cent, and those predictions were emulated by Treasury modelling recently. It will be interesting to hear the response of the RBA to the participation rate, which by all accounts is falling and having an impact on the capacity of families to meet the growing demands of household cost-of-living pressures and, additionally, having an impact on the small- and medium-sized business sectors.


Speaking of the participation rate, we need to be mindful that, whilst we may see reports that the labour market is at 5.5 per cent for unemployment, if those unemployed are doing 38 hours a week, and through economic pressures their labour participation drops back down to 20 per cent, it will not influence the 5.5 per cent or the overall percentage rate but it will have an impact on families, especially on the money that flows through the household. It will be interesting to hear the RBA's response to the participation rate, which by all accounts is falling and having an impact on families.


If this government had managed the surplus, or the buffer as it is now referred to, to the tune of the $20 billion that we left them, our fiscal and monetary positions may well have been very different from those today. I would like to offer my respect and gratitude to the outgoing members of the RBA board, particularly Donald McGauchie and Warwick McKibbin. We do appreciate the incredibly valuable service that both gentlemen provided to the RBA. We welcome the appointment of the new members to the RBA and we trust that they will provide counsel and wisdom to the Reserve Bank of Australia in the same capacity as their predecessors. We appreciate the expertise they provided for the good of Australia and its people in developing sound monetary policy settings. I wish them well in their new chosen fields and their continuing contribution to the betterment of the Australian economy and the fiscal and monetary outlook.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:17):  My contribution will focus on the broader context in which the Reserve Bank conducts its business. As you would know as a member of the committee, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, much of the discussion and interchange at the hearings we have with the governor and deputy governors of the Reserve Bank focus on the broader economic context in which economic policy is made, and those are some of the areas to which I would like to direct my points.


The 2011 annual report of the Reserve Bank that we are discussing today is in large part based on the hearing held in Sydney on 21 February. Since that hearing, we have seen some significant movement in the central bank's approach to interest rate settings, something that has been very welcome to me because, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent an electorate that has traditionally had a very strong manufacturing base. It also has a university, and a high percentage of its workforce is employed in the retail sector. We are being buffeted by the very strong headwinds that are largely impacting regions like my own, particularly as a result of the high Australian dollar. If I have been critical of some of the direction of monetary policy in this country over the last two to three years the criticism would be that the Reserve Bank, to its credit, has been a real tiger when it comes to chasing its mandate on inflation but it has been less quick off the mark when it comes to considering the unemployment and employment parts of its mandate. For people in this place who represent electorates like my own we know that, whilst there is a necessity to take account of the mining boom that is going on around the country, electorates like Throsby and large parts of eastern Australia are not enjoying the benefits of the mining boom around which so much of our monetary and economic policy is based. I do welcome the significant move that the Reserve Bank made in reducing interest rates by 50 basis points. I repeat the calls that have been made by the Treasurer and others on this side of the House who would like to see the major lenders in this country following suit and passing on those interest rate cuts in full.


If you listen to economic debates around this House, you could be forgiven for thinking that the state of the Australian economy is in lockstep with the economies of Europe or even North America. Of course nothing could be further from the truth. Having recently spent a week in Europe, I can tell you I never met a person who would not trade places with us when it comes to employment opportunities and the economic circumstances being faced by Australians. Australia has been through the worst global recession in 80 years, with an aftermath in some countries as long and as turbulent as that which was experienced during the Great Depression. Despite all of this, our actions have helped to ensure that the domestic economy is now more than 10 per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis. By contrast, output in the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan is today still well below where it was at the beginning of 2008, with the UK and much of the eurozone back in recession.


Australia's economy is expected to grow at a further 8.5 per cent by mid-2014. Again, this is more than any of the big developed economies that we normally compare ourselves with. With the Australian economy returning to a trend of growth, it is right that the government moves back into surplus, allows room for business to expand and gives the RBA more flexibility when it comes to rate cuts as and when it sees fit. For the first time in our economic history, the Australian economy has been rated triple-A by all three global credit rating agencies. It is a small and elite club. The European sovereign debt crisis means nine countries either lost their triple-A ratings or were put on a negative watch. The United States has lost its triple-A rating and a few years ago this would have been simply unthinkable. I make these observations because as you travel the halls of this place and read some of the commentary, not the informed commentary, within the popular press, you could be forgiven for thinking that Australia was in the same position as many of the other economies that I talk of. We are in a small club that has a triple-A rating and, for the first time in our history, we have achieved that triple-A rating by all three of the global credit rating agencies.


As a share of GDP, tax revenue is at the lower level it has been for nearly 20 years. This is an important point to make, given that this debate is occurring not 24 hours after the Treasurer of Australia stood in the House of Representatives and handed down a budget which will bring us back into surplus in this financial year. This is at a time when the GDP-tax revenue ratio is at its lowest for 20 years. It is a remarkable achievement. If you consider that the previous coalition government saw revenues increase by almost two percentage points of GDP during its term, as the Treasurer observed in an address to the Press Club earlier today, this is nothing short of a remarkable achievement. Since the 2007 federal election, over five budgets, revenues have fallen by more than 1½ percentage points of GDP. If we had had the same average tax-to-GDP ratio as the previous government, revenue in 2012-13 would be $24 billion higher. That would give us a budget surplus of around $25 billion, the largest nominal surplus in Australia's history in some of the most challenging economic times that our nation has faced. We have steered the country through the global financial crisis and kept unemployment rates below six per cent—as far as I am concerned that is still high, and I know you would share that view, Mr Acting Deputy Chair. We have kept a lid on debt, ensured that we are still growing as an economy and ensured that we have a plan not only to bring this budget back into surplus but to put in place the long-term reforms that are going to be needed to ensure that we remain in surplus on average over the economic cycle so that we are not building structural deficits into our budget. This is something that when the economy was raining gold bars on those opposite they never managed to do. They never took any of those big, tough decisions to remove the structural—the underlying—deficits that were built up under their watch. They never managed to do that. So it is nothing short of a remarkable achievement when the Treasurer is able to stand in the House of Representatives and deliver a budget which will see us in surplus over the financial year.


I will interrupt here and make this point, because there has been a lot said in this place and in the popular press on the subject of surpluses. It seems to be an article of faith from those on the other side of the House that there is something intrinsically good in delivering a budget surplus, that irrespective of what the economic circumstances are they are committed to delivering budget surpluses. I cannot think of a more boneheaded approach to economic policy than that which I often hear espoused by those on the other side: it is an article of faith that we deliver surpluses. When they stand and make statements like that they are saying that it is an article of faith for those on the other side to tax the Australian people more than they need to to run the operations of government. That is ultimately what they are saying: if they are saying that they are committed to running budget surpluses irrespective of what the underlying economic circumstances are, then they are saying that they are committed to running budget surpluses and taxing the Australian people more than they absolutely need to.


So we do have some challenges and we do have some threats. Unemployment is higher that it should be in some areas, while we have labour shortages in other areas. We have infrastructure bottlenecks, largely due to the deficit in infrastructure spending led by those on the other side. And we do have some confidence issues, as we have those on the other side trawling for economic misery. That cannot help but impact on consumer sentiment and investor sentiment. But despite all of this, in the words of the Reserve Bank governor: as he travels around the world he has never met a central bank governor who he would rather trade places with.


So I commend the report to the House, and I congratulate the Treasurer on the excellent job he has done in ensuring that fiscal policy is in step with monetary policy in this country.


Debate adjourned.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (19:09):  I rise to speak on the review of the 2011 annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and the committee's hearing with senior members of the Reserve Bank, including the bank's Governor Glenn Stevens, in February this year. As a proud member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics I relish the opportunity to participate and discuss monetary policy settings with my colleagues. The committee also has the opportunity to question the Reserve Bank on monetary policy settings, and that happens twice a year.


When questioning the Reserve Bank about monetary policy and the management of the Australian economy, we cannot ignore the government's fiscal policy settings. This is a feature of the report and has been a feature of much economic analysis subsequent to the report. Unlike the Labor Party, coalition members have a view that Australia's seemingly good fortune is not a derivative of Labor's fiscal management nor the government's finely tuned fiscal policy settings. Rather, the opinion of the coalition members—and we did seek to verify these views in the report with respect to responsible economic management—is that it is really a legacy of the former coalition government. 


That is not to say that it has all been bad, but the evidence was there from the Reserve Bank. Much of Australia's ongoing economic success and the resilience and strength of the Australian economy were also due to our geographic location more than they are from any brilliance by the current Treasurer. One of the reasons why our terms of trade are fantastic at the moment—record highs—is because of demand in our resources sector. Make no mistake: China wants our raw materials. Our trading partners want coal, they want iron ore, they want our bauxite. We are well placed as a nation to continue to serve them.


The testimony of the Reserve Bank governor was clear. Australia will continue to have economic challenges in the future as we undertake a very significant period of structural reform across the economy. When the Reserve Bank governor says that Australia will continue to have economic challenges in the future as we enter very significant periods, I counsel my colleagues, when pinning their economic credibility to a wafer-thin surplus in such a volatile market, that we should move into the economic arena with caution, in particular with our forecasting of budget surpluses or deficits.


We will continue to see pressures being placed on the banks with respect to their funding costs, and there will need to be continual revisions of interest rates and the official cash rate by the Reserve Bank to get the balance right between inflation and economic growth for Australia into the future. Since the report was tabled we have seen the inflation rate fall under the inflation range and we have seen the Reserve Bank move to stimulate the economy in the way of a movement in the cash rate.


However, talking of banks, it is perplexing to the Australian people that, while banks claim the cost of funds is a major source of their increasing costs, they still manage to somehow produce record profits. Since this report was tabled we have seen inflation move, as I mentioned before. I thank heaven for the independence of the Reserve Bank and its ability to act to stimulate the softening economy. I particularly note the comments in paragraph 2.9, page 7, of the report:


There are sectors of the Australian economy which are experiencing average performance. Some are weak relative to historical averages, others stronger.


In paragraph 2.13, it says:


Global growth is now expected to be below trend in 2012 …


I come from the electorate of Wright where I have very little or no linkages to the resources sector, so I do not experience the spin-off of the two-speed economy when the resources sector is going gangbusters. I have made the comment many times in the public arena that the electorate of Wright is the economic weathervane of the nation when it comes to that softer part of the economy—the mums and dads who have no linkages to the resources sector. I can assure the committee and the House that there are sectors in my electorate that are doing it extremely tough in the current conditions. With reference to the labour market, the RBA advises that the unemployment rate is drifting up, to 5.5 per cent, and those predictions were emulated by Treasury modelling recently. It will be interesting to hear the response of the RBA to the participation rate, which by all accounts is falling and having an impact on the capacity of families to meet the growing demands of household cost-of-living pressures and, additionally, having an impact on the small- and medium-sized business sectors.


Speaking of the participation rate, we need to be mindful that, whilst we may see reports that the labour market is at 5.5 per cent for unemployment, if those unemployed are doing 38 hours a week, and through economic pressures their labour participation drops back down to 20 per cent, it will not influence the 5.5 per cent or the overall percentage rate but it will have an impact on families, especially on the money that flows through the household. It will be interesting to hear the RBA's response to the participation rate, which by all accounts is falling and having an impact on families.


If this government had managed the surplus, or the buffer as it is now referred to, to the tune of the $20 billion that we left them, our fiscal and monetary positions may well have been very different from those today. I would like to offer my respect and gratitude to the outgoing members of the RBA board, particularly Donald McGauchie and Warwick McKibbin. We do appreciate the incredibly valuable service that both gentlemen provided to the RBA. We welcome the appointment of the new members to the RBA and we trust that they will provide counsel and wisdom to the Reserve Bank of Australia in the same capacity as their predecessors. We appreciate the expertise they provided for the good of Australia and its people in developing sound monetary policy settings. I wish them well in their new chosen fields and their continuing contribution to the betterment of the Australian economy and the fiscal and monetary outlook.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:17):  My contribution will focus on the broader context in which the Reserve Bank conducts its business. As you would know as a member of the committee, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, much of the discussion and interchange at the hearings we have with the governor and deputy governors of the Reserve Bank focus on the broader economic context in which economic policy is made, and those are some of the areas to which I would like to direct my points.


The 2011 annual report of the Reserve Bank that we are discussing today is in large part based on the hearing held in Sydney on 21 February. Since that hearing, we have seen some significant movement in the central bank's approach to interest rate settings, something that has been very welcome to me because, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent an electorate that has traditionally had a very strong manufacturing base. It also has a university, and a high percentage of its workforce is employed in the retail sector. We are being buffeted by the very strong headwinds that are largely impacting regions like my own, particularly as a result of the high Australian dollar. If I have been critical of some of the direction of monetary policy in this country over the last two to three years the criticism would be that the Reserve Bank, to its credit, has been a real tiger when it comes to chasing its mandate on inflation but it has been less quick off the mark when it comes to considering the unemployment and employment parts of its mandate. For people in this place who represent electorates like my own we know that, whilst there is a necessity to take account of the mining boom that is going on around the country, electorates like Throsby and large parts of eastern Australia are not enjoying the benefits of the mining boom around which so much of our monetary and economic policy is based. I do welcome the significant move that the Reserve Bank made in reducing interest rates by 50 basis points. I repeat the calls that have been made by the Treasurer and others on this side of the House who would like to see the major lenders in this country following suit and passing on those interest rate cuts in full.


If you listen to economic debates around this House, you could be forgiven for thinking that the state of the Australian economy is in lockstep with the economies of Europe or even North America. Of course nothing could be further from the truth. Having recently spent a week in Europe, I can tell you I never met a person who would not trade places with us when it comes to employment opportunities and the economic circumstances being faced by Australians. Australia has been through the worst global recession in 80 years, with an aftermath in some countries as long and as turbulent as that which was experienced during the Great Depression. Despite all of this, our actions have helped to ensure that the domestic economy is now more than 10 per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis. By contrast, output in the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan is today still well below where it was at the beginning of 2008, with the UK and much of the eurozone back in recession.


Australia's economy is expected to grow at a further 8.5 per cent by mid-2014. Again, this is more than any of the big developed economies that we normally compare ourselves with. With the Australian economy returning to a trend of growth, it is right that the government moves back into surplus, allows room for business to expand and gives the RBA more flexibility when it comes to rate cuts as and when it sees fit. For the first time in our economic history, the Australian economy has been rated triple-A by all three global credit rating agencies. It is a small and elite club. The European sovereign debt crisis means nine countries either lost their triple-A ratings or were put on a negative watch. The United States has lost its triple-A rating and a few years ago this would have been simply unthinkable. I make these observations because as you travel the halls of this place and read some of the commentary, not the informed commentary, within the popular press, you could be forgiven for thinking that Australia was in the same position as many of the other economies that I talk of. We are in a small club that has a triple-A rating and, for the first time in our history, we have achieved that triple-A rating by all three of the global credit rating agencies.


As a share of GDP, tax revenue is at the lower level it has been for nearly 20 years. This is an important point to make, given that this debate is occurring not 24 hours after the Treasurer of Australia stood in the House of Representatives and handed down a budget which will bring us back into surplus in this financial year. This is at a time when the GDP-tax revenue ratio is at its lowest for 20 years. It is a remarkable achievement. If you consider that the previous coalition government saw revenues increase by almost two percentage points of GDP during its term, as the Treasurer observed in an address to the Press Club earlier today, this is nothing short of a remarkable achievement. Since the 2007 federal election, over five budgets, revenues have fallen by more than 1½ percentage points of GDP. If we had had the same average tax-to-GDP ratio as the previous government, revenue in 2012-13 would be $24 billion higher. That would give us a budget surplus of around $25 billion, the largest nominal surplus in Australia's history in some of the most challenging economic times that our nation has faced. We have steered the country through the global financial crisis and kept unemployment rates below six per cent—as far as I am concerned that is still high, and I know you would share that view, Mr Acting Deputy Chair. We have kept a lid on debt, ensured that we are still growing as an economy and ensured that we have a plan not only to bring this budget back into surplus but to put in place the long-term reforms that are going to be needed to ensure that we remain in surplus on average over the economic cycle so that we are not building structural deficits into our budget. This is something that when the economy was raining gold bars on those opposite they never managed to do. They never took any of those big, tough decisions to remove the structural—the underlying—deficits that were built up under their watch. They never managed to do that. So it is nothing short of a remarkable achievement when the Treasurer is able to stand in the House of Representatives and deliver a budget which will see us in surplus over the financial year.


I will interrupt here and make this point, because there has been a lot said in this place and in the popular press on the subject of surpluses. It seems to be an article of faith from those on the other side of the House that there is something intrinsically good in delivering a budget surplus, that irrespective of what the economic circumstances are they are committed to delivering budget surpluses. I cannot think of a more boneheaded approach to economic policy than that which I often hear espoused by those on the other side: it is an article of faith that we deliver surpluses. When they stand and make statements like that they are saying that it is an article of faith for those on the other side to tax the Australian people more than they need to to run the operations of government. That is ultimately what they are saying: if they are saying that they are committed to running budget surpluses irrespective of what the underlying economic circumstances are, then they are saying that they are committed to running budget surpluses and taxing the Australian people more than they absolutely need to.


So we do have some challenges and we do have some threats. Unemployment is higher that it should be in some areas, while we have labour shortages in other areas. We have infrastructure bottlenecks, largely due to the deficit in infrastructure spending led by those on the other side. And we do have some confidence issues, as we have those on the other side trawling for economic misery. That cannot help but impact on consumer sentiment and investor sentiment. But despite all of this, in the words of the Reserve Bank governor: as he travels around the world he has never met a central bank governor who he would rather trade places with.


So I commend the report to the House, and I congratulate the Treasurer on the excellent job he has done in ensuring that fiscal policy is in step with monetary policy in this country.


Debate adjourned.
