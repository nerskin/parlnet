"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-21,"—I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005, which is, after all, a very important bill for the security of Australia. A number of points were made in the debate and I thought I might just place on record the government’s response to those comments.
I note that Senator Greig mentioned his continuing concern that Australians are having their phones tapped at a rate 30 times higher than the rate at which phones are tapped in the United States. The government has previously responded to this on a number of occasions. I think that it is fair to say that direct comparisons of United States and Australian statistics are quite simply misleading, because legislative controls on lawful interception differ widely between jurisdictions. The statistics published in the United States do not include interceptions considered by the investigators to be too sensitive to report. Investigators in Australian law enforcement agencies, however, do not have this discretion and therefore all interceptions must be reported.
United States law allows one warrant to authorise the interception of services used by many people—for instance, where it becomes possible to identify criminal associates of the original suspect. This results in fewer statistical returns than under Australian law, which allows a warrant to authorise the interception of a single telecommunications service or the services of one named person only. This means of course that what we are doing here is comparing apples with pears. They are two completely separate regimes in relation to telephone intercepts and you cannot compare the United States figures with those of Australia for those reasons.
Senator Greig has also suggested, again, that ASIO statistics should be made public, noting the recommendation of Mr Tom Sherman in this regard. The government made its position on this issue very clear in the second reading speech to this bill. We do not accept the recommendation that ASIO report publicly on its use of interception warrants. ASIO discharges extensive accountability obligations, and Mr Sherman did not advance any new arguments on this issue.
The Telecommunications (Interception) Act plays an important role in protecting the privacy of people using the Australian telecommunications system. It is, however, equally important that the act should facilitate the ability of law enforcement and other agencies to have appropriate and expeditious access to evidentiary material. This bill amends the interception act to ensure that it operates in a manner that continues to assist the functioning of our law enforcement agencies while at the same time maintaining tight control over interception.
This bill will allow the recording of calls made to or from emergency service facilities. The recording of such calls is essential to maintaining the excellent service that our police, ambulance and fire services provide and will enhance the accountability of such services. The government, however, has long acknowledged that such power must be subject to a legislative scheme offering appropriate accountability and control. Consistent with its commitment in this area, the government has accepted all of the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and will move amendments in the committee stage to give effect to these recommendations.
I take this opportunity to thank the members of that committee for their work on the inquiry into the provisions of this bill. In addition to the amendments to implement the committee’s recommendations, the government will move additional amendments to further enhance the framework in which the new provisions will operate. In addition to creating a legislative instrument that describes in general terms the nature and location of the emergency service facility, I will move amendments to ensure that recording of calls only occurs in a strictly defined area and to require that notices are placed at the entrance to all such facilities advising staff that calls may be recorded.
Finally, the committee recommended that the regulation making power to extend the definition of ‘law enforcement officer’ in the Criminal Code Act 1995 be better defined. The government notes the committee’s concerns in this regard, and I will move amendments to delete the regulation-making power altogether. The amendments contained in this bill will assist our emergency service operators and radio communications inspectors to more effectively discharge their roles and support the work of our law enforcement and security agencies. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-06-21,"—Yesterday, Senator Harris asked me a very detailed supplementary question. In one minute I was not able to answer all the parts of the question. For those parts that were not answered, I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard the additional answers to the very detailed supplementary question.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows:


Senator HARRIS—Minister, in setting up the JTA is it your government’s intention to have the TTJA run by a chairman, a managing director, two people with regulating experience and one with commercial experience? Will this agency create a corporate partnership between the regulator and the transnational pharmaceutical corporations? Will this agency remove the decision-making authority a further step away from the Australian and New Zealand electors? Finally, will your government guarantee that no natural product or therapy will be banned or withdrawn as a result of Codex?

SENATOR PATTERSON—


In setting up the JTA is it your Government’s intention to have the TTJA run by a chairman, a managing director, two people with regulating experience and one with commercial experience?

The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand for the Establishment of a Joint Scheme for the Regulation of Therapeutic Products provides that the scheme will be administered in both countries by a single regulatory Agency to be established under Australian legislation, and that the joint Scheme and the Agency will be overseen by a Ministerial Council comprising the Australian and New Zealand Health Ministers.
The Agreement was examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in May 2004 who recommended binding treaty action be taken in August 2004.
The Ministerial Council will appoint a Board comprising a Chair, the Managing Director of the Agency, a person with broad experience in public health and regulatory matters in New Zealand, a person with broad experience in public health and regulatory matters in Australia and a person with broad experience in commercial matters.
The Board will be responsible to the Ministerial Council for the governance of the Agency as set out in Article 6 of the Agreement.

Will this agency create a corporate partnership between the regulator and the Trans National Pharmaceutical Corporation.

Under Article 7 of the Agreement the regulatory functions of the Agency shall be performed by the Managing Director on behalf of and in the name of the Agency. The Managing Director will have day to day responsibility for the management of the Agency.
There is no such body under the joint regulatory scheme as the Trans National Pharmaceutical Corporation.
The Agreement will come into force once the implementing legislation has received passage in the Australian and New Zealand Parliaments.

Will this agency further remove the decision making authority a further step away from the Australian and New Zealand electors.

The Agency’s powers will be set out in the Australian Implementing Act.
The regulatory functions to be performed by the Agency will be set out in Ministerial Council Rules and Agency Orders which will have the force of law in both countries. The Rules and Orders will be disallowable instruments in both Parliaments.

Finally will your Government guarantee that no natural product or therapy will be banned or withdrawn as a result of Codex?

The proposed Codex Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements will not apply in Australia and will have no impact on the way these types of products are regulated in Australia.
In Australia, vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as complementary medicines. As such, they are required to meet the same standards of quality and safety as other types of complementary medicines under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The TGA is responsible for the regulation of these medicines in Australia. In some other countries, these products are regulated as foods and are subject to the standards and guidelines that apply to food.
The draft Codex Guidelines for Vitamins and Mineral Food Supplements specifically state that they apply in countries where vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as foods. As these products are regulated as medicines in Australia, they will not be affected by the proposed Codex Guidelines.
Under the joint regulatory scheme the Codex Guidelines will not apply to either Australia or New Zealand because these products will be regulated as medicines.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,8,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2005-06-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Today I asked Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, about the implosion of the export capacity of the Australian manufacturing industry. In answer to that question, and to subsequent questions from my colleagues, we got an ‘interesting’ answer—interesting in italics. We were lectured on the need for Australian industry to become globally competitive. The need for industry to become globally competitive is something that this opposition fully supports and, in government, it pioneered pathways to more international competitiveness. But it is the issues that Senator Minchin identified about global competitiveness that need comment now—firstly, the inability of the Australian manufacturing industry to win in the export stakes. Senator Minchin blamed the exchange rate. When you look at the facts, this blame is incorrect. The figures show that in 2001-02 and 2002-03 exports of manufactured goods in Australia declined by 0.5 per cent and then by seven per cent. The exchange rate at that time was favourable to the export industries. The exchange rate strengthened and therefore you would have expected export capacity to have weakened. But in 2003-04 the export capacity contracted by four per cent. It was still a very bad return but not a support for the minister’s argument. He then mentioned in passing that the resource sector is booming, as if we should take some comfort from that.
Both these points reinforce that the government’s view is to let the market decide: if the market decides that this great economy of Australia should be a mine, a quarry and a great sandy tourist beach, so be it. There is a requirement to move beyond that old thinking. The real argument that the minister put is that the cost input of the price of labour, due to the industrial relations system, is something that is crippling the manufacturing industry. The cost input of labour is one of the lowest input costs in the modern manufacturing industry, and to reduce labour prices—that is, to reduce wages, as the government’s bill on industrial relations intends—is not the way to go about it. We are seeing in the modern manufacturing industry a technology-intense industry. It needs highly skilled and highly qualified workers.
The deskilling of the Australian work force is one of the great shames of the Howard government. The lower wages do not provide any incentive for skills. They produce monkeys that are paid peanuts and that cannot keep up with the manufacturing needs of a modern, internationalised economy. We are being driven down a low-wage, low-skill path and, by consequence, a low internationally competitive path. The manufacturing sector is leading us down that path, because this government has not supported a skills based industrial relations system in which reward is made for qualification, skill and attainment. It is an ideological construct of this government that low wages are somehow the answer. They are not the answer in a high-technology country and a high-technology economy.
The other great gap in what the minister said is research and development. When we were in government, research and development in the private sector rose strongly. Under this government, research and development in the private sector has declined steadily. If you do not think of and develop products and processes for the future, you cannot compete in the present—and you will not succeed in the future either. The underinvestment in research and development in this country is making us less internationally competitive. We agree that the Australian economy should be more internationally competitive. The way to get there is by skilling up our work force and linking wages to higher skills. The other way to get there is to invest in Australian ingenuity and creativeness, to invest in research and development and to develop the new products and processes that can lead this economy into the next era. The fact that this government does not do that means that we are going backwards. The figures presented in the question today demonstrate that to anyone, beyond a reasonable doubt.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Manufacturing Exports</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,9,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-06-21,"—I suppose I should not be too tough on Senator Cook in his last hurrah as a senator before he farewells us at the end of the week, but the truth is that what we are seeing today is Labor seeking to talk down the success of Australia’s manufacturing industry as far as exports are concerned. The facts are that in 2004 Australia’s exports of manufactured goods increased by two per cent in value terms—not a decline; an increase of two per cent, Senator Cook. And this year growth of manufactured exports has strengthened even further and become broader based. In the March quarter of 2005, manufactured exports were seven per cent higher than they were in the same period of 2004. The advice that the government has is that there will be a further strengthening in manufacturing exports throughout 2005-06. So let us put to rest this nonsense we have heard from the Labor Party today that in fact manufacturing exports are declining as far as Australia is concerned.
—They are declining!
—Well, I have just given you the figures, Senator Cook, that they are in fact increasing. To the great credit of the Australian manufacturing industry, these results have been achieved in a period when the sector has experienced the difficulty and pressure of the high Australian dollar and competition from the emergence and growth of low-cost Chinese manufactures. There has also been strong demand in the domestic economy for manufactured goods, and that has channelled a certain amount of manufacturing production away from export markets. Despite all of those disadvantages—the disadvantages of a higher Australian dollar due to the difficulties in the American economy and the consequent low American dollar, competition from Chinese manufactures and the increasing domestic market shifting a focus away from exports—manufacturing exports have increased over the last year. The reason for that is that Australian industry has developed its competitive strength as a supplier of niche manufactures over the last few years, particularly with the support of the Howard government.
Take passenger motor vehicles alone. Their exports have increased by over 500 per cent. The motor industry has been particularly successful in developing and expanding markets in the Middle East for Australian produced motor vehicles with the support of the Australian government through the investment scheme, which has dramatically increased both the quality and the competitiveness of Australian motor vehicles compared with what they were a decade or so ago. Exports of medicines have increased by some 345 per cent, and exports of professional scientific and controlling instruments have risen 184 per cent. So in those high-tech areas Australian industry has been doing extremely well in developing and increasing export markets. Processed resources and metals exports—also a section of manufacturing with which Senator Johnston from Western Australia would be well acquainted—are benefiting from strong demand in the region, including from China. There are continuing challenges to the manufacturing industry in Australia as far as further expansion of these export markets is concerned, but the government has continually sought in particular to reduce trade barriers to our manufactured goods through its trade liberalisation agenda and to support Australian exporters with significant promotional activity.
A very important initiative, one which I have worked very hard for over the last few years, which was announced in this year’s budget was the removal of the three per cent tariff—the so-called tariff concession scheme; the three per cent tariff which had been implemented as a budgetary measure several years ago by this government on imported business inputs for a situation where there were no domestically produced substitutes. This was a cost impost on Australian manufacturers which the government has now removed, a further benefit provided to Australia’s manufacturing industry which will reduce input costs and increase the competitiveness of Australian industry.
The other initiative which the government have taken, in contrast to what Senator Cook has said today, is to increase the skills of the Australian work force. We have implemented a broad based education and training program to address skills shortages, particularly including the announced establishment of 24 Australian technical colleges in regions with serious skills shortages and increasing trade apprenticeships. The number of people undertaking traditional apprenticeships is now at its highest level since 1992. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-06-21,"—It is becoming a common theme now from the government that whenever they are confronted with figures that do not paint the picture of their great economic success they turn around and say: ‘Whatever the bad figures are, it is because we are a victim of our economic success.’ I guess it must be of some great consolation to the now nearly 1,000 retrenched workers earmarked to leave their employment in Victoria over the next few weeks that somehow they should hold their heads up high because they are a victim of our success. That is certainly an inappropriate way to deal with this particular employment tragedy.
Minister Minchin was quite happy to dismiss this, saying, ‘It doesn’t really matter that much because the labour market is in fact very strong,’ and he went on to talk to us about some of the unemployment figures. But of course those figures hide part of the true position of employment in this country. What we know and what everyone should know is that, in order to be considered not unemployed, you only have to work for one single hour per week to take you off the unemployment list. What we have is a huge pool of workers out there who are significantly underemployed. It is not fair to say that, because unemployment figures are looking relatively low based on that formula, somehow these workers will simply walk into new jobs.
But what is this so-called economic success that the government wants to talk about? We are talking about elaborately transformed manufacturing goods. The export growth figures for the last three financial years were indeed minus 0.5 per cent in 2001-02, minus seven per cent in 2002-03 and minus four per cent in 2003-04. Senator Chapman was simply dead wrong when he said those were not the figures. I do not know where he gets his figures or what pool he wants to bring those figures from, but we are talking about elaborately transformed manufactured goods, and these are clearly the department’s figures. These negative figures illustrate the shrinkage of elaborately transformed manufactured exports—the highest value sector of manufactured goods. Each negative result is measured against the year before, compounding the damage to Australia’s export capability in this crucial manufacturing sector.
In contrast, under Labor policies in the 1990s elaborately transformed manufactures experienced remarkable growth. For example, ETM export growth figures in 1996-97 were positive 9.3 per cent—a legacy of the Labor government’s innovation and export facilitation policies. Between 1990 and 1997, the most rapid growth in exports was in ETMs, which grew at an annual rate of 13.8 per cent per annum. Since 1997, however, the growth in ETM exports has slowed sharply, increasing over the period from 1997 to 2003 by only 1.8 per cent per annum based on average figures.
The recent survey by the Australian Industry Group showed that Australian manufacturing in the June quarter experienced the slowest growth for four years. Production growth has slowed and growth has weakened in sales and new orders. The survey results also conclude that there is no relief in sight as it predicts activity to weaken even further in the September quarter. The three-month outlook for manufactured exports is the weakest in the history of the AiG survey, and those surveys have been going since September 1992.
There is one thing on which I do agree with the minister—that is, to survive in the modern economy Australia must be internationally competitive. But the answer to becoming internationally competitive is not to be found in industrial relations. What this government intend to put in place is simply a process to drive down wages. If they think somehow that, in a high-technology economy such as Australia’s, driving down wages is going to help boost the economy, unfortunately they are sadly mistaken. What will help this economy is a proper and real demonstration of skills planning and skilling up the Australian work force, developing and providing opportunities for innovation, proper industry planning, and encouragement of research and development—all these things which this government have significantly ignored, which has got us into a situation of a significant skills shortage.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-06-21,"—May I say how delighted I am that the opposition has sought to move a motion to take note of answers relating to Australia’s export performance, because Australia’s export performance is the best in the world. Let us talk about Western Australia, my favourite subject in this place. We currently experience a growth rate of seven per cent, compared to a national average, including the mendicant states down south—where, of course, Senator Conroy comes from—which is around about two per cent.
We are leading the world in iron ore and refined iron ore production. We have up to a third of the world’s gold production. We are the leading exporter in the world for nickel. We have fabulous returns to Australia from oil and gas exports. We are one of Australia’s largest exporting states in coal and certainly one of the world’s biggest exporters of alumina. We lead the world in copper, lead and zinc production. We lead the world in tantalum production, of which the largest world reserves are contained in my home state of Western Australia, and we lead the world in rare earth mineral sands exports. Hiding behind all of this is uranium. Western Australia has the world’s largest reserves of uranium but, of course, we cannot touch them. We cannot enhance our exports because of the crazy, illogical, incoherent policies of the Australian Labor Party which say it is all right to mine in two places in the country but not in Western Australia.
Let us talk about exports. To April of last year, exports had risen for the previous 10 months by 13.8 per cent. In April alone in 2005, it was up nine per cent—the highest single monthly rise since the Olympic Games of 2000. There was a 14 per cent rise in non-rural exports. These figures are simply stunning. These figures mean that the Labor Party simply has nowhere to go in talking about Australia’s export performance. In the 10 months to April of this year, rural exports were up 11 per cent. Resource exports in Australia to April of this year were up 35 per cent. Manufacturing exports were up seven per cent to April 2005. Services exports were up four per cent. These figures are simply stunning.
In April this year, export performance produced a value of $14.6 billion. I might just draw an analogy, if I may, for the benefit of opposition senators—$14.6 billion is the annual cost, approximately, of maintaining the Australian Defence Force, so in one month our exports equalled the value of the entire cost per annum of running the Australian Defence Force.
My great state of Western Australia in the year 2003-04 exported $15 million tonnes of grain—a sensational performance. In the 10 months to April this year, for the benefit of opposition senators, our exports to India were up by 15 per cent, our exports to Japan were up by 25 per cent and our exports to China were up by 30 per cent. For 2005-06, our exports are predicted to rise by seven per cent. This is, as I say, a simply stunning performance and a great credit to the good governance of the Howard government.
So what is driving this growth in my home state of Western Australia? It is Australian workplace agreements. With regard to the freed-up iron ore industry, BHP and Hamersley Iron have been through the mill with their work force. They now have a free and flexible industrial relations platform. No rollback and look what happens. Our iron ore industry can respond to national demand and we can do good things for Australian exports. Then there is the skills training industry. Every time the Commonwealth wants to make a flexible skills based training regime in each state, we get the unions standing on the hose, so it takes apprentices four years to get their qualifications. Under our system, they would be able to work through at their own rate. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-06-21,"—Senator Johnston, I am just as proud of our home state as you are—in fact, I am a lot prouder of the Gallop Labor government than you are, obviously. But I point out that iron ore, gold, grain, nickel, diamonds, et cetera, are not manufactured exports. You do not need AWAs to grow grain and export it. Those are not manufactured exports, and it is the decline in manufactured exports and the decline in the skill base of the Australian work force that is the challenge facing us today. Today in question time, Senator Cook raised the plight of the 660 Autoliv and Trico workers whose jobs will soon be shipped offshore, unfortunately. Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. It is the natural consequence of this government’s dismal and dismissive attitude towards Australia’s world-class manufacturing sector—a manufacturing sector that has been neglected since 1996.
The Howard government’s record in this sector speaks for itself. In the last five years, 84,000 manufacturing jobs have just disappeared. And they have not been created in the iron ore industry, the grain growing industry or the goldmining industry in Western Australia. These jobs have just disappeared and not been replaced. Of these, 30,000 were lost in the nine months to May this year. That is 30,000 jobs that used to be filled that no longer exist—30,000 people occupied those positions. Our manufacturing trade deficit has doubled from a staggering $42 billion in 1996 to $83 billion in 2004. These are absolutely staggering figures. Growth in manufacturing exports has slumped from an impressive 14 per cent annually in the seven years to 1997 to a miserly two per cent since then. And I will not digress to the issues covered by Senator Marshall about the elaborately transformed manufactures.
Even with this evidence staring them in this face, this government refuses to admit liability for the thousands of jobs lost overseas under its watch—84,000 jobs. Take the government’s reaction to the job losses at Autoliv and Trico, for example. A spokeswoman for Minister Macfarlane blamed pay rises at the car makers for the job losses. In other words, and this is just staggering, it is all the fault of the greedy workers. If only workers would work harder and get paid less, we would not have this problem, according to the spokeswoman for Minister Macfarlane. No, Minister, job losses are not the fault of hardworking Australians. They are the natural consequence of this government’s failure to invest in the manufacturing sector and in research and development.
Another consequence of the government’s policy failures is the current skills crisis crippling our industries and holding back economic growth—an issue that the Labor Party has long been concerned about. Australian businesses, especially those in the manufacturing sector, are crying out for skilled workers. Welders, metal fabricators, carpenters, plumbers and a whole range of other professions are dying under the weight of this government’s inactivity. The only answer this government has for this skills shortage crisis is to say, ‘We are going to build 24 new technical colleges, where we will have some new apprentices come on stream in 2010’—some 4½ years time. There is a lag of at least 4½ years for this government to respond to a crisis that is facing our economy and our labour market today. Yet still this government is rudderless and confused. Instead of investing in much-needed training infrastructure, all they are intent on is a short-sighted policy of importing skilled workers from overseas on category 457 visas.
More than 18 months ago, Senator George Campbell chaired a Senate committee inquiry into the skills shortages. The committee’s comprehensive report, Bridging the skills divide, contained more than 40 recommendations and forms a veritable blueprint for meeting the skills crisis. But what has this government’s reaction been? It will come as no surprise to anyone here that they are yet to reply. They have thrown that report on the scrap heap. (Time expired)

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2005-06-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
           That the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 18 and made under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2004, be disallowed.
           That the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Regulations 2005, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 11 and made under the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Act 2003, be disallowed.
As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—

Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005

The Regulations provide the detail necessary for the regulatory framework established under the Act to safeguard against unlawful interference with aviation.
Paragraph 3.15(1)(e) requires the display of signs on the fencing or barrier around an airside area as specified in subregulation 3.15(4), warning against unauthorised entry. Paragraph 3.15(1)(f) requires the display of signs at every entrance to an airside area as specified in subregulation 3.15(6), warning against the unauthorised possession of weapons. It is not clear why the signs required to be displayed at entrances to an airside area are not required to display warnings against unauthorised entry.
Regulation 3.29 requires the operator of a designated airport to “enter into an agreement with a counter-terrorist first response service provider”. Regulation 3.30 specifies the qualifications of members of a counter-terrorist first response force. The Regulations do not, however, specify who may be a service provider, nor whether an airport operator is responsible for acts of the service provider undertaken pursuant to the agreement.
Paragraph 4.59(5)(b) provides that a weapon is “a tool of trade” if the person who possesses it requires it for a lawful purpose. It is near clear whether the word “lawful” in this context is to be determined solely by reference to the laws of Australia or whether the laws of other countries will also be considered.
Subregulation 4.75(2) defines when a person in custody is classified as being dangerous for the purposes of Subdivision 4.5.2—Persons in custody under the Migration Act. Paragraph 4.75(2)(a) of the definition states that a person is dangerous if DIMIA has assessed the person as being likely to attempt to commit an unlawful interference with aviation, or likely to attempt to escape. This appears to give DIMIA considerable discretion. It is not apparent whether DIMIA has the relevant expertise to make this type of assessment or the basis on which such assessments will be made. Paragraph 4.75(2)(b) supplies an alternative definition, referring to a person who has been charged with or convicted of a crime involving violence against a person or serious damage to property. The paragraph does not specify any time limit (for example, ‘in the past 5 years’), with the consequence that a person who has been convicted of, or charged with, such a crime at any time in the past may be classified as dangerous.
Similar questions are raised by subregulation 4.87(2). Additionally, the combined operation of paragraphs 4.87(1)(b) and (2)(a) gives the Australian Fisheries Management Authority the role of assessing whether a person is dangerous. It is not apparent whether the Authority has the relevant expertise to make this type of assessment.
Paragraph 6.06(b) refers to the issue of temporary ASICs that are designed to be used on a single occasion and then destroyed. Paragraph 6.36(6)(b) allows for a temporary ASIC to be issued for a period of 3 months or the remaining period of validity of the permanent ASIC. There appears to be an inconsistency between these two provisions.
Regulation 6.40 makes it an offence of strict liability to issue an ASIC or a VIC without authority. There does not appear to be a cognate offence relating to the wearing or displaying of an unauthorised or false ASIC or VIC. It is not clear whether this is an intentional omission.
Regulation 7.10 provides that a person who receives an infringement notice may apply “before the end of 28 days after receiving an infringement notice” to have the notice withdrawn. Regulation 7.08 provides that the recipient of a notice may apply for an extension of time to pay the penalty, but there is no time limit specified (as in regulation 7.10) within which such an application should be made.
The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on these matters.

HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Regulations 2005

The Regulations provide for the transfer of custody of certain records of the HIH Royal Commission to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
Regulation 4 gives ASIC access to “any record of, or relating to, the HIH Royal Commission”. The quoted words, found in regulation 4, are copied from section 6 of the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Act 2003. Nevertheless the words “or relating to” appear to have wide application. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the intended scope of these words.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,NOTICES,12,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-21,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will speak briefly on the report on the Home Ownership Program through Indigenous Business Australia. It is an important report, as are all of the reports from the Audit Office. I particularly want to draw attention to it because of the debate that has permeated this place for quite a long period of time. This report raises some issues to do with the management of privacy, and it is important that they are acknowledged and addressed. Some of those issues are not a direct responsibility of ATSIC, but a lot of the Home Ownership Program was run by ATSIC. It is worth noting that the Home Ownership Program’s self-funding asset base has doubled since 1990. It has provided housing for more than 21,700 Indigenous Australians. This is consistent with the ATSIC objectives, which were to promote the development of self-management and self-sufficiency amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and to further the economic, social and cultural development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
Ironically, in the area of promoting self-sufficiency I cannot think of a single program the government has run that has had the level of success that this Home Ownership Program, overseen by ATSIC, has had. It was an extremely successful program. That is not to say that there were not issues to do with privacy. They have been identified and addressed. As I said, not all of those issues, by any means, were the responsibility of ATSIC at various stages of the program. As always with these reports, issues regarding better ways of managing have been identified. This debate has been going on for a long period of time and there has been a continuing implication that ATSIC was incapable of delivering for Indigenous Australians. Clearly ATSIC had its problems, but in this area of the Home Ownership Program it provided housing for many Indigenous Australians who would not otherwise have had it. Its achievement in that area should be noted. I sincerely hope that the abolition of ATSIC and its taking over by various government bureaucracies will not unsettle the success of this program in delivering housing and improving self-sufficiency for Indigenous Australians.

The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Lyn Allison, as agreed by the Senate on 15 June 2005, that there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, no later than 4.30 pm on Tuesday, 21 June 2005, copies of all reports, including financial statements, provided as part of their reporting requirements for the past five years by all agencies that receive funding for pregnancy counselling and/or family planning activities from the Department of Health and Ageing, other than those already provided in the past month. I wish to inform the Senate that the Department of Health and Ageing is currently working to provide copies of reports and financial statements. However, due to the very significant amount of material requested in a short time frame, copies of reports cannot be laid on the table by 4.30 pm on Tuesday, 21 June 2005.

The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Carr, as agreed by the Senate on 11 May 2005, and it relates to the tabling of all submissions received by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in response to the ‘Building on success’ Community Development Employment Projects discussion paper 2005.
I wish to inform the Senate that the minister has agreed to release 36 submissions. This is in addition to 42 submissions tabled on 30 May 2005 and 30 submissions tabled on 31 May 2005. The minister has decided not to release four submissions, on public interest grounds. One of these submissions contains highly personal information and the minister believes that the public interest in keeping the submission confidential outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Three submissions were provided by Commonwealth, state or territory government agencies for internal consideration only. This provides a total of 108 submissions to the Senate, more than initially indicated, as some submissions were received after the formal closing date for submissions.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-21,"—I, and also on behalf of Senator Murray and Senator Brown, move:
That the ‘Communications Allowance’, being Clauses 10.4 to 10.13 of Determination 2005/09: Members of Parliament—Entitlements, made pursuant to subsections 7(1), (2) and (4) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, be disapproved.
I know there is a lot of other business to be dealt with so I will try to be brief, but it is an important matter. The Democrats have a long history of ensuring better accountability, oversight and scrutiny of parliamentarians’ entitlements and of seeking to reduce what we believe are unjust or unreasonable entitlements. My memory of these matters may not go back to the 1980s, but certainly in recent years we have tried to avoid getting into cheap populist politician bashing. I do not think that helps any of us. I do not think it assists the overall credibility of the parliament to reinforce overstated stereotypes about politicians all having our snouts in the trough at every available opportunity, because I know that that is not the case. But we have continued to campaign strongly against those entitlements that we believe are not justified.
We have continually campaigned for many years to reform the superannuation available to parliamentarians to bring their entitlements into line with community standards, and I am pleased that that campaign has now found success, albeit with those of us who were around prior to that change retaining the previous entitlements. But, for the future, clearly that unjustified entitlement has been reduced, and I believe that is a good thing for the credibility of democracy. Similarly, we opposed excessive increases in printing entitlements last year. We did not support the increase in parliamentarians’ pay—from my point of view, purely because I believe we are already paid enough. We do not jump on every single entitlement or point to them all and say that they are all appalling, but I do not believe this particular increase is justified.
To specify the details for those who are not aware of them, the communications allowance is currently $27½ thousand per year for members of the House of Representatives and for senators, or slightly more for those MPs with larger electorates. That allowance covers normal postage, other mail distribution services, couriers, the internet, web site maintenance and the like. What this determination of the Remuneration Tribunal does is dramatically increase that allowance from $27½ thousand to over $40,000 in many cases. It varies from electorate to electorate because the calculation method has now changed: it is 50c per elector for each House of Representatives member. The entitlement for senators does not change at all, and I think that is a pretty reasonable indication that it does not need to change for members of the House of Representatives. If there is a case for changing the formula—so much per elector—then let us have that debate, but make it a set amount per elector that leads to a total expenditure of around the current amount. I do not believe it is justified to enable that increase of around 50 per cent or more on average per year, with unused amounts being able to be rolled over so that it can be stored up for the election year for each incumbent and then spent in huge amounts.
There is already plenty of evidence that incumbent MPs have a dramatic advantage over everybody else. Naturally there will always be some advantage if you work hard and make wise decisions in the interests of your electorate. Then you have got a bit of a head start, and there is nothing wrong with getting an advantage through hard work and connecting with your community and trying to represent them. But getting extra advantages through what is now a huge printing entitlement for each individual member per year and now a massive leap in the communications allowance entitlement per year is not justified, I believe. There are plenty of examples from the last election, I think, to show that the benefit of incumbency from all of the taxpayer funded entitlements is really starting to give what I believe would be an unfair advantage as opposed to a fair or normal advantage.
The Democrats’ concern about this is not that there is a communications allowance. We are not suggesting that everybody uses it in a grossly unreasonable way. We are not suggesting that there may not be a case for changing the formula by which the allowance is determined or even potentially a case for a small CPI increase. To simply hike that total entitlement by over 50 per cent on average, under the guise of changing the way the formula is calculated, is, I believe, unjustified. This means many members will now have an entitlement every year of $40,000 for communications—for postage and the like.
The notion that a member of the House of Representatives needs to spend a 50c stamp on every one of their electors each year is quaint in this era, to put it politely, particularly with bulk mail, shared households, email and all the other methods of communication. The idea that it is reasonable to equate it to one stamp per person in your electorate is novel. Of course, if that were applied to the Senate then we would be getting probably a tenfold increase, but I am not suggesting that at all. However, there is no explanation at all of why the increase does not apply to the Senate; we have constituents as well. Certainly, I see myself as representing the entire state of Queensland but I am not in any way suggesting that I need the equivalent of a 50c stamp for every one of them each year. Nice as that might be for my own re-election, that is not what we are here for.
The continuous expansion of taxpayer funding for these sorts of entitlements is of concern. It is a balance, I realise that, and I realise that a lot of members of the public would be happy for politicians to have no entitlements whatsoever and have to walk to Canberra each time we needed to come to parliament. We are not suggesting that, and we do not seek to generate an unreasonable perception of the important work that parliamentarians do. Of course you need resources to communicate with your electorate; of course you need to be able to hear what their views are. Our simple view is that we already have plenty in that area. With regard to this communications allowance, I do not believe that it is justified to have such a large increase. Certainly I do not think the case has been made. That is the context of our opposition. It is part of a long history of Democrat action in this area. My colleague Senator Murray will also speak briefly on this motion. He has a strong record in relation to this, as have many Democrats, going back to my Queensland predecessor, Michael Macklin.
It should also be noted that the independent member for Calare, Mr Andren, whilst we are not acting in concert on this—we are acting independently—also indicated opposition to this in the House of Representatives but, due to the way things operate there, he was unable to bring it on for debate, which is yet one more example of why the Senate is important. As a member of the House of Representatives wanting to debate opposition to this allowance and this change, which directly advantages members of the House of Representatives, he was not even able to bring it on for debate and require people to state a view, take a vote on it and be held to account for it. It is another example, amongst many, of why the Senate is still so important and will continue to be important even once the government assumes a majority in this chamber after 1 July.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL ACT DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disapproval</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,31,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-21,"—What an outrageous proposal this is—a 60 per cent increase in the postal allowance for members of the House of Representatives to blitz their electorates in the run-up to an election, to the totally unfair disadvantage of any other contenders for those seats. This is a 60 per cent increase in the communications allowance. Each member of the House of Representatives would give up $44,000 annually, but the rollover provisions would allow MPs a postal blitz of up to $88,000 in the year of an election, on top of the $125,000 printing allowance that MPs, under the Howard government, have given to themselves in the House of Representatives.
This is a perversion of democracy. It is not just an affront to many taxpayers who want to see fairness in democracy but who are going to foot the bill for this move but an absolute perversion of democracy, where we should have not only one person, one vote and one value but one candidate, one opportunity and one equal campaign. This is dipping into the pockets of the Australian electorate to advantage, in the main, the big party candidates against all other comers. It should be thrown out. The opposition should be voting against it.
I have not got the permission of Peter Andren, the independent member for Calare in the House of Representatives, but I will read from his media release in which he responds to this proposal, which has effectively been blocked from debate in the other place because it requires government permission. Mr Andren gave notice on 16 June of a motion to disallow the government’s new postage and communications payouts that will cost the taxpayer an extra $2.4 million a year. He thought that the motion was likely to be debated this week but then found the government can prevent that happening. Mr Andren said:
This latest 60% increase in communications allowances—providing an average of $44,000 annually to each MP—is nothing more than a taxpayer-funded rort to benefit incumbent politicians and increase the party propaganda flowing from members’ offices.
He added:
The current allowance of between $27,500 and $30,800 is more than sufficient to cover the normal correspondence requirements of a member and for other services like newsletter mail-outs, letterbox drops, couriers, and designing and maintaining web pages.
Mr Andren said:
I am able to manage all my communications needs on about $20,000 a year and quarantine any election campaign mail-outs and other spending to my fully declared campaign accounts. The same should apply to all incumbent MPs.
The insidious feature of this communications allowance is that the unspent portion can be rolled over into subsequent years and spent right up until the day before an election day. It is nothing more than a taxpayer-funded slush fund for distribution of political propaganda.
Theoretically an MP will now be able to spend, say, $20,000 the year after an election, rollover $24,000 to cover the 2nd year and again rollover the entire $44,000 from year 2 to year 3 and have an $88,000 postal blitz fund for the election.
The allowance is supposed to be used for parliamentary or electorate business, but this is only an unenforceable guideline.
As with the recent increase in incumbent members’ printing allowances to $125,000, this communications increase is simply a taxpayer funded subsidy of the party machines.
It comes on top of free fixed phones, free mobiles, free car, free travel and the $40 million of public funding that was distributed to the three major parties after the last election.
Mr Andren went on to say:
As well the Auditor-General has twice reported the abuse of sitting MPs’ staff travel entitlements during election campaigns, which further entrenches the financial disadvantage faced by independent and smaller party candidates who might want to run for parliament.
The government will argue the new communications allowance is based on one 50 cent stamped letter per year to each constituent. However, a direct mail-out to every household costs about 10 cents a letter. Quite simply, this increase and the roll-over capacity is to provide for an election-year postal blitz.
Mr Andren said:
I call on all MPs and Senators from all parties to vote to disallow this regulation. The public are sick and tired of the continual ramping up of taxpayer subsidy of party politics, quite apart from the unfair advantage it gives incumbents over those who might run for public office with limited means.
What an outrage this is. I agree—and Senator Bartlett put it well—that we have to be careful that we do not get up and proclaim against reasonable allowances to members of parliament, but we are looking here at nothing short of the purloining of taxpayers’ money to advantage incumbent members of the House of Representatives against anybody else who takes them on in an election campaign. It is quite disgusting that that should happen.
Where is the good grace of the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz—who is going to get up and try to defend the indefensible in a moment—in offering to other candidates at elections the same sorts of postal and printing allowances that have developed over recent years, particularly under the Howard government, to advantage incumbents against everybody else? It is a disgraceful bias of campaign opportunities towards incumbent members against other members of the community and therefore it is a perversion of democracy.
Finally, let me say this: I have lost faith in the Remuneration Tribunal, which makes these decisions. These faceless people seem to be taking the part of the government and fostering its interests in particular time and again in regard to putting up politicians’ salaries ahead of the cost price index—and that has happened now five years in a row—and increasing these perks to astronomical figures, way out of kilter with what should be given to MPs to inform their electorates. After all, it is true that all of us as incumbents have a great advantage through the free media as it is against any other takers. To fund further letterbox drops to the community, whether the community likes it or not, through the postal and communications allowance in this way is dastardly.
The Remuneration Tribunal needs a good looking at. It needs a thorough investigation to see how it became such as stamp of government policy, how it tugs its forelock to this government’s wishes, how it has lost its independence and what reference it makes to the community in determining this sort of outrageous lift. Who put this request to the Remuneration Tribunal? It was the people to be advantaged by it. What was thought to be an independent and arms-length tribunal is nothing of the sort.
This is one of those things that I intend to continue to target to discover just why it is malfunctioning in the way it is, without reference to democratic propriety or the community norms that you would think a remuneration tribunal worth its salt would have as its reference point. Sure, it may be safe for the members of the Remuneration Tribunal. They may be getting good feedback. Undoubtedly they have been. But, as far as I can see, a broom needs to go right through that tribunal. We need somebody else there who is more community minded, democratically minded and fair minded.
When there is a check on the excessive and wrong-headed outcome of a tribunal like this, we find that the government can block it in the House of Representatives. That is what Mr Andren is saying has happened in the House of Representatives. An arcane provision, he says, means that the government can prevent this from being debated. It is being debated here in the Senate today. If the Labor Party were to join the Democrats, who brought forward this motion, and the Greens, we would see a proper outcome.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL ACT DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disapproval</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,31,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-06-21,"—I inform Senator Brown that this is not a proposition that we will be supporting. We have heard today the point made by the Democrats that they are not in the business of cheap politician bashing. We have heard from the Greens the opposite point of view. We have heard from the Democrats that they are not interested in the overstated stereotypes of ‘snouts in the trough’. We have heard exactly the opposite from the Greens. We have heard from the Democrats that their concern is not the existence of the communications allowance but the amount that is being provided. We heard that their concern was that it does not apply to senators. We heard from the Greens, on the other hand, that they are opposed to the existence of the allowance, particularly the rollover provisions, and the collusion that is alleged to exist in this chamber on these matters. It is quite apparent to me that the movers of this motion clearly do not agree amongst themselves about it. It suggests to me that, given it is a broadcast day, the motivation for this matter is providing that cheap political populism that we hear so often on these questions of the way in which politicians do their job.
I am also in the business of accountability and the appropriate use of entitlements. I think it is worth while that those issues are canvassed and debated. However, it cannot be honestly and seriously said that this is about propriety and integrity when the arguments are presented in a manner which is tailor-made to run out a populist position, irrespective of the way in which these entitlements are used. It does seem to me that there is a view in some quarters that we should not be enabling members of parliament to do their job properly. It is sometimes said that we should not actually pay people to do their work properly—that we should make sure that politics is conducted by the wealthy under circumstances where they are in the hands of those who are also wealthy.
It strikes me that it is important that there are appropriate mechanisms, however, for the determination of what those entitlements should be. That is why we are saying that this is not about us, the Labor Party, supporting the government on this question. We were not consulted about this. I found out about this, as everyone else did, when I received through my email the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. I was not at any point asked what our views were on these matters. So it is not a question of collusion at all. It is, however, a matter of principle that we have argued time and again for many years. These motions and in fact the whole question of entitlements should be determined by an independent body such as the Remuneration Tribunal and this is the circumstance that we find ourselves in here.
This is not about politicians making decisions about themselves, and it is not about the department in this particular case interpreting the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal. Both are matters that we are legitimately able to discuss and put views on. Senators can even, as we have in the past, support disallowance motions on these issues. It strikes me that the important issue here is not simply the scale of the allowance, which is a legitimate point for public discussion, but the manner in which the decisions were made by the Remuneration Tribunal. We support the principle of the independence of the tribunal and we support the proposition that these decisions should be made by an independent tribunal such as the Remuneration Tribunal.
We do not automatically oppose increases in entitlements. I am not going to be silly enough to argue that in the history of this parliament there have not been positions put by Labor governments for increases of entitlements. What we say, however, is that decisions on the questions of entitlements, including the question of members of parliament pay, should be determined by independent bodies, not by politicians, not by the parliament and certainly not by the government. They should be determined on the basis of an independent assessment.
The tribunal is subject to criticism from time to time, and rightly so. However, it is another matter entirely to suggest that that criticism should go to the question of disallowance of a regulation. That is why we will not be supporting the disallowance of the determination of the tribunal. We have been most reluctant to do so in the history of these matters, and we will not be supporting this motion.
There is a broader issue, and that is the question of incumbency. That is a matter that does need attention. It is quite clear that these measures support incumbents—there is no question that that is the case. But an equally important issue is whether or not people are able to communicate with their electorates. These arrangements advantage the government—there is no question about that—because the government has more members of parliament. However, that does not detract from the fundamental principle of the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal, and that is a position that we will be defending here today.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL ACT DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disapproval</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,31,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-06-21,"—I think Senator Carr is at his best when he agrees with the government, and I invite him to do so more often. The point that Senator Carr made—that this has been determined not by the government but by the Remuneration Tribunal—was the right one. I will go through the contributions that have been made. Suffice it to say that I agree with Senator Carr’s contribution.
It was interesting to hear Senator Bartlett. Senator Bartlett said that the Democrats believe in better accountability and oversight. We say that we support an independent umpire to take these matters out of the hands of parliamentarians. In fact, the Senate in 1990 expressly stated that determining the level of postage allowance should be a role for the Remuneration Tribunal. I also indicate in relation to Senator Brown’s contribution that the Greens, when the issue of who should determine parliamentary salaries arose in recent times, did not oppose a motion which determined that it ought to be the Remuneration Tribunal. You vote for or agree to the methodology but then you somehow want to weasel out if you disagree with the decision of the independent umpire.
Senator Bartlett told us that the Democrats do not jump on every issue and oppose it. I must say that I scratched my head about that. I wondered which ones the Democrats have not opposed. I scratched a bit further and then I remembered: the entitlement that gave Democrats staffers mobile phones. That was all of a sudden okay. And then there was the one where we increased the charter allowance of the Democrats leader by 33 per cent. That one was not disallowed. So we have a bit of a cherry-picking exercise here, with due respect to the Democrats.
However, I accept that they have a more tempered view on these issues than Senator Brown, whose contribution was quite ill considered. We heard all the usual hyperbole that is applied to issues such as whether or not we should wear jackets in this chamber and whether too many trees are being cut down. All the same adjectives that we hear time and time again were used, and I must say that they wear a bit thin. Everything is ‘outrageous’, everything is ‘an absolute perversion’, everything is ‘a rort’ or ‘an insidious feature’. We had all that terminology. I say to Senator Brown that if the parliamentary salary increase that he referred to is such a wrong decision and such a perversion I am sure he will be writing a cheque every month back to the Collector of Public Moneys. He would not want to be associated with or accept the benefits of such a perversion. But I do not think that the Collector of Public Moneys will be holding his or her breath. They will simply say, ‘Chances are Senator Brown will protest but then accept.’
Senator Brown also misled the Senate about the printing entitlement. He said that the Howard government had increased the printing entitlement to $125,000 per House of Representatives member. That is wrong, false, untrue. I suspect Senator Brown knew the facts, but—as is so often his wont—he got the old egg beater to them and tried to whip them up. Senators in this place would know that the printing entitlement had previously been uncapped. We had members of the other place spending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars on printing. It was the Howard government that brought in the cap. So to say that we somehow increased the entitlement to $125,000 is wrong. We capped it to stop any abuse. Yet again, Senator Brown cannot find it within himself to recognise that sort of contribution to public accountability by this government.
The worst attack of all was his attack on the Remuneration Tribunal. He talked about them being faceless people. It was a vicious, cowardly attack on people who cannot defend themselves. If he lacks faith in them, I am sure that every month the Collector of Public Moneys will get a reimbursement of Senator Brown’s salary.
In relation to this entitlement, I indicate that Senator Cook, in his last week in the parliament, will achieve something that he was advocating some 15 years ago. He made, I thought, a very good submission to the Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal at that time. He wrote a lengthy, and might I add, well-considered and well-constructed letter. In relation to the House of Representatives and Senate divide, he said:
Members of the lower house traditionally have a much closer relationship with the electorate than is the case with members of the upper house who represent their state as a single electorate. It is therefore not appropriate to base the entitlement for senators on the size of the constituency.
He made some very relevant points. Interestingly enough, in the letter he recites history. For those who want to use all the hyperbole under the sun, just listen to this. He said:
In the United States, members of the House of Representatives are able to send out six mass mailings each year to each postal patron within their congressional district.
In another example, Senator Cook pointed out that in Canada members of the House of Commons are able to send out four mass mailings each year and up to eight in an election year. In the United Kingdom, Senator Cook pointed out, members of the House of Commons are entitled to free postage for parliamentarians’ business within the country—in other words, it is absolutely unlimited. If we compare ourselves with like democracies, we see that this is not outrageous. This is not a perversion; it is a very modest request for one mail-out per annum to each elector. I do not think that is excessive.
Senator Brown talks about perversion and injustice and all the other hyperbole. I would be interested in Senator Murray’s view on the flat rate for every single House of Representatives seat. Can you explain to the people of Fraser, represented by Mr Bob McMullan, with 118,000 electors in his electorate, why, under the existing arrangement, he gets exactly the same postage entitlement as the Labor member for Lyons, with only 60,000 electors. With virtually twice as many constituents to serve, he gets exactly the same amount of postage. That is wrong.
I do not mind saying that I support what the Remuneration Tribunal did in general terms. The Remuneration Tribunal came to a determination that a fair, equitable and transparent approach would be a 50c stamp per constituent per annum. I think that is a robust, sensible and logical amount. When you make the comparison with our overseas counterparts in the United States congress and the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and in Canada, you can see that we are still very much underresourced in relation to postage entitlements. I think the Remuneration Tribunal has got it absolutely right. We as a government regret that, from time to time, people—and in this case especially the Greens—seek to make cheap political capital out of something which has been determined by an independent body. I simply plead with the Senate to accept the work of the independent Remuneration Tribunal and support its determination.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL ACT DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disapproval</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,31,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-21,"—Unless there are further speakers, I will sum up the debate. I thank the various speakers. What the debate has done is illuminate this topic. I want to start by celebrating the fact that there was a debate. The Senate has yet again shown up the House of Representatives, which, it seems to me, from reports in the Hansard and the information I have received, is afraid to air this matter. There was absolutely no sign of the opposition or the government in the Senate being at all afraid to debate the merits of the proposition. Quite frankly, the House of Representatives needs to get a different mind-set and deal with these things more maturely, as the Senate does.
The second point I make relates to freedom of speech. I am not one of those who get awfully precious when judges, courts, independent regulators or authorities are criticised, provided the criticism is balanced, fair and factual. I do not think that we, as a parliament or as a group of parliamentarians with the responsibilities we have, should ever knuckle down to the view that, because the Remuneration Tribunal is independent, it is right. I say in passing that I have no opinion on that matter, because it seems to me that it does its job honestly and as best it can. That does not prevent me or anybody else from having an opinion about whether it might have got something wrong. I think it is very important that we express that point.
The third point I want to make in summing up is an absolutely vital one which I was not aware of previously. Minister, you might be able to correct me—maybe it was ignorance on my part—but I understood the shadow minister, in addressing this topic, to have said that the Labor Party had absolutely no idea that this matter was being considered by the Remuneration Tribunal. They are the alternative government. They have a large number of seats. I do not recall my party being advised—maybe it was. I certainly do not recall the Senate being advised. There is an issue here which I would ask the minister to take note of: if the Remuneration Tribunal is to be independent and properly informed, it should be writing to and getting the opinions of as many political parties and interested bodies as possible. I formally request that the minister look at whether there has been some slip-up in communication, because I am sure we, for instance, would have liked to have made our point of view known on this in advance of the determination. It is very important that independent bodies in sensitive areas do not come to conclusions without the input that is necessary from the government, the opposition or other political parties. I think that is one great thing that has emerged from this debate.
The minister made some interesting points about Senator Cook’s feelings 15 years ago when he was a minister. All that proves is that incumbency invariably reflects a similar attitude to many things. Maybe Senator Cook has changed his opinion since then, and maybe he has not. However, the better point made by the minister was that we should take note of what other countries do. Countries around the world that share our interest in democracy have interesting things that we do not have in Australia, such as formal processes for appointments on merit, the prohibition of donations from corporations and unions, ethics commissioners for parliaments and enforceable codes of conduct. So I agree with the minister—there are many things that we could take note of from other countries.
I want to return to the substance of the Democrats’ feelings on this proposition we have put to the Senate, and right at the heart of it is the minister’s reminder that this area was deliberately taken out of the hands of the parliament and given to the Remuneration Tribunal because it had been abused in the past or the potential for abuse had been there in the past. That is why, incidentally, this motion asks that the determination be disapproved. The language is quite deliberate. It is the disapproval of a decision that was come to without, as far as I have understood the debate, the input that I would have thought valuable from, for instance, the opposition. However, I am reminded by the minister of what happened in 1990. I pulled out the Hansard for the House of Representatives for 8 November 1990. Mr Hawke, in answering a question, said:
First, I was asked to confirm that a postage allowance is made available on an unlimited basis to leaders of the major political parties. I confirm that.
Of course, it has been changed since that date. Then he said:
Secondly, I was asked the amount spent on postage by those leaders. I can inform the House that in 1989-90 Dr Hewson—who had not been in the position of Leader of the Opposition for a very long period—spent $3,000; Mr Peacock spent $5,100; the former leader of the Australian Democrats, Mrs Haines, spent $5,500; I spent $10,255, and Mr Charles Blunt spent $278,922.
That confirms that it is very important to hold to the principle that the Remuneration Tribunal should remain the watchful eye over all of this.
We Democrats are really arguing about quantum. The Australian Democrats support three things. Firstly, we support the idea that members and senators should have a communications allowance to be able to interact with constituents. They cannot carry out their official duties without it. We are unequivocal on that. Secondly, we support the existing level of the allowance, because we believe it has proved to be perfectly adequate for parliamentarians’ needs. I know for a fact that there are many parliamentarians who do not spend their total allocation every year. We simply cannot see that an increase, a quantum leap of this magnitude, is justified. We believe a communications entitlement of this quantum for members of the House of Representatives is unconscionable and indefensible. Thirdly, we strongly affirm our continued support for the Remuneration Tribunal. We believe it should be an independent body that conducts full consultation, and it should be appointed on merit.
Currently, members of parliament and senators have an entitlement which covers a range of communications, including postal services from Australia Post and other mail distribution services—including letterbox drops in the electorate, courier services and other commercial services for mail distribution—the internet and other electronic communications, and the establishment and maintenance of web sites. The entitlement is to be used for parliamentary or electorate business, excluding political party business. Each senator and member is presently entitled to spend an annual allowance on communications services. The amount is a maximum of $27,500 per annum for senators of all states and territories, $27,500 per annum for members whose electorates are less than 50,000 square kilometres, and $30,800 per annum for members whose electorates are 50,000 square kilometres or more. However, as of 1 July 2005, the communications allowance will no longer be based on the size of electorates with respect to House of Representatives members. With respect to the Senate, it will remain the same, whether you are from Tasmania or New South Wales. For members of the House of Representatives, it will now be based on the number of electors in each electorate, as at the last working day of March each year, and multiplied by 50c per elector. The relevant clause 10.4 now reads:
(a) members are entitled to a maximum annual allowance based on the number of enrolled voters as at the last working day in March each year within the electoral boundaries for the member’s electorate in place at the last general election, multiplied by fifty cents;
(b) senators are entitled to a maximum annual allowance of $27,500.
As senators’ entitlements have not changed—and rightly so, in my belief—I will limit my remarks to the members of the House of Representatives. According to calculations, the current maximum possible expenditure is an aggregate $4,171,200 per annum for all members of the House of Representatives. From 1 July 2005, the new maximum possible expenditure will go up to $6,606,413. This means an extra $2,435,213 per annum to be spent on postage, which is an increase of 58 per cent. An editorial in Canberra’s Sunday Times on 5 June described this as a $6.6 million rort. It stated:
... each party is using it to fund sophisticated and unaccountable political intelligence campaigns, as well as the means to create elaborate data bases on voters, and to target particular groups with letters, e-mail and nuisance telephone calls.
The problem for all those who advocate changing the system is that this kind of newspaper comment reflects community sentiment. Whilst I do not like—in fact, I strongly dislike and disapprove of it—the often mindless and pathetic pollie-bashing that goes on in this country, nevertheless at the base of it is a legitimate demand that the money that is spent by politicians should be not only accountable but also reasonable. Unless we can argue that it is reasonable, we undermine our campaign against those who are just driven by their hatred of the political process.
The really questionable feature of this communications allowance is that the unspent portion can be rolled over into subsequent years and the accumulated windfall spent in an election campaign. So it ends up being a communications allowance for re-election, not a communications allowance for interaction with constituents over a parliamentary term. As with the incumbent members’ printing allowances of $125,000, this communications allowance is being seen—that is, seen by the academics and journalists who cover this sort of thing and by the people who pay a professional interest to this—as being transformed, in large part, into a taxpayer funded subsidy of the political party and its candidates, and that is expressly contrary to the Remuneration Tribunal’s remit. It does not want it to be used for political party activity.
The Democrats have always opposed giving parliamentarians moneys in excess of what is reasonably necessary to do their jobs. Our judgment is that the proposed amount is excessive. We think the reasoning behind changes to the communications allowance is not very difficult to fathom, but it is very difficult to justify. The changes are not related to indexation, nor is there an increase in the number of constituents. The cost of communications is actually getting cheaper with new technologies and there is no change to the needs of members of parliament. We think that no plausible rationale has been put to the parliament which justifies the spending of this amount of money.
Another point I make is that the Remuneration Tribunal needs to do more to justify the decisions it makes. It needs to spell out more why it is making particular judgments. All of us demand that the Reserve Bank, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or the Auditor-General—name any figure of authority and substance—justify their decisions in the public interest. The Remuneration Tribunal should keep that principle in mind.
According to Parliamentary Library calculations, the Labor Party may benefit by an additional $997,769 per annum. But the big winner is the coalition: because it has more seats, it will benefit by an additional $1,392,949 per annum. We think that is excessive. It is quite clear that we do not have the numbers in this debate and that our disapproval is not shared by the majority in the Senate, but, in complete contrast to the House of Representatives, we appreciate that, yet again, senators have had the maturity and the ability to express their opinions on this.
In conclusion, the communications allowance was designed for members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to circulate meaningful and reasonable information on parliamentary business to their constituencies. That is a need, and the need for information remains very high. Where it is corrupted or seen to be corrupted into party political advertising or purely party political re-election money, we will have a serious community problem. We need to make sure that the sensitivity and accountability issues are exposed and that the quantum is always justified and reasonable.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL ACT DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disapproval</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,31,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-06-21,"—I present the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, entitled Unfair dismissal and small business employment, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This was, again, another inquiry by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee—not the legislation committee—into this government’s unfair dismissal law proposals. The aim of the inquiry was to enable the references committee to take a fresh look at the government’s unfair dismissal policy and, in particular, a reference from the Democrats to consider and analyse the government’s major claim that exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws will create 77,000 new jobs.
I say at the outset that this was the committee’s last opportunity to examine that issue before the government takes control of the Senate on 1 July and introduces further industrial relations reforms. Those reforms of course include radical changes to the federal unfair dismissal laws. In fact, during this inquiry when we were considering the exemption of small businesses with 20 employees or fewer, the government signalled its intention to increase that number, thereby exempting companies that employ more than 100 people. The committee was alarmed that, by doing that, up to four million workers in this country will have no remedy for unfair dismissal.
I have had a look at the government senators’ dissenting report—it is not a unanimous report, and we never expected it would be. Naturally, they reject the findings, but they say in the opening paragraph to their dissenting report:
The Government’s position is overwhelmingly supported by small business and by numerous surveys which show that small business employers are concerned about the impact of the unfair dismissal laws ...
They go on to suggest that perhaps the opposition’s stance shows the extent to which we have lost touch with the concerns of small business operators. I say at the outset that there was never any evidence—not one skerrick; not one substantive piece of evidence—presented to us in this inquiry which showed that the government’s claim that 77,000 jobs would be created if small business were exempt from the unfair dismissal laws could be backed up in any way, shape or form. In fact, witnesses before the committee totally discredited that figure of 77,000 jobs, and Dr Oslington was able to show us categorically that no such claim could ever be substantiated. So it makes you wonder who is in touch with reality here, if figures such as 77,000 can be just plucked out of the air by the government and bandied around on some basis of fact.
The committee’s examination of the evidence during the inquiry led us to seven main findings. The government’s unfair dismissal policy is based on an ideological position which has little relevance to the real problems that face small business. As I said, there is absolutely no empirical evidence or research to support the claim of 77,000 jobs being created in the small business sector. The government has categorically been unable to establish a causal link between unfair dismissal laws and small business employment. Evidence from the department and employer groups on this issue was unconvincing. The government’s claim is based on misinformation and wishful thinking, rather than on an objective appraisal of the facts or on any, might I say, qualitative or quantitative analysis of its claim.
The committee found that there is no international evidence to support the government’s policy. Evidence showed that the OECD has consistently ranked Australia as one of the countries with the least restrictive employment protection legislation. That means that Australia’s industrial relations system is employment friendly. New figures supplied by DEWR and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations demonstrate that federal unfair dismissal legislation is not the major issue facing small business that the government claims it to be. The relatively small number of unfair dismissal applications across federal and state jurisdictions does not represent a significant problem for the system—and those figures are included as an appendix to this report. The figures show that, under federal law, there has been a 52 per cent reduction in the number of unfair dismissal applications in 2003, compared with 1996 figures. That is mainly due to the tightening of unfair dismissal provisions under the Workplace Relations Act.
The committee also found that the government’s claim that federal unfair dismissal law retards employment is not borne out by the growth in small business employment. The committee noted that up to 700,000 small business jobs were created between 1992 and 2001, which coincided with the operation of federal unfair dismissal laws. Significantly, small business employment took a sharp downturn after the introduction of the GST—surprisingly!
The government’s misnamed ‘fair dismissal reform bill’ is in fact unfair, because its primary purpose is to enable employers to dismiss workers unfairly. The bill undermines the ‘fair go all round’ principle enshrined in the Workplace Relations Act. The opposition cannot support legislation which withdraws protection from workers, based solely on the size of the business in which they work.
The committee found that small business perceptions of unfair dismissal laws are often based on ignorance, fuelled by misinformation provided by employer groups and the government. There is an appalling ignorance out there of state and federal unfair dismissal laws among small business operators that should be addressed.
The government’s legislation is not an appropriate response to the problems facing small business. The committee heard that issues such as the profitability of businesses, taxation arrangements, GST compliance and general economic conditions figure more prominently and more often in small business surveys than the complaint of unfair dismissal laws.
Based on those findings, the committee recommends that the fair dismissal reform bill be rejected and that the government work with small business to improve and simplify procedures for unfair dismissal applications. The reforms to the unfair dismissal procedures that the committee recommends are listed on page 29 of the report, and there are about five. The committee suggests that the system be improved—that businesses be informed and educated about the system and that even the AIRC be allowed to order costs against applicants who pursue vexatious claims. So in fact the system can be simplified and can be made small business friendly so that costs for business are reduced.
The committee also recommended that no further changes to the unfair dismissal laws should occur until an independent review of government policy has been conducted by experts. So it is a report that actually throws to the wind the government’s claim that 77,000 jobs would be created if the unfair dismissal laws were endorsed. There is a recommendation that the fair dismissal reform bill be rejected. As I said, the committee made seven major findings and three recommendations.
In closing, I would like to compliment the committee staff on their work. In particular, I would like to compliment John Carter and David Sullivan, who helped significantly with the drafting of the report and assisted in enabling witnesses to present their case to the committee, and Dijana and Ruth, who we can always rely on to be there in the background supporting our work. I would also like to thank the witnesses, of course—they went to the trouble of actually writing to the committee and appearing before the committee in both Canberra and Melbourne.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,32,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee entitled Unfair dismissal and small business employment, which has just been tabled. I wish to take exception to the views and comments of the chair of our committee. Before doing so, I wish to thank the committee staff for their work and their assistance: John Carter, David Sullivan and their team. They have been professional and timely at all times during our inquiry.
Why are we standing here today discussing a further report into the Australian government’s proposed unfair dismissal legislation? Why are we actually standing here? The chair of our committee, Senator Trish Crossin, has called for a fresh look at the proposed unfair dismissal laws. I remind senators and members of the public that similar legislation has been introduced not less than 40 times into the Australian parliament.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—In fact, it has been introduced over 40 times; I think I am being told that it might have been 42 or 43 times now.
—41.
—Yes, 41 times. So the majority report and the chair express the view that they need a fresh look at it. I put to the Senate that it is not a fresh look they are looking for; they are in fact trying to clog up the system. They do not have anything new that they can present to the Senate in this report. There is nothing fresh. There is nothing new that we can learn from the majority report.
The government senators’ report is an affirmation of the government’s intent and the merit of the arguments of the unfair dismissal legislation. It is made clear in the government senators’ report that we as an Australian government have a fresh mandate in terms of this legislation which is being denied by the opposition parties. This was a references inquiry and yet the whole inquiry—dominated, of course, by the opposition senators—was dominated by references to the government’s proposed legislation: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal Reform) Bill 2004. Their first recommendation is that that bill be rejected, and yet this is a references inquiry. I put to the Senate that we were off on a wild goose chase.
We on this side of the chamber are the friends of small business. We have been since our inception and certainly since 1996. We now have 96 per cent of all businesses in the private sector, nearly 1.2 million businesses in total, and roughly 80 per cent of those are micro businesses, which employ fewer than five employees. It was undenied during our inquiry and in the public arena that unfair dismissal laws do affect small business confidence. Small business confidence in terms of employing people is dissipated as a result of the current unfair unfair dismissal laws, which were introduced by the Labor government under former Prime Minister Keating. Small businesses see it as a barrier to employment. They see it as an impediment to jobs growth.
The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce stated that, under the current unfair dismissal system, employers lack the confidence to engage additional employees. They said:
... rather than engaging additional employees, employers themselves are simply just working longer hours or family members are encouraged to work longer hours.
This is tough. It is tough for small businesses out there. They have their necks on the line. They are giving it a go and giving it their best shot. I understand that—I owned and operated my own small business for 13 years prior to entering the Senate in February 2002.
I can tell you that survey after survey of small businesses around this country have all said in one form or another that the unfair dismissal laws in this country are an impediment to small business growth. They were concerned about the current laws. The surveys are too numerous to mention all of them, but I will mention some of them. There was the Australian Business Ltd business priority survey of June 2004, the Sensis business index survey of August 2004, the ACCI pre-election survey of September 2004 and the Executive Connection survey of December 2004, and I refer specifically to the Australian Industry Group survey of some 700 small and medium sized companies conducted in May 2005. The details are set out in our report.
Another survey that is demonstrative of the cost of the current unfair dismissal laws was from the Restaurant and Catering Association, which found that 38 per cent of owners had defended an unfair dismissal claim at an average cost to the employer of 63 hours of their time and $3,675 in legal costs. That estimate is translated into $18.2 million in direct costs and $15.5 million in indirect costs to the industry as a whole. These are microbusinesses that have their neck on the line trying to make a go of it. They are restaurants; they are cafes; they are catering companies. They are small and micro businesses doing the best for their country, for themselves and for their employees. That is why we need this legislation—that is, to cut out that cost.
There has been a reference to the study by the Melbourne institute. This is not a government report; this is a study by the Melbourne institute, which referred to the jobs growth of 77,000 and referred to the $1.3 billion cut in red-tape costs that would benefit the Australian economy as well. These are not our figures; these are figures from the Melbourne institute that the chair has been referring to. Indeed, it was a point of discussion in the Senate inquiry, and rightfully so. It remains to be seen exactly how that will pan out in the months and days ahead when we hope this legislation will be passed.
The final thing I want to refer to before concluding is the merit of a single industrial relations system. This is with regard to the Senate small business report of 2002. We recommended the single industrial relations system. We have recommended it again in this report. The government say that this is the way to go to ensure security, to ensure consistency and to ensure simplicity across the system and across states. This is exactly what we are doing with the unfair dismissal legislation. That will be of benefit. Yes, there has been a rise in unfair dismissal cases in state jurisdictions but there has been a drop of 52-odd per cent at the federal jurisdictional level. At the moment, the federal bodies can cherry pick the industrial jurisdiction they operate in; they can cherry pick the state that they are operating in. That is not the way to go. We want consistent and simple laws across the nation.
Maintaining six separate industrial jurisdictions is not only inefficient but also excessively complex and costly for small business. In that regard, I commend the Hon. Senator Andrew Murray, whom I know has a similar view on that aspect of a single jurisdiction and the merits of not having six separate industrial jurisdictions. I think the arguments have been referred to many times before in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. I think passing the legislation has been attempted 41 times. The legislation is for the benefit of small businesses, for the benefit of jobs growth and for the benefit of the Australian economy. What better gift can you give Australian families than jobs growth, productivity and those benefits that flow through in that regard?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,32,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-21,"—On 7 December 2004 I moved a motion to establish this Senate inquiry into unfair dismissal. The Unfair dismissal and small business employment report tabled today is the end result of that motion. I moved the motion because I knew that, come 1 July, the government will be able to pass a law that will enable employers to sack employees unfairly—that is right: you can soon be sacked unfairly. The coalition have been trying to dress up this loss of employee protection as a job-creating measure, and I wanted to expose the complete lack of evidence to support that proposition. Not that that will change their minds, but at least it exposes their policy as more an affirmation of their age-old belief that employers should be able to hire and fire at will—the good old master-servant mentality.
The theory is that the public good of job creation justifies the private harm of reducing employee protections. That theory has been unproven. The advocacy is assisted by a propaganda mudslide of horror stories, urban myths and deceptions. Experiences under lax state laws are seamlessly transferred to become experiences under rigorous federal laws. Historical experiences predating significant improvements in the law are regaled as current practice. Sensible acceptance of liability and a negotiated outcome are characterised as extortionate go-away money. Employers gaily tell the gullible that you cannot even fire workers for stealing.
The coalition variously claims that exempting small business from federal unfair dismissal laws would create between 50,000 and 77,000 jobs. Endless repetition does not make something true, so what evidence might we rely on? The aim of this inquiry was to dispel these myths. I also remind the Senate that I remember the very first bill that the government produced in this area. It was not designed for anything other than to create a double dissolution trigger.
With regard to this report, the submissions received were mainly from unions, peak industry groups and academic researchers. Public hearings were held in Melbourne and Canberra. On 17 March, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal Reform) Bill 2004 was also referred to this committee. Then lo and behold on 1 June the government announced that it plans to lift its proposed exemption from unfair dismissal laws from employers with fewer than 20 employees to employers with fewer than 100 employees. I can guarantee that its next step will be to take it out of big business as well.
In one sense, the greater discrimination does not matter. Either you accept the idea that some employees should have fewer rights than others or you do not. Whatever the line, it is arbitrary. As this report states, as far back as 1998 the Democrats pointed out that the proposed exemption introduces into the system considerable unfairness by upsetting the ‘fair go all round’ principle embedded in the Workplace Relations Act. The report also states:
Drawing on the latest empirical findings from academic research and the views of other stakeholders presented to this inquiry, the committee finds that there is no evidence from Australia or overseas to support the Government’s claim.
Most of the evidence to this inquiry was critical, and at times scathing, of the Government’s approach to unfair dismissal policy.
A research team said of the key piece of so-called research that the government has been trotting out to support their claims of 77,000 jobs growth:
It seems incredible that a government should rely on such minimal research and crudely simplistic job growth reasoning to justify such a significant change to employment in the small business sector.
Just because it is the Melbourne institute, it does not mean that every piece of work it ever does passes the test of quality work—and this one did not.
I want to summarise some of the points made in this report that discredit the government’s position on unfair dismissal reform. First, OECD studies consistently ranked Australia as one of the countries with the least restrictive employment protection legislation. You only have to look at their official reports to see that that is true. In other words, we are not resistant to creating jobs and our employment protection legislation is minimalist. Second, in the 2001 case of Hamzy v Tricon Restaurants International trading as KFC, the expert witness for the federal government, Professor Mark Wooden, agreed with the statement ‘the existence or non-existence of unfair dismissal legislation has very little to with the growth of employment’ and that it is ‘dictated by economic factors’.
Third, empirical studies are inconclusive regarding the effect of unfair dismissal laws on aggregate employment and unemployment, and evidence of a link between such laws and unemployment rates does not automatically convert to an argument that relaxing the laws will result in higher employment levels. Fourth, employment figures for small business during the operation of unfair state and federal dismissal laws contradict the government’s position. Not only did overall employment grow by 1.2 million jobs between 1996 and 2003; total unfair dismissal applications fell from 2.55 applications per thousand employed to 1.60. The trend continues, with jobs growth to 2005 now reaching 1.6 million. The problem has been diminishing rapidly over the very period that government hysteria on the issue has been escalating.
Fifth, in less than a decade federal unfair dismissals have halved while state unfair dismissals have increased by one-quarter under their less rigorous laws. Under the coalition theory, the fall in unfair dismissal applications should have increased employment in workplaces covered by federal law and the rise in unfair dismissal applications should have decreased employment in workplaces covered by state law. Of course it did no such thing. The majority of small business employees fall under state not federal law. There are real problems with state unfair dismissal regimes. A number of these are amenable to rorts and need tightening up along federal lines. Victoria is under federal law already.
Getting rid of five state unfair dismissal regimes and transferring them across to the federal jurisdiction would probably also halve the number of state applications. Such reforms would mean a likely reduction to 11,000 to 12,000 unfair dismissal applications nationally a year, of which between 3,000 and 4,000 would be small business employees. That is out of 10 million employees. With these figures it hardly seems fair or necessary to take away the unfair dismissal protection of small and medium business employees. There is a case for more reform—the committee report clearly says that—but there is not a case for eliminating rights. Sixth, the argument that the small business perception that unfair dismissal laws prevent them from employing people has become a reality, and that therefore legislation is required to deal with the problem, was considered by most witnesses to be a farce. The level of ignorance of unfair dismissal laws by small business employers was identified by witnesses as a major area of concern.
A CPA small business survey in 2002 found that 30 per cent of small business operators believed employers always lose unfair dismissal claims—wrong; 28 per cent think they cannot dismiss staff if their business is struggling—wrong; and 27 per cent believe they cannot dismiss staff who are stealing from the business—wrong. If government had only put half the energy into advising these people of the reality that they have put into vilifying these protections, we would not have such a misinformed outfit out there. In addition, evidence also showed that neither employers nor employees are aware of the differences between unfair dismissal and unlawful termination laws, and it is likely that many have not even heard of unlawful termination laws. Addressing the underlying problem of ignorance and misinformation was considered by many witnesses as again more appropriate than eliminating rights.
As the report concludes, if the case for ending essential employment rights rests on large-scale job creation, you will search in vain for convincing empirical data. But the last two points clearly indicate that there are easier and more beneficial ways to change the attitudes of small business towards the unfair dismissal laws without taking away the rights of employees. I would like to thank the committee, the secretariat, the submitters and the witnesses for their contribution. I commend this report to the Senate and to all those who are more interested in the facts than the rhetoric.

Evidence showed that the OECD has consistently ranked Australia as one of the countries with the least restrictive employment protection legislation. That means that Australia’s industrial relations system is employment friendly. New figures supplied by DEWR and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations demonstrate that federal unfair dismissal legislation is not the major issue facing small business that the government claims it to be. The relatively small number of unfair dismissal applications across federal and state jurisdictions does not represent a significant problem for the system—and those figures are included as an appendix to this report. The figures show that, under federal law, there has been a 52 per cent reduction in the number of unfair dismissal applications in 2003, compared with 1996 figures. That is mainly due to the tightening of unfair dismissal provisions under the Workplace Relations Act.
The committee also found that the government’s claim that federal unfair dismissal law retards employment is not borne out by the growth in small business employment. The committee noted that up to 700,000 small business jobs were created between 1992 and 2001, which coincided with the operation of federal unfair dismissal laws. Significantly, small business employment took a sharp downturn after the introduction of the GST—surprisingly!
The government’s misnamed ‘fair dismissal reform bill’ is in fact unfair, because its primary purpose is to enable employers to dismiss workers unfairly. The bill undermines the ‘fair go all round’ principle enshrined in the Workplace Relations Act. The opposition cannot support legislation which withdraws protection from workers, based solely on the size of the business in which they work.
The committee found that small business perceptions of unfair dismissal laws are often based on ignorance, fuelled by misinformation provided by employer groups and the government. There is an appalling ignorance out there of state and federal unfair dismissal laws among small business operators that should be addressed.
The government’s legislation is not an appropriate response to the problems facing small business. The committee heard that issues such as the profitability of businesses, taxation arrangements, GST compliance and general economic conditions figure more prominently and more often in small business surveys than the complaint of unfair dismissal laws.
Based on those findings, the committee recommends that the fair dismissal reform bill be rejected and that the government work with small business to improve and simplify procedures for unfair dismissal applications. The reforms to the unfair dismissal procedures that the committee recommends are listed on page 29 of the report, and there are about five. The committee suggests that the system be improved—that businesses be informed and educated about the system and that even the AIRC be allowed to order costs against applicants who pursue vexatious claims. So in fact the system can be simplified and can be made small business friendly so that costs for business are reduced.
The committee also recommended that no further changes to the unfair dismissal laws should occur until an independent review of government policy has been conducted by experts. So it is a report that actually throws to the wind the government’s claim that 77,000 jobs would be created if the unfair dismissal laws were endorsed. There is a recommendation that the fair dismissal reform bill be rejected. As I said, the committee made seven major findings and three recommendations.
In closing, I would like to compliment the committee staff on their work. In particular, I would like to compliment John Carter and David Sullivan, who helped significantly with the drafting of the report and assisted in enabling witnesses to present their case to the committee, and Dijana and Ruth, who we can always rely on to be there in the background supporting our work. I would also like to thank the witnesses, of course—they went to the trouble of actually writing to the committee and appearing before the committee in both Canberra and Melbourne.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,32,2
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee entitled Unfair dismissal and small business employment, which has just been tabled. I wish to take exception to the views and comments of the chair of our committee. Before doing so, I wish to thank the committee staff for their work and their assistance: John Carter, David Sullivan and their team. They have been professional and timely at all times during our inquiry.
Why are we standing here today discussing a further report into the Australian government’s proposed unfair dismissal legislation? Why are we actually standing here? The chair of our committee, Senator Trish Crossin, has called for a fresh look at the proposed unfair dismissal laws. I remind senators and members of the public that similar legislation has been introduced not less than 40 times into the Australian parliament.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—In fact, it has been introduced over 40 times; I think I am being told that it might have been 42 or 43 times now.
—41.
—Yes, 41 times. So the majority report and the chair express the view that they need a fresh look at it. I put to the Senate that it is not a fresh look they are looking for; they are in fact trying to clog up the system. They do not have anything new that they can present to the Senate in this report. There is nothing fresh. There is nothing new that we can learn from the majority report.
The government senators’ report is an affirmation of the government’s intent and the merit of the arguments of the unfair dismissal legislation. It is made clear in the government senators’ report that we as an Australian government have a fresh mandate in terms of this legislation which is being denied by the opposition parties. This was a references inquiry and yet the whole inquiry—dominated, of course, by the opposition senators—was dominated by references to the government’s proposed legislation: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal Reform) Bill 2004. Their first recommendation is that that bill be rejected, and yet this is a references inquiry. I put to the Senate that we were off on a wild goose chase.
We on this side of the chamber are the friends of small business. We have been since our inception and certainly since 1996. We now have 96 per cent of all businesses in the private sector, nearly 1.2 million businesses in total, and roughly 80 per cent of those are micro businesses, which employ fewer than five employees. It was undenied during our inquiry and in the public arena that unfair dismissal laws do affect small business confidence. Small business confidence in terms of employing people is dissipated as a result of the current unfair unfair dismissal laws, which were introduced by the Labor government under former Prime Minister Keating. Small businesses see it as a barrier to employment. They see it as an impediment to jobs growth.
The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce stated that, under the current unfair dismissal system, employers lack the confidence to engage additional employees. They said:
... rather than engaging additional employees, employers themselves are simply just working longer hours or family members are encouraged to work longer hours.
This is tough. It is tough for small businesses out there. They have their necks on the line. They are giving it a go and giving it their best shot. I understand that—I owned and operated my own small business for 13 years prior to entering the Senate in February 2002.
I can tell you that survey after survey of small businesses around this country have all said in one form or another that the unfair dismissal laws in this country are an impediment to small business growth. They were concerned about the current laws. The surveys are too numerous to mention all of them, but I will mention some of them. There was the Australian Business Ltd business priority survey of June 2004, the Sensis business index survey of August 2004, the ACCI pre-election survey of September 2004 and the Executive Connection survey of December 2004, and I refer specifically to the Australian Industry Group survey of some 700 small and medium sized companies conducted in May 2005. The details are set out in our report.
Another survey that is demonstrative of the cost of the current unfair dismissal laws was from the Restaurant and Catering Association, which found that 38 per cent of owners had defended an unfair dismissal claim at an average cost to the employer of 63 hours of their time and $3,675 in legal costs. That estimate is translated into $18.2 million in direct costs and $15.5 million in indirect costs to the industry as a whole. These are microbusinesses that have their neck on the line trying to make a go of it. They are restaurants; they are cafes; they are catering companies. They are small and micro businesses doing the best for their country, for themselves and for their employees. That is why we need this legislation—that is, to cut out that cost.
There has been a reference to the study by the Melbourne institute. This is not a government report; this is a study by the Melbourne institute, which referred to the jobs growth of 77,000 and referred to the $1.3 billion cut in red-tape costs that would benefit the Australian economy as well. These are not our figures; these are figures from the Melbourne institute that the chair has been referring to. Indeed, it was a point of discussion in the Senate inquiry, and rightfully so. It remains to be seen exactly how that will pan out in the months and days ahead when we hope this legislation will be passed.
The final thing I want to refer to before concluding is the merit of a single industrial relations system. This is with regard to the Senate small business report of 2002. We recommended the single industrial relations system. We have recommended it again in this report. The government say that this is the way to go to ensure security, to ensure consistency and to ensure simplicity across the system and across states. This is exactly what we are doing with the unfair dismissal legislation. That will be of benefit. Yes, there has been a rise in unfair dismissal cases in state jurisdictions but there has been a drop of 52-odd per cent at the federal jurisdictional level. At the moment, the federal bodies can cherry pick the industrial jurisdiction they operate in; they can cherry pick the state that they are operating in. That is not the way to go. We want consistent and simple laws across the nation.
Maintaining six separate industrial jurisdictions is not only inefficient but also excessively complex and costly for small business. In that regard, I commend the Hon. Senator Andrew Murray, whom I know has a similar view on that aspect of a single jurisdiction and the merits of not having six separate industrial jurisdictions. I think the arguments have been referred to many times before in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. I think passing the legislation has been attempted 41 times. The legislation is for the benefit of small businesses, for the benefit of jobs growth and for the benefit of the Australian economy. What better gift can you give Australian families than jobs growth, productivity and those benefits that flow through in that regard?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,32,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-21,"—On 7 December 2004 I moved a motion to establish this Senate inquiry into unfair dismissal. The Unfair dismissal and small business employment report tabled today is the end result of that motion. I moved the motion because I knew that, come 1 July, the government will be able to pass a law that will enable employers to sack employees unfairly—that is right: you can soon be sacked unfairly. The coalition have been trying to dress up this loss of employee protection as a job-creating measure, and I wanted to expose the complete lack of evidence to support that proposition. Not that that will change their minds, but at least it exposes their policy as more an affirmation of their age-old belief that employers should be able to hire and fire at will—the good old master-servant mentality.
The theory is that the public good of job creation justifies the private harm of reducing employee protections. That theory has been unproven. The advocacy is assisted by a propaganda mudslide of horror stories, urban myths and deceptions. Experiences under lax state laws are seamlessly transferred to become experiences under rigorous federal laws. Historical experiences predating significant improvements in the law are regaled as current practice. Sensible acceptance of liability and a negotiated outcome are characterised as extortionate go-away money. Employers gaily tell the gullible that you cannot even fire workers for stealing.
The coalition variously claims that exempting small business from federal unfair dismissal laws would create between 50,000 and 77,000 jobs. Endless repetition does not make something true, so what evidence might we rely on? The aim of this inquiry was to dispel these myths. I also remind the Senate that I remember the very first bill that the government produced in this area. It was not designed for anything other than to create a double dissolution trigger.
With regard to this report, the submissions received were mainly from unions, peak industry groups and academic researchers. Public hearings were held in Melbourne and Canberra. On 17 March, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal Reform) Bill 2004 was also referred to this committee. Then lo and behold on 1 June the government announced that it plans to lift its proposed exemption from unfair dismissal laws from employers with fewer than 20 employees to employers with fewer than 100 employees. I can guarantee that its next step will be to take it out of big business as well.
In one sense, the greater discrimination does not matter. Either you accept the idea that some employees should have fewer rights than others or you do not. Whatever the line, it is arbitrary. As this report states, as far back as 1998 the Democrats pointed out that the proposed exemption introduces into the system considerable unfairness by upsetting the ‘fair go all round’ principle embedded in the Workplace Relations Act. The report also states:
Drawing on the latest empirical findings from academic research and the views of other stakeholders presented to this inquiry, the committee finds that there is no evidence from Australia or overseas to support the Government’s claim.
Most of the evidence to this inquiry was critical, and at times scathing, of the Government’s approach to unfair dismissal policy.
A research team said of the key piece of so-called research that the government has been trotting out to support their claims of 77,000 jobs growth:
It seems incredible that a government should rely on such minimal research and crudely simplistic job growth reasoning to justify such a significant change to employment in the small business sector.
Just because it is the Melbourne institute, it does not mean that every piece of work it ever does passes the test of quality work—and this one did not.
I want to summarise some of the points made in this report that discredit the government’s position on unfair dismissal reform. First, OECD studies consistently ranked Australia as one of the countries with the least restrictive employment protection legislation. You only have to look at their official reports to see that that is true. In other words, we are not resistant to creating jobs and our employment protection legislation is minimalist. Second, in the 2001 case of Hamzy v Tricon Restaurants International trading as KFC, the expert witness for the federal government, Professor Mark Wooden, agreed with the statement ‘the existence or non-existence of unfair dismissal legislation has very little to with the growth of employment’ and that it is ‘dictated by economic factors’.
Third, empirical studies are inconclusive regarding the effect of unfair dismissal laws on aggregate employment and unemployment, and evidence of a link between such laws and unemployment rates does not automatically convert to an argument that relaxing the laws will result in higher employment levels. Fourth, employment figures for small business during the operation of unfair state and federal dismissal laws contradict the government’s position. Not only did overall employment grow by 1.2 million jobs between 1996 and 2003; total unfair dismissal applications fell from 2.55 applications per thousand employed to 1.60. The trend continues, with jobs growth to 2005 now reaching 1.6 million. The problem has been diminishing rapidly over the very period that government hysteria on the issue has been escalating.
Fifth, in less than a decade federal unfair dismissals have halved while state unfair dismissals have increased by one-quarter under their less rigorous laws. Under the coalition theory, the fall in unfair dismissal applications should have increased employment in workplaces covered by federal law and the rise in unfair dismissal applications should have decreased employment in workplaces covered by state law. Of course it did no such thing. The majority of small business employees fall under state not federal law. There are real problems with state unfair dismissal regimes. A number of these are amenable to rorts and need tightening up along federal lines. Victoria is under federal law already.
Getting rid of five state unfair dismissal regimes and transferring them across to the federal jurisdiction would probably also halve the number of state applications. Such reforms would mean a likely reduction to 11,000 to 12,000 unfair dismissal applications nationally a year, of which between 3,000 and 4,000 would be small business employees. That is out of 10 million employees. With these figures it hardly seems fair or necessary to take away the unfair dismissal protection of small and medium business employees. There is a case for more reform—the committee report clearly says that—but there is not a case for eliminating rights. Sixth, the argument that the small business perception that unfair dismissal laws prevent them from employing people has become a reality, and that therefore legislation is required to deal with the problem, was considered by most witnesses to be a farce. The level of ignorance of unfair dismissal laws by small business employers was identified by witnesses as a major area of concern.
A CPA small business survey in 2002 found that 30 per cent of small business operators believed employers always lose unfair dismissal claims—wrong; 28 per cent think they cannot dismiss staff if their business is struggling—wrong; and 27 per cent believe they cannot dismiss staff who are stealing from the business—wrong. If government had only put half the energy into advising these people of the reality that they have put into vilifying these protections, we would not have such a misinformed outfit out there. In addition, evidence also showed that neither employers nor employees are aware of the differences between unfair dismissal and unlawful termination laws, and it is likely that many have not even heard of unlawful termination laws. Addressing the underlying problem of ignorance and misinformation was considered by many witnesses as again more appropriate than eliminating rights.
As the report concludes, if the case for ending essential employment rights rests on large-scale job creation, you will search in vain for convincing empirical data. But the last two points clearly indicate that there are easier and more beneficial ways to change the attitudes of small business towards the unfair dismissal laws without taking away the rights of employees. I would like to thank the committee, the secretariat, the submitters and the witnesses for their contribution. I commend this report to the Senate and to all those who are more interested in the facts than the rhetoric.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-06-21,"—I present the 122nd report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Parliamentary privilege—unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings, together with a volume of submissions and documents and the Hansard record of committee proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion relating to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate adopt the recommendation at paragraph 3.60 of the 122nd report of the Committee of Privileges.
This report results from a reference which the committee sought and received from the Senate on 16 March 2005 dealing with the unauthorised disclosure of parliamentary committee proceedings. As explained in debate on the motion to refer the matter, the committee had been increasingly troubled by a succession of matters referred to it involving unauthorised disclosure to, and publication by, the media of draft reports. The primary question for the committee was, given the rules governing such disclosure were becoming increasingly unenforceable, whether it should consider recommending that they be modified or changed or that their application be tightened to ensure fulfilment of the Senate’s duty to protect persons giving information, often in confidence, to its committees and persons who might be adversely affected by a committee’s inquiry. In recent times it has been relatively easy for the media to trivialise what can be matters of great importance by deriding attempts by parliamentary committees to protect the integrity of their proceedings.
Because the Committee of Privileges was considering the possibility of recommending far-reaching changes to parliamentary privilege provisions, it sought advice from a wide range of legislatures within Australia and throughout the world. It also received helpful submissions from the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives; three other Australian presiding officers; the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, writing as a former member of the Privileges Committee; Senator Bartlett; and Senate and joint committees. The Clerk of the Senate, a committee secretary and the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet also assisted the committee. Most major media outlets made submissions to the committee.
Briefly, the committee has decided it must take special steps to ensure the protection of evidence given in camera to committees. In order to distinguish this potential contempt from all other cases of unauthorised disclosure, it proposes that in camera evidence be placed in a category which will, after referral to the Committee of Privileges, in effect constitute a strict liability offence. All other cases of unauthorised disclosure may be considered by committees with the assistance of the Committee of Privileges, in accordance with a guideline proposed by the Clerk of the Senate in his submission.
The report discusses in detail the reasons for the committee’s conclusions. The recommendation which the committee asks the Senate to adopt involves a reference to the Procedure Committee to determine whether any changes to the rules are required to give effect to the Privileges Committee’s proposals. This reflects the committee’s concern that it not upset the delicate balance between the current provisions relating to unauthorised disclosure.
As this will be the last report of the Committee of Privileges to be presented while Anne Lynch is secretary of the committee, I wanted to take this opportunity to place on record Anne’s extraordinary service as committee secretary. An avid reader of Privileges Committee reports would search unsuccessfully to find Anne’s name in our reports; her name is not there. It has also generally been the tradition with the Privileges Committee for the chair, when presenting reports on behalf of the committee, not to mention the role of the committee’s staff. The main reason for this is Anne herself and her strongly held view that the committee and its membership have ownership of the report. Today, Anne, I will break that tradition because your service warrants recognition in this chamber.
On 8 July Anne will formally retire after continuous service of 32 years, six months and one day in the Department of the Senate. Since 19 May 1988 she has been our Deputy Clerk, and as Secretary of the Committee of Privileges Anne’s service has been remarkable. Anne’s first association with the Privileges Committee occurred in 1975, when she acted as adviser and research officer when the committee carried out its very complex and contentious inquiry into the loans affair and the Whitlam government’s claim of Crown privilege. This report is our 122nd. As secretary, Anne Lynch has drafted 109 of those 122 reports. It has been a fantastic effort. To give you an idea of the volume of material, if you measure the committee’s reports with a ruler, they run to 4.1 linear metres. Anne has developed an international reputation as an expert on parliamentary privilege. The committee, in no small part thanks to Anne, is respected around the parliamentary world. Her writings on parliamentary matters and her papers at conferences, particularly presiding officers and clerks conferences, are very widely admired.
I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the wonderful assistance Anne has received from June Nelson, who is also in the chamber and who has provided administrative support to Anne and the committee for the most recent 68 consecutive reports of the committee. As I said on Monday night at a small dinner the committee held to thank Anne for her service, an even more amazing achievement of June’s is that she can decipher Anne’s writing. But today is an opportunity to say a brief but sincere thankyou to Anne. Our committee, as well as every senator in this chamber, is delighted, Anne, that you are retiring from the Senate on your own terms and restored to full health after your recent serious health scare. Anne, we wish you a long and happy retirement and we thank you for your outstanding service so very well done.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,35,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-06-21,"—I would like to endorse the comments of Senator Faulkner. This is a most significant report. It deals with a very important issue that has been troubling the Senate for a long time—that is, of course, the unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings. I have to say that it was most disturbing to learn throughout the committee inquiry we held that the media feared the contempt of court issues far more than they ever feared a possible contempt of the Senate. I think that is a sad reflection on the way in which the media treat the parliament today. I hope that they will seriously consider the contents of this report, because it has been a longstanding problem and one that the Senate has sought to rectify, though unsuccessfully, over so long a time.
I would like to endorse the comments that Senator Faulkner just made about the Deputy Clerk of the Senate and secretary of the committee, Anne Lynch. She has been an absolute stalwart for the committee for all of the years that I have served on it, as has June Nelson. It has been the most remarkable committee on which to work. Senator Ray was the committee chairman prior to Senator Faulkner. I also say thank you to Senator Ray and to Senator Faulkner, because I too am retiring soon. They have been fantastic chairmen of this committee. The work that Anne has done to help us and to make sure that we are always in full knowledge of everything that is happening and that could possibly happen has been absolutely exemplary. Senator Faulkner mentioned Anne’s international reputation on matters to do with privilege; that is something that we could only ever dream of as being part of our own careers. So to Anne I say: congratulations on your wonderful service to the Senate and also on your wonderful service to the Committee of Privileges.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,35,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2005-06-21,"—In the normal course of events this report will come up, I think, in general business on the first sitting Thursday in August. I might leave my substantive comments until then other than to say that, of the 122 Privileges Committee reports brought down in this chamber, I rate this one as the most important, as the most dramatic and as having the longest term effects. I commend it to senators to read.
I would like to put on record my gratitude, first of all, to the deputy chair of the Privileges Committee, Senator Knowles. We have actually served almost nine years on this committee together. We have produced about 68 unanimous reports, and I think that says it all. It is also a committee where there was a fair bit of respect and friendship. Every now and then Senator Knowles and I would break ranks down here and exchange a few courtesies across the chamber. Occasionally, both of us would go a little too far and square off at the Privileges Committee. But always Senator Knowles was on the ball on all these issues and was part of engendering that cooperative spirit that exists on that committee. I do not believe all parliamentary committees should be sunshine and light. I believe in adversarial politics, but not in everything. When it comes to parliamentary privilege and a few other issues it is nice to have a committee that cooperates and that goes on the merits of the issues. So I say to the deputy chair: thank you for your efforts over the years; they have been much appreciated.
I will turn now to the real boss of the Privileges Committee: Anne Lynch. People know I like to travel a bit. I was attending a CPA conference in Bangladesh and it was amazing how many Commonwealth parliamentary representatives asked about the Senate Privileges Committee. It has a worldwide reputation for excellence. Because we have had such a turnover of senators on the committee I had to ask: what is the common factor here? It turns out that the common factor is the secretary of our committee. There was never a report not written, never a piece of correspondence not dealt with appropriately and never a judge allowed to get away with a silly comment on privilege without Anne Lynch drawing it to our attention. So I would like to place on the record everybody’s appreciation of her enormous work. It was not without fault: every now and then I would accuse the Deputy Clerk of letting in a Lynchism, which was always to do with colourful or evocative language that we more cautious senators would occasionally want to moderate. But every one of those reports is a report of excellence.
It would be nice for us to take the credit. We had a minor role in it. At times, we issued some guidance, but the driving force has to be admitted: on this occasion it was the secretary of the committee. It was not like some committees, where a secretary simply dominates and takes over. That was never the case with the Privileges Committee. It has always been a partnership between the secretariat and those who are on the committee. I have watched Anne in the chamber over the last 24 years, although she was here long before me. She is pleasant to all senators, treats them all as equals and is always nonpartisan in her attitudes in this place. I know that in retirement—we know that Anne will stay extremely active—whatever she does she will do well. The one thing that I hope she learns to do better than she currently does is emails—she is at about my level—because until recently she could only hit the return button, not the send. But Anne has now conquered that, so she will stay in touch with us all with emails I am sure.
Lastly, I make this promise. I do not make many promises; Senator Kemp might be able to assist to me. I have to reveal that the deputy clerk has never been to the MCG to watch a Collingwood-Carlton match, and I think Senator Kemp and I will facilitate that in the near future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Our committee, as well as every senator in this chamber, is delighted, Anne, that you are retiring from the Senate on your own terms and restored to full health after your recent serious health scare. Anne, we wish you a long and happy retirement and we thank you for your outstanding service so very well done.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,35,2
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-06-21,"—I would like to endorse the comments of Senator Faulkner. This is a most significant report. It deals with a very important issue that has been troubling the Senate for a long time—that is, of course, the unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings. I have to say that it was most disturbing to learn throughout the committee inquiry we held that the media feared the contempt of court issues far more than they ever feared a possible contempt of the Senate. I think that is a sad reflection on the way in which the media treat the parliament today. I hope that they will seriously consider the contents of this report, because it has been a longstanding problem and one that the Senate has sought to rectify, though unsuccessfully, over so long a time.
I would like to endorse the comments that Senator Faulkner just made about the Deputy Clerk of the Senate and secretary of the committee, Anne Lynch. She has been an absolute stalwart for the committee for all of the years that I have served on it, as has June Nelson. It has been the most remarkable committee on which to work. Senator Ray was the committee chairman prior to Senator Faulkner. I also say thank you to Senator Ray and to Senator Faulkner, because I too am retiring soon. They have been fantastic chairmen of this committee. The work that Anne has done to help us and to make sure that we are always in full knowledge of everything that is happening and that could possibly happen has been absolutely exemplary. Senator Faulkner mentioned Anne’s international reputation on matters to do with privilege; that is something that we could only ever dream of as being part of our own careers. So to Anne I say: congratulations on your wonderful service to the Senate and also on your wonderful service to the Committee of Privileges.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,35,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2005-06-21,"—In the normal course of events this report will come up, I think, in general business on the first sitting Thursday in August. I might leave my substantive comments until then other than to say that, of the 122 Privileges Committee reports brought down in this chamber, I rate this one as the most important, as the most dramatic and as having the longest term effects. I commend it to senators to read.
I would like to put on record my gratitude, first of all, to the deputy chair of the Privileges Committee, Senator Knowles. We have actually served almost nine years on this committee together. We have produced about 68 unanimous reports, and I think that says it all. It is also a committee where there was a fair bit of respect and friendship. Every now and then Senator Knowles and I would break ranks down here and exchange a few courtesies across the chamber. Occasionally, both of us would go a little too far and square off at the Privileges Committee. But always Senator Knowles was on the ball on all these issues and was part of engendering that cooperative spirit that exists on that committee. I do not believe all parliamentary committees should be sunshine and light. I believe in adversarial politics, but not in everything. When it comes to parliamentary privilege and a few other issues it is nice to have a committee that cooperates and that goes on the merits of the issues. So I say to the deputy chair: thank you for your efforts over the years; they have been much appreciated.
I will turn now to the real boss of the Privileges Committee: Anne Lynch. People know I like to travel a bit. I was attending a CPA conference in Bangladesh and it was amazing how many Commonwealth parliamentary representatives asked about the Senate Privileges Committee. It has a worldwide reputation for excellence. Because we have had such a turnover of senators on the committee I had to ask: what is the common factor here? It turns out that the common factor is the secretary of our committee. There was never a report not written, never a piece of correspondence not dealt with appropriately and never a judge allowed to get away with a silly comment on privilege without Anne Lynch drawing it to our attention. So I would like to place on the record everybody’s appreciation of her enormous work. It was not without fault: every now and then I would accuse the Deputy Clerk of letting in a Lynchism, which was always to do with colourful or evocative language that we more cautious senators would occasionally want to moderate. But every one of those reports is a report of excellence.
It would be nice for us to take the credit. We had a minor role in it. At times, we issued some guidance, but the driving force has to be admitted: on this occasion it was the secretary of the committee. It was not like some committees, where a secretary simply dominates and takes over. That was never the case with the Privileges Committee. It has always been a partnership between the secretariat and those who are on the committee. I have watched Anne in the chamber over the last 24 years, although she was here long before me. She is pleasant to all senators, treats them all as equals and is always nonpartisan in her attitudes in this place. I know that in retirement—we know that Anne will stay extremely active—whatever she does she will do well. The one thing that I hope she learns to do better than she currently does is emails—she is at about my level—because until recently she could only hit the return button, not the send. But Anne has now conquered that, so she will stay in touch with us all with emails I am sure.
Lastly, I make this promise. I do not make many promises; Senator Kemp might be able to assist to me. I have to reveal that the deputy clerk has never been to the MCG to watch a Collingwood-Carlton match, and I think Senator Kemp and I will facilitate that in the near future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-06-21,"—Abortion is a topic of community debate and it is fraught with problems. We do not want to be prescriptive of choice or indeed proscriptive of it, and we must always have in mind that consultations between doctors and their patients have to remain confidential. At the same time, it is in everyone’s interests—society’s, those of the women concerned, their partners and their families and pre-eminently those of the foetus—to limit the number of abortions.
I thought very carefully before I decided to enter the public debate on abortion because, while I have my own private views, I do not believe that government has any business regulating the life choices of citizens. But abortion is a public policy issue for many reasons: it is a charge on public funds through Medicare; the attitudes of the Australian community towards things such as abortion need to be taken into account; and abortion is a therapeutic procedure, not a method of birth control.
Earlier this year I circulated to colleagues an initial discussion paper on abortion policy in which I put forward a proposal that we consider changing Medicare arrangements to include a rebateable item covering approved professional, independent preabortion counselling. Since then I have taken many more soundings in the community and have had the benefit of a lot of feedback and advice from a great many people, including colleagues. There has also been the substantial benefit to the debate of some groundbreaking research released by the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute. As a result of all that, today I circulated a revised discussion paper.
It was an appropriate day to do that, since it was also a day on which I hosted the Give Women Choice lunch here at Parliament House, at which Father John Fleming—ethicist and, in this context, researcher of community attitudes to abortion—spoke on his groundbreaking research for the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute. Other research by the Parliamentary Library, and the answers to questions on notice placed by Senator Boswell, are important in this debate in that they demonstrate the paucity of statistical material on which to base policy making with regard to abortion.
My paper—a distillation of many views put to me since I circulated an initial draft in March—firms up the strong argument for a Medicare line item that would rebate the cost of mandatory independent counselling. I stress that what is intended is independent counselling by professionally qualified counsellors, available for all women who are considering terminating their pregnancy. That would, I believe, have the effect of reducing the number of abortions, because the range of alternative choices available to them would be made much clearer to the women concerned.
We also need to know the number of termination procedures being carried out in Australia so that the publicly funded medical services that Australians expect to have access to can be effectively resourced. Many Australians are concerned about abortion, as is indicated by the results of the Southern Cross research. The document entitled Give women choice: Australia speaks on abortion was released last month. Earlier today, Father Fleming—who is President of Campion College, who has a PhD in philosophy and medical ethics from Griffith University in Queensland and who specialises in the development of public policy in bioethics—addressed the lunch at Parliament House. He is a member of the federal Gene Technology Ethics Committee, set up under the Gene Technology Act 2000. Gene technology is another area of community debate and something about which I want to say a few words later in this speech.
A key finding of the ‘Give women choice’ research, which was conducted in December 2004, was that there is strong community support for a reduction in abortion numbers, without restricting access. According to the published research, fully 87 per cent of Australians hold that view. A second key finding was that there is near unanimous support for counselling prior to abortion. The Southern Cross research indicates that 78 per cent of Australians believe that women should have counselling, while 21 per cent believe that accessing counselling should be voluntary. There is substantial evidence that the majority of Australians oppose late-term abortions.
Abortion policy is also stymied by the fact that no Australian statistics exist that can accurately measure on a national basis the number of terminations by choice. We have to deal with the policy problem posed by abortion. The states have such statistics as may exist. State hospitals and clinics operating under state laws carry out terminations. The Commonwealth pays for publicly funded terminations through Medicare, and terminations under Medicare are included in the schedule item covering other procedures.
The research brief, prepared by the Parliamentary Library and published in February, entitled How many abortions are there in Australia: a discussion of abortion statistics, their limitations, and options for improved statistical collection, closely examines the issue of available termination statistics. It notes:
… it is impossible to accurately quantify the number of abortions which take place in Australia. This is because there is no national data collection on abortion, there is no uniform method of data collection, collation or publication across the states and territories, and the data sources that are available all have several significant limitations.
That is something that we can remedy. Creating a Medicare rebateable item for counselling that must be provided to women before they have a termination will produce a better outcome, more informed choice and verifiable statistics. South Australia is the only Australian jurisdiction which both collects and routinely publishes comprehensive data on abortions. It would be a good model to follow nationally. The South Australian data includes demographic information on women who have abortions, such as statistics on age and marital status; statistics on the stage at which pregnancies are terminated; information on the reasons for abortions taking place; statistics on methods used to terminate the pregnancy; statistics on postoperative complications; information on the number of abortions which take place in metropolitan and country hospitals and public and private facilities; whether the woman undergoing the abortion is a metropolitan or country resident; and statistics on the category of doctor performing the termination.
We know that in 2003-04 there were approximately 90,000 terminations of pregnancy in Australia. But we need a solid statistical collection strategy that provides clear indicators that distinguish between medical terminations in which the foetus or the mother was at risk and choice terminations. Until we achieve that, we will not be able to assess how successful our current counselling and education programs have been or whether the federal government needs to provide additional resources, including financial resources.
Before closing, I make two other brief points on related social-scientific matters. The first is that we need to look urgently at an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act to ensure that the rights of the child remain paramount—something that my good friend Senator Barnett has been actively seeking. It follows the extraordinary call in a report of the Victorian Law Reform Commission last month for the provision of IVF services to be extended further to medically fertile single women and lesbians. To extend this provision would be an antichildren measure, since children are indeed entitled to come into the world with the presumption of having both a mother and a father. Because science makes something possible—in this case, pregnancy and birth without the natural process of conception—it does not necessarily make it morally right or socially responsible in every circumstance. The Sex Discrimination Act should certainly be amended to allow state and territory governments to refuse IVF services to single women and lesbians.
The second issue is that of stem cell research. The push for human embryo research is opposed in Australia by many people, including me. It is also strongly opposed in America. In the US House of Representatives, one strong voice against embryonic stem cell research, representative Mike Pence of Indiana, made a very cogent point last month that, so far, embryonic stem cell research has not produced a single medical treatment, whereas ethical adult stem cell research has produced 67 effective treatments. Congressman Pence is far from alone in his position on the morality and ethics of embryonic stem cell research. It is also something that other US legislators worry about deeply, including the Republican senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, whom I mentioned in another context in a speech in this place last week. Here at home, as in America, the stem cell debate is really about what we are like as a nation and how Australia—a medical research leader of huge effectiveness and immense scope—can stay within the moral boundaries of science that I believe the majority of Australians want.
—I remind senators that under the order passed on 16 June the total time allocated for the adjournment tonight is as it used to be—40 minutes—and we will be finishing at 11.10, I believe. I also understand there is an arrangement for Senator Cherry to speak for eight minutes and for Senator Allison to speak for two minutes. If there is no objection to this happening I will ask the Clerk to set the clocks accordingly.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Abortion</title>,ADJOURNMENT,38,1
