"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-12-04,"—I rise in continuation on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. When I was interrupted last night, I was speaking about the Cole royal commission and pointing out to the House that there were 194,300 businesses in the building and construction industry and that $5 million was being set aside by this government for both the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. That $5 million equates to the grand sum of $25.73 per business—$25.73 to spend on protecting each and every worker in the building and construction industry in Australia. That paltry sum speaks volumes about the government's neglectful approach to workplace safety. 
Undoubtedly, workers in critical situations will have difficulty in contacting one of the new federal safety officers, with their calls invariably being placed in a queue—and having to press one then five for assistance et cetera—all the while adding to the risk of death or serious injury due to unnecessary delay and processing time. Surely, even the most passionate anti-union ideologue would think the government should ditch its administratively short-sighted proposal in the interests of protecting the community, families and citizens. However, if you listen to the government they would have you believe that the construction and building industry is riddled with lawlessness—almost Wild West style. We have heard some speakers from the other side of the House make that accusation.
My view is different. It is different because I have looked at this issue from the perspective of the workers who make our skyscrapers, schools and sports stadiums—the workers who build our community and who built this very parliament and perhaps even the chair you are seated on at the moment, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker. When you consider theses bills from a worker's perspective—from the view of workers who routinely do hard, unrelenting and dangerous work—it is clear that this legislation is insulting, unreasonable and unnecessary. The government must go back to the drawing board with these bills and incorporate the amendment that I will be moving at the end of my speech—an amendment that responds to the inadequacies of chapter 4 of the main bill and to the real issue facing workers, particularly building and construction workers in this country. That issue is workplace safety, and the fact that industrial manslaughter legislation with terms of imprisonment for negligent employers who kill does not feature on the statute books in any Australian jurisdiction—apart from the ACT, where landmark legislation was passed last week with the support of the ALP and the Greens.
More people in Australia die at, or because of, their work than they do on the roads, but still the government sits on its hands and presents us with a 200-page bill that basically misses the mark. This government could help reduce the carnage that costs lives and causes trauma, but it chooses not to. Instead, it fiddles around the edges with OH&S legislation—which, to be brutally frank, is not working—and it hides behind the false argument that it does not have the constitutional power to introduce industrial manslaughter legislation and to incorporate it as part of the bills before us.
I am no lawyer or academic, but I do know one thing about this argument that makes its conclusion false. That is the fact that there are only seven people in Australia who can assess the constitutionality of any legislation—not the Attorney General, not the workplace relations minister, not the Treasurer, not the premiers of New South Wales or Tasmania, not the Governor-General and not even the Prime Minister himself. In fact, the only people who have the power to assess the constitutionality of any law in this entire nation coming from any parliament are our High Court judges. That is what they do and that is their fundamental role, along with being the highest court in the land. So claims that federal industrial manslaughter laws are unconstitutional and claims by the minister that they do not fit into this legislation that we are currently discussing are false. This point alone reveals the government's position as being one that puts profit over lives and relies upon a clear-cut falsity to do so.
If the government wants industrial peace in the building and construction industry the first step that is needed is the insistence on and promotion of safety. These bills do not do that and instead focus on attacking the rights of workers and unions, who are already in very vulnerable positions. The way forward—which has existed in Great Britain since the early 1990s—is to criminalise industrial manslaughter and serious injury in circumstances of neglect, in the same way as a person who negligently drives a car and causes the death or grievous bodily harm of another will face jail. It is only fair. It is patently ridiculous that employers have immunity from imprisonment when they negligently kill workers at work but face the full wrath of the law if they negligently kill that very same person at home or on the street—away from the workplace. Criminalising industrial manslaughter—and not this bill before us—is one of the keys to industrial peace and goodwill, because it will reduce the instances of death and serious injury in the Australian building and construction industry. But this government does not see it that way. It prefers to sit back and let the carnage continue. 
The statistics are out there: in 1997-98, 48 construction workers were killed; in the following year, 1998-99, 58 were killed; in 1999-2000, 48 were killed; in 2000-01, 44 were killed; and, in 2001-02, 39 were killed. In addition, 37 manufacturing workers were killed and 50 transport and storage workers were killed. At the very least, a significant proportion of those deaths were entirely preventable. We should be putting more effort and resources into bringing these numbers down, as we do in attempting to lower the death toll on our roads. The federal government should really be looking at this issue.
The bills before us should have addressed the issue of industrial manslaughter, but they do not. With all this death and dangerous work, is it any wonder that workers join unions? It may prove a matter of life or death, as it has already in many instances, for unions have saved lives in this industry. The clauses in this legislation which put restrictions on unions and union delegates and their ability to enter workplaces, I would suggest, are going to put people's lives at risk and increase their chances of being injured, and there is ample evidence of that. Unions and delegates have enabled families to rest assured that loved ones will arrive home from work, safe and sound.
In presenting these bills, the government is suggesting that the health of the industry is contingent on their passage. I disagree, for the construction industry is generally a healthy one, where profits exceed the average of other industries and where billions of dollars of profit are routinely generated. So the justification for these bills is revealed for what it is. I think that is an important part of this debate: why are these bills currently before us?
The legislation is not about ensuring jobs or the long-term survival of the industry; it is about maximising profits for construction companies, as well as being the latest instalment of this government's anti-union dogma. That is right: these bills are merely an application of neo-Liberal ideology. The industry is profitable and not in need of this drastic legislative surgery. Companies make billions of dollars, thanks in the main part to the efforts of workers. Workers should share in these profits, yet this government would rather see their wages and conditions further restricted and limits placed on their effective representation by the union of their choice. The Prime Minister's claim that no worker would be worse off under this government is a hollow one indeed.
The Cole royal commission showed us just how healthy the building and construction industry is. For the years 1999-2000, 76.6 per cent of all building and construction industries made a profit which exceeded the national average of all industries, while more construction and building industry firms broke even than the average of all industries. Better still, these firms were less likely than other industries to make a loss. Clearly then, by the Cole royal commission's own figures, the construction and building industry makes more money more often, breaks even more often and loses money less often than other industries throughout the nation. The government's talk of a crisis in the sector is alarmist nonsense, with its foundation based on fiction. 
Why then the need for these bills? The minister tells us that they are a key plank in the most significant reform of the building industry ever attempted. Why the need for reform when the sector is so healthy? Who is making this push? Is it the big end of town? Is it developers and business owners who wish to generate even more profits at the expense of workers? Talk about greed! Grocon Constructions, for example, generated $600 million in revenue over the year ended 30 June 2003, up from $425 million on the year before. Meriton Apartments generated over a billion dollars over the same period, up from $850 million on the year before. Multiplex made over $2.28 billion, up from $1.4 billion, whilst Lend Lease made a net after-tax profit of $174 million, and the year before it made $239 million.
What is the relevance of these bills, you may ask, and the reason that they are before us now? The Business Review Weekly of 14 August 2003, in an article entitled `The property kings', states that Walker Constructions holds over $2 billion in assets and that the developer Mirvac expects to make $220 million in profits this year, while Meriton Apartments holds over $1 billion in assets. It seems clear to me that the industry is awash with money and profits. These bills are therefore tainted because large construction companies feature prominently on the donations register of the Liberal Party, and they give the distinct impression that they are a pay-off for those donations. Both Lend Lease and Leighton Holdings have each donated over $100,000 to the New South Wales Liberal Party since 1998. Meriton Apartments has given $145,000 and Multiplex tops this list with over $250,000. In fact, property donors and building and construction industry donors have given over $2.63 million to the New South Wales Liberals in the period mentioned.
So is it any wonder that legislation such as this comes before this chamber? It is legislation that clearly alters the relationship between workers and employers. It is legislation that manifestly benefits employers and burdens workers. Unlike this government, the Australian Greens put people first. Profits must take second place to the safety of individual workers. There is no argument there. That is why we believe industrial manslaughter and serious injury caused by proven negligence should be criminalised with jail terms. That should be a part of these bills. Accordingly, had I not been gazumped by the member for Rankin, I would have moved the following amendment to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“This House rejects the Bill and:
(1)	notes the unacceptably high levels of death and serious injuries in the building and construction industry and across all work-places and therefore demands that the Government introduce industrial man-slaughter legislat-ion immediately that provides for prison terms of: 
(a)	25 years for employers that are found to have killed an employee through proven criminal negligence;
(b)	10 years imprisonment for employers that are found to seriously injure an employee through proven criminal negligence; 
 (c)	fines of up to $50 million for corporations and $5 million for company directors that negligently kill or seriously injure employees;
(2)	condemns the Government's attempts at restricting the rights of people to be properly represented by their relevant union in the construction industry; and
(3)	re-affirms the inherent value of trade unions in protecting and advancing the pay and conditions of employment for all workers.
Noting the member for Rankin's and the opposition's concern about workplace death and the specific case of Joel Exner and in light of ACT Labor supporting industrial manslaughter legislation just last week, I ask the member to withdraw his amendment so the real issue of industrial manslaughter can be addressed by this chamber and my amendment can be put.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise in this House to oppose the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. I do so not only on behalf of the many construction workers and their families in Geelong and the electorate of Corio, which I represent in this place, but also on behalf of all working people in the Corio electorate. This legislation is merely an extension of the industrial relations agenda that has been pursued by the Prime Minister, the former workplace relations minister, Mr Abbott, and the current minister over the period of time since the election of the Howard government to power in this country. If we condense in a nutshell what is enshrined in this legislation, we see that it establishes two new regulatory bodies, the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the Federal Safety Commissioner, in an attempt by the government to extend its power into the construction workplaces of this country. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 also severely restricts the legally protected industrial action that could be taken by building workers under the current provisions of the government's industrial relations laws. It limits a union's right of entry to work sites, it imposes severe penalties on unions and officials who contravene the provisions or the related provisions in the legislation, and it enhances access to damages for unlawful conduct.
When we strip away all the rhetoric, deceit and trickery of the Howard government over these matters, what we have left is a very industry specific piece of legislation which fairly and squarely panders to the prejudices of not only the Prime Minister but also the current minister and the former minister. When we strip all the rhetoric away and look at the reason why we are debating this legislation in the House today, we can see very clearly an extension of the industrial relations agenda that the Howard government has pursued from day one. I want workers in my electorate to reflect on the particular provisions of the bill that I have mentioned because it will not be long before this type of industry specific legislation is extended to other sectors of the Australian economy. Workers in Corio are very familiar with the attempts of this government to introduce penal provisions into legislation and to strip away the awards and conditions that have been hard won over a long period of time.
This bill is not an improvement to the industrial relations framework of the building and construction industry. This legislation is based on the Cole royal commission. Commissioner Cole is on record as saying that the way the government set up this particular inquiry required him to make findings about conduct or practices that `might have broken the law'—so we had a $60 million exercise into what might have happened in the building industry. In the electorate of Corio we could have used that $60 million that was wasted on the Cole royal commission in providing more aged care places, early childhood places, sustained funding for the men and family relationships program and a whole range of other services that really do address the needs of workers and their families. But what we had was a $60 million witch-hunt against a union and its members in Australia. 
That is the extraordinary length to which this Prime Minister, this minister and the former minister will go to get at who they see as their political enemies. It is not as if this particular industry is on its knees. As we know, the building and construction industry in this country has been the centrepiece of economic growth. For the four years that Labor left the coalition with four per cent growth it was the central feature of that economic growth. It has been a central feature of the economic growth that Australia has enjoyed since the coalition came to power—but if you listen to the members opposite you would say that the economic growth rate was all their own work! We left the coalition with single digit interest rates. We broke the back of inflation. We left the coalition with four years of four per cent economic growth, and the cornerstone of that economic growth was the good economic performance of the construction industry.
One has to ask the question—and I think it is a reasonable question—why do we have this legislation here today on the floor of this parliament? It is not because the government is on a quest for reform, because reform suggests that you carry the agenda forward. This is not a reform agenda; these are bills and regressive measures that pander to the worst instincts of the Prime Minister and the prejudices of the coalition government.
We heard on the floor of this parliament only yesterday the minister telling us the reasons why this particular legislation is necessary. In the dorothy dixers served up to the current minister we heard a lot of talk about union thuggery. From the Hansard,this is what the minister had to say in this House on 2 December. When he was asked about a union official who was bashed, he said:
... this thuggery and intimidation in parts of the union movement is a disgrace.
The workers in my electorate of Corio remember the rottweiler dogs and the mercenaries who were trained in Dubai by the coalition government. We understand a little bit about the thuggery of coalition governments. We will not have any of this pious nonsense about the necessity of this legislation to get at thuggery in the union movement. Members of this House, I think we need a bit of legislation to get at the thuggery of the coalition government—of John Howard, the Prime Minister of this country, and his ministers. After all, they were the ones who set dogs, and hoodlums in balaclavas trained in Dubai, onto Australian workers. Geelong construction and waterside workers were amongst those workers. We simply do not forget.
The Cole royal commission which underpins this legislation was, the government said, a commission into the construction industry. But, in reality, it was a witch-hunt against construction unions. The government has had very bad experiences in the past with royal commissions that blew up in its face. The current Prime Minister knows very well about the Costigan royal commission into the painters and dockers union. What it uncovered was rampant tax evasion. The Prime Minister had been the friend of the tax bludgers when he was Treasurer of this country. What we found from that royal commission was that prominent Liberals were involved in massive tax evasion and cheating on the Australian public with the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Who was the Treasurer at the time that particular situation occurred? It was the current Prime Minister—the friend of the tax bludgers who were uncovered by the Costigan royal commission. 
The government got a bit smarter in this particular royal commission. It excluded from the terms of reference any measures that would investigate tax evasion in the building industry, and we know that it is rife amongst employers. But that was not a matter for examination by the government through this royal commission. Is it any wonder that the Cole royal commission did not uncover one instance of tax evasion in the construction industry? In an industry that averages one workplace fatality a week, this $60 million, expensive exercise found only two breaches of occupational health and safety by employers Australia wide in this industry. That is a joke.
—A costly one.
—It is a costly joke, as my honourable colleague reminds me, for the construction workers who die each week in this industry. It is no joke to their families or to the construction workers who leave home in the morning and do not come home at night, but that issue was not worthy of examination by this government. No, they wanted to get at the representatives of those workers, who have been very vigilant in making sure those industrial construction sites are up to speed in the occupational health and safety sense.
What is the government's response to this beat-up royal commission that was so expensive to mount, at a cost of $60 million? How does the government respond to this very successful industry in the Australian economy? It introduces draconian measures designed to alienate and eliminate the very union presence that has made these workplaces safe. An example of that is seen in the legislation. We have the return of Big Brother to the construction sites in this country with the establishment of an Australian Building and Construction Commission, which, if you want to look at it, is really this conservative minister's own special industrial police force.
The directors of this outfit—and that is all you can describe it as—will be appointed by the minister and will take directions from him. We will have teams of inspectors roaming around the construction sites and building sites of this country gathering evidence about workers and their activities. These inspectors will have greater rights to enter a workplace than the union representatives of the workers who actually build the buildings in this economy. This is an anti-union team of inspectors that will be given wide powers over everyone working in the industry. They will be able to force workers and their representatives to attend their offices, to answer questions and to hand over documents.
If you do not comply you will get six months in jail. This will make it more difficult for workers in a very dangerous industry to take industrial action in protection and defence of their interests. Fines for breaches of the no right to strike provision could reach up to $110,000 for unions and $22,000 for individuals. A minister can blow $45,000 on a telecard, abusing the public purse, yet in this legislation, when you exercise one of your fundamental industrial rights you will cop a fine of $22,000. The freedom of association provision will see penalties and sanctions in the order of $110,000. There will be no industry bargaining, and awards will be stripped bare.
So let us have no illusions about the agenda behind this pernicious legislation. I ask the question again: why are we debating this legislation in this House today which affects a sector of the economy that ranks fourth in productivity and is the centre of a boom that is delivering growth to the Australian economy? I leave the members opposite, and the electorate, to ponder that question. In my electorate of Corio, in the greater Geelong region, in 2001 the construction industry employed well over 5,000 males and 643 females; it comprised about eight per cent of the work force. Over 2001-02 building activity went up by 36 per cent. So I ask again: why this particular legislation? It is an expensive exercise in union bashing; that is all it is. 
In the remaining time available to me I want to pay tribute to the construction union in Geelong and to the workers in the construction industry in my electorate of Corio. The honourable members opposite can get behind closed doors and dream up schemes to train mercenaries in Dubai to come back onto the wharves and waterfronts of Australia to belt up Australian workers and Geelong workers. They can train their rottweilers and they can pull their balaclavas over their heads and engage in acts of thuggery. But against whom? I will tell you about the construction workers in my electorate. When somebody is down and out, and when a family is disadvantaged, they are the first to take the hat around the building sites. How do I know this? I have seen it. The members opposite will not talk about the CFMEU in my electorate, which supports a breakfast program for disadvantaged young children at Whittington Primary School and Rosewall Primary School. They will not talk about that, and you will not see that come out in the evidence to the Cole royal commission. But this is what the government's thuggery in this bill is designed to do: to get at these people.
Today I pay tribute to the late Glenn Hodgman, a shop steward for the CFMEU in Geelong, who last week was tragically killed in a motor vehicle accident. He will be a real loss to Geelong construction workers because his brief on the construction sites in both Geelong and Melbourne was to ensure occupational health and safety. He will be sorely missed, and my sympathies go to his family. The construction workers of Geelong have lost a committed friend who devoted his life to ensuring that the workplaces of Geelong and Melbourne are safe so that building workers can come home to their families.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I join with Labor members on this side of the House in opposing the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. This legislation singles out for victimisation the workers and employers in this one industry. It seeks to impose heavy-handed and restrictive controls on those who work in the construction and building industry and it seeks to take away from them rights that are applicable to all workers. The few government members that have risen to speak in this debate all claim that the industry must have these special restrictions placed on it because illegal standover tactics are widespread, endemic and part of its culture. We have heard the government refer to the culture in the industry. But if there is a culture and a widespread endemic problem of this sort of illegal activity, you would have to ask: where are all the prosecutions for these activities over the last seven years that this government has been office? Forget the convictions, they have not even had the prosecutions!
The activities that the Liberal and National Party members purport to be endemic are so rare as to scarcely ever come before the courts of Australia. They base this therefore not on practice that can be tested in our judicial system—because the evidence is not there to support these draconian measures—but on the Cole royal commission. The Cole royal commission was demonstrably a kangaroo court. It was more a royal rort than a royal commission. I am indebted to the work of Jim Marr in his book First the Verdict: the Real Story of the Building Industry Royal Commission, which sets out some of the interesting background to the establishment of the commission and the way in which it conducted affairs. 
This royal commission was not seen as a rort—a kangaroo court, a witch-hunt—just by those whom the government might tag as union members or sympathisers; it was seen in that light by the major commentators throughout the country at the time at which it was set up. Jim Marr's book quotes comments from various editorial writers at the time. The Canberra Times said:
The Government's appetite for expensive election stunts continues unabated. The most recent example is yesterday's decision to launch a royal commission into the building industry.
The Australian said:
Is the royal commission a political stunt? Yes.
The Australian Financial Review—hardly known for its preference and support for the trade union movement generally, let alone the CFMEU or the BLF—said:
There are more effective ways for the government to fix the industry than by pursuing an expensive exercise that smacks of political opportunism in an election year.
The Sydney Morning Herald said:
When inquiries of this sort, carried out at substantial public expense, are seen to have been set up primarily to embarrass the opposition, the currency of judicial investigations tends to be debased.
Even the Courier-Mail, in my home state, said:
The inquiry and its timing are intensely political. It is not difficult to imagine lurid accounts being given by counsel assisting the inquiry before any evidence is called and tested.
They were right. The Courier-Mail hit the nail on the head. We saw the lurid tales drawn out without any evidence ever being tested. Worse than that, the royal commission then put in place a series of procedures for the conduct of the inquiry that meant those wild assertions could not be tested and that facts could not be freely put before it. This was a royal commission that the taxpayers have paid dearly for, in more than one way. The taxpayers paid dearly for it out of their pockets. The government had to dig deep into the taxpayers' wallets to fund this rort to get the answer that it was seeking.
When the building royal commission was set up, we were told it would cost about $7 million. In fact it cost over $60 million. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you might recall—and I am sure many listeners to this broadcast will recall—that, at about the same time, we had the largest corporate collapse in Australian history, at HIH. A royal commission was established into HIH, reluctantly, by this government, as there was a rising tide of concern in the community about how such a major collapse could occur. The royal commission into HIH cost the taxpayer $29 million, less than half the amount of money the government spent on this witch-hunt to pursue its political agenda in the construction industry.
When you have a look at where some of that money went, you see how transparently political the entire exercise was. Some $683,000, well over half a million dollars, went to media relations. That was for the spin doctors trying to get the government message—the Peter Reith, Tony Abbott, John Howard message—out there on the issues that were coming before the royal commission. But they had to look after the royal commissioner as well; after all, he was going to be the person responsible for writing the final report on which this legislation is based. They looked after the royal commissioner very well indeed. He managed to negotiate for himself a salary of $660,000—not bad for a part-time job, particularly when you consider that his counterpart at the HIH inquiry, Justice Owen, was being paid $226,000. The royal commissioner that pulled the rort for this government ended up getting three times more money than the royal commissioner investigating HIH. 
But that was not all that Royal Commissioner Cole managed to benefit by out of this. He had some very extraordinary arrangements agreed to. Out of working hours, he was entitled to 52 return air fares to Sydney each year for himself, his wife and his family. When he was not in receipt of travelling allowances, he picked up an additional allowance of $308 a day just for being there. When he was in Melbourne, which is where the royal commission was headquartered, the taxpayers paid out $850 a week for him to have a rented house. When he was in Sydney—which, incidentally, was his home town—he managed to get $2,000 a week to rent a furnished house in the inner suburbs. But Sydney was his home town, and he also had the 52 flights a year for himself, his wife and his family, as well as the $660,000 a year salary—not a bad deal. The taxpayers paid dearly out of their wallets so that this government could contrive a royal commission to produce the basis for the bills that are now before us.
If you have a look at how the royal commission conducted affairs, you can also see how transparently biased it was. The royal commissioner adopted and implemented procedures for cross-examination of witnesses that restricted the cross-examination to the evidence of the witness. That made it very difficult for those wanting to test the evidence to introduce any other matters. Moreover, it prevented cross-examination on matters not already subject to the evidence, which restricted the opportunity to test the credibility and prevented the eliciting of evidence that might support or be favourable to those who were under attack. Indeed, those who had been accused did not have the right to call witnesses of their choosing to counter the adverse evidence or to support their version of events. This was, by any definition, a kangaroo court and a witch-hunt—one to which the taxpayer paid extremely good money to furnish a report for this government's use in this legislation.
If we were fair dinkum about looking at the problems in this industry, we would realise that it is an industry that has had difficulties over time. It is a difficult industry. It is a hard industry. People who work in it are tough and hard people. But the government and the royal commission have chosen to ignore a raft of information and evidence that was either put before the royal commission or which unions sought to have before the royal commission.
In my state of Queensland, the union found that rorts in the industry totalled $1.3 billion a year in the underpayment of wages, the evasion of income and payroll tax, the non-payment of superannuation and redundancy entitlements, and the failure to pay WorkCover premiums. Was the government interested in that? Is the government moving today to deal with that $1.3 billion black hole? No, it is not. Instead, it chooses to pursue the agenda it established at the outset, which is to victimise the people who work in the industry and use this royal commission as a front for their activity. Why would they do that in an industry which is actually one of the world's most competitive construction industries? 
Labour productivity in the Australian construction industry is recognised, in study after study, as being one of the best in the OECD. An Access Economics study in 1999 ranked Australia's labour productivity in the construction industry second only to the United Kingdom. Access Economics are hardly in the pockets of the CFMEU or the BLF. The OECD, in a report that was the subject of a study by the University of Newcastle in 1999, found Australia second in the OECD world to Canada in having the highest output per person. We should in fact be proud of the productivity, particularly the labour productivity, within our construction industry, but this government is not interested in pursuing questions of productivity and increase in wealth. When it comes to matters of this kind, it is obsessed by its agenda of attacking the rights of workers to organise collectively.
In a recent international comparison, a well-known group of quantity surveyors found that the base cost of construction in Australia was ranked as being less expensive than Germany, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. That study was done by Page Kirkland Partnership in 1999. The Australian construction workers work long hours by international standards, ranking only second to American construction workers on average—again, that is from the Access Economics report of 1999.
If the ordinary person on the street needed any other concrete proof of the international competitiveness of our industry, they need only remember the construction of the venues at the Sydney Olympics: all built before time and under budget. For the first time in the modern Olympiad, an Olympic village and all of its facilities were completed in advance and under budget—unheard of in the modern Olympiad—and that was done by Australian construction workers. I might say that was done by Australian construction workers and companies operating under a New South Wales Labor industrial framework. It could not have been done operating under the Howard government's industrial relations laws, because it was subject to broad agreements across the industry that the Howard legislation does not permit. So the success of the work of those people in Sydney—the companies and the construction workers—was facilitated in no small measure by the access they had to the New South Wales Labor government's industrial relations laws.
Comment has been made about the problems of safety in the industry. That is important, and it needs to be recorded in this debate that the government has shown no regard for these problems. Fifteen per cent to 20 per cent of all workplace injuries happen on building sites. Lost time due to accidents accounts for five times the amount of time lost in industrial disputes. If the government is concerned about industrial activity at building sites then surely it must be concerned about lost time through accidents, which accounts for five times the lost time through industrial disputes, but it is not. Instead, it continues to pursue its ideological vendettas.
In 1998-99—which is the time for which the most recent figures were available when the document before me was published earlier this year—it is estimated that the industry lost 49,440 weeks due to employment related injuries. That cost the industry some $109 million. Is this government proposing to do anything about that? No, it is not. For the past 10 years there has been an average of 50 deaths a year on construction sites in Australia. A person dies every week on construction sites in Australia. That is hardly an acceptable level for any civilised society. It happens to be a fact—and it is supported not just by research in Australia but by research in like countries, such as the United Kingdom—that the level of accidents and deaths on construction sites is markedly lower on those sites that are unionised. In fact, in the United Kingdom a recent study showed that there were 50 per cent fewer accidents on those sites that were unionised. 
All of this would make you think that the government would want to legislate to improve the safety and viability of what has been a very internationally competitive and productive industry, but it does not. Instead, it wants to continue with its plans, plans that were laid out some years ago by Peter Reith. Indeed, they were laid out some years before that by John Howard, when he was shadow minister for industrial relations—at the time when he said that he wanted to stab the Industrial Relations Commission in the stomach—and now, as Prime Minister, he is able to have people like Peter Reith, Tony Abbott and the current minister to do that for him.
We see the Office of Employment Advocate being used as a political police force in workplaces throughout the country, and I have spoken in this parliament about that before. More recently we have seen the building industry task force being set up to specifically target building sites to create mayhem and havoc. I say that deliberately because on an earlier occasion, in March this year, I spoke about the activities of that task force at Lang Park, at Suncorp Stadium, which was then under construction. There was an industrial dispute at the site at that time, and that dispute was worked out—as all these things are—amicably, by negotiations, and the site has been completed. Those who have been to Lang Park would know that it is truly one of the great sporting stadiums of the world. But at the time that dispute occurred, this government fetched its task force onto the work force, inflaming the situation by personally intimidating builders, individual workers and even apprentices, and threatening people with telephone taps and loss of income if they did not do what this government wanted them to do. That is a matter I spoke about in an earlier debate. I do not have time to repeat those details, but it is indicative of the sort of agenda this government has sought to run.
There are issues in the construction industry that need to be solved. The responsibility for the errors is not all on one side of the fence. But it happens to be a fact that those issues will never be resolved by a Liberal government—never. In industrial relations, this Liberal government, more than any previous one, has never acted as an honest broker. We have had Peter Reith, Tony Abbott and the current minister. I have got to say that it has been a downhill run in ability from day one. The one thing you had to say about Peter Reith when he was minister was that whilst he was vicious and dogmatic he was competent: he knew what he was doing and he was good at doing it. I used to describe his successor, Tony Abbott, as Peter Reith in short pants and long socks. Tony Abbott used to describe himself as a minister with L plates. Both descriptions are pretty fair. The current minister is barely worth powder and shot, I have got to say, because he is clearly out of his depth in all respects.
But throughout this period there has been an underlying policy that the government has sought to pursue. Everybody knows—not just those in the workplace but people in the community—that this government has not sought to behave as an honest broker in industrial relations disputes, whether it has been Peter Reith on the waterfront, Tony Abbott telling workers in an auto industry that they were traitors, even though they were taking industrial action that was actually lawful and in accordance with his own act of parliament—nonetheless, they were traitors—or the current minister. 
The only time in which there is an opportunity to address these matters—and people can argue whether this is good, bad or indifferent; it happens to be a fact—is when there are Labor governments. Some years ago when this industry was in the spotlight it was in fact a Labor government, the Bob Hawke government, that took action to deregister a number of branches of the BLF, although not all of them. I am very pleased to say that the BLF in my home state of Queensland was not deregistered. I have many good friends in the BLF and the CFMEU in Queensland; they are both very good unions and I am happy to be associated with them. But the ACTU, the labour movement, the Labor Party and the Labor government recognised that action needed to be taken and it was. This government will never be in a position to do that.
The current minister stands in the parliament and tells us there is thuggery. What is the example he uses? He uses the example of the National Secretary of the Metal Workers Union being bashed. Excuse me! The union official was the victim! But the government gets up and actually accuses the trade union movement and the Labor Party of perpetrating this violence. Look no further than the waterfront, look no further than G&K O'Connor's, where an employer went out and brought thugs into the workplace. It was the subject of a current affairs media program at the time. One of the thugs got sick of the task he was required to do and told the world how he had been asked to go in, paid by the employer, to bash people and encourage fights. That is thuggery in the workplace and it needs to be addressed, no matter who is responsible for it. This bill is not about addressing those problems. As the government has done in the past, it seeks to do no more than pursue its one-handed, one-eyed, ideological industrial relations vendetta. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-12-04,"—I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. I listened with interest to the former shadow minister for industrial relations. I certainly concur with some of the comments he made about the hypocrisy in many respects of the treatment of industrial relations in this country. There is no doubt though, reading the Cole royal commission report, that there are some serious abuses occurring in the building industry by employees and employers or, rather, unions and employers. That commission report contains 212 recommendations, most of which suggest changes to federal workplace relations legislation governing the building and construction industry.
The report recommended that structural reforms focus on four areas: that bargaining occur at the enterprise level, with limitations on pattern bargaining or the seeking of common employment conditions beyond an individual business; that any party causing loss to another party through unlawful industrial action be held responsible; that disputes be resolved in accordance with dispute resolution procedures; and that an independent body be established to ensure participants comply with industrial, civil and criminal laws. While there is no doubt a need to closely scrutinise behaviour in the building and construction industry—it has been a fact of life for many decades, in fact—there is debate on the need to superimpose another set of laws on top of the existing workplace relations legislation. It begs the question as to whether we are to see further workplace-specific legislation aimed at, say, the health industry down the track or, indeed, the higher education sector.
It can be argued that the royal commission has made a special case about the need to set up an industry oversight to study the extent of corruption and illegal practices by unions and employers. But from what I have seen in researching this bill, we may well risk a complete overkill, the creation of overlapping authorities and confusion among participants rather than the clarification of rights and responsibilities. Indeed, the building industry scene, despite the sensational headlines that accompanied the royal commission, is certainly not the same environment as that in which the 1980s royal commission into the painters and dockers union was conducted. The Cole commission turned up allegations of bribery and property damage, but it did not turn up the widespread tax evasion, bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, underworld links and extreme physical violence of the Costigan inquiry into the painters and dockers union. 
The previous speaker questions the objectivity of the commission in this latest inquiry. I want to have confidence in royal commissions and royal commissioners and the independence of commissioners. I want that to be the case, and I want that to be the case too for the public so they can enjoy that same sort of confidence. I make no comment on any lack of fairness in this particular process. But an investigation by the Australian Financial Review a month or so ago into the Cole commission was interesting. It was headed `Cole inquiry empty charges'. When you read that article, it makes one wonder at the need for this establishment of a virtual police force to supervise one industry. The Australian Industry Group have questioned the role and powers of the proposed ABCC and the Federal Safety Commissioner, as well as the proposed building code and its role in regulating workplace relations. The AIG are concerned that the definition of building work makes a larger sector of the manufacturing industry a part of the building and construction industry.
The ACTU believe the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is unnecessary and undesirable and that enforcement of industrial relations legislation can be adequately handled by existing structures. According to the ACTU, workplace relations inspectors and the Office of the Employment Advocate have the powers appropriate to the investigation and prosecution of industrial relations law. These include the power to enter premises, to require the production of documents and other things and to interview relevant persons. The ACTU further say there is no evidence to suggest these authorities do not have sufficient powers to deal with alleged unlawful conduct in the building and construction industry. This statement is germane to this whole complex set of legislation.
This very issue needs to be teased out by the Senate inquiry into this legislation. As I have said on many occasions, it is a blight on this place that we do not have legislation committees to look at legislation like this. Here we have debate on legislation of a complex nature about industrial laws in this country—a very sensitive issue surrounding the building industry with allegations of a lack of objectivity around inquiries and so on and a questioning of the very reason for this legislation—and we are asked to debate and vote on this legislation on what is supposed to be the last day of parliament this year. It is an absolute outrage. If the government are serious about proper debate in this chamber, instead of shoving this legislation through to the Senate to let the senators do the job that the House should be doing the government should be introducing it in an orderly fashion, holding any parliamentary inquiries first and then delivering those results. I do not even have a Bills Digest to help me sort through the complexities of this particular legislation, and yet here we are supposedly debating the whole issue. 
The same thing applied back in 1996-97 when workplace relations bills were introduced. Again, we needed the outcome of a parliamentary inquiry. Amendments were needed—a huge number of amendments—and they were sensibly negotiated. And where were they negotiated? They were negotiated in the Senate between the government and the Democrats—Senator Kernot and Senator Murray were the ones who did that work. Why is it that on this occasion in this place the government is not able to introduce meaningful amendments to this particular legislation? There is no way that this legislation does not need similar amendment. There are conflicts of opinion between employer and employee advocates over sections of the legislation. I will not go into all the detail, but one question is whether the building and construction industry really needs separate workplace relations legislation, especially from a government that preaches deregulation and non-intervention in these processes. In fact, this legislation has been described as `uninvited third-party intervention' on a whole new scale by Anthony Forsyth of the Faculty of Law at the ANU. The Australian Industry Group say the case for reform has been made out by the royal commission, but they have several concerns about aspects of this legislation and certain contradictions in it and they want those properly explained.
As far as I am concerned, it is not clear what workers are covered by this legislation. We do not know what the breadth of coverage of the so-called building work is in this legislation. Does it extend beyond the building industry? How extensive is the role of the ABCC and the ABC Commissioner? Why shouldn't the new building code be a disallowable instrument reviewable by parliament? How secure are the provisions dealing with unsafe work practices and the Federal Safety Commissioner's role? It strikes me that we should be incorporating far tougher employer penalties for abuse of safety standards in the industry if we are targeting employees in such a fashion as this legislation does. There appear to be no criteria for the so-called accreditation scheme relating to contracts for Commonwealth work. In fact, the ACTU argues that health and safety protection could well be undermined if workers on a site or related sites were subject to different provisions by different governments—state, territory or federal. There appears to be a highly confusing overlap of state, territory and federal occupational health and safety laws, according to some of the expert assessment I have seen of this particular legislation.
The minister suggests the new Federal Safety Commissioner could deal with industrial manslaughter issues and crimes of safety negligence, but these roles are not spelled out in any detail as far as I can see. The issue of pattern bargaining creates problems for both employers and employees, with the Australian Industry Group saying the definition of pattern bargaining in the legislation fails to deal with the most damaging aspects of union behaviour that constitute pattern bargaining. But it is also concerned its own activities in regularly giving advice to its member companies about union claims may also be construed as pattern bargaining. So it has doubts about the efficacy of the bill in terms of the perspective it is coming from. Of course, union groups for professions such as nursing are very concerned at the eventual implications of such pattern bargaining laws for their own industry, and other professions, if this industry by industry approach to industrial relations is adopted. Indeed, there are concerns—concerns which demand consideration by a parliamentary inquiry—that this legislation includes additional restrictions beyond those in section 89A of the existing Workplace Relations Act on the range of allowable award matters for the building and construction industry and that there is the potential for these restrictions to be eventually applied in other industries. 
There are a host of other issues that cannot be considered properly in the time constraints that have, again, been imposed on us in this House and around this legislation.
Honourable members interjecting—
—It is not a gag debate, but it is an inadequate debate that we are having on these most complex of pieces of legislation. If the building industry is in such disarray and in need of such complex reforms then we need a very complex debate that allows us to study this legislation in the detail it demands. I will continue my remarks after question time.
—Order! I thank the member for Calare for his interruption at that point. It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101A.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to the government's so-called Medicare safety net. Shouldn't a universal health system cover all Australians and not exclude over 10 million people who the government thinks are not worthy of an extra $5 incentive to be bulk-billed? Acting Prime Minister, isn't it true that Medicare only needs a safety net because the Howard government has failed to provide Australia with enough bulk-billing doctors?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,question
"Anderson, John, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—What all Australians need is access to affordable, reliable health care. In the end, we do not actually run a politburo in Australia. Doctors themselves—medical practitioners—should be entitled to determine the extent to which they are going to bulk-bill. We are putting very significant further incentives into Medicare to encourage bulk-billing, but I do not see how the concept of a safety net can be confused, distorted, misrepresented or underestimated in its importance and its benefits. It will protect all 20 million Australians. Everyone will be protected by it. 
I think it is also worthy of note that the number of people likely to use and need the safety net is not actually terribly large. That is evidence that we have a fundamentally sound health system in this country. We are taking the necessary steps, or offering to take the necessary steps, to ensure that Medicare is secured as a mechanism for delivering health care to all Australians on an affordable basis. The minister's plan, in my view, is an extremely good one. It ought to passed, we need it in place and I would have thought it was one of the first tests of the new-found leadership of the Labor Party and its stated willingness to support this government whenever we put in place proposals which will benefit Australians. The question that must be asked is: why are you failing this test so early on?

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. It relates to the near-hit over Victoria yesterday and his claims in this House that his airspace management system will result in safer skies. Can the minister confirm that before his airspace changes the whereabouts of all three aircraft would have been known to the air traffic controller? But yesterday, the controller learned the light aircraft was on the same path as the jet only because the pilot happened to call him to seek a change of operating mode. Will the minister please now halt the introduction of his system and fix it?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Security</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,question
"Anderson, John, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—I thank the honourable member for his question and I am pleased to give a detailed and comprehensive answer to it, because it is important. It is a serious issue; it deserves a serious response. But I will say at the outset that the opposition spokesman's lack of understanding of this clearly reveals that he ought to accept my invitation of last week to go down and talk to the experts at Fairbairn. 
By way of preamble, it is very important to put this report and other claims about the new airspace arrangements into context. Firstly, in any week in Australian skies, about 100 incidents are reported to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. As I explained to the House earlier this week, most of those incidents involve minor equipment malfunctions, minor errors by pilots or repositioning of aircraft during their approach to airports. Very few of them are serious. Only on rare occasions do they become life threatening. They are part and parcel of air traffic control around our skies. In the end we have to face the simple reality that, if pilots never made errors and planes never entered the same part of the sky, there would be no need for air traffic control.
All of the types of incidents I referred to are reviewed by the ATSB. They are the body charged with investigating these matters, getting to the bottom of them and, if necessary, making recommendations for changes. Over the course of the year, very importantly indeed—and again, I urge the opposition spokesman to go down and get across the broad facts here—believe it or not, there are about 100 incidents where collision alerts fitted to commercial aircraft are triggered. Every one of those incidents is thoroughly investigated. In the case of the Melbourne incident that is being reported today, the ATSB have decided to conduct a detailed investigation.
From what I have been advised at the very early stages of that investigation, I can confirm to the House that at about 10 minutes past 10 yesterday morning, about 50 miles north of Melbourne airport, the collision alarm was triggered on a Virgin flight, involving a 737 aircraft, en route from the Gold Coast. The alarm was triggered by a Cessna 421 that had entered the separation zone surrounding the 737. The aircraft were flying in the same direction at different altitudes and, very importantly in the context of the way that the member asked the question, both aircraft—I emphasise both aircraft—had been and were in contact with air traffic control. As part of the investigation and in accordance with normal procedure, the air traffic controller involved has been stood down while the inquiries progress.
In relation to the introduction of NAS, it is far too early to draw any conclusions as to why the Cessna impinged on the 737 separation zone. That is the advice from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. If the Leader of the Opposition or his transport spokesman believe they know more than the ATSB then I suggest they take up a new role and go and apply for a job with the ATSB!
The other thing is that the member for Batman should have learnt from his earlier intervention this week. He claimed in here that a midair collision had only been narrowly averted over Tamworth last Saturday. I was actually in Tamworth at that airport for several hours that day and I must say I did not feel at all threatened. That is what he claimed. They say they are worried about this. That report has been assessed and I have been advised by safety authorities that what actually happened in Tamworth was that, at a little past five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, a privately owned Cessna 172 was making a normal approach to Tamworth airport. As required under NAS procedures, the pilot made radio contact with the tower to seek clearance to enter Tamworth's class D airspace. He was about 500 feet higher than he should have been. He was told to delay his descent, which he did. The tower was aware that a Dash 8 commercial aircraft was also making an approach. It told the Cessna pilot to remain outside class D space until the Dash 8 was clear and then to follow it in, maintaining visual separation. That is exactly what happened. 
That is a completely normal landing procedure for two aircraft at a regional airport—the sort of thing that happens hundreds of times a day. There was no emergency, no near miss, no incident for either pilot to report. The only thing that went wrong was that the member for Batman came in here with the lines he got from his union mates, scaremongering in the same way as the unions have done with the Tamworth NorthernDaily Leader. The union made up the story. They gave it to the member for Batman and he did his riding instructions. He came into this place, he did not ask any questions and he did not check with air safety authorities; he just did the union's bidding.
When NAS was introduced last Thursday and the member for Batman started his daily question from the union, I invited him to go down there—just down to Fairbairn—and get some facts. I invite him to do that again: find out what this is about.
—He laughs. He does not want to be bothered. I can understand that last week he was too busy to do that—he did not have time. But I repeat that invitation today: he should go down and visit the implementation group and make sure that he can actually comment on this in an informed way. We are about improving safety in Australia's skies.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—It is a great honour to give my first speech in the House as the new leader of the Australian Labor Party. I could easily give the House a long list of the policy failings of the Howard government. I could go through all the government negatives, all the different areas where they have let down the Australian people. But there has already been enough negativity this week from the government; there has been a stack of negativity. Can anyone remember a new idea the government have advanced this week? Can anyone remember a positive proposal they have advanced this week for the benefit of the Australian people? Can anyone remember a program for the future mentioned by the government in either question time or outside the House?
It has been a curious thing, Mr Speaker: I have been sitting here watching and waiting for any sort of positive proposal, any value added to the public debate for the benefit of the Australian people, and all I can conclude is this government has a very strange set of priorities. It seems to be much more interested in my past than in the country's future. Is that what the Australian people want? A government living in the past, obsessed with the past, or a government that is elected for the hard work of doing things in the public interest, doing things in the national interest? 
The battleground for the election campaign, to be held sometime in 2004, is already clear. A government living in the past, talking about the past versus a Labor opposition dedicated to the future, the national interest and the future of our country. I honour and respect the past—always have and always will—but I will tell you one thing about the past: you cannot live in it; and, moreover, history lessons do not improve people's lots in life for the future. No history lesson will produce an extra bulk-billing doctor in any part of the Australian community. No history lesson will ever improve access for university and TAFE in this nation. History lessons will not improve school results or back the students working hard in our schools today. No history lesson will find a single job for a long-term unemployed youth in this country. History lessons do not improve the quality of life of the Australian people in the future.
It is a funny thing: the government wants to talk about the things I said nine months ago, five years ago, 15 years ago. Next step: back into the university essays at this rate of progress. We can all play that game. If we all tried to live in the past, on this side of the House we would say: remember Asian immigration? Remember `never, ever GST'? Remember the `kids overboard'? Remember stabbing Medicare in the guts and getting rid of universal health care in this country? We can all talk about the past, but I have a different priority. I want to talk about the future and be positive about the future and advance Labor Party plans to make the future better for the Australian people. I am interested in bulk-billing rates nine months from now. I am interested in the education system five years from now. I am interested in the next generation of Australians and where they are going to be 15 years from now. Not the past; the future. Not the things that obsess the government, the petty games and political antics, but the things that the Australian people want in their House of Representatives: good policy proposals adding value to their lives and our nation.
In recent days, some commentators in the media have been pointing out the 22-year age difference between me and the Prime Minister. For me it is no big deal; my mum is just a little bit older, and I have got no problem with her! The truth is I am not worried about how old the Prime Minister is; I am worried about how old his ideas are for the Australian people. This is a government of old and tired ideas; a government living in the past—every day showing how it lacks a plan for the future. My plan is simple enough: I want Australians climbing the ladder of opportunity. I want a government that adds value for the benefit of the Australian people, putting more rungs in the ladder of opportunity—not taking them out in health care, not taking them out in education, not taking them out in all the basic services and opportunities that a decent society relies upon.
I have believed in these things all my life, and to the best of my ability I have lived them all my life. I believe in hard work; I believe in reward for effort. I know for a fact that people need to try hard in our society, but I also know the powerful combination that makes that effort worthwhile. It is the collective, civilising role of a government that cares about social justice and compassion in our society. I want to put the rungs back in. The rungs that the Howard government has taken out or ignored I want to put back into the ladder of opportunity—adding some value to the public policy debate and, most of all, adding some value to the future of our nation. Not the past; the future. That is the thing that matters. 
The first rung on this ladder of opportunity is early childhood development. It is the foundation stone of lifelong learning, because the truth is that learning does not start on the first day of school; it starts on the first day of life. That is the truth of it, and that is why early childhood development is so important. It has been an undervalued and underresourced aspect of our learning society. I am struck by the international research showing how, if you want to know where someone is going to be later in life, you can sort out a lot and you can pretty well predict their pathway in life at age five.
What we need to recognise is what the professional people tell us. I remember a letter that Mem Fox, Australia's great infant storybook author, wrote to me saying that if we read three storybooks a night to our children then by the age of five they will be literate and they will be doing numbers. Every parent reading aloud three storybooks to their children every night is making a real commitment to the future of the next generation. I am taking her advice as best I can. My average is down for this week, I've got to say—I've been pretty busy—but I am committed to it and I want all Australian parents to be committed to it. And for those Australian parents who have not got the skills available to them or the training, a Labor government will do it for them. It will provide special literacy programs to make reading available in all the homes and to make education valued in all the homes of our nation. We need a new national program for early childhood development, improved preschool access, putting the qualified teachers back into the child-care system, encouraging parents to read aloud to their children and special literacy programs for the parents without the skills at this stage. That is the first rung.
The second rung up the ladder of opportunity is good schooling. I know, from my own life, there is no more powerful institution in our society than a good government school. I have been fortunate to have good family and good schooling available to me earlier in my life. But I also know, from my own constituency and other parts of the country, that there are many underresourced non-government schools in Australia. I want to make this clear at the outset of my Labor Party leadership: we believe in school-funding equity, we believe in a needs based school-funding system—not sectors fighting each other for money but all schools, government and non-government, in this country reaching a strong national standard for resources and achievement. The basic truth is this: I will not rest easy. I will not rest for one moment in this responsibility that I now discharge until every school in this country is a high-achievement school fulfilling the potential of the next generation of young Australians.
The third rung up the ladder is post-secondary education opportunity. To one of my predecessors—my most illustrious predecessor—in the seat of Werriwa, who is sitting at the back, I want to say: thank you, Gough, for your step, the step you took in 1973, to make higher education more affordable for the next generation of young Australians. Even today in the seat of Werriwa, people still come up and say, `You know Gough—thank him for the access we had to a higher education.' I am one of those people. Labor build on that tradition. We build proudly on that tradition with our Aiming Higher policy: an extra 20,000 university places; an extra 20,000 TAFE places; our commitment to VET; and our commitment to training—higher eduction opportunity for all. And we do it without the need for heavy debt early in life for students. Indeed, this is a government that have gone debt crazy. Look at their record: the highest household debt in Australia's history, the highest credit card debt, the highest foreign debt and the highest current account deficit, and there is their policy for university student debt. We do not want a debt society. We have to build a new culture of national savings, and a lot of it comes out of education opportunity and access. 
So up the ladder we go, putting rungs back into the ladder of opportunity in this country. One of the most crucial rungs is that of health care for our families. Medicare must be a universal system of public health care—universal. If it is not universal, it is not Medicare. If there is insufficient public health care, then it is not Medicare. Labor founded Medibank and then Medicare, and only Labor will save them. Only Labor truly believe in the principle of universal public health care in this country. Under a Labor government in the future we will not need a safety net, because we have a target and a plan to rebuild bulk-billing. That is the principle that Gough Whitlam and Bill Hayden established in 1973. It is the true principle that Neal Blewett established in 1983 and 1984: the basic principle of Medibank and then Medicare.
If you have enough bulk-billing doctors, there are two things you do not need in our society: families will not need private health insurance to go and visit their local GP and they will not need a safety net. There will be enough access to bulk-billing doctors to revive the basic standard we require: access to good, affordable—and, in this case, bulk-billing—GPs for our children and our families. This is the Labor plan to lift the bulk-billing rate from 68 per cent to 80 per cent. It is a plan for the future—not a government talking about the past, not a government that is on its fourth cut of health policy.
—The minister opposite objects. They had their policy prior to the last election—the Wooldridge plan—and then a policy after the election. Then there was the Kay Patterson plan and the Tony Abbott plan. It just makes the point: you cannot trust the government with health care. Only Labor believes in Medicare and the principle of universal public health insurance.
Beyond that, we have other principles. We will also improve our public hospital system and take a proper federal government responsibility for dental care—I hope the minister is listening to that: a proper federal government responsibility for dental care—not the thing that the Australian people have grown to despise, shoving the responsibility onto another level of government, but actually stepping up to the plate and doing good things for the benefit of the Australian people. People are worried; they are worried about the future of their health care. It will be safe in the hands of a Labor government.
There are many other rungs on the ladder of opportunity: housing services, child care, recreation and libraries. I know these things in my own life and how much they matter to people who want to work hard and be rewarded for their effort. At the top of the rung, of course, there is aged care. The measure of a civilised society is not only the way in which we treat children but also the way in which we treat our elderly. But in Australia we now have a shortage of more than 13,000 aged care beds, and more than 2,000 elderly Australians are waiting in hospital for an aged care place. We cannot aspire to be a decent, civilised society until we end this scandal. Labor will solve the aged care crisis in this country. This is our ladder of opportunity. This is the Labor way. We will be working as hard as we can through next year to make it the Australian way: the way of life, the reward for effort, the hard work and the aspirations that the Australian people want but are not getting from this government. 
There is one other big priority. We would not be a Labor Party unless we cared about poverty. The sad truth in this country today is that there are too many Australians without a foot on the ladder, let alone climbing the ladder—they have not even got a foot on it. I know of public housing estates around the nation where people have 40 per cent unemployment rates and 80 per cent rates of welfare dependency, where the problems of poverty pass from one generation to the next. So we must end the government's neglect of poverty. It is a government that boasts about economic growth but a government that has not brought down the number of long-term unemployed Australians.
Growth is good but growth must be for all Australians. We must get every Australian family on that ladder of opportunity and provide opportunity for all. So we need a new national effort. We must win the war against terror internationally but also the battle against poverty domestically. There are many things that need to be done to solve poverty—many things indeed—but a good starting point is to get all governments with their shoulder to the wheel: federal, state and local government, dedicated to a concerted national effort to eradicate poverty from our society.
Cooperation is important, and I am impressed by the research that says that, if you do eight government programs concurrently in a disadvantaged neighbourhood, you get 10 to 20 times the result than if you do each of those programs in a sequence of years. So I give this pledge for my first meeting as Prime Minister chairing COAG, the Council of Australian Governments: we will have a concerted intergovernmental effort to solve poverty in this country high on the agenda. It is our No. 1 priority as a Labor Party, and I want to work with my state and local government colleagues to achieve it for the nation.
We must reward effort. I believe passionately in the powerful combination of hard work, good families and communities, and the collective role of government. I just want, for this nation, one simple proposition—and, if I can achieve this thing as leader of the Labor Party, it will fulfil the things I have always believed in. I just want a government in this place as good as the Australian people themselves. The people of this country are looking for a better way. They know the failings and excuses of a government that lives in the past; they know the failing of this government and its political strategies. They have seen a government that really have just one strategy for re-election. They talk in the past and, when it comes to the future, they have one thing only at the front of their minds—that is, the political strategy of ripping Australia in two, just so they can try and pick up the bigger part politically. It is the oldest trick in the book. We saw it last time, and we are going to face it next time by talking about the future and doing good things for the country.
I believe that, until our nation unites around the common values of work, reward for effort, aspiration and compassion, we will not truly be able to advance as a nation fulfilling our full potential. I want all Australians on the ladder of opportunity climbing upwards. That is the Labor way, and next year we will be working as hard as we can to fulfil all our beliefs and ensure that they become, in the service and good of our nation, the Australian way.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Education and Community Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,31,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—On behalf of members on this side of the House, I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his elevation. But I do make the observation, having just listened to his speech, that I have to conclude that having got to the position of Leader of the Opposition he now does not have a clue about what he is going to do with his new eminence. Except for the vitriol against the Prime Minister and the coalition parties and except for the idolatry of Gough Whitlam and Labor, the leader of conceivably any political party could have made the speech that the Leader of the Opposition has just made—except I say this: no leader of a coalition party would ever make a speech so cliched, so fatuous and so utterly devoid of any serious content as that which the Leader of the Opposition has just made. 
The Leader of the Opposition is better than that. The Leader of the Opposition has spent years developing hard positions on difficult topics, and now it seems he has got to the top job and he is terrified of his own shadow. There was not a single concrete proposal or a single decent idea from the Leader of the Opposition in that speech. What has happened to him? He talks about rewarding effort. He talks about ending poverty. He talks about looking forward. He talks about being our best selves. Well, wacky do—all of us believe in that. If that is the best the Leader of the Opposition can do after all these years of scheming, dreaming and plotting, I say: bring back the member for Hotham. If that is the best the Leader of the Opposition can do, bring back the member for Brand. Bring back anyone, because noone else in this House would have had the temerity to insult our intelligence with that wish list we have just had from the Leader of the Opposition.
I think quite a few people on this side of the House were a little apprehensive when the Leader of the Opposition assumed his position on Tuesday. But we should not have been, because quite frankly he has been the de facto Leader of the Opposition for the last six months anyway. He has been the chief policy maker as shadow Treasurer, and he has been the chief tactician as Manager of Opposition Business. We have already seen the result of six months of de facto opposition leadership from the member for Werriwa. It was so poor that the member for Hotham lost his job. The member for Werriwa should have lost his job, not the member for Hotham, on the basis of the pathetically inadequate wish list we have just heard from the member for Werriwa.
The Leader of the Opposition tried the oldest trick in the book and accused the government of having no ideas. This very week the government has made major announcements about saving the Great Barrier Reef. This very day the government has made a significant announcement about joining a ballistic missile defence program. That is just this week. What about the big difference that this government has made to the economic, social and cultural architecture of this country? What about tax reform—something that was too hard for members opposite? What about industrial relations reform, which the member for Werriwa believes in but now lacks the guts to advocate? What about the liberation of East Timor and those poor, oppressed people who had suffered from 500 years of colonialism, first at the hands of the Portuguese and later at the hands of the Indonesians? This government gave them their freedom. Regarding border protection, the member for Werriwa talks about being tough on queuejumpers. This government has delivered that. Then there is Work for the Dole. The member for Werriwa talks about giving people a fair go and a chance to show not what they cannot do but what they can do. This government has delivered that through Work for the Dole—and of course we have been opposed every step of the way by the member for Werriwa and his cohorts.
This government is not obsessed with the past, although we do think we should learn from it, and we do think it is important to look at the past and the present and hold the new Leader of the Opposition accountable. I can understand why the new opposition leader does not want to dwell on the past. It is because, frankly, it embarrasses him—and it should embarrass him. There is so much political inconsistency, so much political treachery and so much betrayal of ideas, people and institutions that he had pledged to support. 
This MPI was supposed to be about health, education and community services. In the old days, before the Leader of the Opposition became anaesthetised by success, he actually had a few views. This is what he said about private health insurance:
This is the maddest piece of public policy that one will ever see out of the Commonwealth parliament.
I bet you he supports it now. This is what he used to say about safety nets:
The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place ...
That is what this government is doing in health. This very day, the Leader of the Opposition had a chance to vote in favour of a strong, effective, necessary and timely MedicarePlus safety net, but what did he do? He ratted on his own principles, as he has so often done in the past. If we go back a bit, he talked about heroin injecting rooms. He said:
I would think it's just common sense to have heroin addicts in a controlled environment where there's proper supervision ...
Yes, but not a jail. He wants there to be injecting rooms—coming to a suburb near you.
On education he had nothing at all to say today except empty platitudes and cliches. Once upon a time, before he was anaesthetised by success, he was prepared to take a tough position on universities. He said:
It is possible to envisage ... different types of resourcing.
He then said one type could be:
A group of internationally focussed institutions, with a greater emphasis on private revenue sources than public money.
He said of these elite universities:
Their fees would be deregulated, with the equity role of government pursued through publicly funded, means tested scholarships.
And he identified these universities that should be deregulated. They were Queensland, New South Wales, Macquarie, Melbourne, Monash, Adelaide and Western Australia. Come on—support a decent policy. Support deregulation of the elite universities. Have the courage of your convictions. Do not just engage in opposition for opposition's sake, and pass the government's higher education bill.
In the days when he had a policy and held a view and had not lost his guts, the Leader of the Opposition had some interesting things to say. On community services and reforming the disability support pension, for instance, he said that the disability support pension was being used as a way of shifting people off the dole and `artificially lowering the unemployment rate'. He said that some experts believed that the size of the program should be no more than 150,000. Back then, before he was anaesthetised by success, before he was neutered by his elevation, he wanted 400,000 Australians to be thrown off the disability support pension. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: come on, have a conviction, have some courage, have a policy. If you think you were going a bit too far back then, just adopt the modest policy position which the government is putting to the Senate of trying to slightly moderate, slightly limit, the ability of people to move onto the disability pension and take what you once used to call `early retirement'.
In days gone by, the Leader of the Opposition had an opinion on everything but a policy on nothing; now he has a cliche on everything but a policy on nothing. Where does the Leader of the Opposition really stand? He says he is in favour of the US alliance, but he calls President George W. Bush the most flaky President, the most dangerous and incompetent President, in living memory. He gets into a bit of trouble in this House, so what does he do? He runs out and wraps himself spinelessly and cravenly in the flag of a country that he has spent the last 12 months criticising and excoriating. 
He says—or at least he used to say, before this week—that he wants to see lower taxes for high-income earners. But of course he opposed those self-same tax cuts when they were before the Senate. Then there are his particularly batty ideas: the betterment tax on local residents, because the council has done something for them; the regional GST, where you pay GST on one side of the street but not on the other side of the street; and the progressive expenditure tax, which has been tried nowhere and which not even academics understand but which the Leader of the Opposition has adopted. Then there is the `homework police' that he wanted to see interfering in the houses of his own electorate because he did not believe that the parents in his electorate were capable of doing a good job. This might be all very well from an undergraduate or an overpromoted policy adviser, but it sits very ill indeed in the mouth and the books of someone who is now presenting himself as the alternative Prime Minister of this country.
What is really going on here? I think it is now pretty clear that he did not mean any of that. All of those books and speeches and all of that posturing were just a form of self-advertisement. It was just a kind of political exhibitionism. It is like the bad language: it was being turned on and off for effect—because, in the end, what is he interested in? He gave the game away on the front page of the Daily Telegraph this morning. He said:
Anyone in a public life, sometimes you've got to go in hard for position—
not to go in hard for people and in support of them, not to go in hard for principle and in support of that, but to go in hard for position—to grab that and feed the ravenous ego which has been driving the member for Werriwa ever since the early 1980s, when he first got onto the Liverpool council. 
The ultimate question here is one of character. The new Leader of the Opposition has been judged harshly by the people who know him best—those who have worked and lived with him over the years. From the member for Brand we have this:
Many in the Labor Party await with bated breath for Mark Latham to do more damage to the Liberal Party than he does to the Labor Party and taxi drivers ...
New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, writes about how the new Leader of the Opposition hung up on him in tears. We even have the member for Hotham, who said a couple of years back:
I wanted talent and teamwork—
on the front bench—
The teamwork question was not in doubt with anyone else. It was with Mark.
The member for Griffith describes the member for Werriwa's ideas as `just plain loopy'. Tony Sheldon, the respected union official, talks about the member for Werriwa's ideas as being `maverick and deformed'. Workers Online have said:
Some months ago Latham pronounced that the time had come to muscle up to the Liberals. Ever since he's been giving the impression of a cane toad on steroids—ugly, venomous and prone to explode. 
There is no better judge of the member for Werriwa than Gary Gray, the man who so well understood the former Prime Minister—the member for Werriwa being the leader of the Keating government in exile. Gary Gray knew so much about human character that he understood that Paul Keating was `Captain Wacky'. Gary Gray said: 
It is truly said when you are standing beside him—
that is the member for Werriwa—
and hear ticking it is not his wristwatch. 
The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is no alternative Prime Minister, because in the end it is character that counts. There is the scorned former political mentor, there is the abandoned first wife and there is the bashed taxi driver—this trail of human wreckage that the Leader of the Opposition has left behind him—all who testify to the fact that there is a brutal streak to the member for Werriwa. I hope he can overcome this, but he is already 42 and leopards do not change their spots. Until he can demonstrate qualities of consistency, commitment and character, he is not a credible alternative Prime Minister.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I am very pleased to follow the Leader of the Opposition on this MPI and I thank him and my colleagues for that opportunity. Opportunity is the theme of this MPI: the Howard government's failure to provide adequate opportunities for the Australian people, particularly in health, education and community services. On this side we often look at opportunity in political life—not for its own sake but because that opportunity in political life provides us with a policy opportunity to uplift the nation's spirit and the lives of the Australian people. So our dedication and commitment is to the opportunity for Australian people which comes from an appropriate and proper public policy framework.
Our public policy framework is, firstly, to ensure there is economic growth in Australian society and then to make sure that the benefits of economic growth go to all Australians, not just those who already have a high income, a high-skilled job or a place in society. We want to ensure that the benefits of economic growth and Australian society go to all Australians; to the many not just the few. That is at the central core of the notion of opportunity, and it is central to the great Australian characteristic and ethos of egalitarianism. That is a great Australian characteristic; that is a great Labor characteristic. It is the Australian way: a fair go, an egalitarian society. That is now under threat, as reflected by this MPI and the state of the Australian community at the moment. And that is the great danger of going down the track of four more years of the Howard government. Four more years, if the Howard government is re-elected, of the great danger of losing the Australian way, of losing an egalitarian society and of losing a fair go for the Australian people.
One thing that the Leader of the House and Minister for Health and Ageing did not address in his contemptible and despicable personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition was the notion of opportunity. Did we hear from the Leader of the House how, over the last seven or eight years, the Howard government has provided any opportunity to Australian society? This government is the highest taxing government in our nation's history. You might think that, given we have the highest-taxing government in our nation's history, there would have been some investment in services to offset that? This government, being the highest taxing government in Australia's history, has put families under enormous pressure. The Labor Party's view is that, where families are under economic pressure, it is a core objective of a Labor government to relieve that pressure and to uplift their lives. At a time when we see those families under enormous pressure, we also see the demise of our health and education systems—those great services which provide the chance of a fair go and the chance of an egalitarian society. 
I will deal firstly with health care. We know that, over the seven years of the Howard government, by a process of stealth and attrition, John Howard has set about seeking to achieve his long-held policy ambition of restricting bulk-billing to pensioners and concession card holders. When John Howard came to office, bulk-billing throughout Australia was at 80 per cent. Every year under the Howard government bulk-billing rates have fallen. They are now at 68 per cent. It is harder to find a doctor who bulk-bills. When you find a doctor who does not bulk-bill, the cost is more expensive; so the burden on families is more expensive. Our great Labor commitment is to a universal health care system where quality health care is available to all Australians, irrespective of their wealth. With Labor it is a case of health not wealth. If the Howard government are re-elected, we will see the complete dismantling of Medicare—not just the dismantling of the bulk-billing pillar but also the dismantling of the second great pillar of universal health care: free access to public hospitals. Some of us remember John Howard in the 1980s on the front page of the Australian Financial Review saying that his preferred public policy position was to means test access to public hospitals. So, in the area of health care, our great Australian tradition of a fair go is being undermined and destroyed by the Howard government.
I turn now to the issue of education. Education provides the great opportunity in life. It might be old-fashioned, but in my view the most important things you can give a family today are a job for the family and an education for their children. As the Leader of the Opposition said, the earlier you give young Australians access to a quality education the greater chance they have of uplifting their lives and, as a consequence, uplifting the lives of future generations. What do we see now? We see legislation before the parliament at the moment which will see a 25 per cent increase in fees for university. This year 20,000 young Australians will miss out on a university place. So access to education at the higher level is being restricted. This is undercutting a fair go, undercutting access to education and undercutting the chance and opportunity for young Australians to get a high-skilled job after the benefit of a decent education. Often the minister for education comes into this place and waxes lyrical about TAFE, but he never tells us that there are 15,000 young people currently missing out on TAFE places. I have a strong view that if we want to try to change equity in access to education then we have to start in our primary and secondary schools. What do we find under the Howard government? A 200 per cent increase in Commonwealth grants to the most wealthy elite schools. This is matched by a 20 per cent increase for the poorer non-government schools and all government schools. You see there the destruction of our egalitarian society. The destruction of a chance for a fair go, a fair opportunity for access to education for all Australians.
So we have the highest taxing government in the Commonwealth's history putting the burden on Australian families and at the same time dismantling the opportunity and the hope which come from having access universally to a quality health care system and a decent education system. If the Howard government is re-elected, over the next four years we go down the track of destroying the Australian way, of ending Medicare, of destroying bulk-billing and of dismantling access to public hospitals. We will see more public money go to the wealthiest and elite schools and less money go to our poorer non-government schools and to all government schools generally. This is a dismantling of the Australian way, a dismantling of the great Australian ethos of egalitarianism and a fair go. 
On the other hand, what do Labor say about these great opportunities? Already we have put out over $4 billion worth of programs to rebuild bulk-billing, to rebuild Medicare and to rebuild our public hospitals. It is not often remembered that, when the government came out with their first Medicare package—which they have now dispatched with the former health minister—they funded that program by taking a billion dollars away from the funding of our public hospitals and giving it to the states. They gave the states a billion dollar handpass. That is how they funded their first program. Now that they have dismantled that program and thrown out the former discredited health minister, they have come up with another attempt at a political fix. What is required here is not a political fix but a public policy fix—a public policy commitment to universal access to a quality health care system that is affordable to all Australians through the taxes that they pay. 
As far as education is concerned, our package on education is trying to ensure that young Australians have access to tertiary education. It is important to make this point: often people look at education in isolation and think that it is a social policy issue. Education is in very many respects one of our most important economic issues. In the 21st century, Australia will remain internationally competitive for one reason alone—the intelligence and skills of its people. A greater investment in education is a greater economic investment; it will help us remain an attractive place for investment and an attractive place for trade, and that will see the economic growth and the jobs we need. 
Our commitment to opportunity is to make Australia the best possible place in which to live. We want to make our country safe and secure. But we also want to ensure that families have the best health and education systems that we can offer. We want our education system to give young Australians every opportunity to develop their abilities and skills to help them realise their goals and their potentials. We want to give our nation the best health system, a fair health system, an affordable health system and a universal health system. We also want to secure the country for our people—a smart and secure country, which makes the most of our people's talents, our abilities and our great resources.
The great challenge of any government and the great commitment of a Labor government is to uplift the lives of Australian families and the spirit of our nation. That is the sort of opportunity that Labor provides and that is the sort of opportunity that the Howard government will destroy by undermining a fair go, by undermining an egalitarian society and by undermining the great Australian way. With Labor, it will be an opportunity for all Australians, not just a few.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—It is my pleasure to address the House on this matter of public importance on the three subjects chosen by the Leader of the Opposition—which happen, as it turned out, to be the three areas of strongest and most sustained achievement by the Howard government over the last eight years. 
I want to begin with health. It is a critically important day for Australia's health and for the architecture of our health system as the government has introduced a piece of legislation—which we are seeking to have passed in the Senate—that will provide over $2 billion of expenditure to strengthen Medicare and to improve availability of bulk-billing around the country. We have the extraordinary situation of this landmark bill, with over $2 billion of expenditure commitment by this government, suffering an arduous passage through parliament; it is apparently subject to rejection in the Senate by the ALP, under their new leader. He has begun his time as leader with the commitment to greater bipartisanship in matters that are clearly in the national interest!  
How can it be that in my seat of Parramatta we have the great luxury of over 90 per cent of GP visits being bulk-billed, yet sitting next to my electorate is that of my colleague parliamentary secretary Sharman Stone in the seat of Murray, which is struggling to crack 30 per cent of doctor visits being bulk-billed. This is a massive injustice and inequity. We are taking steps in the A Fairer MedicarePlus package to try and make doctors more available in rural and regional areas with practical efforts—not just rhetoric or language, but backbone. Money from the Commonwealth Treasury for health is being systematically resisted by the ALP. 
If we turn to the facts of the achievements of this government in the area of health, we find that Australia is one of the healthiest countries in the world in terms of outcomes. According to the latest OECD and World Health Organisation data, Australia ranks sixth in the world for life expectancy and fifth in the world for healthy life expectancy. The Howard government has improved Medicare, immunised Australia's children, substantially increased funding to the states for public hospitals and taken pressure off the system by restoring the balance through our initiatives in private health care. 
Here are just two examples of those outcomes. When we came to government, Australia was ridiculed in international fora for its Third Word standard of immunisation. But, frankly, as a consequence of the sustained commitment of previous health ministers—and I particularly salute the pioneering work of Dr Wooldridge in the area of immunisation—Australia has hauled itself out of the Dark Ages. We can now move around health forums holding our head up high because of the extraordinarily accelerated rate at which Australian children are being immunised, as opposed to previous years. 
Let us look at the strengthening of the private health system. We know that in fiscal terms a blind ideological commitment to public health is completely unsustainable. It produces a situation where capitalist magnates of this country are receiving chunks of their health care massively subsidised by the public purse. Because of the opposition's blind commitment to this ideological obsession with public medicine, we have sought to both strengthen the availability of quality public medicine for those Australians who need it and ensure that Australians who have the capacity and the will to make greater personal financial contributions to their health care are encouraged to do so. In the long run we will make the public health system in this country more sustainable and more capable of delivering practical benefits to Australians who need them. Prior to the Howard government, immunisation coverage rates in Australia were as low as 53 per cent. By June 2003, over 91 per cent of 12- to 15-month-old children were fully immunised. This is an extraordinary achievement.
When I think about the great achievements of this government, I naturally begin in Parramatta with the fact that, when I was elected in 1996, unemployment was over 14 per cent. It is fitting that the Treasurer has just arrived for this debate, because I can also say that—as a consequence of the sustained discipline and coherence of the Commonwealth government's policy of running tight government expenditures, of maintaining surpluses instead of deficits, of not crowding out private sector investment and of not forcing up interest rates by profligate spending—unemployment in my electorate has fallen from 14 per cent to 4.7 per cent. That is for the September quarter for the Parramatta local government area. That is about a 10 per cent reduction and it means that literally hundreds and hundreds of families in my electorate have access to an income today who did not have one before. That is my idea of social justice. It is not about wearing a ribbon and putting out a press release; it is about reducing unemployment from 14 per cent to 4.75 per cent over eight years. I see that the Minister for Health and Ageing is at the table. People like the Treasurer, the minister for health and the Prime Minister have committed themselves to the hard yards, to the heavy lifting and to the unpopular tasks that so many others put off to a later date. 
—Haven't you got a state government? Didn't they do anything?
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Braddon seems to insist until I call him to order!
—The other day I visited the Australian Mint in Deakin. I walked past a poster on the wall that said, `Problems seldom solve themselves.'
—What are you looking aghast for, Pete?
—The member Braddon is warned!
—I am proud to be part of a government that, in the areas of health, education and community services, accepts the fundamental proposition that problems seldom solve themselves. They require leadership; they require individuals to stand up and be prepared to bear a little bit of pain, a little bit of risk, a little bit of heat. How much help have we had from the opposition in that regard? I am thrilled to welcome the new Leader of the Opposition's commitment to bipartisanship where a matter is clearly in the national interest. How many times have we seen the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, walk to the dispatch box and say, `This matter is so compellingly, obviously in the national interest that Labor will be delighted to support it'? How many times? In the eight years that I have been here, I do not recall those words ever leaving his lips. The Australian people turn to each other and ask, `Do they really think we are such mugs? Do they really think that the government is incapable of doing something good?' How much traction would the ALP get if, just once or twice, they supported a positive measure like the MedicarePlus package, which is currently before the Senate?
The matter of public importance refers to education. The amount of money spent on education per person in Australia today is higher than it has ever been in the history of this country. That is because of reforms introduced by this government; and again it is practical reform. It is reform which has responded to the expectations and the wishes of the community rather than dictating to them. It is not a `We know better than you' reform. It is not a `You will commit yourself to one form of education to the exclusion of all others' reform. We have strengthened the health system by allowing those who are able to make a greater contribution to the cost of their own health care to do so, and we have done the same in education. As a result, we have seen $2 billion in savings to the Commonwealth government because more and more Australian parents are making the decision to educate their children in the schools of their choice and according to the philosophical orientation and direction of their choice; and we have a much stronger education system as a consequence.  
This is another example of a bill—both the minister for health and the minister for education have bills before the Senate—involving a massive commitment of Commonwealth government expenditure to strengthen a critical sector of the Australian community's life, and we are being resisted and obstructed at every point by the Australian Labor Party. This is a test of leadership. This is a test of whether the member for Werriwa is capable of taking his party with him. I think that the member for Werriwa does suspect, deep down, that these measures are in the national interest. His fear is that if he takes the decisive step of concurring with the government so early in his time as leader he will be abandoned by his colleagues. So I call on the colleagues of the member for Werriwa to get behind their leader and take the bold step to deliver on the commitment of bipartisanship on matters which are in the national interest by supporting the passage of the government's A Fairer Medicare package and the higher education reforms in the Senate.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Education and Community Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,31,1,speech

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-12-04,"—I was speaking prior to question time and was saying that I was concerned at the way that the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 had been introduced in such haste, with work yet to be done on it to develop a cogent argument, an understanding of the bill itself—in the absence of a Bills Digest, which is not yet available. For such complex legislation I find it quite astounding that we are expected to debate and, indeed, vote on it on the last sitting day—if we in fact get through the second reading debate.
Indeed there are concerns that I outlined previously about this legislation that had been expressed by both employers and employees about some of what they see as conflicts between federal, state and territory legislation, particularly in the occupational health and safety areas. The minister suggests that the new Federal Safety Commissioner could deal with industrial manslaughter issues and crimes of safety negligence, but these roles are not, as I can see, spelt out in any detail in this legislation.
The issue of pattern bargaining, as I said, creates problems for both employers and employees, with the Australian Industry Group saying the definition of pattern bargaining in the bill fails to deal with the most damaging aspects of union behaviour that constitute pattern bargaining. But the AiG is also concerned that its own activities in regularly giving advice to members—that is, companies in its group—about union claims could also be construed as a means of pattern bargaining. I have noticed that other unions, such as the nurses union, in recent days have expressed concern about the implications such pattern bargaining laws might have eventually on their own and other professions, if indeed this industry-by-industry approach to industrial relations should be adopted as a matter of course.
There are concerns which demand consideration by a parliamentary inquiry, and that is why this bill has been referred to such an inquiry. There are concerns that the bill includes additional restrictions beyond those in section 89A of the existing Workplace Relations Act on the range of allowable award matters for the building and construction industry and the potential for these restrictions to be eventually applied in other industries. I will be interested when the minister sums up the second reading debate to see if he can address some of those issues that I have raised and no doubt others have raised in the course of this debate. There are a host of other issues that cannot be considered properly in the time constraints that again have been imposed on the House and this legislation on this scheduled last day of parliament. Here we are debating without even the benefit of a comprehensive Bills Digest.
As I said at the start of my speech, there is no doubt that some reform is needed in the building history. The Cole royal commission made that pretty clear, whatever the inadequacy of its terms of reference. I am not going to go into questions about the objectivity of a commissioner, because I would like to believe totally in our royal commission process as an objective and independent means of finding out about these important issues, but I did indicate earlier how some commentators have pointed out that the problems highlighted in the industry—the alleged violence and incidents and so on—are not numerous by any means and pale into insignificance compared to those considered in the 1980s royal commission by Costigan.
There are some serious questions raised as to whether or not this legislation is necessary, given that the workplace relations regime seems to be effective in dealing with the extent of the problems that have been identified. There are also contradictions in this bill that both employer and employee groups have pointed out. As I said about the 1997 workplace relations legislation, at this stage there is no way that I can support this workplace legislation. I will await a more measured assessment of the ramifications of and need for this bill when I see the outcome of that inquiry. 
It is the sort of inquiry that we, in the people's house, should be doing before we debate this legislation. We continually refer bills to the other place and to its legislative committees. I remember talking to the then Leader of the Opposition a year or so ago, just after the last election, and in all the talk about reform and democratising and making this place more relevant that was one of the issues that was brought up. Some interest was expressed in it. If we are to be relevant in the scheme of things—and I know, Mr Speaker, you are very interested in talking about a more meaningful debate in this place—then taking up some of the suggestions that have been made about second reading debates is essential so that the second reading stage of bills becomes more meaningful. But I really would suggest that, to give us the substance of the material that we need to debate properly, we should not see situations like this, where we have bills introduced without the necessary research material being available. The necessary legislation is automatically deferred to the other place, and that is not the role of legislators, which surely we are.
If we are going to continue down this path, then this place will become a somewhat irrelevant backwater in the scheme of things and the Senate will become the place where, as we have seen over the last couple of days, the real legislative work is done. I really do not think that that is what our electorates expect of their elected representatives. They want to see the opposition and crossbenchers, and sometimes even government members, suggest and move amendments in this place. That is what disappoints me about the way this legislation has been handled by the government. It leaves me no option but to say: not at this point can I support the bill as it stands.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I join with the member for Calare in saying that the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 is very disappointing legislation. The government's whole approach to industrial relations, and in particular this issue, has been very disappointing. This legislation is further evidence of the government's ideological hatred of unions. The decisions it has made in relation to this legislation have been driven not by the best interests of Australia and Australian workers but, rather, by the government's philosophical and ideological hatred of unions.
I believe this legislation has got the fingerprints of the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations all over it. This is his approach to all types of legislation: it is a win-all approach; it is a bullyboy approach; it is going in boots and all. We saw it this morning with the Medicare legislation, and we see it now with this legislation. This legislation is not built on consultation; it has come out of the Cole royal commission, a royal commission that was set up for one purpose, and one purpose alone—that is, to destroy a particular union and to attack a particular industry.
I am very disappointed with a number of aspects of this legislation. Coming from a background where I was very conscious of occupational health and safety, I think that there has been a great failure in this legislation to look at and embrace that issue. The construction industry has a very sore reputation when it comes to occupational health and safety and injury, and it is very disappointing that this has not been dealt with. 
This legislation, as I mentioned, follows the Cole royal commission into the building industry. As I also mentioned, it was driven by the government's ideological and philosophical hatred of unions rather than a genuine desire to improve the building and construction industry, to make it safer and more efficient or even to get better outcomes for all parties—that is, the workers, the employers, the contractors and those people who are involved in the construction of major projects.
The government has consistently sought to erode the bargaining capacity of Australian workers, and this legislation is a further example of that. It has a one-sided, confrontational approach to the reform of this industry and all industries. Its industrial approach is one of winner takes all, rather than one of consultation involving all parties and recognising that unions actually have an important role to play. They have a role in addressing and redressing the imbalance which exists within the work force. It is a way of addressing the power between the employer and the worker, and it benefits all. A strong union movement within a country, a nation and industry also benefits employers. Unfortunately, this government has not approached it in that way. It has failed to address the nonpayment of employees' entitlements, tax evasion in the building and construction industry and many of the other problems facing workers.
Obviously, on this side of the House we will not be supporting the bill, because it is flawed in a number of ways. This bill follows the Cole royal commission, which was established in August 2000. From memory, it reported to the government on 24 February. In September 2003, the government established the building industry interim task force following the Cole recommendations. Task force members were given powers as inspectors under the Workplace Relations Act, and their role was described as:
... an interim task force and partners that will investigate and refer possible prosecutions or other proceedings, breaches of the federal industrial crimes and civil law committed by any person or organisation engaged in the industry. In addition, the task force will refer any breaches of state law to appropriate state agencies.
The task force has since launched a number of prosecutions, mainly against union officials, which gives you an indication of the one-sided nature of this. The bill was tabled on 6 September and it is largely the same as the draft bill that was tabled in September this year. A Senate inquiry into the bill and other aspects of the industry has commenced and submissions are due by 30 November. It is expected that it will report in 2004.
I would like to return to the Cole royal commission, because it is the basis of this legislation. At the time, I saw it as one plank of the government's re-election policy. This is a very divisive government and it was seeking to set unions against employers and create division within the community. Unfortunately for the government, I do not think it has been so successful, because people—whether or not they are members of unions—recognise the fact that unions have an important role to play and that this government has been very one-sided in its approach.
The Cole royal commission cost taxpayers $60 million. It has been the most expensive royal commission in history, costing twice as much as the HIH commission. If you look at the enormous impact that it had on so many people in Australia, you have to wonder what the motivation is behind this government. On this side of the House, we do not wonder. We are very aware of this government's pursuit and ideological hatred of unions. The royal commissioner, Terence Cole, was paid $660,000—that is, three times more than the HIH royal commissioner. On top of that, he was given allowances and perks, including rental accommodation in Melbourne and Sydney. With his $140,554 Supreme Court pension, his total package was $900,000. It certainly was a lot of money. The lawyers to the royal commission were paid $21 million, and $700,000 was spent on media liaison—that is a lot of money. The fact that so much money was spent on media liaison makes you realise what was behind it all. 
Over 90 per cent of the public hearing time was devoted to investigating anti-union topics—once again it demonstrates the one-sided nature of this royal commission. No time at all was given to investigating anything positive about unions—once again it demonstrates where this government is coming from. Just a little over three per cent of the public hearing time was devoted to topics which adversely reflected upon employers. I do not know if the government is aware of it but, on this side of the House, we receive a lot of complaints from workers in industry. Actually, I receive many more complaints from workers than employers, although I do receive some from employers. It seems unrealistic that we should have a hearing that does not look at issues that affect workers and employers. Rather, we concentrate on attacking the unions. This was an exercise in attacking the CFMEU, which is the union that the royal commission gave all its attention to. As I was saying, 81 per cent of public hearing time was devoted to attacking the CFMEU. I do not think that is good enough, nor was it a good use of public funds.
This government really stands condemned for what it has done here. It is totally biased against unions, and there were 200 companies named. These companies were named because they were suspected of illegal or inappropriate behaviour, but only one of these companies was investigated. That is not an even-handed approach to such an important issue. A royal commission should be even-handed. If a royal commission is set up, then it should really look at all the issues, not only the issues that the government chooses for it to look at. There was an obvious blurring of the lines between the royal commission and the political arm of government, and I think that the people of Australia are not fooled by it.
I see that the biggest single issue affecting the Australian construction industry is workplace safety. It is not a new occurrence. It is not something that has just happened. It is something that has been there for a very long time, and this support and legislation do absolutely nothing to address that. The legislation mentions it, but I believe that it will actually lead to a watering down of the situation that exists at the moment. It does nothing to strengthen the state jurisdictions, and it is very much a knee-jerk response to what I see as the most important issue. Workplace health and safety is far too important an issue for buck-passing or political point scoring, but this is what this legislation does. It does not look at the fact that workers have had their lives placed at risk. The construction industry has the worst occupational health and safety record in Australia. There have been some 50 deaths a year over the last 10 years. I believe that the most important thing that any government can do is ensure the safety of its workers.
I am on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations, and earlier this year we held an inquiry into aspects of the workers compensation scheme. The minister was not too keen to look at the issue of workplace occupational health and safety. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that that area is of key importance to us as a nation and to workers in the industry. The underlying assumption going into this inquiry was that the most important issue facing the workers compensation schemes in Australia was fraud. What I think we actually learned was that the most important issue facing workers in the work force in Australia was having a safe workplace to work in. It was recommended that greater importance be placed on this and the fact that currently there was an unacceptably high level of workplace injury and fatality. Of course, right up there—right up front—was the building and construction industry. This inquiry did not find that workers compensation fraud was an issue. Rather, it found that unsafe practices in the workplace needed to be addressed and that we needed to have a national approach to the issue. 
If you look at the efficiency in the construction industry in Australia, you see that the building and construction industry contributes an average of six per cent to the GDP and employs around seven per cent of the work force, yet the industry is still plagued with this unacceptably high level of death and serious injury. Fifteen to 20 per cent of all workplace injuries happen on a building site; five times more time is lost due to accidents in the workplace than is lost through industrial disputes; and, as I said, there have been 50 deaths per year over the past 10 years. I encourage the government to look more seriously at the issue of occupational health and safety—to put away its boxing gloves, to forget that it wants confrontation with the union movement and to forget that it is out there to attack the construction industry. Rather, it should look at the industry, be positive and see whether it can come up with some occupational health and safety practices in the workplace that will actually address this issue. The government has established the federal safety commission. That is an attempt by the government to show that it is addressing the occupational health and safety issues, but it is in fact a watering down. We need the unions, and all people, to be involved in monitoring what is happening in the workplace.
It is interesting to see that the ACT government recently passed industrial manslaughter legislation. If there is any industry where you need to look at industrial manslaughter, it is the construction industry, because time and time again unsafe work practices are used. I will give one example of this which is very close to home. My son was working in the construction industry for a time, and the company that he was working for had a less than perfect work safety record. One of the workers had a steel bar driven through their leg. This particular employer refused to call an ambulance because they had already had one accident that week and if they called an ambulance and went through the proper procedures they would be reported to the WorkCover Authority in New South Wales. So they bypassed it and took the worker to the hospital in a car. They were criticised by the emergency department for that action. Needless to say, my son left that employer and moved to a different one. But it really shows some of the very unsafe practices that are used and which this government sanctions.
Included in this piece of legislation are other matters—restrictions on taking industrial action and issues relating to pattern bargaining—that will weaken the powers of unions. That they will make it a more one-sided industry and skew the balance even further in favour of the employer makes this legislation totally unacceptable, and I condemn the government for not approaching and encompassing these issues fairly and in an even-handed manner. Legislation looking at any industry should take into account all factors. It should not be one-sided and driven by hatred—an ideological hatred of the union movement.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 represents a unique opportunity to implement lasting cultural reform in this industry, and the case for reform is compelling. The Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry exposed an industry in which the rule of law no longer has any meaningful application.
This central finding of the royal commission has been reinforced by three court decisions in the past month: firstly, Mr John Sutton, National Secretary of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU, was found guilty of two charges of malicious damage; secondly, the New South Wales District Court convicted Mr Salvatore Manna, a former CFMEU official, for perjury arising out of evidence he gave to the royal commission; and, thirdly and finally, the Melbourne Magistrates Court convicted Mr John Setka, another CFMEU official, for issuing threats against a construction manager who was to appear against him in a case in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In addition to these three court findings, as I advised parliament earlier this week, a union official was transported to the Geelong Hospital by air ambulance to be treated for the serious injuries he received when he was bashed during a recent Victorian plumbing union planning day at Lorne. (Quorum formed)
I appreciate the calling of a quorum by the member for Cowan because it gives me the opportunity of pointing out to my colleagues the culture of thuggery, intimidation and violence which is part of the building and construction industry in Australia. As I was pointing out, just recently a union official from the plumbing union had to be transported by air ambulance from Lorne to the Geelong Hospital because of injuries he had received in a planning strategy meeting being conducted by that union. This follows another recent incident in which Mr Doug Cameron, a well known union official, was assaulted—bashed outside the front door of his own home. 
—This is appalling.
—It is appalling. We have reached the stage in Australia where not only do we have thuggery, intimidation and violence on the building and construction sites of Australia, but a leading union official in Australia cannot walk outside the front door of his own home in suburban Sydney without being bashed. That is what this legislation is about. These examples illustrate the finding of Mr Justice Cole that parts of the building and construction industry are mired in a culture of lawlessness, intimidation and thuggery. This is why the government is determined to deal with this culture in this bill.
Some opposition members have been prepared to recognise that there is lawlessness and thuggery in this industry. In at least a couple of the speeches from opposition MPs tonight we have had some recognition of this culture of lawlessness. The reality is that they are prepared to do nothing about it. They recognise it but are not prepared to lift a finger to do one thing which is practical in terms of stamping out this lawlessness so far as the building and construction industry is concerned. A key plank of this bill is the most significant reform of the building and construction industry ever attempted. The bill implements about 120 of the royal commissioner's recommendations. It is a targeted and measured response to its findings.
The government's response to the royal commission's other recommendations have already been announced. I commend this response to honourable members opposite—particularly the honourable member for Shortland, who spoke prior to me—as they appear to be under a misapprehension about the extent of the action that the government is taking to address the other issues of concern in the industry, such as employee entitlements, tax avoidance, phoenix companies and occupational health and safety. As I stated in the second reading speech for the bill, clear and substantial economic benefits will flow from a revitalised building industry. So that all members of the House understand the potential benefits, I will repeat the findings of Econtech in their independent analysis. 
—It is shonky analysis by a shonky outfit.
—I note—and it is on the Hansard record—that the member for Rankin has said that the independent analysis by Econtech is shonky. This analysis shows that if labour productivity in the commercial construction sector matched that in the domestic housing sector then the CPI would be one per cent lower, GDP would be one per cent higher and consumers would enjoy an additional $2.3 billion in economic benefits each year—that is, $2,300 million in economic benefits each year. This surely rebuts the allegations made by members opposite, including the member for Brisbane. The changes proposed by the bill will benefit all Australians, not just those engaged in this particular industry. Beyond the economic benefits, all industry participants will also benefit from being able to work in an industry that is free from coercion and allows them to exercise free choice about whether or not to join a union or enter into a particular type of employment arrangement. For far too long, basic freedoms in this industry have been undermined, with arrangements often forced upon unwilling parties.
The bill ensures that choice will be a real option. All industry participants, including workers—and obviously the members opposite do not want to hear this. (Quorum formed) From my 12 years in parliament in both opposition and government I know quite well that there is only one reason why oppositions call quorums: they do not like to hear what is being said. That is the reality tonight. The reality tonight is that, so far as the building and construction industry is concerned, we have an opposition which recognise a culture of thuggery, a culture of intimidation, a culture of coercion and a culture of lawlessness. The royal commissioner, in 23 volumes, set out word-by-word why this industry needs reform. The opposition do not want to hear about it.
A couple of their members in this debate tonight were prepared to concede that there was a culture of lawlessness, but the reality is that not one of them is prepared to lift their hand to do anything constructive to deal with the culture of lawlessness. This is a singular industry so far as this culture of thuggery is concerned—a culture in which bashings are commonplace and are not only occurring on building sites in Australia, as Justice Cole pointed out.
—So are deaths.
—The honourable member for Cowan knows that in the city of Perth, just like in the city of Melbourne, this culture of lawlessness is part and parcel of the building and construction industry. The real test not only for the Labor Party but also for the new Leader of the Opposition is whether or not they are prepared to do something. Is the Leader of the Opposition prepared to do something about that which he has protested against for the last 10 years or so in the federal parliament? We have in the member for Werriwa—the new leader of the Australian Labor Party, the new Leader of the Opposition—a man who has had so many positions on so many issues that he has a policy position about everything.  
The real test for the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this bill and to the government's workplace relations legislation is whether or not he is prepared to stand up to the big union bosses. He has said on numerous occasions quite clearly and unambiguously that the Australian Labor Party should not be captive to the unions. No wonder that almost every major union leader in Australia was lobbying over the last weekend for the election of the member for Brand rather than the member for Werriwa as the Leader of the Opposition. 
What we have on the other side, in a 47-45 division, is a deeply divided Labor Party. They are divided on no more central issue than that of workplace relations. We have in the Leader of the Opposition someone who, in his own words, recognises that the influence of the union movement in Australia is a part of the industrial dinosaurs of the past. I suspect in his own heart that the member for Rankin also agrees with that proposition. In fact he is smiling to me, so I know he agrees with that. I remember what the union boss in Queensland, Bill Ludwig, who is a great defender of the power of the great union bosses in Australia, said about the member for Rankin.
—The member for Cowan knows this as well. There is a deeply divided Australian Labor Party at the present time and, of all the issues on which they are deeply divided, workplace relations and the role of the big union bosses in Australia are key components. That is why this piece of legislation is a real test for the new Leader of the Opposition. Is he going to be a captive of the union movement as the member for Hotham—the previous Leader of Opposition and former president of the ACTU—was? Or are we going to have in the member for Werriwa, the new leader of the Australian Labor Party, someone who is prepared to actually put into action that which he has espoused over the last decade? That is the real test, the real question, that the Australian Labor Party, in electing the member for Werriwa, will be facing in coming years. A central issue to this test will be the attitude of the Australian Labor Party to the workplace relations reforms that this government has put into place.
Let me just draw the context of these reforms. The economic reforms which this government has driven over the last 7½ years, including structural reforms to the workplace, have been the reason for the creation of 1.3 million jobs in Australia.
—The honourable member for Rankin makes some comments. May I remind him of the speech which the former Prime Minister of Australia, the former leader of the Australian Labor Party, Paul Keating, made in April 1994, I think it was, in which he spoke about the important need to continue the freeing up of the industrial relations workplace in Australia. We have a Labor Party which has been backing away from the reforms that even Paul Keating—who the current Leader of the Opposition says is one of his heroes in the Labor Party—supported. The reality is that 1.3 million jobs have been created in Australia since the Howard government took office. The unemployment rate in this country is now down to 5.6 per cent—a rate below which it has never been for the last 22 years in Australia. Unemployment has come down, longterm unemployment has come down by twothirds and youth unemployment has also come down in Australia. This is a result of the economic decisions and the structural reforms, particularly those reforms to the workplace, that this government has made.  
Honourable members interjecting—
—The honourable members opposite know this in their heart of hearts—particularly the member for Rankin, who is not a great supporter of big union bosses. The real test is whether or not they are the captives of the unions that have dominated the Australian Labor Party. We have a situation in Australia where five out of six workers in the private sector do not belong to unions, yet 80 per cent of the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party are subject to their union bosses. That is the situation we have in Australia at the present time. If the Australian Labor Party want to be relevant, they will change that like the Leader of the Opposition says. If they want to be relevant and drive down unemployment and lock it in at historic lows, they will support this legislation. (Time expired)
 (Ms Corcoran)—Order! The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations invoked a number of recent incidents in relation to building union officials to seek to justify this pernicious, punitive legislation. In fact, there is no such justification at all. The minister referred in particular to an assault against Mr Doug Cameron, the secretary of the AMWU, and sought to argue—fatuously—that this constituted evidence for the value of this particular legislation to crack down on union thuggery. In this case, the union official was assaulted, so I do not think anyone could necessarily establish a case that this constituted union thuggery. In fact, the head of a major union in Australia was assaulted.
—He was assaulted by another member of a union, wasn't he?
—That has not been established, yet this legislation is purportedly to deal with such assaults. Perhaps the member opposite has never heard of the criminal law, which in fact makes assault illegal. Therefore, there is no basis for bringing into this parliament this vicious anti-union legislation.
In fact, I understand that a rough description of the person who assaulted Mr Doug Cameron was that he was in his early 20s and well dressed. It is equally possible that he was assaulted by a Young Liberal. There is a fair bit of violence in Liberal Party branches around Australia—there is certainly lots of intimidation if you look at developments in Sydney in particular. The member for Wentworth has been subject to a lot of activity in his own electorate. I am saying that it is equally plausible that the person who committed this assault against Mr Doug Cameron was in fact a Young Liberal. On the basis of the logic that has been invoked in this case, we should have anti Young Liberal legislation. Perhaps we could have the Anti Young Liberal Amendment Bill. Such is the weight of evidence that the minister has brought that it is equally plausible that the person who assaulted Mr Cameron was not in fact a union official at all but a Young Liberal. Although, I know, it is getting late in the evening, perhaps the minister would consider introducing legislation to ban the activities of the Young Liberals in Sydney. It is equally plausible that it was the Young Liberals. We could have the Young Liberal Intimidation Amendment Bill perhaps being introduced into this parliament, so fatuous is the case that this government has put to justify this pernicious, punitive legislation. It is arguing that because Mr Cameron was assaulted there needs to be tough anti-union legislation in the building industry. It is laughable.
But we should not laugh about this sad reality: a couple of months ago a young man, Mr Joel Exner, a 16-year-old boy, fell from a building site in Sydney. He was not protected by anything: he had no safety harness, there was no guard rail and there was no scaffolding. Yet I never hear this minister say, `There is a problem in the building industry. There was a fatality in the building industry so we need to bring in tough new laws to deal with breaches of occupational health and safety in the building industry.' We do not hear that from the Liberals. They are total hypocrites.
Any suggestion of an assault against a union official justifies this legislation but this minister has gone missing when it comes to dealing with the sickening, regular fatalities in this industry, which average one per week. I do not hear this minister calling for tough new occupational health and safety laws in this country to deal with that negligence.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I have not gone missing; I am right here. It seems that the member for Rankin is seriously suggesting that the numerous instances of intimidation, thuggery and coercion in the building industry which Justice Cole indicated in his royal commission were not real. It seems the member for Rankin is seriously questioning the conclusions that have been independently made by judicial officers in separate courts in Victoria and New South Wales—conclusions in which, for example, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, John Sutton, was found guilty of two charges of malicious damage and former New South Wales CFMEU official Mr Salvatore Manna was found guilty of perjury in his evidence before the royal commission.
—And that is assault, is it? That is violence?
—If the member for Rankin wants to hear about an instance of assault, then the decision of Magistrate Gurvich in the Melbourne Magistrates Court in which Mr John Setka, another CFMEU official—
—That was not assault.
—Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, I know I should not under the standing orders but I wish to respond to the interjection of the member for Rankin. He says that what John Setka did was not assault. I point out to the member for Rankin that if he understood the law—as the member for Banks opposite does—he would know that assault includes verbal intimidation.
—The member for Rankin scoffs, but the member for Banks knows the law. 
—It could.
—This case involved a finding of issuing threats against a construction manager—and even the member for Banks will admit, because I know he knows his law reasonably well, that that constitutes assault. So let us have an end to this nonsense. Instances of assault, threats and intimidation have been found independently by judicial officers in Australia. Their findings support the findings of Justice Terrence Cole, a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court of some 10 years standing. I am not from New South Wales, but that is my recollection, and I do not believe that the member for Rankin is questioning the integrity of Justice Cole.
—You are happy to, are you? Is that right?
 (Mr Barresi)—The member for Rankin will have his chance in a moment.
—So the member for Rankin is questioning the integrity of Justice Cole. I think the member for Rankin is digging himself a ditch tonight, and when he wakes up tomorrow morning and reflects upon this he might think differently. The opposition spokesman on this matter is now questioning a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court, who—and I will check this out—was probably appointed by the current New South Wales Labor government; there is a good chance of that. It does not matter in any event, because I do not believe the judges of the New South Wales court are subject to questions of integrity anywhere.
Let us face the reality. We all know that the building and construction industry for years and years has been subject to a culture of intimidation and coercion. That is not in question. The question is: what are we going to do about it? In a meeting with me last week, the state workplace relations ministers—John Della Bosca of New South Wales and others—all conceded that there is a culture of lawlessness in this industry. The real question is: what is going to be done about it? We are prepared to do something about it, but the opposition are wimping away.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,48,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—Labor would never condone violence and intimidation. The point I am making is that a young boy, aged 16, fell off a building site and, when asked about it, this minister was silent. I think an extreme violence is when a young boy falls off a building site, having been on that site in employment for three days with no decent occupational health and safety provisions in place—no guardrail, no harness, no scaffolding. The boy died, and the minister was silent. That is the point I made earlier: the minister has gone missing in relation to the death of Joel Exner.
The minister thinks it is a dreadfully serious matter when a person says something adverse to another, but when a young boy dies it is not serious. Three years earlier a 17-year-old boy fell off a site in Sydney in very similar circumstances—again, there was no harness, no guardrail and no scaffolding. The company was fined $20,000 and three years later had paid less than $2,000 of that fine. There was a rally of 10,000 proud trade union members in Sydney, and the minister was asked about that. And he was silent.
Extreme violence is displayed when a young man falls to his death because of the lack of occupational health and safety regulations being implemented on building sites. On average, one person in this industry dies every week. The minister invoked the analysis of an economics outfit, Econtech, which squeals that it costs 40 per cent more to put a wall on a high-rise building than it does on a house. This is supposed to be testament to shocking productivity in the construction industry. I say it should cost more to put a wall on a high-rise building than it does on a house for one simple reason: it is dangerous to work on high-rise buildings. 
As a consequence, it is necessary in a decent and civilised society that there be safety provisions on high-rise buildings that are not necessarily applied to houses. But the minister and the Liberal Party missed this point completely. It appears that the Liberal Party is prepared to cut costs, to cut corners, to cut safety in this industry, and decent Australians will not stand for it. They will not stand for this winner takes all attitude and going for the cheapest bid even if it prejudices the safety of the young men who are employed in this industry.
This legislation is pernicious because it restricts the right of entry of union safety experts onto sites to examine the workplace health and safety provisions on those sites and to enforce them. This minister and this government do not want to see that happen, because they are into cost cutting; they are into safety cutting. You can cut costs if you cut safety, and that is what the Liberal Party believes in—the lowest bottom line, the cheapest bid, at the expense potentially of the lives of young people and older people employed in this industry. It is not all about the bottom line. What value does this minister put on a human life, when one person in this industry dies every week and the Cole royal commission found only two breaches of occupational health and safety? Around Australia, they found only two breaches, in Darwin.
That is why I say the Cole royal commission was biased and that is why we have in place now a Senate references committee to examine the occupational health and safety shortages and deficiencies in this industry around Australia. That is why this bill will not pass through the Senate—because this Cole royal commission either ignored completely or glossed over major issues, including occupational health and safety in this industry. This is a bill that was designed to fail from the outset.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I have been informed, subsequent to my previous remarks, that Justice Cole was appointed by the New South Wales Labor government to the Court of Appeal in 1998. In relation to occupational health and safety, the honourable member for Rankin totally ignores the fact that there are provisions in this bill for a Federal Safety Commissioner. He totally ignores the agreement and understanding between the Commonwealth and state and territory ministers in order to progress the occupational health and safety recommendations of the Cole commission through the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission—a decision that was unanimously agreed by not only me but also the Labor state and territory workplace relations ministers a couple of weeks ago in Melbourne.
If there was any credibility whatsoever to the honourable member's assertions now, then in the amendment he moved in the House tonight—in which he refers to a number of issues, including employee entitlements and tax evasion in the building and construction industry—he would have referred to occupational health and safety. There is no reference whatsoever to that in the amendment that the member for Rankin moved in this House. The reality is that this is all fluffery from the member for Rankin; he is just making a political statement. I have said what needs to be said.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—The remarks of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations prove once and for all that he is sublimely oblivious to the terms of reference of the Senate inquiry which of course do include occupational health and safety. Such is the contempt with which he treats the Senate that he is unaware of the terms of reference of that inquiry. It also gives us a very early indication of the sincerity of this government in cooperating with that Senate inquiry. If the government do not know what it is inquiring into, I do not think we can expect a lot of cooperation from it—but then there are no surprises in that, because this bill, as I was saying, is designed to fail.
This is not a bill designed to reform the building and construction industry; it is a bill designed to fail so that this minister, Minister Andrews, following carefully in the footsteps of his predecessor, Minister Abbott, can go to the industry and say, `Gee, look, we tried, but those terrible people in the Senate knocked us back.' Of course his predecessor, who is sitting right beside him, has got form on this because he did not get much through the Senate in the way of workplace relations bills. That was also because of his pig-headed attitude and because the legislation was against the interests of the decent working men and women of Australia, and the Senate in its wisdom rejected those bills. I think he only got one out of about 13 through. This minister, his successor, is not looking any better in terms of his capacity as a legislator, because the Senate would not treat very happily the minister's ignorance of the terms of reference of the inquiry that has been established by the Senate. 
I point out this bill is not only designed to fail but also not deregulatory at all. The member for Kingston is here, and he knows a little about the market. The great contradiction of this government is that it says that the bill is deregulatory but it runs to hundred of pages of regulation of the building and construction industry. If the government was fair dinkum about being deregulatory, it would not have such a bill. But it wants to regulate the building and construction industry. I understand the basic philosophy behind this—that is, when unions are strong, when unions have a capacity in their own right to achieve decent wages and conditions for their employees, the government seeks to regulate them. But when employees are not in such a position—when they do not have much bargaining capacity in the first place and they seek to join a trade union movement—the government seeks to deregulate the industry.
The common theme is that the government seeks to tilt the bargaining table consistently in favour of employers and against employees. That is the common theme, not that it is regulatory or deregulatory. On some occasions, it is highly regulatory and, on other occasions, it is really deregulatory—that is, when it tears away the safety net protecting the lowest paid workers in Australia. But, in this case, it is really regulatory—it wants to heavily regulate. You would find no more astonishing critic of this government in this case than the HR Nicholls Society. They have been very critical of this bill. They are your friends. The Minister for Health and Ageing, the former minister for workplace relations, has addressed the HR Nicholls Society on many occasions.
—I think the Treasurer used to be a member.
—The Treasurer was a member. I certainly know that the Treasurer has addressed the HR Nicholls Society. So what does the HR Nicholls Society say about this mob? They do not like the bill—`very complex', `highly regulatory'. So there is your arch critic, Minister. You are being criticised by your mob, the HR Nicholls Society, for a very complex bill—which of course will not do anything to improve productivity in this industry. It is designed to fail.
I refer the minister to discussion paper No. 150, commissioned by the Cole royal commission and then disregarded because that discussion paper showed that, by international standards, productivity in this industry is high—ranking in many instances, by various indicators, first or second compared with the other countries with which we like to compare ourselves. So how about a cooperative approach to reform? I do not think there is a chance in hell, because this bill is designed to fail. The ACTU offered a cooperative approach many months ago, and it was completely ignored by this government. (Time expired)

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—Once again the government has introduced a piece of superannuation legislation that, if passed, is destined to make the superannuation system more difficult for consumers to navigate. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 follows this government's pattern of introducing legislation in a confused and ad hoc manner, the result of which has been to make the superannuation system more complicated and expensive for consumers. In principle, the concept of choice is fine when the choices are clearly set out and well understood; however, the legislation fails because it gives choice without the necessary safeguards. Choice without the necessary safeguards does not serve the interests of either the consumer or the superannuation industry.
Of course, it needs to be acknowledged that for many fund members choice of fund already exists, and roughly 80 per cent have investment choice within their existing fund. Unfortunately for many, that has been a very expensive choice. One only has to look at those consumers who invested in Commercial Nominees and lost thousands of dollars or those who faced exit fees of up to 93 per cent of the funds under management to understand the personal cost to consumers of an uninformed choice in an unsafe choice environment. On the other hand, many do not exercise the right of choice because they simply do not have the skills to navigate the bureaucracy involved in changing fund or are trapped by excessive exit fees. 
The Liberals' unsafe choice regime is not only unsafe but also so complex that it does nothing to reduce the bureaucracy that deters many people who are already able from changing funds, and, as one would expect from the Liberals, it does not deal with exit fees that operate as a barrier to choice. The Liberals' unsafe choice regime does not even attempt to address the existing problems of the superannuation system, not to speak of the other issues of safety and security that must be resolved to ensure safety in a choice environment.
Superannuation is unique. Investing in it is not like buying a car or even a home; it is a highly complex financial product to which considerable tax concessions are attached. The nine per cent superannuation guarantee, which makes up the major part of superannuation savings, is compulsory saving. These two factors alone justify giving superannuation purchased by SG contributions greater protection than that given to other financial products. In addition, superannuation is a long-term investment, where the impact of a bad decision can take years to emerge and may be impossible to redress. This alone justifies tougher regulation. Labor has a policy to introduce a safe choice model. Only when the superannuation environment is secure and safe for all workers will Labor support the introduction of choice.
The story with the Liberals' unsafe choice regime is different. At a time when confidence in the superannuation system is low, the last thing the superannuation system needs is added uncertainty and insecurity, but that is what the Liberals' choice regime will do—it will increase insecurity—because it does not address the question of safety. That is why Labor will introduce a safe choice system—choice that will give consumers the ability to decide where to put their superannuation moneys but within a framework that allows for real choice, accompanied by appropriate safety.
Despite the current public pessimism about superannuation and the overwhelming evidence in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that there are significant problems associated with the unsafe choice regime that this bill would establish, the Liberals have refused to acknowledge the problems and issues that need to be addressed before a safe choice environment can be established. Foremost amongst these issues is that of adequate disclosure, particularly on the effect of fees, charges and commissions on superannuation accumulations. Consumers cannot be expected to make real choices if they do not understand what they are choosing between and if they do not know the bottom line. There is ample evidence that consumers do have great difficulty in understanding financial information in general. The ANZ financial literacy survey confirmed what many already suspected: Australians' understanding of financial matters, and in particular superannuation, is not strong. The Liberal government of course argues that the new disclosure regime introduced as part of the FSR process will resolve this problem. Let me make it clear: it will not.
Apart from the fact that disclosure alone will not be enough to ensure that consumers fully understand the choices they are making, recent research on the ASIC disclosure model has shown there are major problems with the model and that, even with the recommended changes, the model is inadequate. Chant West produced a report on behalf of ASFA about ASIC's fee disclosure model, which concluded that, even if the model were significantly amended to reflect ASFA's recommendations, it would remain inadequate. The report says: 
Even with such improvements however, it is not clear that consumers will be able to understand ASIC's fee tables or make valid comparisons of bottom line costs.
The research uncovered a number of shortcomings apart from the difficulties in understanding the fee tables in the ASIC fee disclosure model. Investment fees are not well disclosed in many funds, and other fees are not consistently reported. In other cases, the manner of reporting of fees can be misleading. Labor has always supported the introduction of choice—a safe choice model in which the individual is able to make a real and informed choice. The Liberals' unsafe choice regime, with its totally inadequate disclosure model, fails to meet that requirement.
Even if the ASIC disclosure model were adequate—and it is not—the Liberals' choice regime is still unsafe. It is clearly recognised by all in the superannuation industry that consumer education is essential; that is, consumers need to acquire the skills to interpret the information disclosed in order to be able to make educated and informed choices. Let us return to the ANZ financial literacy survey results. According to the results of this survey, even though on average the population had reasonable mathematical skills:
... applying these skills to the comprehension of financial statements presented some challenges ...
The understanding of basic investment fundamentals was extremely poor. In particular, the relationship between risk and return—a fundamental relationship in the investment context—was not at all well understood. Yet the Liberals, in the face of all this information, insist on inflicting on the public their unsafe choice regime, a regime that would leave consumers very much the prey of unscrupulous sectors of the financial services industry willing to exploit those lacking in financial literacy skills—the skills needed to understand and interpret crucial information about superannuation.
The Liberals' answer to the education issue is to propose funding to educate consumers about their choice regime after it is in place. Not only is that too late—consumers need to be educated before choice comes into operation—but the amount allocated to education, roughly $1.60 for each individual, is clearly ridiculous. Just how much education can you provide for $1.60? Certainly not enough to equip the average consumer with the information and skills required to make a real and informed choice. It is not even enough to fund a fridge magnet saying: `Watch out for suspicious people providing bad financial advice'.
The inadequacy of the government's total expenditure of $28.7 million over four years has been recognised by the industry. At the inquiry into this bill the ASFA representative stated his belief that $28.7 million would not go very far in a `campaign that would catch most people'. The representative of the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre at the University of NSW also argued the amount was inadequate, and the representative for the Industry Funds Forum summed it all up succinctly:
I think that, by any measure, $28.7 million spent over four years is not going to achieve the sorts of objectives we would say are appropriate for an education campaign. 
As already pointed out, the fact that the Liberals' meagre education program is not scheduled to start until the Liberals' unsafe choice regime is in place speaks for itself—it is a case of the cart coming before the horse if ever there was one. A striking comparison can, of course, be made with the Liberals' GST advertisements, which came well ahead of the introduction of the GST. It certainly lets us all know exactly where the Liberals' priorities lie, and it certainly is not with the ordinary worker battling to save some money for retirement. 
This brings me to another important issue—that of fees, charges and commissions. This is another problem that the Liberals will not concede exists, and yet the effect of high fees and charges and the even more deceptive commissions on a fund member's account can be significant, running into tens of thousands of dollars over a fund member's working life. I have already pointed out that high exit fees operate as a barrier to changing funds, but they are also in some cases so excessive that they have a devastating effect on an individual's retirement savings.
At the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation into the since disallowed portability regulations, one submission included a list of examples of excessive exit fees. These excessive exit fees ranged from nine per cent to 93 per cent of the balance of the superannuation account. A 93 per cent exit fee is obscene. Is it any wonder many people are now turning away from superannuation? We have heard of even higher levels of exit fees, the most extreme cases leaving the fund member owing the fund money. I think this is a convenient place for me to stop.
—I reassure the member for Kingston that he has the call and the chair has not interrupted him.
—I am simply trying to expedite the rest of the day.
—I appreciate that the member for Kingston may have a certain passion to be heading back to the electorate of Kingston, but he has the call right now.
—Labor believes that the nine per cent compulsory SG deserves to be protected from losses due to excessive fees and charges. It also recognises the difficulties faced by consumers in interpreting the effects of a commission and its impact on superannuation accounts, and it consequently believes that commissions on superannuation paid for by SG contributions should be prohibited. Of course, the Liberals argue that choice will open up the market to competition with the result that fees and charges will decrease. This is an assumption with no basis in fact. On the contrary, there is evidence that the opposite occurs in a so-called free-for-all market in retirement products. For example, in both Britain and Chile massive increases in charges occurred when the market was opened to unregulated competition. What is more, the evidence from industry surveys indicates that in Australia, in circumstances where choice now exists, the costs are generally higher and the returns lower.
With unregulated competition, fees are pushed up by the huge marketing and promotion costs involved in competition for the superannuation dollar, not to speak of the rewards paid to the sales force: the financial advisers and planners. The Liberals' free market superannuation regime will not decrease costs; it will instead generate new costs that will ultimately fall on the consumer. We all need to remember that fees, charges and commissions can significantly erode superannuation savings. A one or two per cent annual fee reduces the final retirement income by 22 and 40 per cent respectively, and a five per cent fee reduces it by a huge 60 per cent—a frightening statistic. The Liberals' choice regime also ignores the current practice of financial service organisations offering incentives to employers to use their particular fund. This is a practice that in a choice environment would no doubt continue, with the objective of getting the employer to pressure employees into the employer's chosen fund. 
Labor will not endorse the Liberals' choice regime—a regime that does not control fees and charges and commissions on superannuation products purchased with SG contributions. It is a regime that will ultimately result in an increase in costs with a corresponding decrease in superannuation savings. Nor will Labor tolerate a regime that does not prohibit inducements made to employers.
What about small business? Has the government thought at all about the effect of its unsafe choice regime on the operations and profitability of small business? The Liberals, the party that purports to represent small business but that introduced the small business nightmare of the GST, now wishes to impose on small business another expensive and time-consuming burden: unregulated choice of superannuation fund. Just imagine that you have a small business with 15 employees and each employee chooses a different fund. That will mean 15 different lots of paperwork and the cost of time spent sorting it all out. It is another Liberal government small business bureaucratic nightmare, when small business will not recover from the last bureaucratic nightmare, the GST.
Finally, a word about the Liberals' interpretation of choice—the Liberals' very flexible interpretation of choice and of their own philosophy. The Liberals want to introduce choice where choice serves the interests of their supporters in the financial services industry: the large financial services organisations that will benefit from the Liberals' unsafe choice regime. But when it comes to other choices they are not so generous in their interpretation. Australians are free to choose the partner they wish, including a same-sex partner, but the Liberals will not allow fund members in same-sex relationships to make the same choices as all other couples—that is, they deny couples in same-sex relationships the same rights as the rest of the community to provide for their partner's retirement security. The government should remember that it is their money and they have the right to provide for their dependants. The Liberals' choice regime effectively discriminates against those who choose to live in same-sex relationships and denies them a choice available to all others. It illustrates the hypocrisy of the Liberals' approach to choice and even to liberalism.
Labor does not support a bill that will introduce unsafe choice. Therefore, I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House declines to give the Bill a second reading, and regards it as an `unsafe choice' Bill because:
(1)	there is no provision for clear, simple and comparable disclosure so that consumers can understand the total impact of fees and charges;
(2)	excessive entry and exit fees, which act as barriers to choice, are not banned, nor is there provision for the regulation of any fees, charges and, in particular commissions on investing the compulsory 9% super-annuation guarantee contributions that can significantly erode superannuation savings;
(3)	there is no exemption for small business, further burdening it with red-tape and paperwork and the consequential financial costs;
(4)	it causes complications for those superannuation funds which provide low cost life insurance for members, with the consequence that many funds will cease to provide a life insurance option;
(5)	there is no provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program;
(6)	there is no provision to include same sex couples in the choice regime, further perpetuating the existing dis-crimination against same sex couples in relation to superannuation rights; and 
 (7)	there is no prohibition on financial service providers offering inducements to employers to direct superannuation to a particular fund where the fund selected may not be the one that best represents the employees' interests”.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I will not say very much just now. We will have an opportunity a little later to say more about what this government's changes will mean to Australian universities and to our students and their families. We do support increased funding to universities, so we will support these amendments that at least add a little more to the funding that is so desperately needed by our universities. This government has cut $5 billion from our universities over the last seven years. It is because of those cuts that our universities find themselves in such difficult circumstances. It is because of those cuts that our university students are finding themselves in overcrowded classrooms and that staff find themselves overloaded with more and more students as there just are not enough staff.
It is a good thing that the government is putting some additional funding into our universities, but this still goes nowhere near making up for the massive level of budgetary pressure that the government has put our universities under. So, yes, we will support these changes, but of course we will continue to campaign over the next few months leading up to the election to press the government to do even more for our universities. Labor's policy is on the table. We have indicated how we will fund our universities in a way that makes sure that the demands on the universities to provide outstanding, world-class university education can be delivered.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I rise today to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. It is an appropriate bill. I listened to the member for Kingston speak. He is a person in this place who I have a personal regard for. I was surprised by his speech, which was definitely not one of his better ones. It really failed to come to the heart of things—that this bill is about providing choice to those in the work force as to whether they want to invest in one particular superannuation fund or another. We all know that the Labor Party likes to have a monolithic approach to life whereby the government controls everything and the marketplace does not determine what people do, but we on this side of the House believe in the marketplace as the appropriate way to go. We believe in choice: the freedom of individuals to make the decisions that affect their lives. 
There are few things that affect people's lives more than the choice of superannuation. People come to me on a constant basis saying, `I invested in a particular fund group, and the amount that I received from that group is not sufficient.' Particularly last year, when the American market slid, people in certain high-profile investment schemes found that the value of their superannuation funds had dropped. As a person who actually invested in one of those funds, I sympathise and empathise with their consideration. Of course I moved to have my funds put in another superannuation scheme, and that is the way it should go.
There is a choice: either your superannuation fund performs or you shift. That is the marketplace. That is what people are used to. They do not want the government determining that they should have only one scheme. They do not want a corporation saying, `This is the company's scheme, and that is the way it goes.' Even with a very large organisation in Australia—it is one of the top 10 in Australia; and a number of people in my electorate are employed by that particular organisation—only two weeks ago some people came to tell me the difficulties they had when wanting to opt out of that scheme and go into another one, because they do not believe that their superannuation fund is performing as it should.
I was concerned about that, and it highlights the fact that we do need the choice and we do need the competitive environment to make sure super funds are performing in the best manner and that they are getting appropriate returns. I believe that is one of the key issues that people are concerned about in our community, so I am surprised at the speech by the member for Kingston on this issue. On the question of choice, I heard him speak about gay couples. I thought that that was a separate issue that should be debated at another time rather than muddying the waters in terms of this particular bill, which is quite clear. It is clear that the Australian people want options when it comes to superannuation, and the coalition is being responsible and providing that choice. This bill is a measure which is designed to take the superannuation industry forward. It is a step forward by a progressive and economically prudent government, and it goes a long way to confirming Australia's status as having one of the world's soundest superannuation sectors.
I think of the time when you and I first left school, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. One went into various schemes and the money was left behind. I speak for myself: for the first 20 years of my life, I do not know what happened to those funds. I saw very little of them. They just disappeared. There was no choice in terms of the scheme you were in. The money was often left behind or the returns were so poor that it was hardly worth picking them up.
Now of course it is a very different situation. There is a requirement that people should prepare for their own retirement. Right from the beginning, the funds should be separated out and should not be touched. An important part of that is this question of choice. It is important with the ageing of Australia and the demographic shift. We think that, by 2042, over half the population will be aged 45 and over, and a third will be aged over 55. In my electorate alone, over 18½ per cent of my electorate is aged over 65. I listen to the superannuation choices that they made and the regrets that some of them have. I believe the ability to choose one's super scheme is quite fundamental. 
The size of the superannuation industry in Australia is significant. It is a significant part of the economy. In fact, as of December 2002, Australia had approximately 250,000 separate superannuation funds, which manage in excess of $A500 billion in assets on behalf of 25.1 million accounts. Further, for the year ended December 2002, aggregate contributions to superannuation funds amounted to $A51.7 billion, while benefit payments amounted to $A35.4 billion.
Currently, superannuation averages $56,000 per person and, after the family home, makes up the second largest asset held by most Australians. It is therefore crucial we have the opportunity to determine where our savings for retirement are directed. Can we imagine in terms of our largest asset, our home, if we had the government telling people: `This is where you're going to live; this is the amount that you can put into a home; this is the way it should go.' People would say you were crazy. We want total choice as to where we live. It is the same with superannuation funds: the second largest asset that Australians hold is superannuation, and why wouldn't you give them that choice?
The bill currently before the House is yet another example of the coalition getting on with the job of managing the economy. It delivers on the promises we made during the 1996 federal election campaign and reaffirmed in the 2001 election document, A Better Superannuation System. In the 1997-98 budget, the government outlined a choice of funds measure which sees employees able to choose where their superannuation contributions are paid. It provides workers with the right to choose who manages their superannuation. While there is a clear intention of superannuation trustees to do a good job for their members, this intent does not always translate into success and there will be some who fail to protect their members' interests. We have seen some spectacular examples in that regard.
This bill will amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. From 1 July 2004 it will be a requirement of employers to comply with choice of funds. This will be done in two ways, these being by formal mechanisms of offering a choice of funds to employees or by agreeing to a fund that an employee proposes by way of a written agreement. An individual written agreement will involve the employer being provided with notice by the employee proposing a fund and the employer accepting that fund in writing. For those who are happy with their current arrangements, there is going to be absolutely no need to change funds. However, those who are seeing their retirement funds being whittled away by poorly performing returns and exorbitant fees will be able to protect their nest eggs through choice.
I heard the member for Kingston saying that one of the reasons Labor would not agree was that the question of fees and charges et cetera was not part of this bill. Of course, that is what you get with competition. If you get true competition in the marketplace then people can evaluate what the fees and charges are and go with the company or organisation fund that is able to provide appropriate returns and also minimise the cost to the individual investor.
With approximately $6.9 billion in lost superannuation and the potential for fund members to incur fees in each superannuation fund in which they are a member, it is imperative that a flexible system be created. I had in my electorate office just a week ago, for example, a young building contractor—who is out there in the workplace, moving around from scheme to scheme—saying how difficult it was to get employers to organise to provide for superannuation funds to be put into different schemes. `I don't understand,' he said, `but I wish there was a simpler way that I could choose for my funds to go into that particular system.' I said, `It is on its way.' It is a scheme that I believe will have strong resonance in the community. Undoubtedly these changes will lead to revitalised competition in the superannuation industry and make funds more suited to individual members. 
The formal choice process is going to ensure that employers offer their employees a standard choice form within 28 days of commencement of employment. An employee will also have the right to request a standard choice form every 12 months. It is within the employer's entitlements to contribute to a default fund if the employer has complied with the choice requirements and the employee has not chosen in compliance. You can imagine that, when a lot of young people come in, they do not focus on that; they have other things on their mind, as you and I might remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. With this opportunity, people do not focus on it and they do not decide themselves where they should invest the funds but rather it is left in abeyance, so the employer can then make the decision as to where it should go, as long as it meets the requirements. The employer must be willing and able to provide information with regard to the process taken for choice and ensure that the fund has minimum levels of insurance in respect of depth.
The criteria for the selection of a default fund for an employee are contained within the provisions. If there is a Commonwealth or territory industrial award fund for the employee then this is to be the default fund. Should there be no such industry award fund then the eligible choice fund will be the majority fund to which the employer contributes on behalf of more employees than any other fund. If there is more than one fund provided in the award then the employer must choose one as the default fund.
As is clear, the figures which were released by APRA suggest that the return for superannuation funds in Australia over the period 2001-02 was minus 1.6 per cent, and I can certainly attest to that in terms of my private investment fund. However, the average return over the past seven years was in fact a short seven per cent. This data indicates that, whilst global markets have been in steady decline over the last two years, Australian superannuation funds have produced a comparatively strong performance over this time. In the US the average decline in 2002 was 10 per cent; in the UK the average decline in 2002 was 14 per cent. It is true to say that Australia has a superannuation system of which we can be proud. 
Superannuation is a process that is evolving, and we have certainly come a long way from the bad old days when there was little attention given to this. You were given no choice, the funds were locked in one company's superannuation scheme and if people moved on they simply left them behind. Of course, many people did not provide for their retirement and, suddenly, when they faced retirement or were forced through redundancy to move into retirement, they were not prepared for it.
The new approach to superannuation—with people preparing for their retirement by deductions, which they cannot touch, being taken out of their salaries—is a good move; it is moving in the right direction. I am sure that in the future we are going to see further changes made to superannuation schemes, including the prudential management of them. This bill is an important building block. Choice is fundamental to what we on this side of the House believe in. The marketplace can determine which way to go. In some cases you have market failure but this is not the situation with superannuation funds: most of Australia's superannuation funds compete in a very systematic and appropriate way. The returns of each fund during the past year are provided in the Australian Financial Review. Those who are concerned can go to the returns of the funds for each year to determine which is the appropriate fund in which to invest. 
This is what we want to see in the marketplace: competition, which always fires up companies and organisations to do their best, rather than sitting back, as some of the larger companies have with their one-fund schemes. These schemes have not necessarily been performing as well as some of the private sector schemes that are out there, investing and monitoring the situation and determining where the best return is going to be placed. If they do not, of course the market is fairly ruthless in terms of that, and people will switch their funds, as we have seen with some quite large superannuation schemes over the past 12 months. Management changes and the high fees that are being paid to some of the directors are looked at and some people are moved on—this is part of the scene. At the bottom line, this bill is showing real concern for our retirees, the older people in the community, and making sure that they maximise their funds so that in their golden years they have funds to be able to support themselves, have a trip overseas or around Australia, look after their grandchildren and have a roof over their heads. 
That is why we are in favour of this true choice situation helping people prepare for their retirement in a free market economy. We on this side of the House believe that this choice should be given to the Australian community. I believe it will resonate strongly with those who are in the work force, and I think those who have already retired will support the government on this. These changes should have been made a long time ago. I support the bill.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,56,1,speech
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I am pleased to rise today to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. The main reason I am pleased is that I wrote this speech in August 2002 and, every couple of months, as I looked at the progress of the bill in the House, I would start thinking that surely the government had to finalise this matter and bring it to fruition—so I am doubly pleased to be making this speech. 
We are now attempting to deal with the issue of superannuation choice for the third time since this Liberal government came to power in 1996. There is no doubt that the broad concept of choice in superannuation is popular and is supported by all parties in this place. The problem is in the implementation of this concept. Questions such as accountability, complexity, protection and cost all arise in this complicated area. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which examined the bill in detail, highlighted these areas in its report. There is currently no legislated choice of superannuation funds at the federal level. Almost 80 per cent of employees do have choice as to how employee superannuation guarantee payments are invested within their fund. These commonly take the form of being able to decide the mix of their investments in sectors such as equity, property or bonds. 
To progress this debate, I think it is very important that the government consider the amendment that Labor want to make. This is the amendment moved by my colleague:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House declines to give the Bill a second reading, and regards it as an `unsafe choice' Bill because:
(1)	there is no provision for clear, simple and comparable disclosure so that consumers can understand the total impact of fees and charges; 
 (2)	excessive entry and exit fees, which act as barriers to choice, are not banned, nor is there provision for the regulation of any fees, charges and, in particular com-missions on investing the compulsory 9% super-annuation guarantee contributions that can significantly erode superannuation savings;
(3)	there is no exemption for small business, further burdening it with red-tape and paperwork and the consequential financial costs;
(4)	it causes complications for those superannuation funds which provide low cost life insurance for members, with the consequence that many funds will cease to provide a life insurance option;
(5)	there is no provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program;
(6)	there is no provision to include same sex couples in the choice regime, further perpetuating the existing discrimination against same sex couples in relation to superannuation rights; and
(7)	there is no prohibition on financial service providers offering inducements to employers to direct superannuation to a particular fund where the fund selected may not be the one that best represents the employees' interests”.
I ask the government to seriously consider our amendment. It is an important amendment as it goes to the crux of the deficits of this bill. The bill in itself is a good thing, but it has deficits. As I mentioned, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation reported on the consideration of bills for July to December 2002 in December 2002. So it has taken a long time for the work that went into this report by the senators to filter through and emanate in this bill before the House. But, without Labor's amendment, we think it is problematic, particularly from the consumer protection side. I would like to read a section from the report. In the summary on page 135 it says:
The Committee supports the principle of choice, and the right of individuals to choose their own superannuation funds, with appropriate consumer protections. However, the Committee believes that the Bill would benefit from a number of improvements in providing for the successful implementation of choice. Accordingly the Committee believes that the Government should consider making appropriate amendments to the Bill, after examining the implementation issues raised during the inquiry, in particular:
	clarifying and simplifying the default fund provisions, while retaining the protection offered by Federal, State and Territory industrial awards, where applicable;
	considering the compliance burden on businesses;
	considering the impact of fees and charges;
	reconsidering the provisions applying to defined benefit funds, with a view to exempting defined benefit funds from the proposed legislation, providing the schemes are fully funded and the employer contribution is in excess of the nine per cent SG rate;
	ensuring that appropriate levels of death and invalidity insurance cover under the default provisions of the Bill are outlined in regulations;
	considering the impact of death benefits on fund members; and
	reconsidering the level and nature of employer fines, following receipt of advice on their constitutionality.
So the committee, which was a bipartisan committee, raised these points in the summary. I do not think the bill has gone far enough in taking into account these points. Hence, Labor had no choice but to move the amendment now on the table.
I would like to point out the comments made by the Labor senators. I think at this stage I will mention and commend the work of my colleagues Senator Nick Sherry, Senator Geoff Buckland and Senator John Hogg. They are people with experience who put a lot of work, time and effort into this. They travelled around Australia with the committee to try and make sure that the voice of the community came forward—in particular, the voice of the community with regard to real choice, not just some kind of small framework of choice that actually has problems down the track. 
In the report, on page 87 under `Additional comments by Labor senators', the overview says:
Labor senators believe that consumers should have a broad and well-informed choice of fund with full protection. This Bill does not provide the basic elements of this objective.
This Bill potentially impacts on the superannuation retirement savings of 8.8 million Australians. It has major ramifications for their superannuation savings.
This Bill with its deregulation will force employers to offer a choice of fund and will force up to 8.8 million Australians to make a choice of fund.
It goes on to say:
The critical problem is the level of financial literacy of 8.8 million Australians. To what extent should forced decision making be expected of up to 8.8 million consumers and what level of protection should be in place?
The Liberal laissez-faire free market philosophy that deregulation of superannuation will increase competition and should lead to a reduction in costs because 8.8 million consumers will be well-informed as result of disclosure and education is fundamentally flawed.
In the UK the Thatcher Government tried the experiment and it was a disaster. In the US—the often-quoted free market leader—not even the strongest advocates of privatisation of the social security (pension) systems are arguing for choice of fund.
The Government's disclosure model is not comprehensible and their education campaign miniscule.
If adequate disclosure is delivered what will be the behaviour of consumers when forced to make a choice? Many will make poor decisions to their detriment and/or seek additional advice adding an extra layer of private sector bureaucracy for which they will have to pay from their contributions thus reducing their retirement income.
As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I am a mature woman. I have been in this world some time. I am a mother and a grandmother. My children are young adults in their 20s. They work casual seasonal contract work. They come to me and they bring their friends to me. Not only do I work in my electorate 60 hours a week or whatever it is—and, as you all know, we are all workaholics in this place—but also, on the weekends, I have to provide a service to my children and their friends. A lot of it is helping them to complete the paperwork to do the rollover on their superannuation fund for some job they have worked in for a year or two. They have moved into different fields, from hospitality to retail to office work or whatever. I continually ask these young people: `What have you done about your super? Have you rolled it over? You will lose it all in exit fees.' So they bring themselves to me with these forms.
I must point out to the House that I have a superannuation fund too. I want to give a message to the people who design those forms for superannuation funds. For me as a parliamentarian, parent and grandparent, and for my friends, colleagues, neighbours and constituents, can you please simplify the forms and make them understandable? They are complex and obscure. They often do not need a lot of the boxes filled out, but, by the time you work your way from option A to option P, it is very hard to complete these forms logically and sequentially and actually understand what you are doing.
I have been very active in trying to make these young people in my life, as well as my constituents, understand superannuation but particularly understand the importance, if they have many small funds, of rolling them over into one. When it comes to advice on which one to roll them over into, I do not give it to them. I tell them they have to go out and find out what is best for them. They would like to be able to just tap on a site on the Internet and find the best one with a click, but the world does not work like that. 
This bill is weak on consumer protection. To think that people can be financially literate is a bit of a fantasy. My message to the superannuation funds is: do something about your paperwork and also about how you send out brochures and information—particularly to young people, but also to older people—explaining what the fund is about. I am sure that most people got their statement of benefits from their superannuation fund in July and August. If you can understand that and the report that comes with it, you must be an extremely talented person with a degree, a master's and a PhD in finance and commerce. I am pretty literate, but I have great problems with those statements.
Let us look at what has happened. Let us look at the evolution of a government superannuation policy. Labor introduced the national superannuation scheme in 1992—something we were proud of. This included the compulsory superannuation guarantee, which is now nine per cent. The effect of this measure was to increase superannuation coverage from less than 40 per cent of the work force to 88 per cent today.
The rationale behind Labor's superannuation system was threefold. The first goal was to improve retirement incomes to take them above a basic age pension but make them sustainable in the long term, particularly given the increasing age of our population. The second goal was to improve fairness, particularly for low- and middle-income earners, through compulsory superannuation, to improve self-reliance. The third goal was to build an efficient and cost-effective system administered and invested in by the private sector. As my colleague the shadow minister for retirement incomes and savings stated in a recent policy paper, it was a long-term visionary policy.
I find it interesting that all these goals are in sync with the finding of the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report, which was released with last year's budget. The government's actions on superannuation have not been consistent with the findings of its own Intergenerational Report. Labor had planned to expand the contribution regime with a co-contribution of three per cent from the employee and three per cent from the government, making a total of 15 per cent. This was fully costed by Labor in the budget forward estimates, and the actions of this government in abandoning this policy could best be described as short-sighted.
This government's actions on superannuation since it came to power have been all over the place. It has been a display of backflips and twists that would make an Olympic diver jealous. The first measure, introduced in 1996, was the so-called surcharge tax on higher-income earners. What this effectively did was double tax for high-income earners who were saving for their retirement. You could hardly call this an incentive to save. Then there was the policy of expanding the surcharge by including fringe benefits in income calculations. The government then changed the treatment of termination payments for surcharge purposes. Then, after realising the folly of the original decision to double tax for high-income earners, it announced a phase-down of the surcharge rate from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
There was also the experiment with a savings rebate for voluntary contributions, which they dumped after a year. So much for encouraging saving. So much for the community being well informed and keeping up with it. Next, there was the failed attempt at consumer protection. I use the term `consumer protection' loosely, because this policy was all about restricting compensation in the event of theft or fraud. By attempting to restrict compensation to 80 per cent of people's savings, this government certainly showed scant regard for those hard-earned savings. 
So what does all this show us? It shows us that this government has not been proactive in encouraging retirement savings. The government's record on successfully managing this important aspect of people's lives is lacking. This mismanagement has now extended to the issue of superannuation choice. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this is the third time this government has tried to address this issue. Again, the government is found lacking.
A constituent rang my office last week—a young chef who was changing jobs and moving from one area to another. He has rung my office twice. He is a bright young man who has struck on the idea of superannuation choice—and I keep giving the message to my lovely electorate of Stirling that it will happen one day—and he wanted to know whether the bill was through. I did not know whether to laugh or cry, because he was signing up to a new job the next day and he wanted to know whether in going into a new job he had a choice in superannuation. He is a young man in his early 20s who understands that these things are happening and who has rung my office three times over a year to find out what was happening.
—Did you tell him that you had blocked it?
—No, I told him that, because the government could not get it right, it was going to come back into the parliament soon—
—You are the cause of his problems.
—but that he should sign up on the scheme put forward by his employer, because that was his only choice that day. I hope he started his new job and is happy in it.
—I hope he votes Liberal.
—You are a nasty excuse for a human being.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Batman, we do not need any contribution across the table.
—This is why constituents ask why Labor do not support superannuation choice. This assertion is based on propaganda circulated by this government. It is not true that we do not support choice. Labor support superannuation choice—
—Rubbish!
—If the member for Mitchell wishes to speak he will obey the orders of the chair.
—but choice which is backed by full protection for the consumer. Before I go into the specifics of this bill, I also want to speak briefly on an issue that has still not been adequately resolved by this government. A few months ago I spoke in this place on the bill that made changes to the superannuation guarantee. In that speech I constantly referred to the prosecution powers of the ATO. In his reply to members' speeches, the parliamentary secretary, the member for Fisher, mocked me—like the member for Mitchell is mocking me here today—saying that the terminology I used was incorrect and, as a result, I did not know the system. I would like to correct the parliamentary secretary, the member for Fisher, and point out that I was using the correct terminology. This terminology is used by the ATO and in the Senate report. 
The policy of this government and the policy direction it gives the ATO are the reasons why the parliamentary secretary got so confused. Even though it is known as a prosecution process it is essentially a toothless tiger, and the stated policy is to educate employers to carry out the requirements under law rather than to enforce them. I actually stated this in the superannuation guarantee debate. Unfortunately, education programs do not work on people who deliberately ignore the law. Before this government legislates on choice of super fund it needs to make sure that honest, hardworking people are not ripped off. The minister needs to introduce harsh penalties for those businesses that openly flout the law. Just changing the time frame for payment is not going to work on its own.
Recently, a constituent of mine who worked for a company called Healy Airconditioning, which traded under the name Airworld, approached me about his superannuation. The proprietor of this business was a man called Alwyn Healy. Alwyn Healy is the sort of operator that this government believes does not exist: a shyster. I believe that Mr Healy was the subject of an expose on one of the current affairs programs. Mr Healy was a real class act when his company went broke. It was revealed that he had stopped paying the superannuation guarantee for his employees in 1997. This shyster continued to give his employees fortnightly payslips with their superannuation contributions clearly marked on them. So for almost five years he lied to and stole money from his employees. His penalty: nothing. He has now set up another company called Sola-Air in Bayswater, outside my electorate, and continues to trade.
Meantime, the liquidator and the ATO have told Mr Healy's former employees that they are at the end of a very long queue of creditors and are unlikely to see any of their superannuation money or entitlements. You have to love this country: there is one rule for the Prime Minister's brother and one rule for the rest of us. So maybe if the parliamentary secretary got out into the real world and saw the problems that are facing thousands of Australians his contribution to the debate would be more than sitting down and writing notes on our speeches and then selectively misrepresenting our arguments to score political points. This is about people's lives. The retirements of the people who worked for Healy Airconditioning are affected by the loss of years of superannuation contributions.
I do not expect the Prime Minister will change and, as a result, I do not look forward to either the Prime Minister or the parliamentary secretary making a positive contribution to this debate. Maybe the parliamentary secretary could do something useful for a change and tell the House how his government intends to get my constituent's money back and how the employees of Sola-Air are going to be sure that this same sort of rort is not pulled on them. I challenge him to restrict his remarks to practical ways in which my constituent can get his retirement nest egg back. I am more than happy to provide the details of my constituent to him so that he can do this.
In conclusion, Labor do support choice, but we want good choice; we want choice with consumer protection. At the moment, consumers do not have a choice, and they cannot move their money due to the pension structure of their superannuation. That is why they need some equity and they need it now. The government needs to bite the bullet and take some positive steps, further than just changing the frequency of indexation. I support the bill with Labor's amendments, and I thank you for the opportunity to speak in this debate. ",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,56,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. I have in my hands a report by the Australian Senate Select Committee on Superannuation dated November 2002. It has taken one year for the Labor Party to think about it. It has taken one year for them to take some positive action by saying that this is a good thing. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party do not like choice because they think it works against the big funds run by the unions. They are afraid of competition and are seeking to protect their mates in the unions. That is what this is about. The Australian Labor Party will never agree to choice. At the end of the day, I believe that, if they got back into government, there would be no way that they would introduce choice. It is not a factor that is even on their radar, because they do not agree with it. That is the simple truth of the matter. They would rather have the complexity and cost of the current system, which just keeps adding up for people who change jobs and for people in itinerant work. This is a wonderful thing for workers, but the Australian Labor Party keep blocking it.
As I said, there is a Senate report dated November 2002. I stand for the government members of the committee a little because the previous speaker indicated that there was a bipartisan result. It was not a bipartisan result. The government members of the committee clearly stated that the legislation should be passed. The committee as a whole came to a conclusion, and in their comments in the introduction, right at the beginning of their report, they said:
A key issue associated with choice is portability of superannuation benefits. During the inquiry, the Government released a consultation paper on portability. Under the proposed arrangements, portability would relate to the balance of existing funds at 1 July 2004, while choice would relate to contributions made after 1 July 2004.
In the report, as a group the senators said that they broadly agreed with choice, some parties more strongly than others, and they considered the government should get on with the job. One year later, we are still debating this issue, and we still have a whole raft of amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party—a raft of amendments which only seek to delay the acceptance of superannuation choice for the workers of Australia. That is what all this is about: just seeking to delay, to put off and to never get around to supporting the workers.
The people of Australia should remember that nothing can be blocked in the Senate unless the Labor Party agree. The minority parties and the Independents on their own cannot effectively block any government initiative; it takes the Australian Labor Party to bring it to fruition. I think it is a sad thing that an organisation that claims to support the workers of Australia will not allow this legislation through. If it is so flawed, so terrible, so complex and so difficult, why not let it through and then every day criticise the government for such a poor result? But, no, they are not prepared to give it the test. They are not prepared to let it into practice. They are not prepared to let it become law because they know that it is a good thing for workers. What they are afraid of more than anything else is that large union super funds will not be able to compete. That is the only reason that the Australian Labor Party are opposing this legislation—to look after their union mates, to build up the funds and to continue the complexity that is there now. If there were any rationality, any commonsense or any truth in fact in the statements they are making about the need to change this legislation because it is so terrible for the workers of Australia, if they were thinking smart politically, I am sure they would let it in, let it become law, let it create chaos and then point to the government's incompetence. But that is not their intention. 
I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that most workers in Australia have absolutely no say where their superannuation savings are invested. Regardless of the fees they are charged and of the returns they get, they have no opportunity of saying where their funds go. They should be given that say. Every person who has a super fund values that super fund and has probably made that their super fund by choice or they have decided on a fund that best suits their needs on the advice of family or their first employer. Having done that, they ought to be allowed to consolidate the savings generated from their hard work in that fund of their choice. As they go through life prior to marriage—and young people may change jobs on a number of occasions—they should be able to achieve the age of family formation with a certainty of the funds that they have put away and with a capacity to borrow from, or to put up as an asset, their contribution to superannuation. But now that is not possible for many because they have got bits and pieces scattered through a series of funds, much of which is being white-anted away by fees and charges. If it could be consolidated, that process would be much diminished.
In November last year the Financial Planning Association conducted research which showed that 71 per cent of employees believed they should have a right to choose their own super fund. In fact, the FPA chief executive, Ken Breakspear, said he hoped the findings of this inquiry would help encourage the passage of super choice legislation through parliament. That was a year ago, and I am sure there is a continuing requirement by more than 70 per cent of people involved in super to choose where their funds are invested.
The same survey found that almost 50 per cent of those who do not have a say said that they would move to another fund, given the opportunity. So 50 per cent are unhappy with the funds they are in and want to move to another fund. The survey found that only 25 per cent of respondents had been able to choose their super fund. I think that is a terrible thing and this is a good thing the government wants to do. We have been at this now for a year, in the process between the House and the Senate, and for years before that, as we tried to get a breakthrough and a change that would benefit the workers of Australia. The only obstacle in the way is the Australian Labor Party. If the current Leader of the Opposition is true to his word now, he will get in there and make a change, but today we see the Australian Labor Party holding their traditional line of obstruction and non-compliance and seeking to persuade the public of Australia that the government has not done anything.
The fact is that the government has been powerless to do things because of the Senate. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation stopped short of supporting calls for a cap on fees charged by super funds but said that the government should consider regulating fees to reduce the costs paid by all members. Part of the choice process is to look at the fees that are being charged. Part of the choice of deciding what fund you want is to see which one offers the best opportunity for your stage in life and your prospective employment. The Democrats in the Senate have this weird idea that governments should regulate the fees and charges in superannuation. In many instances I would have to say that I am disappointed by the level of fees and charges that funds put on their members. However it is a factor of choice, and this is not the legislation where we should start fooling around with fees and charges. This legislation is to offer choice; fees and charges can be dealt with in other ways. What the opposition is doing is seizing on fees and charges and rolling them into the choice legislation to try to get other changes that are not part of the choice agenda so that they can use a further excuse, saying, `Well, the government is not really going to consider choice as it should be considered.' 
I think the Australian Labor Party are missing a great chance. If this legislation is so bad, why for political purposes would they not let it through? The fact is they do not think it is bad; they are concerned about the impact on union funds and they want to protect their union friends. I am not including you in that Mr Deputy Speaker, but I know the Australian Labor Party just wants to protect the millions and millions of dollars stored up in union super funds. That is what this is all about—year after year preventing workers from having an opportunity to receive reasonable retirement benefits.
The amendment that is the basis of the Australian Labor Party's objection says that the House declines to give the bill a second reading and regards it as an unsafe choice bill. The reason given is that there is no provision for simple, clear and comparable disclosures so that consumers can understand the total impacts of fees and charges. That has nothing to do with choice. Given the opportunity for choice, the first thing people will ask is, `What are the costs? What are the charges?' So there is absolutely no reason to add this amendment. The excessive entry and exit fees are all to do with the general operation of superannuation. They have nothing to do with the choice factor. The government is seeking to get the factor of choice in as a principle for the workers of Australia. Fees and charges are another issue altogether, and if the Australian Labor Party want to deal with them, they should be dealing with them under general legislation covering super and not under the choice bill.
The fact is that the Australian Labor Party are opposed to choice. They do not want choice. They do not want choice for workers and they are not prepared to back the workers of Australia to give them choice in superannuation in order to get the best results in their retirement to choose a fund that suits them and their families and to provide the most beneficial retirement package. I think the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party and the way they claim to represent the workers of Australia is beyond belief. They even want to bring in the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee as part of their amendments to this legislation.
Following the Senate inquiry and the report by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the government said, `Fine, we think choice is important and we will go away and have another look at it and see what other amendments and changes we can make.' On 4 November, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, the Honourable Senator Helen Coonan, stated exactly where the government was prepared to modify things in order to listen to what was said by the community, take note of consultations we have had over a long period and see whether it might be possible to negotiate a reasonable outcome through the Senate.
Regarding the commencement date, employer groups argued they needed at least 12 months to prepare for choice, and the government decided it would not commence this bill until 1 July 2005. That was sensible. Regarding penalty provisions, the current situation is that there is a strict liability offence, with a maximum penalty of $6,600 per breach. There was concern that this would be found to be unconstitutional, so that has been changed, and the penalty will be set at 25 per cent of the value of the contributions paid into an incorrect fund. That provides protection for employees so that an employer cannot claim, `I just happened to write the wrong name on the cheque, and so your money has gone into the wrong account.' The penalty will be capped at $500 per employee. The Commissioner of Taxation will have the discretion to reduce this penalty—including down to nil—if it is an honest mistake, while retaining the option of really applying the force of law if that is needed. 
With regard to default funds, the bill prescribed a three-step procedure that employers must follow when selecting a fund for employees. We felt that this was inappropriate because the default rules imposed an added obligation. This was one of the objections of the Senate committee and one of the reasons that the Australian Labor Party said that there was an impost on small business. The default rules will be changed to reflect the status quo for employers when selecting a fund. If there is no award governing the contributions, the employer will be able to select any complying superannuation fund as a default fund. This is consistent with the current superannuation guarantee legislation. I did not know that the Australian Labor Party objected to that legislation—I think it introduced it, if I remember correctly. So we are following your own pattern; your own template is being followed. The government is following a template laid down by the Australian Labor Party in bringing some consistency to the choice of default funds by employers.
What has the government done and what is it prepared to consider with regard to the choice process itself? The current bill contains two choice processes: either an employee can choose a fund under a formal choice process or an employee can have an individual written agreement. It was said that these two processes were complicating the legislation. So what has the government done about that? The government has proposed amendments to provide for one choice process. An employee will be able to choose a fund at any time provided they have not selected one in the previous 12 months. Employers do not have to accept a fund if the employee does not provide account details or any other prescribed information to prove that the fund will accept the contributions. It is very simple, very easy and very reasonable, and it demonstrates that we have listened to employees, employers, funds and those parties in opposition to this, such as the Australian Labor Party, who do not want and resist and reject—and have continued to obstruct—the introduction of choice in superannuation.
The government has also made amendments in the area of defined benefit funds. The governing rules of some defined benefit schemes require retirement, retrenchment or resignation benefits to be paid to a person, provided they are a member of the fund at the time of these events. That is inappropriate because members of these funds may be able to use the choice of funds process to be paid additional superannuation benefits. The proposed amendments will ensure that an employee cannot choose a fund if they remain a member of a defined benefit fund that fully secures their rights to a benefit. There is no game-playing—it has got to work fairly on both sides, and that is precisely what the government has done. With regard to retirement savings accounts, the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 currently requires an employer to offer an employee a choice of fund before the employer can make a contribution to the RSA. This is an unnecessary choice under the choice of funds process and that provision has been deleted from the RSA Act.
All in all, these are reasonable provisions. This legislation indicates that there is a real prospect for us to be able to make the changes we need. There is a big change through the $1.3 billion package of superannuation co-contribution and reduction of surcharge measures that the government has negotiated through the Senate. The matched-savings measure provides a direct injection into the retirement savings of Australian workers earning up to $40,000, and for battlers there is another benefit of up to $1,000 annually. That is allowing the government to match people who want to put money into funds. The government will stand as their partner and allow them to prepare for retirement. There is a whole range of retirement packages geared for people of lower incomes or those people whose employers may not be supplying an opportunity for them. It will also reduce the pressure on those making very large contributions so that they are encouraged to contribute even more. 
The choice factor is the only block missing from the total package. The choice factor is something that all employees should have access to, and they are being denied that. I repeat: 70 per cent of people want choice, 50 per cent of employees say that they would change their funds given a chance and only 25 per cent of employees are happy with their current fund. It is therefore irrefutable that these changes need to be made. The Senate committee made suggestions and the government has listed a number of amendments and introduced those amendments. The government is concerned that the commencement date, the penalty provisions, the default funds, the choice process itself, the defined benefit funds and the retirement savings accounts should all be modified as the Senate and other groups have suggested.
It is now up to the Australian Labor Party to put their money where their mouth is. They say that they agree with choice: let them give the workers of Australia choice. Let them agree that this legislation should be given a try; let them say, `Let's put this through; we've got objections or worries about certain elements of it and we will be pointing out to you, all through the election campaign, our worries about what you have done.' That would have been a reasonable approach. But at least the workers of Australia who want choice should be given choice. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Mr Ripoll) adjourned.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,56,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. This bill is very important to many Australians. In fact, I would say that it is important to all Australians; it should be something that people actually take note of. I do not want to talk at length about a whole range of issues contained within this bill, but I do want to spend a little bit of time outlining Labor's view and trying to dispel some of the myths that are contained within the body or even the title of this bill.
The government has for a long time had the idea that giving bills a particular name makes them represent a particular type of view. For example, `choice' is a word that has been used widely in this debate, in terms of giving people more choice. There is this idea that just by giving people choice you are making things better. I argue that that is not the case. Choice is not always better, because you can have a variety of bad choices to make rather than good choices. I am more concerned that the government have a look at this bill and, rather than just offer up choice, give people, say, safe options or safe choices—choices and options that will actually make their retirement income more secure into the future. To me, that would be a much better way to approach this type of legislation.
This bill does not do that and does not, I believe, represent what is critically necessary for people in the long term—that is, for their retirement. This is so much so that Labor has actually moved an amendment relating to a range of areas. I want to briefly go through the changes that Labor is proposing. In particular, I note the fact that there is no provision in the bill for clear, simple and comparable disclosure so that consumers can understand the total impact of fees and charges. This particular area is critical. As people would know, one of the greatest problems that we face—not only in terms of superannuation but in terms of banking and finance—is this issue of fees and charges and the impact it has. It has a huge impact. In fact, it now probably represents the largest proportion of revenue for institutions, rather than the actual packages themselves. So Labor believes it is critical that there be a clear, simple and comparable way for different funds to be assessed by people when they are making their choice so that they can understand what it is that they are actually getting into.
One of the analogies I use when talking about this type of legislation is mobile phone contracts and deals. Everybody knows that if you walk into any mobile phone outlet the plans and types of offers that are available are extremely confusing—you can never really compare two plans. It is done that way so that you really do not get that choice. This goes back to the earlier point I made: being offered a lot of things does not actually mean you have choice. If you really examine the choices you have and you do not understand them then you have no choice. The government cannot just get away with talking about choice of superannuation funds if the people it is meant to benefit gain no benefit because they cannot make a viable comparison. At the end of the day, people actually lose because they cannot compare in any real way what it is that one fund will cost them in fees and charges and so forth. That is one area of concern in particular that I have and it is one that this bill does not address.
The other area of concern is excessive entry and exit fees. These are actually barriers to choice. They are not banned and there is no provision in this bill for the regulation of any of these fees or charges, particularly in terms of commissions on the investment of the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions. Government has to put in legislative protection; that is why bills are drafted. But if government does not do that then we have wasted our time, because we have not provided options so that people can make realistic choices. I would rather that this government used words like `realistic choice between one particular product and another'. But if we are going to go down this path—and this bill certainly takes us down there—then it will be legislation like the mobile phone plan analogy I used, in that people are not going to be able to make any real comparisons.
Labor is also concerned that there is no exemption for small business. That is something that this government has done for a long time: continued to burden small business with red tape. I can recall in previous elections the government making a hoo-ha about cutting red tape and being the friend of small business. But when it really comes down to it—when they are really tested as to whether they are the friend of small business—we do not see it, certainly not in legislation. The burden that is now faced by small businesses is massive. It is mostly delivered by this government. This continued red tape in terms of paperwork and the sort of work that needs to be done by small business proprietors in managing the super funds that they have to deal with represents an opportunity missed by this government. They could have done a much better job in this bill. 
There are also complications in terms of low-cost life insurance for members, in that those funds will cease to provide any real life insurance option for people who are in those types of funds. There is no further provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program. This is something that it would be worth while for the government to pick up out of this. I can understand that the government is not going to want to pick up all of Labor's amendments and suggestions, but it could pick up the idea that superannuation is not only a vitally important program but actually essential for people.
Retirement income is one of the great issues that we will be talking about more and more as we grow to understand the absolute necessity of people being able to fund themselves in retirement, rather than relying on the tax system and pensions, which are just not adequate. It is now widely accepted that people really have to make an extra effort with their superannuation, with their retirement income. There is no provision in the legislation to provide consumers with effective education programs which would give them the skills necessary to make educated choices. There is not much point in so-called choice in legislation if people do not understand what it is that they are choosing between. With regard to the complexities of superannuation, which are many, people end up making decisions which are not based on any real knowledge of what those decisions will mean in the long-term future. That is another missed opportunity; it could have been part of this legislation.
Something that Labor has been pushing for, which is extremely timely in terms of a range of issues out in the community, is recognition of same-sex couples in superannuation legislation. In this legislation there is no recognition of and provision for that. Again, this is a missed opportunity to provide for same-sex couples in the choice regime. It further perpetuates the existing discrimination against same-sex couples in relation to superannuation rights. We have moved on from the old days when we did not recognise or understand those relationships. We have moved away from superannuation arrangements for the white picket-fence type of family unit. People are in same-sex relationships and they spend their whole lives together. That should be acknowledged and recognised by government. Everyone else has recognised it. Everyone in the community now recognises and accepts that that is a reality of life and that people make lifelong commitments in same-sex relationships—commitments that last for 30, 40 and 50 years. If two people contribute throughout life to each other and to a fund, that should be recognised in law. They should be given the same rights as other Australians. It is another missed opportunity.
When you really look at this bill, you see that it is a bill of missed opportunities. We do not have the time to redo this bill. This is the end of the year; we are on the last day. A lot of work has gone into this. We do not have the time to redo this. But the government did have the time and did have the opportunity. That is why we debate bills. Anybody listening today might ask why we come into this House and debate bills and why, as an opposition, we get upset and even angry with the government when they cut short debate on bills, when they guillotine and do not allow debate to take place. That creates a culture of contempt. It creates a culture where ministers always think they are right and that they cannot possibly make an error. 
Government ministers will smile or bark at you when they get a bit annoyed, but they are barking at you because they do not want to hear another view. Their view is absolute; their view can never be wrong. Their view is it. After you point out that they had 100 spelling errors in the bill and one paragraph in the wrong place, and that their bill does not work as it is meant to, they say, `Oops!' If we spent the necessary time on that great democratic principle, the debate, and the process and the use of the Senate in order to deal with these things, then we would get much better bills. Of course, that is only if they are willing. We can almost say that we need a coalition of the willing from the government, where they would be willing to sit down and look at these things for the benefit of all Australians rather than just pushing their ideological agenda.
Talking about ideological agendas, I was listening to the member for Mitchell. He is a fine member who has been in this place just about longer than anybody else, I think. The government members just cannot help themselves. They have to come in here and take whatever it is that is on the table and relate it to something that is completely irrelevant to the actual bill. The member for Mitchell started talking about union control. I was thinking: `Blow me down! How do the government always relate everything back to union control?' It is as if they think there is some sort of evil network out there of union control of superannuation. If the member for Mitchell and the other government members actually thought that was the case, they might have done something in this legislation. But they did not, because it is not the case.
It is a fact that there are very good industry based funds which are not union controlled but where unions participate and union officials are trustees or members of boards. That is a good thing, because they represent the workers who invest in those funds. It is the workers' money that is in those funds. What is silly about having a representative of the workers on a board or as a trustee? To me that makes sense. Surely you could not have it run by just the fund managers. That would be an imbalance, wouldn't it? You surely could not have just the bosses on the board or as trustees. Surely there needs to be some balance. I think there is balance, because a wide range of people are responsible for managing many of the industry funds and other funds that are extremely important for people's futures. But, again, government members come in here and speak garbage about what they see as giving choice. `Giving choice' for government is code for taking away something. Giving choice means: `We are going to take something off you. We are going to allow you to choose to have something less.' At the end of the day, that is what it is about.
There is a range of issues in this legislation. There is no prohibition on financial service providers offering inducements to employers to direct superannuation to a particular fund. I think that is another missed opportunity in this legislation. It has to be understood that there will be some unscrupulous people out there who will do unscrupulous things. Part of our role, and absolutely part of government responsibility, is to protect retirement savings. If you consider what superannuation means for most Australians, it is all that they have when they come to retirement. The family home is the major asset, followed by superannuation. There really is not too much else for the majority of ordinary Australians. 
So our responsibility as a parliament and, particularly, as a government is to protect those people's interests, to make sure that the funds do not fall over and to make sure that their retirement is protected. Not only is it in their best interests as individuals or as a family unit but it is in the interests of all Australians. It is in the interests of government; it is in the interests of taxpayers. I think it is another missed opportunity. This bill should have been called the `Superannuation (Missed Opportunity) Bill', because there is more missed opportunity in it than there is any real change or worth in terms of making things better. They are a number of the issues that I wanted to outline.
In the few minutes I have left to speak in this debate, I want to make a couple of other brief comments about choice. The member for Mitchell and other government members have gone down the path for some time whereby they believe that statistics prove everything. Supposedly, 70 per cent of people who were surveyed wanted choice. I have experienced this in my electorate, where the member for Blair did a survey on an excessively important issue in the electorate. It was a huge survey on a road issue. There were 100,000-odd surveys, and he got back 180—an amazing response! The survey asked the question: do you want an alternative route to the current one? So the question is: do you want another road? Of course you do. Who would say no to that? It is a ridiculous proposition that people do not want choice. If you asked me, `Do you want choice?' I would answer: `Well, of course I do. Who doesn't? Everybody wants choice. But what choice are you offering? What is it that you are actually putting on the table?' As I said earlier, if people cannot make an educated decision between packages or between funds then what choice is there? You tick a box or you ask somebody else. That is not real choice. The work that needed to be put into the legislation to give people real options and real choices simply has not been done. This is more about unsafe choice than it is about any real choice.
There is another issue in terms of superannuation and retirement incomes that I put on the Notice Paper as a question to the minister. I have had a response, although it was late—very tardy of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, but such is the case—on the extremely important issue of superannuation deductions and provisions under a particular act, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, in relation to hardship for a number of former public servants. I am extremely disappointed by the response from the minister, who, from his answer to me, appears not to comprehend the issue at hand. I use this opportunity to make the plea to him that people who are affected by a number of sections under this act are suffering and losing money. Their retirement income is being eroded by what is clearly an unfair mechanism contained within that particular act. While it is not related directly to this bill, it is related to superannuation and the choice that we are talking about, and it is another area where the government could make choice happen by fixing up parts of bills that do not work. As I have said, I put that as a question on notice, and I will be following that question up with another question.
Labor are doing some positive things in terms of our own policy. We are looking at people's retirement incomes and making sure that there is safety out there, but also that there is growth and that their incomes are protected into the future. If we look at compulsory superannuation, it is widely acknowledged that it has been extremely successful. Right across the board this has boosted people's retirement incomes and made it possible for people to look forward to a decent future and a good life in their retirement. Boosting superannuation savings is essential, particularly for women. Women have not traditionally had great retirement incomes. Given the realistic proposition these days that people may separate, become widowed or encounter a whole range of different circumstances, we need to be conscious of the fact that women in particular need to have their retirement incomes protected. Other groups that particularly need to be looked at are people who are self-employed, contractors or people who work in industries where there are not the funds or mechanisms to give them a decent retirement future, and particularly older people who have come into the superannuation guarantee mechanisms quite late. So there is a whole raft of issues within the bill that were not addressed adequately by the government. 
Labor have made a number of proposals. Particular policy options include reducing the contributions tax by either two per cent for all members or 3.5 per cent for those aged 40 years and over. We have heard this message from the community: `The taxing regime on superannuation is unfair and needs to be addressed.' The government has had seven years to look at this very real issue. If you talk to people who understand this, they know that the taxes on retirement incomes are simply way too high. Other policy options that I am particularly interested in are about capping fees and charges at 1.2 per cent or the appropriate dollar amount, and providing full compensation for funds lost due to theft or fraud.
They are the things that government should be doing. They are missed opportunities because they are not contained in this bill. If the government went out and talked to people in the street and asked what it was that they needed to be adequately provided for then those things are the answer they would get. What I do not agree with is that the government say, `Yes, we've been listening, but what we'll do is give the top five per cent of income earners in this country a big break, rather than everybody. We'll give the bonuses and the benefits to people who earn incomes in excess of $90,000-odd a year.' Everybody needs to be looked after, but I think we should spend a bit more time on this. This government should acknowledge that if we are going to talk about the battlers then we should actually be providing for the battlers. The day will come when people out in the street realise what the government have been doing.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I am simply flabbergasted. Normally the member for Oxley delivers a good speech in this House, but it is evident that he has not read the detail of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 and he has certainly not given recognition to the tremendous consultation process that this particular bill has been through. In fact, I could go through each of his criticisms and demonstrate that the member for Oxley is quite wrong in much of what he has said. He has accused the government members of talking garbage. Well, I have never heard so much garbage in relation to a presentation on a bill.
There are 27 speakers listed to speak on this bill today. That demonstrates the interest of this parliament, and certainly of the government, in this bill being properly debated. This bill originated before the 1996 election, when the coalition, unlike the opposition today, were working very hard on developing new policies to put before the Australian electorate in relation to superannuation and retirement self-sufficiency. Those policy initiatives included portability of funds. We have delivered on that. We brought the legislation to the House to allow portability of funds, which has been a huge issue. Where people moved in their jobs a number of times and set up various super funds, the gains that they were getting were being lost—fees and charges were gobbling them up—and the sheer difficulty of managing a number of funds was problematical. We have delivered on that. 
As for choice of funds, the bill is here before us today. I think it is important. What a lot of rubbish there has been! Do we say to our kids, `Don't worry about going to school today, darling, and don't worry about trying to do algebra, because it's all too hard and the choices are too difficult for you; so just stay at home and don't do anything'? How dare we say to the Australian electorate that you do not have the capacity to make your own decisions, to go out there and fossick around for information that is vitally important to your retirement and that we as a parliament do not—or at least the Labor side do not—have any confidence in the ability of the public to go out there and use their own initiative to make these kinds of decisions? There are endless amounts of information available to the public.
I think it is extraordinary that we hear people on the Labor side constantly saying—and the member for Kingston, who spoke on this bill earlier, made the same point—that it makes it difficult for people to navigate. Yes, it is difficult. A lot of decisions in life are difficult. But are we going to produce a nanny-state mentality in Australia today? Are we going to help people by providing information and education as well as basic legislation to ensure that businesses do the right thing—or are we just going to run this protectionist mentality, this nanny-state mentality? I am confident that the majority of people out there in the electorate can make their own decisions, given the correct information. That information is available to the Australian public.
When this bill goes through, we will have delivered on choice of funds. We have delivered on the contribution splitting, which was another element of the coalition's early policy discussions. We have delivered on asset splitting under the Family Law Act. I was the Minister for the Status of Women at the time. In fact, I was one of the people who initially pushed income splitting on dissolution of marriage because many women were disadvantaged by not taking this into account in the split of assets. We have delivered on that. That legislation came to the House, it was debated and it is now in operation. We have delivered on tax incentives to help people build a nest egg for retirement and for self-sufficiency in their retirement. This government has delivered $11.2 billion worth of tax benefits to retirees, superannuants and pensioners—people on pension schemes. It is a huge investment by the Australian government—the Australian people, really—in retirement self-sufficiency.
In the lead-up to the last election, the government was committed to delivering three key initiatives in superannuation. They were in a policy called A Better Superannuation System. This policy was designed to make superannuation attractive, accessible and a secure means of long-term saving. It built on the outstanding record of the Howard government to tackle some of the prickly issues in relation to provision of a strong retirement income—issues that Labor never tackled in their 13 years in government. The government places a very strong emphasis on helping Australian families to achieve financial self-reliance in retirement.
Today we debate the bill that amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to allow people choice. Neither the member for Kingston nor the member for Oxley mentioned this, but I think it is important to mention that this bill went through a Senate select committee process. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation supported the principle of choice. They made some important recommendations. Many of those recommendations were taken up by government. This bill was modified to take account of those recommendations, which included extending the date for commencement. The government also reduced the maximum penalty, reducing the liability on small business. It simplified the default rules to retain the status quo for employers when selecting a superannuation fund for their employees. It reduced the choice-of-fund processes from two to one, thus reducing some of the compliance elements for business, and it allowed employers to refuse a chosen fund if the employee does not provide them with certain details about the fund within a given time. 
These changes to the bill reflect the excellent consultation processes that the minister has entered into. I congratulate the minister for doing a tremendous job with this bill, because it is not an easy area. It is tough, as I said. Some of these are very prickly sorts of issues that have had to be dealt with. Labor, when they were in government for 13 years, did not see fit to tackle some of these prickly issues. It is commendable that our minister has and has gone through the consultation process and has ensured that these concerns have been reflected in this bill before the House today. It has made it easier for employers to comply and it has made it easier for employees to choose a fund.
The amendments support the Senate select committee's finding that the employer cost should be kept to a minimum and penalties reduced. There have been sceptics in the business sector about the operation of choice of funds. We have heard some of them today. I suppose one of the things that gave rise to that scepticism and concern is the situation that occurred in the United Kingdom. It did cause some concern, because consumers did not have any strong protection laws and it left them at risk of being sold inferior products. That is not the case in Australia. We do have those laws. The government has seen to it that we have an effective consumer protection regime. That is another item that was really highlighted in the Senate select committee and that the government has taken note of and has done a lot to strengthen. The Financial Services Reform Act 2001 did a lot to strengthen the necessary protective mechanisms so that we do not have our consumers caught up in the same problems that were experienced in the UK.
The result of the government introducing the Financial Services Reform Act 2001, which commenced on 11 March 2002, was the provision of a harmonised framework of disclosure obligations for superannuation funds and indeed other financial services. These reforms therefore allow much better access to information by the consumer so that they can make informed decisions. Again this idea that everybody needs protection and that members of the public are too stupid to make decisions for themselves—that is the implication from the Labor member for Oxley and the Labor member for Kingston—I, for one, find deplorable. I am sure many people out there would find deplorable the suggestion that they cannot make their own decisions, that they are not smart enough to work their way around some of the decisions that they have to make.
To further highlight that, choice of funds has been available in my state of Western Australia for five years and it has operated successfully, although some people continue to be of the view that it will create problems. It is interesting to note that the ANZ Bank released in May 2003 the findings of research into the financial literacy of adult Australians, which revealed that most Australians have a reasonable level of financial literacy. This goes right against what the member for Kingston and the member for Oxley are purporting. In fact, the results of that survey were that 98 per cent of the public understand that they must prioritise their needs to balance income and expenditure, 97 per cent know that their employer must make superannuation contributions for them and 91 per cent know that they can make extra superannuation contributions. It was interesting that only five per cent of people did not think planning or saving for retirement mattered. That is a fairly low percentage—while we would like a 100 per cent conversion of people to the notion that planning for retirement is important, it is a relatively low percentage. Certainly only 37 per cent had worked out what they would need for their retirement. We need to do more work in this area but, in answer to the member for Oxley, the government has made provision, through the Australian Taxation Office, for education and publicity on choice in superannuation. Forty per cent could read a superannuation statement and identify all items correctly, and there is probably a little more work to be done in that area, and 44 per cent had a good understanding of the fees and charges that applied to superannuation, so we need to get people to do comparisons. The best thing about people having a choice of superannuation fund is that if they do not like the fees and charges they can opt out of their fund and go into something else. That is very important. Who says anyway that employers or trustees on a board or union representatives are any better equipped than you to make decisions about your retirement nest egg? I do not think that you can sustain the counterargument at all. Funds for public education about choice of funds will be administered through the tax office. The initial allocation is $12.7 million in 2002-03 and then $10.3 million in 2003-04. 
The government has acted on recommendations to limit the compliance cost, and this goes to the heart of the criticism by the member for Oxley about the difficulties for business in this particular bill and missed opportunities. Opportunities have not been missed at all. The government has ensured that employers will have the flexibility to choose the most cost-effective and least onerous method of providing choice to employees. If there is no agreement, employers can satisfy their choice of fund obligations by entering into a certified agreement or an AWA with their employees. If there is no such agreement, employers must provide a standard choice form to existing employees, and to new employees within 28 days of their commencement of employment. I do not see this as particularly onerous. After this time, employers will only have to provide this information at the request of the employee. Employers will be able to reject an employee's choice if the employee seeks to change funds within 12 months of having chosen a fund. The employee must also provide to the employer written evidence that the fund will accept contributions from the employer, and any other prescribed information. If not, an employer will also be able to reject an employee's choice on these grounds. The government has taken notice of the Senate select committee's recommendation and reduced the penalty provisions to $500 per employee, with the Commissioner for Taxation able to, in certain cases, use his discretion to reduce the penalty to nil if necessary.
Electronic banking and computer software will further reduce the compliance cost aspects for business. In WA, where the fund has operated for five years, clearing houses have been established, requiring the employer to write only one cheque for distribution to nominated funds. So there are schemes being developed, as well as software and electronic banking, which will make compliance quite simple for businesses. The average cost to business of complying with choice of funds has been estimated at $54 in the first year and $36 each year after that, so you can hardly say that this is a massive cost for the business sector, particularly small business. The government has amended the default rules to reflect the status quo for employers when selecting a fund, and employers are also required to make award payments to a fund nominated in a Commonwealth industrial award, which will continue to make payments to that fund if an employee does not choose a fund. If there is no award then the employer will be able to select any complying superannuation fund as the default fund. 
Once again the structure of this bill and the changes made reflect the government's willingness to work with various groups and individuals to provide a legislative response without unduly penalising small business by unwieldy compliance measures and draconian penalties. Overall, this is a good outcome, and again I say the minister should be congratulated on the work that she has put into this bill. With superannuation forming the largest savings of most families, apart from the family home, workers should have the right to choose who manages their superannuation nest egg. This government has had a strong record of improving superannuation and retirement income policies since it came into office in 1996. That has not come about by chance. These policies had been worked on in the years leading up to our success in the 1996 election. I know, as I was on the group in this parliament—the backbench committee; with the now Treasurer and in fact David Connolly, who formerly served in this House, and others, including John Watson from the Senate—that worked quite hard on these policies in those early days. This early policy work has paid dividends in assisting Australians to achieve financial independence in retirement.
I do not have many more minutes, but I am going to try to summarise just some of those. I think I will run out of time, because the achievement list of the Howard government since it came into government in 1996 is so long. These include: superannuation tax concessions amounting to $11.2 billion—those are 2003-04 figures; increased age for voluntary contributions; availability of extra contributions by working people between the ages of 70 and 75; contributions to superannuation by recipients of the baby bonus; allowing parents, relatives and friends to make superannuation contributions on behalf of a child—up to $3,000 per child over a three-year period; increasing the limit of full deductibility of super contributions by self-employed people—and that was a very strong issue in the lead-up to the 1996 election; allowing portability of superannuation funds; requiring employers to make at least quarterly superannuation payments to protect the interests of the employee; and allowing temporary residents to access their superannuation. Many young people came from other countries to work here and went home again. Money was deducted and they would under normal circumstances never have received that money or the benefit of it.
We have amended the Family Law Act to allow superannuation benefits to be split when a marriage breaks down; introduced the superannuation spouse rebate, which allows individuals to make super contributions on behalf of their low-income spouse; provided capital gains tax relief—and our shadow minister for small business put this policy into our small business policy package in 1996 and we have given the effect to that promise—to allow a small business to use the proceeds of a sale of a business for retirement income purposes; removed the anomalies in the means testing arrangements; amended the capital gains tax so that the nominal capital gains of super funds are taxed at the concessionary rate of 10 per cent where the assets are held for at least one year; strengthened preservation arrangements; introduced the retirement savings accounts, which are very important for people who have many different jobs and only small amounts of money to invest; regulated to free self-managed superannuation funds from the full prudential requirements faced by the larger funds; indexed Commonwealth civilian superannuation pensions; provided higher tax rebates for senior Australians; introduced the bench and bonus scheme; and implemented new investment rules. These are very significant measures which help to ensure maximum financial self-reliance in retirement. 
The opportunity for workers in this country to exercise their right of choice and determine their own retirement destiny is a very important principle. This is where there is a philosophical difference between the Labor Party and the coalition parties. We believe that people have the right to determine their own destiny and somebody else is not necessarily superior in making those kinds of decisions about other people's lives. It is an important principle and this bill ensures that workers are afforded that opportunity.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I listened with great interest to the contribution by the member for Pearce to this debate on theSuperannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. I note her comments on the speech by the member for Oxley—she said that his speech was garbage. I have been in this House and heard some unbridled hypocrisy, but I think the member for Pearce has just taken the cake in that regard. We listened to her speech where she said what a great thing superannuation is and that this bill picks up the prickly issues that Labor never tackled in 13 years of government. Labor tackled the big issue—it gave superannuation to Australian workers and it lifted the participation rate from 40 per cent to over 90 per cent of the Australian work force. One of the greatest structural reforms in retirement incomes policy that Australia has ever seen was introduced by a Labor government.
It was not just introduced by a Labor government; it was introduced with trenchant and virulent opposition by the Liberal Party. Here we have Liberal members getting up in this place and telling us what a great bill this is, providing choice to Australian consumers of superannuation, yet they are the very people who denied choice to Australian working people in getting access to superannuation and improving their standard of living in their retirement years. I think the member for Pearce has to be very careful when she levels criticism against the member for Oxley about a speech being garbage. You come into this House and tell us what a great thing superannuation is, yet you opposed it when Labor introduced it. I think the Australian people can make their minds up about the sincerity of members opposite when they level criticisms against Labor governments of the past.
Senior members of the current government had some very interesting things to say about superannuation when Labor expanded the coverage from 40 per cent to 90 per cent of the Australian people. The honourable member for Mayo is a senior minister in the government. He said that the insertion of superannuation provisions in industrial awards was `one of the most underrated threats to the future stability of Australia's economy, and indeed to the capitalist system'. This idiotic piece of psychobabble from the now Minister for Foreign Affairs was uttered in 1985 in his response to the insertion of superannuation provisions in industrial awards. 
I could go on, with Liberal members lining up at the gate to debate against giving choice to Australian workers about a better standard of living in their retirement and opposing superannuation for workers, yet they come into this House today as the paragons of virtue, defending choice in superannuation. I guess it is the end of the parliamentary session and members will say anything on the floor of this House in the heat of debate.
But I pick up on another point made by the honourable member for Pearce. She said that planning for retirement is important. Of course it is important to plan for your retirement, but it is also important for working people to get access to a better retirement incomes policy. The member for Pearce said that planning for retirement was so important, yet she is a member of a party that fought tooth and nail against providing access to superannuation for working people. So we now have, `Planning for your retirement, and superannuation is very important for consumers,' but it was not so in the past, when only the privileged few were able to gain access to superannuation and a better standard of living in their retirement.
The member for Pearce levels the criticism at members opposite that we are arguing along the lines that consumers are too stupid to choose their own fund. She argues, in debating the points that we have advanced to tighten up regulations and give protection to consumers, that we are simply saying that consumers are too stupid to choose their own fund. I note that, in the banking system, consumers have the right to go to the various financial institutions with products in the retail marketplace and choose which product serves their particular interests. But that does not mean we do not have a regulatory regime to regulate the conduct of those financial institutions; it does not mean that we do not have mechanisms in our legislative framework to ensure that consumers are protected. So when members on this side of the House advance arguments to enhance the protective mechanisms in superannuation, I think the member for Pearce is drawing a long bow in arguing that we regard consumers as being too stupid to choose their own funds.
My colleague in this place the honourable member for Kingston has a second reading amendment to this legislation, which outlines some very important matters that are not covered adequately in this piece of legislation. For example, the amendment says:
(1)	there is no provision for clear, simple and comparable disclosure so that consumers can understand the total impact of fees and charges—
that are being levied on superannuation products they consume. The amendment continues:
(2)	excessive entry and exit fees, which act as barriers to choice, are not banned, nor is there provision for the regulation of any fees, charges and, in particular commissions on investing the compulsory 9% super-annuation guarantee contributions that can significantly erode superannuation savings; 
(3)	there is no exemption for small business, further burdening it with red-tape and paperwork and the consequential financial costs;
	...	...	...
(5)	there is no provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program ...
	...	...	...
(7)	there is no prohibition on financial service providers offering inducements to employers to direct superannuation to a particular fund where the fund selected may not be the one that best represents the employees' interests”.
On this latter point, I think the government has missed a golden opportunity to offer in this bill better protection for Australian consumers in superannuation. Why it has not picked up on this particular amendment, I do not know. 
The second reading amendment proposed by the member for Kingston contains sensible provisions—sensible measures—that improve protection for Australian consumers in the superannuation marketplace. We know that at the moment there are some real shysters in the financial services industry that are taking consumers down. We have celebrated cases in the media where companies and individuals providing financial advice have lost millions of dollars and are going into receivership. We know that many financial services providers do not have the competence to properly advise consumers about the superannuation products that are available in the marketplace. Many consumers are now falling foul of that bad financial advice from those people—and have in the past.
This is a very sensitive issue in the community because people's retirement incomes are very important to them. Many of my constituents have come to me, concerned about the fees and charges being levied on their superannuation products. They are concerned about the long-term impact on the returns they will receive on their retirement and, as a consequence, the potential adverse impact on their standard of living. This whole area is of real concern to working people in this country.
This bill has a long and tortuous history that goes back to 1996. At that time, the choice of funds concept may have been a radical proposal for this government but in 2003, at the end of this parliamentary year, it is time that the government put its union-bashing prejudices aside and delivered to this parliament and to the people of Australia suitable and informed legislative guidelines for superannuation funds that will benefit all Australians.
The choice of funds concept needs to work for the benefit of working people, not just for the benefit of the financial services industry. On this side of the House we believe that consumers should have a broad and well-informed choice of funds with full protection. This bill in its present form does not provide the basic elements of that fundamental protection that we seek.
We know the history of the coalition in the superannuation area, and I alluded to that in my opening remarks when I commented on the contribution of the member for Pearce. The Liberal Party and The Nationals fought tooth and nail to stop Australian working people from getting access to superannuation. Many Australians today have an improved standard of living in their retirement that they would not have had if the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Liberal Party and The Nationals that they represent, had got their way on the floor of this parliament. That is the truth of the superannuation matter. Members opposite continue to peddle what are blatant mistruths to consumers—that is, that industry superannuation funds are merely union funds.
There are many superannuation funds where some trustees are appointed by trade unions, but there are no union-only funds allowed under Australian law. In fact, the superannuation industry's supervision body requires that all nonprofit funds have an equal number of employee and employer trustees. So there are a few myths about this. The real rationale for this particular piece of legislation is that it is merely an extension of the prejudice of the Prime Minister and the minister for industrial relations against the union movement. The real rationale for this bill lies in the historic and entrenched anti-union attitudes of the Liberal Party, rather than it being a reasoned and rational piece of legislation. 
I refer now to an extraordinary claim by the then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, when he launched proposed changes to the regulation of superannuation funds in October 2001. It gives an insight into the mentality of Liberal ministers in this regard. In relation to those changes to the regulation of superannuation funds, he said:
It is going to be tough. It is going to be hard particularly for the industry funds. It is going to mean that the representatives of some of the workers on those industry funds, including union officials, are going to start to be held accountable for investment decisions. It is going to force those people to disclose and at times, seek approval, of members if they are going to engage in related-party activities. So if they are giving work to mates they are going to need to seek approval of members of the fund. The days of the cosy relationships in superannuation are now over.
That statement really reflects the blind prejudice of the Liberal Party towards any outcome that is reached through cooperation and negotiation between employers and trade unions. But, I tell you what, this minister knows about `cosy relationships'. I refer to a newspaper article that I came across yesterday, 4 December, which related to the lavish hospitality that the minister received from Emirates Airlines. Here we have the minister, who with reference to superannuation talked about `cosy relationships', being attacked in a newspaper article by the head of Qantas and the head of the Sydney Airport Corporation for the lavish hospitality that he enjoyed with the compliments of Emirates Airlines. In the article, Mr Dixon of Qantas said:
However, we would ask that he get his facts right occasionally.
In reference to Mr Dixon, the article went on to say:
He blew his top after learning that Mr Hockey's offending comments were uttered while the minister enjoyed lavish hospitality from rival Emirates Airlines ... 
Mr Max Moore-Wilton, who was the head of the Prime Minister's department before he moved to the Sydney Airport Corporation, branded Mr Hockey as a `galoot'. The member for McMillan is a country boy and so am I; we know what a galoot is. And I see the honourable member for Parkes, who represents a country electorate, is here; he knows what a galoot is. The problem is that one of his senior ministers is a galoot; of course the minister was a galoot when he was in charge of financial services and regulation.
There are some core issues here. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we believe that consumers should have a broad and well-informed choice of funds, with full protection. Put simply, this bill does not provide that. This bill potentially impacts on the superannuation retirement savings of 8.8 million Australians, and it has major ramifications for their savings. The bill, with its deregulation emphasis, will force employers to offer a choice of funds and will also force up to 8.8 million Australians to make a choice of funds. Of course, there are great financial risks for people in this.
Make no mistake: superannuation is a highly complex financial product. There are risks involved when people do make those choices. It is not like a consumer item or whitegoods; it is a long-term investment because it is not accessible by retirees until aged 55 or 60, and it is not easily returnable if it is invested in a poor product. The tragedy of the superannuation story is that the impact of adverse investment decisions takes years upon years to emerge.
We have some views. We believe the bill should be amended to cap ongoing fees and charges that can be debited against the super guarantee contributions and accumulated superannuation guarantee savings of new members at 1.2 per cent per year or an appropriate combination of dollar and percentage amounts. We believe there should be a prohibition on entry and exit and switching fees that can be debited against accumulated superannuation guarantee savings of new members before a reasonable time, and we believe there ought to be a cap on the total cost of insurance that can be debited against those contributions. 
Above all this bill does not—but should—provide reporting and public disclosure of all fees and charges made by superannuation funds and their intermediaries. Superannuation was a great Labor initiative and no amount of humbug from the member for Pearce or anybody opposite can alter the fact that, when we gave the working people of Australia access to it, it was opposed tooth and nail by the Liberal Party and The Nationals.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—I must confess I was slightly amused a while ago to hear the members for Corio and McMillan described as representing country electorates. I think the next time they see something country it will bite them.
But I rise to speak now on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. Quite obviously superannuation is the second most valuable asset a lot of Australians have, after their homes. In some cases it will be the only source of retirement income that they get. More than 80 per cent of the nation's work force contributes to a superannuation fund in one form or another today. Bearing this in mind, it is rather incredible to find that 2.7 million Australians have unclaimed superannuation. That is quite staggering. That means one in every three Australians who work have not claimed their superannuation. In other words, they do not know where it is. In total, that is $6.9 billion—an average of $1,600 per account. It is sitting around waiting to be claimed and in a sense it is unaccounted for. When you consider that for many people this is going to be their only source of retirement income it makes you stop and wonder how we could ever be as careless as that. Why would we risk the health and wellbeing of such a serious investment with so much at stake for our future—and certainly the wellbeing and enjoyment of our senior years? The answer is simple, I guess: we are either confused, complacent or both, and perhaps we just do not know how to find it.
Towards the end of the nineties, around 14 per cent of Australians changed their jobs every 12 months. That is a staggering statistic, but probably those of us who employ people will not find it a surprising one. Those aged between 20 and 25 years were the most itinerant, with one-quarter of them consistently changing their jobs on an annual basis. So we really should not be too surprised to think that anybody under 25 may have as many as five different super funds. I know that many employees I have had, especially those in the shearing industry, had absolutely no idea what they had. At the same time they are getting up to five different administrative charges on five different lots of money, rather than one. Quite obviously, at the age of 25 retirement and the long term may not be the most important things on their minds and so they do not keep track of those funds in the way they should, and certainly the system up until now has not encouraged them or even made it easy for them to do so. So I guess you can really see how $6.9 billion can be floating around unclaimed in superannuation funds at this time.
It is true that many people do not know where their funds are, but fund managers have also been known to lose track of funds and, with the resulting chaos, the government had to do something. The government has been trying to since 1996. The current superannuation arrangements do not make it easy. They certainly do not make it easy for the individual. If fund managers get confused about it, why wouldn't you? Federal income tax laws provide incentives to encourage employers and employees to contribute to their own future and their own retirement through superannuation funds, but the biggest problem is that there are no obligations for employers to give their workers or employees the right to nominate their own funds. This has long been a bone of contention, but you must have not just the right but the encouragement to take an interest in your own future. 
From time to time it does happen that employers will ask, but they do not have to, and certainly in the bigger situations they generally tend not to. At the federal level, compulsory employer superannuation can exist under either an industrial award or the superannuation guarantee charge, but in essence most Australians have absolutely no power—none at all—over their own super funds and where their savings and their futures lie. We have to change that, and the coalition government has been trying to since 1996. We have tried to work with the opposition to make it happen, and thus far we have not succeeded. I know we are now looking at what the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has suggested as ways to lower the confusion and make it easier, and we are leaning to some of the things that that committee put forward.
I commend the amendments put forward in this legislation, and I urge opposition members to consider the wellbeing of working Australians and their right to choose their own super fund. Let us be honest: the more we encourage people to have some direction about where their retirement plan is, the better off they are and the better off the nation is. Superannuation choice would give Australians a much greater sense of personal ownership and control over their superannuation. For employees who do not currently have a choice of fund, it would provide the opportunity to make an informed decision about their own investment goals and strategies. It would start to address the sense of complacency that one in three Australian workers have. They simply do not know where their superannuation is and have not claimed it.
That brings to mind a situation that my daughter was in with one employer some years ago. She changed jobs a few times and lost track of things. She simply accepted the word of the fund manager that the money had been put in, but in fact the super fund did not reflect any contributions being paid into her account. You could say that perhaps she should have been more vigilant. Indeed, she should have, but the system at the moment does not encourage or make it easy for people to keep track of their own funds. If it is one fund, you have only one thing to watch, and I am certain you would be more encouraged to do so. I suspect my daughter, like most Australians—especially young Australians—was overwhelmed by a confusing superannuation system. It is a system that does not give much joy to the person most affected: the employee.
The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 not only honours the government's seven-year commitment to overhaul the system but also recognises that, by providing employees with choice, we are giving them the incentive to take control of their retirement savings. Money Management defines it as follows:
The introduction of choice-of-fund has the potential to result in greater interest in superannuation as a savings vehicle and increased levels of awareness of the benefits of super. Subsequently, increased levels of contributions can be expected. 
It is likely that choice and portability would increase competition among superannuation providers for business which is currently `tied up', resulting in a better outcome for many fund members. The risk is that employees, when given control of their superannuation, could make decisions contrary to their best interests. This is why it is important to have in place a strong disclosure regime combined with professional advice.
In 2002, the Financial Planning Association released a report called Super choice, which was compiled for the FPA by Roy Morgan Research. The results suggested:
	Seventy two percent of respondents had their superannuation fund chosen by their employer, while twenty-five percent were already able to choose their own fund
	Eighty-eight percent of respondents would like to keep their superannuation fund when changing jobs.
There were various other findings, but these findings underline the fact that we do have to give people the ability to have one fund—not half a dozen, as is currently the situation. FPA chief executive Ken Breakspear says that all Australians have the fundamental right to choose their superannuation fund due to its enormous impact on their future. This is especially so with Australians seemingly retiring earlier—although I sometimes wonder if a lot of them are not going to come back to work in their later years.
While the Liberal and National parties have remained completely committed to introducing this bill, we recognise and appreciate the need, to get this bill passed, to make amendments that will satisfy the opposition. Since this bill was first introduced in 1998, after the choice of fund measures were removed, several amendments have been made. We now have a bill that recognises the rights of employees and removes the administrative burdens that were considered to affect employers. In fact, one of the worst issues was the cost of administration. I have seen funds that have ended up in debit simply because the cost of administration came to more than the value of the contributions. We now have a bill that, first and foremost, gives employees the right to nominate their own superannuation fund. It is a one simple choice option. They must select a complying superannuation fund or scheme, or retirement savings account, and they will be able to choose a fund at any time, provided they have not selected one in the previous 12 months and have supplied enough details for the employer to make that contribution on their behalf. 
We have amended this bill to reduce the burden on the employer. In its original form, the bill set out a three-step procedure for employers to follow. We now have a simplified process. If there is no award governing the contributions, the employer will be able to select any complying superannuation fund as a default fund. This is consistent with the current superannuation guarantee legislation. It will be totally transparent, it will be easier to follow and it will definitely give the employee the control over his own life that he currently does not have.
Labor is inclined to say that this is too hard—it is too difficult—and that employers are not well-enough informed to make these decisions. I think that is bunkum; I am sure they are. The government do not employ a defeatist attitude where people's lives are concerned. Let us help them to help themselves, if that is the situation. We believe that, with a comprehensive education program, Australians are—and will and should be—well equipped to make their own choices.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002, which will affect the retirement future of Australia's 8.8 million fund members. This bill seeks to provide employees with greater choice in the selection of employer sponsored superannuation. On the surface, it seems a sensible thing to propose. There are arguments to say that it could create greater competition in the super industry and lead to improved returns and that having people take greater control of their retirement future means that they will have more ownership over the decisions that they make. But equally the arguments against the bill are just as strong. 
You only have to look at the United Kingdom to discover what happened when deregulation of their superannuation market took place without safeguards to protect superannuation savings. Even the most free market culture in the world, the United States, is not talking about this sort of deregulation. In some cases in the UK fees doubled and additional costs were also incurred by those seeking financial advice. The bill will potentially see an increase in advertising for the various products, with these costs being passed on to consumers. The Australian Consumers Association has stated, `Without adequate regulation, fees and charges would keep rising with superannuation in the same way that deregulation of banks has led to increases in bank charges.'
Without the safeguards proposed by the opposition, many more Australians will find that their superannuation savings rapidly diminish. With deregulation many Australian employees will consider making changes to their fund or their investment. But how are they going to make an informed choice? The government claims that employees will be protected by improved disclosure and an education program. The Australian Taxation Office will spend some $28 million over four years on establishing choice and deregulation. But no-one will be surprised to discover that half the money budgeted will go to the ATO for administrative costs. Only the remaining $14 million will be used to educate the 8.8 million fund members on super choice. That is $1.60 per member and, frankly, it is not enough to ensure that sufficient information is provided to make an informed and appropriate decision—a decision that could have a serious impact on your retirement future.
In principle, the concept of choice is fine when the choices are clearly set out and well understood. However, this legislation fails because it is choice without the necessary safeguards. Choice without the necessary safeguards does not serve the interests of either the consumer or the superannuation industry. Superannuation is a complex financial product. It is not like buying a CD, a house or a car. I have serious concerns that the level of financial literacy required to make the sorts of choices the government is proposing is not widespread amongst the Australian community. When you ask most people about superannuation many do not understand the scheme that they are in, they do not understand how it works or how their deductions work and they do not understand what is going to be needed to build enough retirement income in order for them to have a secure retirement future.
Encouraging consumers to increase their financial literacy is a good thing but you cannot just throw open the industry in the way proposed in this bill without safeguards, because if you do that you will just leave people to sink or swim. That is why Labor has introduced a `safe choice' system—choice that will give consumers the ability to decide where to put their superannuation moneys but within a framework that allows real choice accompanied by appropriate safety. Foremost amongst these issues is that of adequate disclosure, particularly on the effect of fees, charges and commissions on superannuation accumulations. Consumers cannot be expected to make real choices if they do not understand what they are choosing.  
The government, of course, argues that the new disclosure regime, which was introduced as part of the FSR process, will resolve this problem. It frankly will not. Information and knowledge are two very separate concepts. The provision of information alone does not guarantee that consumers will have financial knowledge. Apart from the fact that disclosure alone will not be enough to ensure that consumers fully understand the choices they are making, recent research on the ASIC disclosure model has shown that there are major problems with this model and that even with recommended changes the model is inadequate.
As I have already mentioned, experience overseas has shown that increased competition in the retirement savings industry has not led to cost savings. In fact, costs have increased. But will charges increase? Shouldn't increased competition mean reduced costs? One needs only to look at the banking industry for an idea of what might happen. Costs have increased, in line with the increased marketing and advertising that super funds potentially will have to undertake to attract investors. These increased costs will naturally have to be passed on to investors. Amendments proposed by the opposition will see fees, charges and commissions capped, thereby protecting savings. Without a cap or some control over fees, charges and commissions, retirement savings will dramatically be reduced. The government may consider a small annual fee increase of, say, two per cent as insignificant. This two per cent increase will reduce the final retirement accumulation by 40 per cent. Labor cannot let that happen. 
But not only can administrative fees be increased; entry, exit and switching fees may also be affected by this bill. I can easily imagine a scenario where a fund may have unrealistically low entry fees to attract investors and then costly exit fees to ensure that investors remain. Telstra's mobile phone contracts are a real example of such control. Another positive amendment proposed by Labor is to ensure that entry, exit and switching fees are kept fair. This will be achieved by prohibiting fees beyond reasonable administration costs. This will help maintain the nest egg that so many Australians will be depending on in their retirement years.
It is not just the employee that will be affected by the bill as proposed by the government. We all remember the difficulties faced by many small businesses in collecting the GST for this government. We all remember the problems that small businesses had in completing the BAS return. We all remember the additional cost burden placed on small businesses getting their accountants to help them through this complex task. We also remember the time it took mums and dads to complete this form—time away from their families and from their businesses. This burden cannot be allowed to be replicated through complex and onerous procedures being imposed on small business people. Concern has already been expressed by a number of employer organisations. The Motor Traders Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Industry Group and the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association have all expressed concerns over the possibility of increased red tape and increased administrative obligations.
Australian small businesses are still smarting over the increased workload and costs flowing from the tax collection role inherited through the GST. Australian small businesses do not want to go through this again with superannuation fund choice. But what will happen should a small business not be able to meet the increased compliance costs or negotiate their way through complex forms and procedures? They will face the possibility of significant penalties and potential legal action. Labor has proposed that the bill be amended to exempt small business from the choice regime, an amendment supported by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia.  
Liberal members have been spruiking the right of choice in super funds, but they will not provide that same right of choice of domestic partner for superannuation purposes. Now that we are living in the 21st century, isn't it time that we all grew up and acknowledged that there are people living in committed and stable same-sex relationships? These relationships may be a little different from the Leave it to Beaver family of the 1950s or the Brady Bunch of the 1970s, but it does not make them any less significant or meaningful for the people involved. This bill as proposed by the government discriminates against same-sex couples by not allowing them to enjoy the same equity as others. We believe that same-sex couples should have that equity. They also have the right to feel secure and confident that their partner will have rights should one predecease the other. Again, Labor has proposed that the bill be amended to provide equity for those in same-sex relationships.
Our proposed changes will ensure that retirement savings are protected for the future and not eaten up by fees and charges. Our proposed changes will ensure that employees can make well-informed decisions on where to place their savings and in what investments. Our proposed changes will ensure that small business operators are not burdened with complex and onerous procedures. And our proposed changes will ensure that all Australians are treated equally with regard to their superannuation choices, regardless of their sexuality or domestic arrangements.
Labor does not support a bill that will introduce unsafe choice. The second reading amendment to the bill moved by the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, strengthens the bill and should be adopted. The bill is an unsafe choice because: there is no provision for clear, simple and comparable disclosure so that consumers can understand the total impact of fees and charges; excessive entry and exit fees, which act as barriers to choice, are not banned, nor is there provision for the regulation of any fees, charges and, in particular, commissions on investing the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions, which can significantly erode superannuation savings; there is no exemption for small business, further burdening it with red tape and paperwork and the consequential financial costs; it causes complications for those superannuation funds which provide low-cost life insurance for members, with the consequence that many funds will cease to provide a life insurance option; there is no provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program; there is no provision to include same-sex couples in the choice regime, further perpetuating the existing discrimination against same-sex couples in relation to superannuation rights; and there is no prohibition on financial service providers offering inducements to employers to direct superannuation to a particular fund, where the fund selected may not be the one that best represents the employees' interests. The changes proposed by Labor to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 will ensure that this bill meets the needs of the 8.8 million fund members. I commend the second reading amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. This is an important facet of the policy debate within the context of the superannuation industry, which is currently undergoing significant improvements due to the government's landmark reforms in superannuation for Australian workers, particularly for low-paid workers. The government is particularly aware of the importance of nurturing and encouraging a culture of saving within the Australian community. The current reforms proposed by this government recognise this need, and that is another reason why the bill is a welcome addition to the raft of reforms currently being undertaken in this parliament. 
The bill recognises the importance of allowing workers to choose where their superannuation contributions are to be paid. The government has consistently argued the need for this type of legislation to be passed. Unfortunately, though, attempts have been undermined in the past by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. This legislation will provide wider investment choice for employees and fund members and is a welcome initiative within the context of the superannuation policy debate. The opposition have consistently opposed choice legislation for superannuation funds. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, the opposition have consistently attacked the measures undertaken by the government.
The choice of superannuation fund legislation currently under debate has been introduced twice before by the government and has been defeated by the Labor Party and minor parties in the Senate on both occasions. This very unfortunate and persistent opposition has not advanced this crucial debate any further and has highlighted the Labor Party's spoiling role in opposing legislation that would substantially benefit working Australians in their financial planning for retirement incomes. But perhaps there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon. We know that the new Leader of the Opposition is, uncharacteristically for a member of the Labor Party, in favour of choice. He said so in 1995, when he stated:
If ... the needs of children and families are complex and diverse, then the role of government is simple and twofold: first, to maximise choice ...
So we know that the opposition should now be favouring choice as a central tenet in determining policy intentions for the benefit of Australians. Members opposite might do well to read the now Leader of the Opposition's comments on choice and come on board and strongly support this bill. Such hopes, I think, will not be realised, but we can only hope that in the new year the members of the opposition will read many of the previous comments of the new leader they have chosen, albeit by a narrow margin, and we may see some very interesting changes to their negative approach to the government's reform agenda.
It should be noted that superannuation savings represent for most people their second largest asset, after the family home. This factor highlights the importance of creating an industry that allows people freedom of choice in deciding who manages their superannuation. This will lead to increased competition within the industry and will see improved returns for workers on their superannuation savings. With this in mind, it is extremely disappointing that many within the Labor Party and minor parties have consistently worked over the years to oppose the government's reforms to allow greater choice of funds. Indeed, the proponents of the anti-choice argument are relying on the misguided premise that workers should not be trusted with decisions about where to invest their superannuation funds. It is an absurd notion and one that should sit quite uncomfortably with Australian workers who are trying to plan their retirement, but it is no surprise because it is these same people who also support denying workers the right to choose whether or not to join a union. 
All people in the work force should have the right to choose where their superannuation investment funds are channelled. It should not be the right of employers to force where a worker invests their superannuation savings. The legislation requires that employers comply with the government's choice of superannuation fund requirements. These changes are in no way new changes; they were announced as far back as the 1997-98 budget and represent the government's continued efforts to consolidate the superannuation industry and assist with working Australians' retirement incomes.
The bill legislates to allow employees to have greater flexibility in choosing where their contributions are to be deposited. Through amending the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992, this bill strives to provide that choice for employees. Choice of superannuation funds for employees constitutes the biggest change in superannuation policy since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee. The benefits of this system will be felt by many workers, who will welcome the opportunity to choose where their superannuation income goes. Employers will have to comply with these new regulations in two ways: by allowing the employee the choice as to which fund they wish their superannuation to be paid into or by formally allowing the support of a fund nominated by an employee in a written agreement.
We should remember the notion of choice in today's society. Workers have every right to nominate where their superannuation entitlements are to be invested, in a similar way as people are afforded choice when acquiring similar long-term assets such as personal investments and the family home. A key factor in the success of the long-running reforms of the superannuation industry is the exploration of the notion of freedom of choice to provide for the most effective and efficient system of retirement planning for working Australians. This reform is an important and necessary mechanism with which to give workers more flexibility and choice. In turn, this will effectively lead to greater services and lower fees stemming from competition between fund providers.
The choice of fund legislation will deliver control of superannuation savings into the sole domain of the workers themselves, who ultimately should have control over their retirement savings. This policy is all the more important, because we have seen in recent times that many funds have delivered negative returns to investors. The government already has safeguards in place to deliver greater transparency of operations and employee protection through the government's regulation of the superannuation industry and through the Financial Services Reform Act.
Australian workers should have the last say as to where their contributions are directed. As part of this policy venture, the government has also introduced portability of superannuation legislation which reaffirms commitments made most recently in the 2002-03 federal budget. This legislation complements the current bill for choice of funds in allowing members of accumulation funds the ability to transfer their savings from their existing fund to one of their own choice.
In March this year, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority detailed that there were more than 24 million superannuation accounts in Australia. This would reasonably equate to workers having two or even three separate superannuation accounts. This bill will allow for a reduction in fees and charges through the creation of a more competitive regime within the superannuation industry. Currently, superannuation funds hold about $500 billion in employee investments. This figure highlights the extreme importance of the industry and the fact that the Australian workers are the main contributors to this system and therefore should have complete control when it comes to dealing with their financial futures. 
In other industries that have undergone competitive and deregulatory changes in recent times, the argument of choice has been of paramount importance. It has led to an increase in consumers' awareness of where their money is going and to whom. This is the foundation argument of this bill: giving employees the opportunity for greater choice and jurisdiction over their superannuation and retirement savings. It is a strange and curious fact that Australians have limited choice over such an important product as superannuation, but the Australian Labor Party believes that the Australian public and workers do have a right and the ability to choose when it comes to election time but will not give them the freedom to choose how to allocate their own superannuation contributions and to which fund.
Superannuation is a compulsory financial need, and Australian employees currently have very little control over their superannuation incomes. Currently, employers and not employees hold the power to control superannuation savings, and it is this very anomaly in the system that needs to be urgently addressed. The Australian Financial Review has stated that the choice of fund legislation is `difficult to argue with in principle' and, indeed, it is difficult to argue with legislation that will give more power to employees who wish to choose where it is best to invest their superannuation savings. The Howard government has undertaken significant initiatives within the industry in recent times to improve its accessibility for Australian workers. This legislation is a necessary element of those changes and would give that much-demanded choice.
Whatever the Leader of the Opposition's musings on choice eight years ago, the Labor Party does not like choice: they oppose students having a choice about whether or not to join a student union; and they want to force workers to join militant unions in spite of the falling rates of union membership—which obviously illustrates the lack of service that such unions provide to workers. We know that at the end of the day the Labor Party is in favour of conscription, because that provides their fundamental financial stability, which they use to run their campaigns. But they should be a bit broad-minded and not confuse forcing people to join certain organisations and certain superannuation funds. They should remember that these funds do belong to workers and they should have every right to decide where these funds should be allocated. I am very proud to be a member of the coalition government, which both values and offers real choice. This is the very premise of this legislation, and for these reasons I commend the bill.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—Although the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 is intended to provide employees with greater choice in the selection of employer sponsored superannuation, Labor believes that the practical implementation of it presents many risks. This is the basis for Labor's opposition. As the minority report from the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation noted:
... consumers should have a broad and well-informed choice of fund with full protection—this Bill does not provide the basic elements of this objective. 
Superannuation was introduced by the Keating Labor government in order to ensure that all individuals would have an adequate standard of living upon retirement. Now nearly nine million Australians have superannuation, so any changes we make here affect nearly one in two Australians. If this government persists with this bill, it will adversely affect one in two Australians, in the opposition's view. Back then, those opposite opposed superannuation. The member for Mitchell said at the time:
... there is no fairness or justice in superannuation as it is being presented to the Australian workers by the current government.
The member for Corangamite said:
The disastrous consequences on employment have been discussed by bodies such as the former Confederation of Australian Industry.
Now the Liberal Party pretend to be the champions of superannuation. It has always been a Labor idea. Like Medicare, Labor introduced it and only Labor really believes in it. Therefore, I believe that only Labor can be trusted to have a correct view about it. Over each individual's working life they have the ability to accumulate a great deal of money in their superannuation fund. How that money is invested has the ability to greatly affect the standard of living of our population upon retirement. We have a duty of responsibility, a duty of care, to ensure that superannuation is invested sensibly.
In March 1998 the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation released the report entitled Choice of fund. They found that there was no evidence that significant numbers of employees sought choice of fund, that employers regarded choice as yet another unwanted administrative burden, and that the success of the policy depended on the employees making `an informed choice'—that it was important that employees understood the consequences of the decision they made. The Choice of fund report also found that key features of statements, such as disclosing fees, charges and commissions, must be simplified to allow adequate comparisons to take place.
Complicated information surrounding superannuation will present a major practical difficulty. Given the time required to understand the superannuation information, it is unlikely that many consumers will be able to make an informed decision relating to their choice of super fund. Nearly four out of five people do not complete their own tax return, due to its complexity. Superannuation would be just as complex, if not more so. Although the opposition do support the concept of choice in superannuation, we are not about to support an inadequate, insufficient and complex bill. Simply because the bill is called the `choice of superannuation funds' bill does not necessarily mean that it is a good bill or in fact that it is about real choices in superannuation. That is why, at the Senate select committee, the opposition made practical, sensible recommendations. But the government refused to listen or to improve the bill.
Additionally, there is a risk of further multiple account proliferation. With the ability to swap easily, there is a great danger of funds being lost. There are concerns relating to the compliance burden on business. There will be huge marketing campaigns devoted to trying to woo customers. This represents a waste of resources in unnecessary advertising and is likely to further add to the administrative cost of superannuation via the cost of competitive advertising being built into people's superannuation charges. The Australian Consumer Association has stated that, without adequate regulation, fees and charges will keep rising with superannuation in the same way that deregulation of the banks has led to an increase in bank fees and charges. 
There are a number of concerns relating to the practical consequences of this legislation. Choice is likely to increase the cost of funds, with transferral costs and administrative costs et cetera. Complicated product information is likely to convolute the issue for the average person taking on superannuation. There is the risk of members being fixated on short-term rather than long-term performance. There are high risks associated with that strategy. That is why I support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Kingston:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House declines to give the Bill a second reading, and regards it as an `unsafe choice' Bill because:
(1)	there is no provision for clear, simple and comparable disclosure so that consumers can understand the total impact of fees and charges;
(2)	excessive entry and exit fees, which act as barriers to choice, are not banned, nor is there provision for the regulation of any fees, charges and, in particular commissions on investing the compulsory 9% super-annuation guarantee contributions that can significantly erode superannuation savings;
(3)	there is no exemption for small business, further burdening it with red-tape and paperwork and the consequential financial costs ...
The government go on and on about how they are the party of small business, but, as with the GST, they are happy to give small business more and more red tape all the time. The amendment moved by the member for Kingston continues:
(4)	it causes complications for those superannuation funds which provide low cost life insurance for members, with the consequence that many funds will cease to provide a life insurance option;
(5)	there is no provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program ...
Most importantly, the amendment continues:
(6)	there is no provision to include same sex couples in the choice regime, further perpetuating the existing discrimination against same sex couples in relation to superannuation rights ...
It is all very well to say that people have a choice of super funds which do not discriminate. All super funds should not discriminate. People who want to pass on to a partner their superannuation, their life savings, should have the right to pass them on to the partner with whom they have had a loving, long-term relationship, regardless of their sexuality. It is a perpetuation of the discrimination against them that this bill would not see that all super funds do that. The amendment concludes:
(7)	there is no prohibition on financial service providers offering inducements to employers to direct superannuation to a particular fund where the fund selected may not be the one that best represents the employees' interests”. 
I would like to focus on part (6) of this amendment specifically. The additional comments by the Labor senators in the select report said:
This Bill represents substantial changes to national legislation that purports to provide choice for all Australians. Given that Australians have a fundamental right to choose a partner, we believe that this Bill should also make amendments to the provisions that currently discriminate against those who are in same-sex relationships. It is ironic that the Liberal Government—
so-called—
argues for choice as a fundamental right in so many contexts and yet in this Bill that is intended to provide superannuation choice of fund it doesn't also provide for choice of domestic partner for superannuation purposes.
This is a very major problem. The Melbourne Age recently identified eight per cent of the community in Victoria as living in same-sex relationships, and they have the right to dispose of their superannuation in an equal way with all other Australians. We were in a very similar situation a few months back with the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill, where the Labor Party moved an amendment to remove discrimination in superannuation but the government rejected it. Now we are in the same situation, and once again the government is going to reject equality for same-sex couples with this bill. 
On 21 August 2001, the Prime Minister said that he was opposed to discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. Yet in area after area the government continues discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In this area of superannuation it is particularly regrettable, as I thought the Liberal Party was meant to be in favour of property rights. When these people want to pass their superannuation on to their surviving partner, it is their perfect right. After all, they are savings accumulated during their lives living as a couple together.
The gay community are a very active community in all states. They have actively and successfully fought against discrimination. A few nights ago in Melbourne they held the Rainbow Awards. I had the privilege of launching the awards a few months back with Vivien St James, pictured in my newsletter, and earlier this week the awards were announced. Unfortunately I was not there—I am here. However, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the winners: from the hall of fame, Dulcie Du Jour and Chris Gill; best venue, DT's Hotel; Tex McKenzie; woman of the year, Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon; innovative event, Pride March Cake Bake-Off; Jan Hillier Drag Excellence, Dulcie Du Jour; best show, Hot August Night; entertainer of the year, Damian Nicholas; gay icon of the year, Justice Michael Kirby; Candi Stratton; best night out, at the Peel; Tabitha Turlington; young achiever, Andrea Anquillano; outstanding volunteer, Gay and Lesbian Switchboard volunteers—
—Did you get an honourable mention, Michael?
—Perhaps after this speech I might. As well as the fun and festivities, the issue of discrimination is one that is very alive in the gay community's mind in both Melbourne and Sydney—and, I am sure, in other cities too. The issue of discrimination in superannuation, tax, health, social security and even veterans' affairs is high on their agenda, and unfortunately this discrimination is perpetrated with this bill. I urge the House to support the amendments moved by the member for Kingston and adopt the Labor Party's policy that would end this discrimination.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. In supporting the bill, I take myself back 18 months to when I was visited by a worker from the then BHP plant at Western Port, now the BlueScope Steel plant at Western Port, who said to me, `Look, I simply want to be able to choose where I put my own superannuation.' He said that he thought that that was part of the government's policy and was interested as to why that was not being implemented. I explained then and I explain now that it is part of the government's policy, and it is being implemented, but that it was stalled in the Senate. It was stalled in the Senate for over a year.
Now, thankfully, that Senate obstruction has been removed, and we are in the process of giving workers at BHP, at Ingham's in Somerville, throughout the electorate of Flinders and in fact throughout Australia choice over where they will be able to place their own superannuation funds. That is good in itself, as an individual right and an individual choice, and it will also lead to much greater competition and pressure on the superannuation providers to perform and to provide results. That is a critical step. So when I think back to that meeting 18 months ago, I am proud to be able to say that this legislation provides choice in superannuation funds. For the first time, an industry worker, whether in a chicken plant in Somerville, an office in Cowes or electrical trades in Rosebud—in all of those areas—will have real choice over the superannuation which they choose for the rest of their lives. 
This bill is about moving towards the goal, the vision and the dream of lifetime portability of our superannuation account. For me, the end result and vision that we are working towards is that there will be a single account which each of us will be able to maintain, to rollover and to have as a lifetime account across all professions and all different employment models so that it does not becomes a job based superannuation account, it becomes a human based, person based account, and its sticks with them and stays with them. That will be a tremendous step forward. That is the vision; that is the goal; that is the objective.
When people say, `Oh, this doesn't achieve everything that I want,' I say, `Well, get out of the way.' Do not stop an improvement because you think that the perfect should be the enemy of the good. That is my message to the honourable colleagues on the opposite side of the House. Do not stand in the way of something which improves, simply because you might think that there are other things which could be added or amended. That is a very important thing, particularly when you come to the fact that this bill is all about the principle of choice.
There are approximately nine million Australians who have and maintain superannuation accounts of some form or other. Each one of those Australians will, over time, be able to assume greater control over their choice of funds. They do not have to elect to change. There is no burden on them to do so. There is a fiction which has been presented today that in some way this will be an extraordinary and complex business. It will not. 
What the legislation does is provide the capacity to consolidate and to roll over and, above all else, the capacity for people, if they so choose, to take the choice and to take responsibility for their own superannuation funds. That is a principle which, I would hope, every member of this House would endorse. This notion that each individual will have the capacity to say to the corporations for whom they work or to say to the superannuation fund providers, `I am not happy,' is the very same principle we have with government. The single most important thing is the capacity to choose whether to throw out a government and, in having that, to maintain responsibility, to maintain scrutiny, to maintain a sense of propriety over that government. It places that power in the hands of every individual. This legislation, for the first time in Australia's history, empowers and provides that opportunity for every individual.
Is it the finality? Of course not. Superannuation is, in historical terms, a relatively new concept and a relatively new product. We are adapting and developing. What we find on the other side, though—and I am not a natural knee-jerk critic of different views in the parliament—is that on this occasion there is a reform which the vast majority of them believe is a positive reform and yet the very motion which they brought before the parliament today is to block the reform, because they wish to tack onto it other elements which are not necessary. There may be merit in some of those and there may not, but they wish to tack those on and, in so doing, they wish to stop the passage of legislation which would provide choice for nine million Australians. 
In particular, I want to take on two of their arguments. The first argument is that this notion of increasing choice will increase the cost of funds because people might move. But what it does mean is that funds will have to be more accountable and that, where they are subject to choice, funds such as the large industry funds, which have 50 per cent union representation on their board, will, for the first time, have to compete to win business. That affects two elements of their performance. It affects their investment performance and it affects the costs, fees and charges which they will impose. Those will no longer just be compulsorily levied. People will have the choice as to whether they wish to accept or not accept that particular fund provider. That is an important step forward.
The second argument that I wish to take up that was brought up by our friends from the opposition is that they say there is no such thing as a union fund. Yet what we see across a range of industries is compulsory funds attached to those industries, paid into by union members, with compulsory 50 per cent union membership of the board. In that situation, you effectively have direction and control over the investments of those funds by the union members. I believe a critical step forward—it is not included in this bill, but that is no reason for not passing the bill, and I put that message to our friends from the opposition—is that in Australia we should be moving to a situation where each of the major funds has at least one-third of directors being independent.
That would do two things. One, it would ensure that neither the industry nor the union has control over the superannuation fund. Two, it would ensure that the independent directors would have an important role in ensuring that the viability of the fund is maintained, the integrity of the investment process is maintained and the health of the member's contribution is advanced and improved. As well as those first two, there is a third measure which I think is a very important one. That third measure, which comes from this notion of a core of one-third of independent directors, is very simple. It is the idea that it would create a class of independent directors and a practice of having independent funds management directors. I think that would be an extremely sensible and valuable step in advancing the Australian superannuation funds industry—an extremely sensible step forward.
The fourth thing I wish to raise is a point which our friends in the opposition have raised. They have talked about the fact that there should not be any discrimination in relation to same-sex partners and the ability to access superannuation funds. That is a reform which, over time, I would like to see achieved. I am against discrimination and I think that, as a society, we are evolving in that direction. That is something which I have been working towards quietly behind the scenes and something in which I believe. It is not a necessary element of this bill. It is not a reason to stop this bill. It is not a reason why we should not provide that choice immediately. It is something to work towards over the long term. I am happy to be able to make that point in public on the floor of a house of the parliament of Australia and to say that I am committed to the capacity for choice in superannuation funds over time for same-sex couples.
I believe that is an important position. It is one which comes from the heart. It is one of the fundamental reasons I am a member of the Liberal Party and it is one of the things in which I believe passionately. But I say to the opposition: it is no reason not to provide choice for the vast majority of Australians. Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Do not abuse the position that is entrusted to you. Do not abuse the opportunity that this House provides to create and propose new initiatives which bring forward new benefits for people within Australia. 
Overall, this bill has two primary purposes. Firstly, it provides more superannuation fund choice and flexibility for consumers. It fulfils the government's election promise to allow choice of superannuation fund, drawing from the superannuation policy statement A Better Superannuation System. So firstly it provides choice; and, secondly, it provides better superannuation services, and that is an extremely important step. Where does this bill fit within the overall context of Australian superannuation reform? It provides greater choice and flexibility for consumers by ensuring that employers provide a choice of funds to employees. It does so in the context that current federal and state legislation make it unusual for employees to be given choice—it is not a norm; it is a rare thing. This legislation will help to establish it as a fundamental principle. The change is necessary due to the fact that hundreds of Australian industries and those involved in working in them need tailored superannuation schemes. What we are working towards is the goal of lifetime personal portability. That is the simple concept in superannuation which all of us should keep fixed in our minds.
The second critical element of this bill is that it increases the quality of superannuation services, and it beggars belief that people might stand in the way of that improvement. Current state legislation does not actively encourage competition or even efficiency amongst superannuation providers. This encouragement is doubly necessary due to the fact that we have an ageing population and that, when we look forward to 2020 or 2030, we see that Australia will be more dependent upon the decisions we make now. The decisions we make now help to prepare Australia for a generation hence—they are critical—and, by encouraging an increased quality of superannuation services, as to their efficiency and their productivity, and decreasing the capacity of funds to gouge—which currently exists within the industry based, union run superannuation funds—we improve the capacity of returns for all Australian workers.
I believe that this bill is ultimately an important step forward; it is a real step forward. It may not be the final step but it is a necessary and critical step along the way. If one blocks this, as the opposition is proposing, we are left moribund; we are left without taking the necessary steps forward to help immediately, going forward from this day, the vast majority of Australian workers. But if we do pass this bill—if we do take the steps which are available—and if we do allow the reforms to occur then we are working towards (1) a more efficient economy, (2) a society which is better prepared for its long-term future and (3) perhaps most importantly of all, the capacity for individuals to control their own financial future.
As the member for Cook said in his speech, it would beggar belief if we were to tell Australians how much they could invest in their family home, where they had to invest and on what basis they had to invest in the family home. The second greatest asset owned by each Australian, on average, is their superannuation. In the same way that we have that flexibility which we do not question about the first asset, the family home, we should apply the same principles to the second asset, which is the superannuation fund. On that basis I am delighted to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. I commend it to the House. I urge all members of this House to support this bill and pass it forthwith.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—Superannuation is a very important issue in this country. It is one of the most important issues for all families because it is critical, and it has always been critical, that people have the capacity to save. But, given our ageing population and the changes that are occurring, it is more important than ever that there is a system of savings that is certain and fair. However, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 is not entirely fair, and that is why Labor has problems with it. I commend the member for Flinders—and I think the member for Sturt, who was in the chamber, agreed—for speaking out against the government on the issue of same-sex couples being discriminated against over superannuation. That took some courage and conviction, and I commend him for making those comments. However, he is clearly at odds with his leader and the minister on this matter. The government have no regard for same-sex couples. They are homophobic and they are discriminatory, and I think people understand that.
However, I would like to go to the heart of the rationale for the bill before I go into the detail; I would like to go into the reasons for this bill. I wish it were just a question of a bit of Liberal Party philosophy applied to a particular area of policy: the capacity of people to choose. However, I was struck by a quote that was in a Labor senators' report arising out of a Senate committee. The report quoted the member for Solomon, Mr David Tollner, speaking at a Northern Territory Industrial Relations Society conference on 31 August last year, as saying:
The other day I was at a backbench briefing. The subject matter was superannuation—an area in which I have some experience and I was paying attention. It was suggested that the freedom of choice in superannuation funds to be offered to employees through new legislation was, in part, a union busting exercise. I said: `How does that work?' I got referred up the line—to a senior parliamentary colleague who maintains a strong anti-union stance on all matters. He said he couldn't tell me how that works. The moral of the story is that sometimes the cause takes precedence over reason.
The member for Solomon unwittingly came across the rationale for this bill. This bill is about diminishing the capacity of industry funds to operate. In doing so, it is making the system far more complex and uncertain for Australian working families. It really worries me to think that the enmity this government has towards registered organisations of employees is such that it has an effect on so many areas of its own government policy, to the point where it will happily introduce a complex, unworkable set of arrangements in order to undermine industry funds which, in the end, are not union funds—there are employer and employee representatives on a trust fund that oversees their retirement savings. That is unfortunately the main rationale for this bill.
There have been efforts in other places to introduce choice in this manner. Indeed, I know that in the United Kingdom the Thatcher government introduced choice. It caused all sorts of problems to the system and made it very unworkable. It left many employees very vulnerable and, most importantly, it made their savings very vulnerable. I think the government has to get its mind back on what matters in this area.
The government likes to say that what it is about is choice. I can recall that, prior to the Hawke governments, those conservative governments were not about choice. Maybe they were, but the choice was that, if you were a manager, you might have got a good salary and superannuation. But very few ordinary wage earners in the late seventies and prior to the Hawke administration received superannuation. My father started work in the early- to mid-fifties. The first time he received superannuation was in the mid-eighties. He was an ordinary wage earner and, like many Australian workers, he was not in receipt of superannuation benefits. That came about in the eighties. 
As the member for Corio said earlier, those changes to superannuation occurred despite the opposition of the now Prime Minister, who was on the front bench then, and the trenchant opposition that the Liberal-National coalition had to those changes. They opposed superannuation. They did not want ordinary employees to have the capacity to save for their retirement. We know that super was there for many people—
—That's rubbish!
—But you opposed them. The member for Moncrieff interjects, but the fact is that, when those superannuation bills were passed into law or passed through the Senate, they were opposed by the then opposition, including the Prime Minister.
We know that the Prime Minister has always opposed Medicare and we know that he has always opposed superannuation. But we also know that the Prime Minister is mean and tricky. He has to go around and find ways to undermine things, not directly but indirectly, where he can. This bill is not about looking after the interests of ordinary working people and providing choice. This bill is more about undermining industry funds and setting adrift a system that is reliable and workable—albeit with some problems, which Labor have already made comment on. There are some major problems about portability that should be fixed. In these times when people are leaving their jobs or finding new jobs more often than once they did, there has to be a greater capacity to have a system of portability that ensures they are able to do that.
There are so many other issues that Labor would like to attend to and will attend to when in government, but this government historically is ideologically predisposed to not wanting people to have superannuation. It is on the record as such. I think this bill is an indication that it has concerns, as I said, for industry funds or what it likes to call union funds. Let us remember that industry funds enable employer representatives and employee representatives to oversee the retirement savings of a particular group of employees. Let us also remember that, in the last number of years, when compared with other funds, industry funds have fared better. When we look at the returns in a very difficult period for superannuation, with much of the investment being overseas, and we compare industry funds with non-industry funds, we find that, on average, they have done far better than those other schemes. So, despite the scaremongering and the enmity this government has towards those funds, they have outperformed other funds in the system.
I have great concerns about the actual motives behind the government's position on this. I am also concerned that they are not thinking clearly because, as the member for Solomon said, they are more about union busting. They are more concerned about that than they are about the 8.8 million Australian workers who are now recipients of superannuation. What Labor has said it will do is introduce a safe choice of fund and allow an individual to select the fund he or she wishes to join. Choice is at present already available to many employees prior to retirement and to most at retirement.
What most stands out from fund surveys is that, generally, these choice products—retail funds purchased by an individual—have higher costs and deliver lower returns. Choosing a fund sounds fair and simple in principle, but, in reality, when choice of fund is put into practice, it is essentially deregulation. In the United Kingdom, as I said earlier, when the Thatcher government introduced choice it was a major disaster, caused by misleading selling on a massive scale. Members were convinced to transfer on the advice of advisers selling commission based products. This eventually cost the financial services industry 11.56 billion in compensation. 
Similar problems have arisen in other unregulated systems. We argue that a safe choice regime will ensure that fund members in a compulsory superannuation system, where individual financial literacy is variable, will be fully protected from the pitfalls of a financial services marketing environment. A main feature of this regime will be the necessity for members transferring from one fund to another to sign a standard member option form that clearly compares all fees and charges and long-term investment returns for both the fund that the member is leaving and the fund that he or she proposes to transfer to. Fundamental to a safe choice regime is the clear disclosure of all fees, charges and commissions that may apply to a fund.
In addition, other tough but necessary regulation will be needed. Further details will be introduced by Labor in the coming months and leading up to the next election. Employees must be allowed to make an appropriate choice, so penalties will be introduced to deal with employers and financial institutions that use coercion to influence an employee to join a particular fund. So we are saying that, yes, there is choice now, and perhaps there should be greater choice where possible, but it has to be choice that provides protection for employees.
We think the government's intentions are blinded by their enmity towards industry funds and are not about ensuring that people, if allowed a greater capacity to elect which fund they are in, will be protected. This is not like buying a carton of milk or a CD; this is one of the most important financial decisions a person can make. I do not think that too many people fully understand the detail of superannuation. I do not pretend to. I would seek advice—counsel—if I had to make decisions, and I think that most reasonable people would like to be in that position. However, given that occasionally there is a nexus between where a person works and what superannuation fund they may be in a position to choose from, there needs to be a capacity for those employees to be properly protected.
That is what we are about. We would like to see people properly protected. We find that the way the government has gone about this does not properly ensure that employees will be in a position to make a choice with full disclosure and full knowledge, nor, we assume, in every circumstance, will they do anything other than take the advice of their employer. So, in discharging his or her responsibilities, the employer will have a great deal of responsibility in this regard.
I do, of course, support the amendments moved by the member for Kingston. I have concerns in relation to the government's application. I think the reason that the government's application is faulty is, to a large extent, because of its ideological hatred of trade unions and their involvement in industry funds. I think that is a real problem. If they could just get over that hurdle—if they could just get over their concern about and enmity towards unions—I think they would think more clearly on this very fundamental area of policy. So I concur with many of the comments made on this side of the House in relation to the problems.
Earlier I commended the member for Flinders—and I do so again—on his courage in standing up to the Prime Minister and the government on same sex couples' rights. I think he had every right to do that. I know there are other members—I think the member for Sturt is one of them—who support the capacity for same sex couples to be treated equally. It is 2003: when will it be time for this government not to treat same sex couples with such scant regard? So I commend the member for Flinders and those other members who were obviously not able to convince their own government to change this bill in respect of same sex couples. 
This bill was introduced into the House for the wrong reasons. It was introduced on the basis that it was about choice, but in effect it is about causing chaos in this very important area of policy for this nation, because of the enmity that this government has. In the end, you always have to question this government when it comes to superannuation. They have never supported it; they did not support it in the eighties, and now they cannot get rid of it. Like Medicare, the government are having trouble getting rid of it directly, so they would like to muck it up, cause problems and see it fail. They are against it, and they always have been. For those reasons, I have problems with this bill.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I am pleased to follow on from the member for Burke, as I cannot help but be a little bemused by his summary. I listened closely to him, and he said the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 is about the Howard government, in some underhanded way, going about ensuring superannuation fails. That was the thrust of what the member for Burke said: the choice of superannuation bill is a way in which the Howard government is attempting to make sure superannuation fails.
I am quite astounded that someone would come into this chamber to speak against this legislation and argue that it is about the Howard government wanting superannuation to fail. I find it incredible—amazing—that the member for Burke could actually believe the Australian people would sit there, listen to that diatribe and agree with him. Does the member for Burke think he has convinced anyone on the opposite side of the chamber that this legislation is about making superannuation fail, that there is some grand plot on the Howard government benches whereby we want billions of dollars of savings, in the form of people's superannuation, to be squandered? That is absolute rubbish, and the member for Burke's contribution—for lack of a better term—to this debate should be treated as absolute rubbish, because it is an absurdity.
This bill is actually about providing a choice of superannuation funds to employees. It is about saying we recognise employees are intelligent enough to make a decision about where they would like to see their superannuation contributions go. It is a recognition that there are many employees who take a very active interest in where their superannuation contributions go; employees who take the view that certain funds provide a better return or, alternatively, meet criteria they are looking for and who, on that basis, will make a decision about where their superannuation contributions go. The flip side of that is, if there are employees who are not interested in where their superannuation contributions go—and in an ideal world there would not be any of those employees—this bill provides that there will be default funds available to employers. The employer will make the contribution on behalf of the employee into a default fund.
With this legislation we are making sure, once again, that we do not sit here on high and decree what is appropriate for an employee. Rather, where possible, we will provide opportunities for the Australian people to take responsibility and to make up their own minds about ways in which their lives could be impacted. When it comes to superannuation, they have a crucial and fundamental decision to make about what happens with their superannuation. 
Let us put all of this into context. Back in the early 1990s, 12 to 14 per cent of the Australian population were aged 65 and over. It is predicted by demographers that by 2030 or thereabouts the percentage of the Australian population aged 65 and over will be in the vicinity of 25 per cent. Effectively, we will see a doubling in the number of people aged 65 and over during that period—at least, that is what is forecast. We have to be serious about the unique challenges that face the government, whether it be us or, one day, the opposition. The reality is that, should that doubling occur, the government will need to make a decision about how to fund the expectations of the Australian community.
It goes without saying that a large number of people have made very significant contributions throughout their lives to Australia's tax base. Rightly or wrongly, a lot of people take the attitude that when they retire—when they attain 60 or 65 years of age—they should be able and entitled to go onto the age pension. That is a reasonable expectation. But the question that really needs to be answered is: how will we address this large proportion of the Australian population that would like to be on some form of age pension benefit? Even when only 12 to 14 per cent of the population were aged 65 and over, it was difficult to pay for all of those benefits with our tax base. How much more difficult will it be when approximately 25 per cent of our population are expecting government support for their age pension?
I applaud the opposition for, in large part, being the initial driving force behind superannuation. I think it was a forward-looking policy to say that we needed to ensure Australians provided for their retirement. It was a recognition of the true fact that Australians needed to take charge of their wealth into the future so there would be some form of annuity available to them when it came to their retirement. But I heard the member for Burke say the Howard government is opposed to superannuation. Let us deal with that: that is absolute rot. We were opposed to the structure the ALP were looking at introducing in their legislation, but we are not opposed to superannuation at all. We fully support and applaud all Australians with regard to their superannuation. What we were opposed to was the structure the ALP were implementing. That is water under the bridge now, but I needed to put it on the record to refute what the member for Burke said.
The government have also looked at making sure that, when Australians do retire, there is, ideally, an annuity from their superannuation that they will be able to feed off which will provide a reasonable standard of living for them and which can be augmented by the age pension if necessary. A large part of that is making sure we have market conditions that are conducive for people wanting to be involved in superannuation. Compulsory contributions are already part of legislation, but the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 takes things another step forward.
As part of our 1997-98 budget we spoke about our push to have a choice of funds measure. This was reaffirmed in 2001 as part of our election policy platform, when we announced our A Better Superannuation System package—a policy that said we would ensure a choice of funds was made available to all employees. We said that because we recognise that it is a crucial step to providing incentives for employees to look at where their superannuation will be when it comes time to retire. 
From anecdotal evidence, it appears that a large number of Australians do not take an interest in their superannuation, because it seems to be something that is a bit too complex and something they do not want to deal with. This bill lays on the table an opportunity for them to take an interest and get involved, knowing that they can help to engineer the types of outcomes that they are seeking later in life when they retire.
We are very cognisant of the fact that providing choice of super may provide some additional compliance costs to small businesses and to employers in general. The Howard government is very aware of the fact that employers do not want to deal with more red tape. I know that on the Gold Coast, which has the highest number of small businesses per capita in this country, employers do not want to deal with more red tape. But what we fundamentally believe is that employees have the right to decide where their superannuation contributions should be going, and the bill before the House finds a very appropriate balance between the employers' wish to not have overly complex compliance and therefore high compliance costs and the employees' wish, should they so desire, to be able to choose where there superannuation contributions go.
As I touched upon at the outset of this debate, if an employee does not make a choice, a default fund is available. Initially when the government was mooting this legislation we said that, where there was an industry award—a Commonwealth or territory award—an industry fund should be used as the default fund. This bill amends our initial proposal and now provides that the status quo fund will be the default fund, provided of course that it is a complying fund for the purposes of the legislation. That means it is less onerous for small business.
Small business operators, and indeed all employers, have nothing to fear from the introduction of this bill. The compliance requirements associated with this bill are minimal. It means that, for employees, it might in fact be an even more attractive proposition to work for a particular employer because they perhaps are contributing to a particular fund or, alternatively, employers are more than willing and able to assist an employee to make an informed decision about where their superannuation should go.
I have spoken about the reasons why we believe choice of fund is good for employees, but let us also look at some of the other externalities that will flow from this bill—and they are positive, because we fundamentally believe that choice of superannuation will also provide enhanced competition, which in turn will lead to greater efficiency. The net outcome of enhanced competition and greater efficiency should be that there are improved returns on superannuation and, in addition to that, there should be lower charges and administration fees involved with superannuation.
By having choice of funds when it comes to employee contributions, fundamentally we have a situation where superannuation funds will need to compete to try to obtain as much as they can from their customer base. They will be looking at saying to employees: `Now that you are no longer anchored to a particular fund, come and invest your money with us. If you invest your money with us, we will be looking at $X as a return and looking at enhancing your bottom line, because we have put pressure on our administration charges—we have put downward pressure on the prices that are involved. And, because we take a very proactive approach, we are looking at achieving a higher return than one of our competitors.' 
It is a good outcome that, because of choice of funds legislation, there will be improved competition, greater efficiency, higher returns are more than likely, and it is expected there will be lower fees and charges involved with the administration of a super fund. Again, these are very positive, tangible results that I know the Australian people will respond to very strongly because they recognise that these will be the positive externalities that flow from choice of super funds.
I would also like to touch upon the fact that in this amendment we have also altered the deadline for when the choice of fund legislation will commence. Originally it was proposed that it would be 1 July 2004, but a number of employer groups have argued that they would like that to be extended by 12 months to ensure there is more than adequate time for preparation to comply with the new framework. As a consequence, this bill as it stands will provide for choice of fund commencing from 1 July 2005, providing a large lead-in time so that there are no nasty surprises for employers.
All in all, the bill before the House is good for employees because it means that they now can take charge and have an informed position about what they are doing with their superannuation. It is good for employers because we are giving them plenty of lead-in time and plenty of notice with regard to the change in the framework, and we are also ensuring that they now can be willing to meet the demands of employees to have control over their superannuation. We have amended the bill so that now employers are not in a situation where they need to look at default funds in relation to the industry fund but rather can continue with the status quo, provided that, as I said, the status quo is a complying fund.
An employee can make a choice at any time with respect to the fund they would like their contributions to go towards, provided they have not selected one in the previous 12 months. If an employee has not provided bank account details or any other prescribed information to their employer, the employer does not have to accept that fund. We have been very business friendly, particularly for small businesses, with this legislation to make sure that it creates as few compliance costs as possible. This bill is an important one. It recognises that where possible we need to encourage Australians to provide for their retirement and it limits the compliance costs for employers.
In the final throes of this discussion I would like to touch briefly upon the issue of same-sex couples. A number of speakers on both sides of the chamber have spoken about the situation with regard to same-sex couples and the allocation of superannuation between them. It is my view that, with regard to same-sex couples, whilst this bill does not make provision for the allocation of superannuation, superannuation should be treated the same as any other asset. A couple in a same-sex relationship should be able to bequeath their superannuation in a manner that is appropriate and in the same way as they would with any other household asset or, indeed, their family home or something of that nature. I think that ultimately should be the goal that we strive for as a modern government, and I am sure that in time we will achieve that outcome. This bill is a good bill and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I am delighted to speak in the parliament this afternoon on the last day of sittings for this parliamentary year and I extend, on behalf of my family, good wishes to colleagues in the parliament and to all those who make this place run so efficiently. I am honoured to speak following my good friend and Queensland colleague the member for Moncrieff, who, when he speaks in the chamber, always speaks very eloquently and with great intelligence. It is a great pleasure to speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. It is another example of the Howard government putting policy and legislation before the parliament that is in the interests of the country. It is also another example, correspondingly, of the opposition being in a frame of opposition just the sake of it. I say to those opposite: `Support this bill, because this is something that would enhance your prospects in the broader community. If you just listen to the people around the country, you might learn something.' 
Since the introduction of the government's A Better Superannuation System policy in 2001, and the electoral endorsement of that policy at the November 2001 elections, this government has worked very hard to achieve much-needed reform in Australia's superannuation system. The government has developed a whole raft of changes that will benefit the Australian community, with stronger and more equitable superannuation arrangements. These include the government's co-contribution for lower income earners, the super safety amendment, reduction of the superannuation surcharge, superannuation splitting for spouses, superannuation portability and, of course, this legislation that is now before us—the super choice amendment, which we hope will receive support from both houses of the parliament. All these changes are reforms that will provide very real benefits to our fellow Australians, very real benefits to the workers of Australia. They will improve the security and the efficiency of our superannuation system.
Unfortunately, as I have alluded to, the opposition seems to be in a position where it does not wish to subscribe to good policy, to policy and legislation that will make a very real difference to our fellow Australians. The Labor Party even voted down a reduction of the superannuation surcharge earlier this year. When I conveyed that to Ryan residents, who continually ask about that, they just remained absolutely astonished. This rate, if it had been accepted by the opposition, would have reduced the figure from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent. This would provide great savings to our fellow Australians, especially those nearing the age of retirement. But that is something that those of us on this side of the parliament will continue to work for. The reforms in A Better Superannuation System will clearly benefit Australian workers—the very people that the Labor Party is supposed to champion and fight for.
The amendments in this bill before us will provide more choice for superannuation funds for Australian employees. That is the essence of it. This legislation will alter the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and will hopefully take effect from 1 July 2004. The purpose of it is to enable Australian workers to have the freedom to decide which superannuation fund or scheme they want to subscribe to. Employers will need to be able to make contributions to a range of funds and comply with the choices of their employees. The onus will be on employers to provide a choice of superannuation funds and provide support for that range of funds. Employers will be obliged to provide their employees with unlimited choice in terms of complying with super funds, and there will be financial penalties for employers who do not comply with the choice of fund requirements.
I find it astonishing that putting up an idea of choice would receive stubborn opposition from those opposite. It is a situation, if I can use an analogy, which is like employers choosing homes for their employees. We would not compel employers to choose our homes; we would not let employers tell staff where to bank, who to insure with or which stocks to buy, so why continue with a system where people have little say in how one of our largest assets is invested? I say to the sole representative of the opposition sitting in the chamber, the member for Braddon—a decent man, a very civil man in this parliament—`Surely you wouldn't want to be told where to live or which stocks to buy?' Some of those opposite have even bought Telstra shares, if I recollect correctly. The member opposite might be one of them; I am not sure about that. Superannuation is a very important asset. I am sure he appreciates having the choice of where to live but, unfortunately, he does not subscribe to the view that he can have the choice of where to put his superannuation. 
This bill differs from previous bills rejected by the opposition. The process of this new amendment will be easier to administrate for employers and employees alike. Workers will have the option of choosing a fund through a formal process or through individual written agreements with their employers. A written agreement sees the worker providing written notice of a proposed fund for contributions and the employer giving written notice accepting that fund. I heard the member for Ballarat in the chamber earlier talking about this bill being counterproductive to the interests of small business and employers. What absolute nonsense. What sheer hypocrisy it is for those opposite to talk about what is in the interests of small business. They would not know the first thing about small business.
If the employer is already contributing to a defined benefits fund on behalf of the worker, then the employer must provide a formal choice of funds process. This is to ensure that employees will receive the necessary information so that they can make an informed decision about their choice. As colleagues on this side of the parliament have said very eloquently, and I am sure they will continue to make the point, who are we to say to the Australian public that they have no idea, that they do not know what is best for them? It is absolutely astonishing that those opposite can take the position to the Australian public that they know best about a very important asset—the superannuation funds of the employees of Australia.
The employer must offer a standard choice form to the employee within less than a month—within 28 days of employment. The employee can also request a standard choice form every 12 months. These are among provisions that make a difference and make this very responsible. There are default provisions; for instance, where the employee does not choose a complying fund, eligible default funds are defined in Commonwealth or industry awards for the employees or by the super fund that the employer contributes to for the majority of their employees.
The benefits of this legislation are significant. The clear and obvious benefit of the legislation is that Australian workers, Australian employees, will have influence over their super funds. Australian employees will be able to choose where their money goes. I say to those opposite and those listening throughout the country today that this is a very elementary concept: you choose where your money goes. You do not have the government telling you, as is the opposition's position by not supporting this bill.
It is most unusual that Australians cannot make this very simple, fundamental choice for themselves. I know the people of Ryan—the great electorate of Ryan that I have the privilege of representing—will stand shoulder to shoulder with those of us on this side of the chamber, because they are very concerned about how their superannuation is managed and looked after. They can choose for themselves. They do not need the Labor Party to tell them where their money should go. 
Superannuation is a compulsory financial product that all employers are obliged to provide for their employees. As I said, why shouldn't Australian workers be allowed to direct their own investment choices? By giving Australian employees more choice and the ability to participate in the decision-making process for superannuation, workers will also gain a sense of ownership and responsibility for their financial and retirement future. We all know that the Australian population is ageing, and so superannuation assumes critical importance, which hopefully all members of this parliament will acknowledge. So with this sense of ownership, workers may well contribute more voluntarily to their super outcomes and take a greater interest in how their money is managed and invested.
Another benefit will be increased competition. If employees and workers are not locked into a specific fund by their employers or their industry, the superannuation industry will need to work very hard to earn the respect of those workers. Australians work very hard for their money, and it is absolutely essential that their future investments are looked after properly by those who manage them. Efficiency will also be a positive outcome of the changes. In order to attract the hard-earned dollars of Australian workers, super funds will need to demonstrate their viability and performance in very real terms and they will have to perform for their members. Increased competition and efficiency will also put pressure on fund administration charges to be competitive, if not to be decreased.
There is widespread interest and concern throughout the Australian community about superannuation. As my Queensland colleague the member for Moncrieff alluded to, it is in fact the opposition that can perhaps claim some brownie points for being the initial driver of superannuation. As this government acknowledges, you should give credit where credit is due. It makes the point all the more dramatic on this last day of sitting that those opposite stand in a very different position to where they were a decade ago and a decade before that. More and more Australians recognise that their future retirement will depend on their superannuation funds, and that is why this is assuming supreme importance. Yet, in 2003, the very party that supposedly claims credit for this is doing a U-turn and doing everything in their power to make life difficult for those in the superannuation industry and those who have their superannuation funds at risk through superannuation managers. The people should have the choice as to where their money goes.
The Labor Party's response to these amendments is contemptuous; it is very patronising. They have dismissed it out of hand. They talk about it being of importance to small business, yet they go against what really is important to small business employers who want to make life easy for their employees in terms of superannuation investments and keep it as simple as possible. In the superannuation policy paper of 2002, the Labor Party said they wanted full investment choice. But when the option came before them, they rejected these amendments, as I have alluded to. Labor rejected the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill in 2003, which would have reduced the burden of the superannuation surcharge by almost five per cent over three years.
Let me repeat for the benefit of the people of Ryan, whom, as I said, it is a great pleasure and honour to represent in this parliament: the Labor opposition rejected the Howard government's intentions to reduce this surcharge. I might take this opportunity to be more specific for my constituents. I want to say again to Ryan residents like Mr Tony Speer of Taringa, who has written to me about the surcharges, that the government has tried to reduce them. That is right—the government has tried to reduce them. But the opposition stands firmly against this—an appalling situation over something so important. 
The government has demonstrated its strong commitment to improving and reforming the current superannuation regime in this country. I understand the former Leader of the Opposition was to address the cream of Australia's superannuation industry earlier this week, but something more important came up: the very question of who was going to lead their party. So superannuation came second to that. The superannuation industry lost out. The former Leader of the Opposition decided that he would rather cast his vote in a ballot than talk to the cream of Australia's superannuation industry. They were supposed to meet for a very important address and no-one addressed them, not even a staffer or an important adviser. I look forward to the new Leader of the Opposition talking to the Investment and Financial Services Association, who manage some $655 billion for nine million Australians—a big sum of money in anyone's language.
These 200 guests were regrettably unable to hear the words of wisdom from the former Leader of the Opposition, so I look forward very much to the new Leader of the Opposition going in and speaking to this industry. The member opposite, the member for Braddon, might be able to speak on superannuation and tell us what the Labor Party's position on superannuation is, what they are going to do and whether they are going to let our fellow Australians have choice in superannuation. Why would the opposition stand against this government's policy? It is just another example of its lack of commitment to the very important measures that this government is introducing. This is all about making life easy for Australians. The government has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving and reforming the current superannuation regime in this country, and the Minister for Revenue, Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan, has shown this commitment by tireless work in preparing a number of very significant legislative changes, including the current one that is before us, to revitalise the push for superannuation reform.
Other important initiatives, as I outlined at the outset, such as portability of superannuation, government co-contribution for low-income earners, surcharge reduction and superannuation splitting for spouses, have been put forward but all have been rejected by those opposite. That is an appalling state of affairs for an alternative government of the country. I want to quote my Taringa constituent Mr Speer. He says:
My family and I have been Liberal supporters for as long as I can remember. The friends and associates I mix with are the same. The subject of superannuation is, at our age, a major consideration and discussion topic when we meet. I have little doubt that the party who has the will to be serious about major changes to superannuation will win a lot of votes. People over the age of 45 do comprise the majority of the population, as I have already mentioned.
They are words of wisdom indeed and are very strongly reflective of why Mr Speer supports this side of government, this side of the parliament. It is because this government is doing exactly that. It is focusing on and is committed to superannuation and superannuation reform. I look forward to conveying to him and to other Ryan residents again that it is the opposition that has stood very stubbornly against all the measures that this government has introduced to try to reform the superannuation industry, to make this industry user friendly and very efficient, and to make a difference. 
In the debate on this very important bill, the member for Braddon looks a lonely soul sitting here in the chamber by himself. It is a shame that many of his colleagues have already flown home. Many of his Queensland colleagues have already abandoned him and gone back to Queensland. They obviously do not have an interest in this bill and in speaking to it, whereas those on this side of the chamber are getting up, one after the other, to speak very eloquently, very strongly and very genuinely about how important this bill is to superannuation. I know that the member opposite is a very decent and civil man, but regrettably he does not have any ideas about superannuation. Like his colleagues and his new leader, he is more concerned about things that are not what the people of Australia are concerned about, and one of the most important ones is superannuation.
Australia's superannuation industry is very important. A significant amount of money is invested in it, and this government strongly supports a savings culture. It is important for all Australians to be mindful of saving for their future and their retirement, and the Howard government stand very strongly behind that idea. We encourage it, and measures such as this bill and these amendments are all about that. It is a tragedy that those opposite will, for ideological, or perhaps philosophical, reasons that are very much out of sync with the broad Australian community, be opposing these measures. I ask those opposite: if you listen to the community and subscribe to commonsense and logic, how on earth could giving Australians choice in something so critical as superannuation be something not worthy of support? It is just amazing. It is that kind of conduct and attitude that will banish you to that side of the chamber for many years to come, indeed if not decades, until you get a decent Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps the member for Braddon might even put his hat in the ring. He might even then put Tasmania on the map.
In conclusion, I want to encourage those opposite to support this bill and these amendments, because they will make a difference to our fellow Australians. Why would well-meaning and strong schemes such as this which the government is putting before the parliament be opposed? I want to commend the amendments to the parliament. I want to invite the Labor Party to support the government in these important measures for the people of Australia and for the people of Ryan, for whom superannuation is of supreme importance to their lives and to their ease of mind. I am going to continue speaking in this parliament, in the greatest democratic chamber in the Western world: the Australian House of Representatives. I am going to speak very strongly about the importance of superannuation and what the government is doing to put it at the forefront of people's lives, because certainly the opposition does not do that at all.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I thank the members for Ryan and Moncrieff for their input into this. I notice that, unfortunately—and I sympathise with the member for Braddon over there—the rest of the booked speakers are missing in action, so the opposition is diminished. They have gone home—or gone fishing or whatever. It is a pleasure to talk on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. I want to quote Benjamin Franklin. In 1789, he wrote the words:
... in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.
More than 200 years later, a third certainty is emerging—that is, we have an ageing population. Australia, like most industrialised countries, is experiencing the ageing of its population through advances in medicine and better standards of living. In 40 years time, the number of people aged over 65 years will be doubled and the number of people over 85 years will be four times greater than it is today. That, together with the declining birth rate of the 1970s, means a much smaller work force will be contributing to the tax base required to support a rapidly increasing ageing population. That is one of the reasons why this bill, which provides choice in and portability of superannuation, is so important. The policy objective of the choice of fund proposal is to provide employees with greater choice as to which complying superannuation fund or RSA will receive compulsory superannuation contributions on their behalf from their employer. 
This element of choice will give employees freedom to make decisions about their retirement nest eggs and will create greater competition within the superannuation industry and, in turn, greater competition within the industry will place downward pressure on fees and charges. Increased competition and better returns will benefit all people with superannuation and will reduce, over a period of time, pressure on the age pension system. The age pension system is likely to come under pressure in the middle of the next decade, when the baby boomer generation starts retiring. So it is increasingly vital that we take steps now to encourage more people to save for their retirement and, importantly, to give them a choice about where their money is invested and how it is administered.
It is difficult to argue against the right to choose. The ability to decide where to invest your money should be a straightforward and basic democratic right. There would be outrage in the community, as suggested before, if it were ever suggested that people should have their homes, bank accounts or insurance policies chosen for them.
—These speaking notes sound similar to mine.
—Great thinkers think alike, Sid. One of the most significant investments that many people will ever make—and which will determine their standard of living in retirement—is beyond their control. Regardless of the fees they are charged, the returns their funds achieve or the services their funds deliver, employees cannot change their fund. Even though it is the worker's money and it is the worker paying the fees, the decision on which fund to invest in is made by the employer or, through their award, by their union—which might relate to some of the problems opposite. Imagine if in order to get a home loan the lender reserved the right to choose your house or your employer chose the bank account into which your wages should be paid. These scenarios would be totally unacceptable, and yet that is a scenario that currently exists with regard to superannuation, except in my home state of Western Australia.
To all those who argue against choice in superannuation, let me say that the Western Australian experience has been positive; we already have choice. The Western Australian experience has shown that the compliance burden for employers can be contained. The market has evolved to keep employer costs to a minimum. For example, the largest WA based super fund operates a clearing house for employers to make contributions efficiently and cheaply to multiple funds. Employers who use a clearing house need only write one cheque and provide details of the funds of which their employees are members, and it is handled.
Detractors of this legislation also argue that most people are not superannuation experts—neither are they necessarily real estate, banking, financial planning or insurance experts. But they should be given the choice to consult an expert, just as they do for other investments such as buying a home or investing in property. Of course, the status quo can remain for those who choose it. Anyone happy with their current superannuation arrangements can choose to retain them. It is all about choice—choice to direct your money to a fund of your own choosing or choice to leave your contributions where they are. 
The $6 billion in `lost' superannuation suggests very strongly that people tend to forget about money that they have no ability to control. If people actively have control over their own money, we should see a marked improvement in the level of interest in superannuation and a heightened awareness of participation in retirement saving programs. Research shows that most Australians want to be able to choose their own superannuation fund and have the freedom to move their money as and where they like. More than 70 per cent of respondents to a survey said that they would like `full choice of fund'. Yet still the opponents of choice say no. They appear to believe that it is preferable to let consumers languish in a fund with higher fees and charges and poor returns rather than focus on achievable reforms.
It is important that a strict regime of disclosure accompany the successful introduction of choice, and that regime is already in the pipeline. From March next year, financial advisers will not only have strict legislative disclosure requirements; they will also have to have passed more stringent licensing requirements. To comply with their obligations under the FSRA, planners will be required to disclose fully and completely all of their fees, charges and commissions. Similarly, all fees and charges associated with the products they are recommending will have to be disclosed. Where a planner's advice may have a detrimental impact on the client, the planner is required to explain clearly what that might be. For example, a planner advising a client to move to a new superannuation fund would clearly have to indicate if the ongoing fees and charges in the proposed new fund exceed those of the client's current fund. With open and honest disclosure, the client would then be in a position to make an informed choice over where his or her superannuation contributions should be invested. No employee will be obliged to change their fund if they are happy with their existing arrangements.
This legislation is all about empowerment, not compulsion. With more than $A500 billion invested in superannuation and representing for most Australians their second largest asset after the family home, superannuation is hugely important. The government is committed to ensuring that the superannuation system is robust, safe and flexible and that it meets the needs of Australians in retirement. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 builds on that commitment by giving choice to the employee and creating greater competition within the industry. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, for your usual sagacity and tolerance in the administration of your important work in this parliament. I wish you and your family and those who assist you in the work that you do a very happy Christmas.
The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 that is before the House is of great importance in ensuring that some 4.8 million ordinary Australians are entitled to a choice of which superannuation fund they wish to see their life savings deposited in. That is an important matter for many Australians, not just for those I have mentioned but also for the 0.6 million-odd businesses that are the employers and that are also likely to be affected by this choice legislation. 
I heard the address from the member for Kingston a little bit earlier in this debate. The first point he made about this proposed legislation—a point which seemed to not carry any weight at all—was that there would have been insufficient notice about the nature of the legislation and its provisions for those who might be affected by the legislation when it comes into force on 1 July next year. With the greatest respect to the member for Kingston, that is just complete rubbish. The fact is this legislation has been on the Notice Paper longer than just about any other legislation that has been proposed since this government began its beneficent regime back in 1996. Indeed, in 1997-98 the Treasurer, Mr Costello, proposed in the second budget that he put to the House this very measure. The Senate first rejected this legislation on 8 August 2001. So the members of this place have already had an opportunity to examine in some detail the proposal and the policy behind the proposal that is being considered today.
Since then there have been some further improvements to the proposal being put to the House through the process of consultation that the government have put in place. In particular, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Investment and Financial Services Association have been consulted. Employer groups—in particular, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—small business groups and those representing employee interests have also been consulted. The two concerns that were mentioned in that process of consultation—namely, the importance of reducing the burden of choice on employers whilst ensuring the key objective of greater choice of funds—were the principal focus of that process of consultation and that, I believe, has led to an improved piece of legislation coming before the House.
It was not just that process that led to an appreciation by the broader commercial community, by those superannuants who might be affected or by people who contribute to funds. Indeed, on 5 November 2001, in the document A Better Superannuation System, the coalition in a very clear statement put to the people of Australia the very measure that is now being proposed before this House. On 14 May last year the Assistant Treasurer put out a press release that detailed the measure that is now being considered. So the suggestion that there has been insufficient time or opportunity for those who might be affected by these measures to understand, comprehend, digest, comment on or be consulted about the measures is just complete rubbish. In addition to that, the government has contributed some $28.6 million to be spent over the next four years as part of a measure to assist in educational programs linked to the legislation. I commend the government and the minister for the presentation of these proposals. I suggest that the criticism by the opposition that they have had insufficient notice to comment on or be able to understand this legislation is completely empty and nonsensical.
The question then arises: what is the need for choice in a situation such as this? Under current arrangements there is no real choice for employees in relation to their superannuation fund. Employers deposit funds in appropriate, eligible funds as designated by the superannuation insurance scheme and relevant authorities, but also as a result of the choice of the employers. There is no choice for employees to determine the direction of the funds which make up the nest egg they are looking forward to when they retire.
One of the great things about being Australian is that we take care of our older people in ways that so many other countries do not. The superannuation legislation before the House, which this government strongly supports, is a very good example of the care that we have for older Australians and the respect that we have for the choices of older Australians, unlike those opposite who would rather dictate to those who make contributions to superannuation schemes and force them to go down a single track. 
What is the reason for their position? What is the reason for their opposition to choice? At the end of the day we know that the real reason is that they are seeking to protect the trustees of union superannuation funds and the choices of the union bosses in relation to employees. That is what it is all about. It is all about protecting the livelihoods of the trustees of the superannuation funds and the little golden nest eggs that they have been looking after for years. There is no real choice for the workers of Australia in the policies of the Australian Labor Party. They are exposed again for their hypocrisy in opposing this important legislation.
There is an important basic principle at work here. I will give two examples that have affected me in my work in the electorate of Wentworth. The first example concerns a number of people who were employees of Ansett airlines before its unfortunate demise. Several people have come to my office in despair because the superannuation fund arrangements that were put in place by the employer immediately prior to the demise of the airline—and there were some very strange goings-on with the choice of superannuation funds by the board, if I may say so—have left their superannuation at real risk. In some cases it appears they might even lose the benefit of that superannuation. I know some steps have been taken to try to address that problem, but the fact that they have been at significant risk as a result of games being played by one or two senior managers of the board of Ansett immediately before its demise indicates that there is a real reason why employees in this country should be given greater respect in relation to choice of superannuation funds.
I have another example. Recently a person employed by a business up in Bondi Junction came to my office. He was very concerned because the company, which had set up a superannuation fund for him through its own internal arrangements, had scarpered with the funds. The arrangements that had been put in place by this corporation to supposedly protect the interests of this employee were completely non-existent. There was a fraud perpetrated on this employee. He knew that it was going on, and I knew that it was going on—or that it was about to happen or it had immediately happened; we were not too sure. Of course the matter was referred to the police. The problem was that he had no choice as to the direction of his superannuation funds. It was happening before his very eyes. All he could do was leave that business and go to another business, but that was not what he wanted to do. So this legislation is important because the choice that is afforded to workers is also a protection for them.
I know it is said by some in the union movement that workers do not need that sort of protection because they can join a union, but that point can be turned back on the union movement itself: if the union movement is really doing its job and looking after the interests of employees, it ought not to be recommending necessarily that those employees join a union superannuation fund—a union-governed or -dominated superannuation fund. There may be other choices for workers. I hope that as a result of this legislation union bosses have the courage, the moral rectitude and the sense of concern for workers and members of their union to advise employees in particular businesses, especially in small to medium sized businesses, that there is a choice, that they do not have to go into the union superannuation fund. I hope that, in the education process which the government is wisely putting in place, employees will be told about those possible choices. That is why this legislation, which at heart offers choice to Australian workers, is so important. 
The member for Kingston said that not only does this legislation offer an unsafe choice—I think he called it the `unsafe choice' regime, and I have already dealt with that issue—but it does not offer an informed choice. But the whole point of the legislation is to afford workers the opportunity to have an informed choice. Let us take the union position. If the unions are doing their job, if the shopfloor steward or union delegate is really looking after the interests of the employees in a particular business, that delegate—that union—will be informing those staff members of the real choice that they have, and that information should include the alternatives.
There may be half a dozen substantial superannuation funds an employee can choose between. There may be some that are performing and some that are not. There may be some charging high fees, such as those charged—I think, inappropriately—at the moment by some superannuation funds, and some that are not. There may be some that are better managed than others. That will be the case, and that is why it is terribly important that the union delegates on the floor, the supervisors and so on, give the employees the information to be able to make that choice. So there is a reason, if people act properly, that informed choice will occur in the interests of employees and staff in particular businesses right across the nation, where there are unions.
Of course there will be some workplaces where there are no unions. In those places the education campaign that the government is putting in place will ensure that there is an informed choice for those people. There is information that will be going out, I understand, through the Australian Taxation Office. There will be material that will be distributed in accordance with what I have read in the explanatory memorandum—and I would recommend that all those who are interested in this examine that memorandum, because it sets out who will be entitled to receive that material.
The suggestion by the member for Kingston that this is an unsafe system is an empty criticism. The suggestion that it does not lead to an informed choice is hypocritical because it is a condemnation of the union movement, which is in a position to inform those workers of their entitlement to make a choice. I hope, and indeed I trust, that the workers of Australia, the 4.9-odd million people who will be affected by this legislation, will exercise a real and clear choice.
It has been said by the member for Kingston and others—using examples from Britain, Chile and other places around the world—that when choice of superannuation funds was opened up fees rose and management commissions were incurred. Even at entry and exit, there were costs imposed on superannuants and contributors. Indeed, when I look at the amendment proposed by Mr Cox, I see that one of the reasons that he gives—or that the opposition give—to oppose this legislation is that excessive entry and exit fees may be charged and that there is no incentive for a reduction in the fee structure. But that shows ignorance, if I may put it like that, of the way this legislation will work and the way the market will work in respect of fees.
One of the things that I am very concerned about at the moment in relation to managed funds is the fact that set fees of, say, up to 2½ per cent are charged on a capital fund under the management of trustees, directors or managers. For example, a flat fee of $5,000 may be charged on a $200,000 fund under the management of a trustee or manager. It seems to me that, by opening up the choice of superannuation funds, some pressure will be put on those managers to charge a more realistic fee, because people will have choice of funds. If they are not getting good value for money in relation to their nest egg—the money they will have when they retire—what will they do? They will not sit back and despair that they cannot do anything about it; they will make a choice. They might even ignore the recommendation of their union—that they should be in the union fund—when their money is being whittled away. They might decide in the interests of their family to put the money in a fund which they have information about—and there is plenty of information available from financial advisers—which will give a return to them and their family in their retirement. That is in the interests of their family and, ultimately, in the interests of all Australians. 
Another matter that I want to mention concerns a criticism, as I perceived it, made by the opposition in relation to same-sex couples. It is an issue that is raised in the amendment put forward by the opposition. The amendment says:
(6)	there is no provision to include same sex couples in the choice regime ...
This issue has been raised in debate before by both sides of the House, as has been recognised. But, with the greatest respect, as I read the legislation, it does not deprive same-sex couples of a choice. They can make a choice as to the superannuation regime by which they propose to have their funds managed and supervised. The choice as such does not involve any discrimination against same-sex couples. The logic of that is obvious, because one, two or more people in the same group may make the choice that is best suited to them. This legislation is not designed to recognise families or same-sex couples; it is designed to confer choice. It is disconcerting and silly of the opposition to make that sort of criticism of this legislation. If the opposition wish to propose such a measure, they should deal with it up front and in a more cogent fashion. Of course the rights of same-sex couples are important, but it does not seem to me that they are adversely affected by this legislation. It just does not deal with the question one way or the other, and it is not appropriate for it to do so.
In looking at the amendment proposed by the member for Kingston and the various reasons that he has put forward, I would like to finish by commenting on the part of the amendment that says there are no clear, simple and comparable disclosure provisions. When you look at part 2 of the legislation, you will see that it is the very opposite of what the member for Kingston has suggested. It is a very clear and simple procedure for any worker to make a choice of a superannuation fund that will be to his or her benefit. There are only two choices: an eligible fund which they may choose through a simple choice document, or a fund through an agreement which is reached with an employer. The choice is clear and simple. It just requires goodwill on the part of all those involved in workplaces around this country to make sure that it happens in the interests of all Australian families and all Australian contributors to superannuation. In that way, our older people will have an even greater choice of superannuation funds so they may enjoy the retirement which they deserve.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 today, particularly in the climate that we find ourselves in, based on the Intergenerational Report and other reports that are available. We are getting older, and the latest mortality figures show that men have an average life expectancy of 80 years of age and women have one of 85 years of age, so women need to put away a bit more for their superannuation. It is becoming more and more obvious that we have to ensure that we have adequate provisions so that we have a comfortable lifestyle well into our 80s and 90s. In the area that I represent, the longevity of people is quite outstanding. In fact, the other day I visited a gentleman who had turned 107. Quite regularly I present certificates to those who are 100 years of age or more. After you have presented seven of those certificates, you run out of things to say and do—and I am finding that more and more. We have to ensure that we put away for our later years as we are living longer. 
It is important in this climate to ensure that we have a good superannuation regime. The government have been very responsible in making sure that, as part of that regime, we have a choice of funds, a system that is very competitive and a system that ensures no-one is discriminated against. For far too long, it has been a very inflexible system. We have heard previous speakers, including the member for Wentworth, say that we had absolutely no choice, that it was inflexible and that employees were locked into funds that provided inadequate returns and had overly burdensome conditions and applications attached to them.
It is important that as a government we recognise that. One of the things that we did was to consult with a number of interested parties. We made sure that, when we proposed the choice of funds, we spoke to the superannuation industry, particularly the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Investment and Financial Services Association, about our proposal. Employer groups were also consulted—because there are two parts to this and the administration is largely borne by employer groups—and, in particular, large employer groups like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and myriad small businesses, including those that represent employee interests.
There were some enhancements made to the 1997-98 federal budget announcements that reduced the burden of choice on employers while ensuring that the key objective of the greater choice of funds was preserved. I have to admit that when I first saw this legislation some years ago I was very concerned about the burden on employers, particularly the amount of paperwork that would have to be endured and the cost, but some streamlining has been done and some changes have occurred, making it much simpler.
There are some aspects of this legislation that will ensure that there will be great benefits. It will increase competition. As in many other sectors, competition is a very healthy thing in the superannuation sector, particularly in the area of fees. I am pleased to see that people like Richard Gilbert in the industry have been working towards more disclosure, particularly in the area of superannuation fees. I think that is a very good thing, and I applaud his industry for ensuring that greater disclosure occurs. He has been working very hard with members of his industry so that consumers do have greater disclosure, particularly in the regime that relates to fees and charges here.
If there is one thing I get complaints about it is the amount of fees and charges and the lack of transparency in superannuation over a number of years. It has been a huge problem, and I think we are slowly getting to a situation where we are getting much more transparency in the industry—and what greater amount of transparency is there than to give people a choice? The opposition have been complaining all morning about what a terrible thing this is. I do not think giving people choice is a bad thing; I think it is a great thing. For far too long employees have been locked into large superannuation funds that have been controlled dominantly by the union movement. I also agree with the member for Wentworth that this opposition to the bill is very much about union dominance and control and influence in the superannuation industry. They do not want any new competitors and are doing everything they can to maintain and safeguard their dominance. So I think this is a great thing. It will lead to greater efficiency. It will mean more competition, it will provide greater returns in superannuation savings and it will also place a downward pressure on those administration fees we often hear about, particularly as they relate to funds. 
Greater competition benefits all Australians with super, and over time it will also have a beneficial effect on the age pension system. If we look at what is happening in European countries, we can no longer go down the path of being totally reliant on the age pension system. There are many countries in the world that have recognised that and have encouraged greater savings as well, placing a greater emphasis on providing for their retirement. Australia is no different. We have an ageing population and we have to consider the fact that very soon—in a particularly short period of time—we will have a very large number of baby boomers reaching retiring age. A system like this is very helpful for them.
When the system is implemented it will mean that employers will be able to offer a standard choice form to any employee within 28 days of their becoming an employee and that the employee can request a standard choice every 12 months. The bill, as I said, talks about competition, efficiency and reforms within the industry, and it will result in reductions in fees and charges for all Australians with superannuation. The bill will also allow employees to choose any complying super fund or RSA in which their employer contributions can be deposited and ensure that employer contributions are made to a defined benefit fund and that employers advise employees of the consequences of a choice that would reduce contributions or other specific entitlements. For example, the employer needs to notify the employee of cases where there is death or disability insurance as well.
To be effective, though, that choice would need to be exercised by the employee within 28 days of the employer providing an employee standard choice form. So, after making their initial choice, all employees would have to make a further choice at least every 12 months thereafter. Many of them might decide to stay within the fund, and that would be entirely up to them, but the choice is being provided. The employer would contribute to a default fund if the employee failed to provide an eligible choice fund within that specific time period. The opposition today have complained about it being unsafe; I do not see anything unsafe about that measure. There are plenty of safeguards here and they will ensure that employees will be safeguarded. Also an employer may be served a contravention notice and be subject to financial penalties if they fail to give effect to a valid employee choice. In line with the workplace relations reforms, choice would be subject to the terms of the workplace agreements, which would provide employees with a choice of superannuation fund for their employee contributions.
The bill also provides for other organisations such as the ATO and ASIC to offer information and advice to groups affected by changes and to become familiar with those details. They are fully available for anyone to access. Under the bill the ATO will provide employers and employees with information in a number of forms, and it will do it in a number of ways, including new pamphlets directly targeted to specific groups such as employers or employees. It will set out the relevant information in a question and answer style, which is very good. Also anyone can access this information through the ATO's existing Internet facilities, and there will be a number of ATO help lines set up as well. The private sector also will contribute towards the education of the affected groups, and the cost of the implementation is roughly $27 million initially for employers, with later recurrent costs of $80 million. For employees, it will cost nothing, and for fund and RSA providers it will cost $7 million initially, with subsequent recurrent costs of about $2 million. 
This is a very good system that has been modified over time. I reject much of what the opposition has had to say today about there not being enough choice, about how it will not reduce bureaucracy and will increase red tape, and about how it does not deal with fees and does not result in safety and security for employees. Safety and security are what this is all about. They are among the strongest features of this bill. I absolutely reject everything that has been offered by the other side in their opposition to this. Superannuation is a long-term investment. It is important that the safety of that investment is guaranteed. It is important that Australians have that choice and it is important that they have confidence in a superannuation system that will provide them with more and more security in the years to come. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—The Labor Party's opposition to the implementation of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002 is a commentary upon the current status of the Australian Labor Party and, more particularly, what is almost a Luddite culture. Here we are addressing the sixth or seventh piece of legislation in recent times that improves the existing circumstances. It may not improve them to the extent that the Labor Party would desire and it may even be something that people will not like, but, if that is the problem—and more particularly the second bit—why would the Labor opposition, which aspires to be the next government, antagonise the Australian people? Why is it so important that Labor members stop pieces of legislation on such spurious grounds?
Labor members have only one constituency, a rusted constituency, left. It is often referred to as the trade union movement, as though its membership encompassed everyone. We well know that even a large percentage of the remaining 17 or 20 per cent of people in the work force who are trade union members do not vote Labor. Labor's constituency is the trade union bureaucracy. Of course, that bureaucracy has inordinate power over the future of Labor people who enter this place and vote. They say that it is down to 50 per cent. That means that you only have to find one other person to vote with you. That is extreme. Rupert Murdoch would tell you that that is quite enough if you want to run a big company.
The reality is that Labor's opposition to the legislation is due to unnecessary concern about protecting the established trade union superannuation funds. If we believed the retired Secretary to the Treasury who goes on television frequently and very slowly tells us that they are the best thing since sliced bread, we would have nothing to fear. There might even be people voting with their feet under a choice regime and saying to their employer: `This is the best option for me and I want you to take me out of, say, the AMP and put me in C+BUS. I am not a builder but that is where I want to be, because I believe they will deliver me better outcomes.' There is some evidence of that today. The reality is that that will be the choice for an employee but there are other contemporary issues that seem to be misunderstood. 
I was in this House when the then Treasurer Keating implemented compulsory superannuation levies. Prior to that we had had some award-structured levies. In fact, I addressed the House during that period to point out evidence that was given to me by seasonal workers in my electorate—and that is another contemporary issue. People today can seldom anticipate lifetime employment, but for many, particularly those represented by rural and regional members of parliament, there is almost a culture of seasonal employment. People work for 11 months a year but in any one year they might have three separate employers, maybe more, and they do it every year. Those workers came to me and said: `In each case we have been put into a different superannuation scheme. The outcome is that we now have less money than the employer contributed. It is being eroded by management fees and things of that nature.' I related that evidence to the House prior to the Keating superannuation law but nothing was done about it.
Here we are today, with surely the most substantial outcome available to workers in many forms of employment. They are able to say to their employers: `I want not only to stay with the company you have been putting my money into but also to aggregate or round up all my other funds and get them into one scheme. It is my intention, at least for the foreseeable future, if I leave this employment, to take that policy with me so that I can say to my next employer that that is where I want to put it so that I can get the aggregation of those funds and a single management fee.' Surely, bearing in mind all other issues to be considered, it is worth while passing this legislation. There is evidence of huge amounts outstanding but nobody knows who owns them. Of course those amounts are now starting to add to the bottom line of a lot of funds that might be claiming a performance to which they are not necessarily entitled. I am not sure how that bookkeeping would work but it is a distinct possibility.
Even if there is nothing else of value in this legislation, it offers a choice to people to round up all their funds into a single entitlement. That is being opposed on the ground that somebody might take a bit out of C+BUS or something else in that process, yet there is the opportunity that C+BUS might get more. Do members want me to suggest adjourning the debate?
—It is the final day of the session. Therefore, I am extending some generosity.
—If everybody is fired up and ready to go—I have given only half my contribution on this bill; I am sure that the House would be delighted to hear the other half.
—As the member for O'Connor will be well aware, the chair will do whatever the House wishes. I am not sure what the member for O'Connor's instructions from the Government Whip were. I am happy for him to continue, unless he has some other specific purpose.
—For the purpose of obliging the House, I would be more than willing to suggest that I continue my remarks at a later hour this day or next year. I do not think that there is any intention to conclude this matter today, so I am more than willing to truncate my remarks, provided I have the opportunity to continue at another time.
—I reassure the member for O'Connor that it would be my wish, since the clock still has 13 minutes on it, to ensure that he has the opportunity to be called again. 
—Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would be very happy to move that the member be not further heard, if that would assist the House!
—The member for Bruce will resume his seat. The member for Bruce's sense of humour is probably not needed at this point in time.
—Come on, Mr Speaker, he's always good for a laugh!
—I am not going to argue with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about that. But I do need an indication from the House as to whether it wishes the debate to be adjourned, and for the adjourned debate to be listed for a later hour this day.
Debate interrupted.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
Today is a historic day for higher education, and it is also an extremely important milestone in the economic and social development of our country. Education is understandably, and it should be, an emotional issue. It is something about which we feel a deep sense of commitment and understanding. As Thomas Jefferson said, education is the defence of the nation—it is what will defend our children most from that which we fear as human beings, and that is ignorance, fear of change and fear of the people we do not always understand or want. Education, more than anything else, will give us cultural and social resilience, and it will also be the foundation upon which our economic prosperity will be built. The kind of Australia that Australians will be living in and young people today will be living in when they are parents and grandparents will be driven largely by what happens in higher education. 
This bill and these amendments, which we strongly support, may not be popular in all quarters, but the government is not here to be popular. We are here to do what is right for our country. There are many things in these measures which are popular and there are some things that are not always well received by all people, but we are committed to doing what is right. The reforms to higher education embrace a far-ranging package of measures, which include changes to the regulation and management of universities, and the size, composition and functions of university governing councils. We are moving to change the fundamental funding formula for universities by providing funding to universities on the basis of what they deliver, through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme.
The first instalment of the $2.4 billion of extra public funding, available in the first five years, will be delivered to universities in increments of 2½ per cent, five per cent and 7½ per cent each year for the first three years. In addition to that, there are 34,000 fully funded HECS places coming into the system to provide more opportunities for thousands of Australians. In addition to that, $122 million will specifically be provided to regional and rural campuses—60 of them across Australia—which often operate from a poorer industrial and economic base.
The government is also changing the loans schemes which support students to the Higher Education Loan Program. Under the HECS arrangements, the repayment threshold—the level at which university graduates start to pay back their share of the contribution that they have made to their higher education—will increase to $35,000 and will commence next financial year, 2004-05. For the first time, Australian students who are full fee paying students in Australian public and private universities will have access to loans provided to them by the Australian taxpayer. They will pay a flat 20 per cent administration charge, which is less than a two per cent real interest rate, for those loans. Again, not a cent will be paid back until they are earning in excess of $35,000.
For the very first time, Australian students who want to spend up to one year studying in another country during the course of their undergraduate studies will also have access to a loan—OS-HELP, or overseas HELP. The government is also going to see that postgraduate students do not pay any interest rate or charge at all on the loans to support their studies. There are 34,000 scholarships in this package to support low-income students whilst they are actually at university, and there are 15,000 scholarships worth $16,000 each over four years and 17,500 scholarships worth $8,000 over four years to support students with their living and accommodation costs while they are at university. Neither of those scholarships will be affected by the income test under the Social Security Act. The government is also saying to Australian students, `Look, we obviously want you to have a university education, but you cannot go on doing endless undergraduate degrees,' so a seven-year equivalent, full-time learning entitlement, with additions for financial and other forms of duress, will be available, along with opportunities for students who face extenuating circumstances. (Extension of time granted)
In addition to that, for the very first time in Australia—and in response to advocacy from the leaders of Australia's universities—the universities themselves will be required to set the HECS charge. At the moment the most mediocre course delivered by the most uninterested people in the least desirable university in the country attracts exactly the same HECS charge as university courses that are considered to be of a higher quality. For the very first time, universities will set a HECS charge between zero and a level which is no more than 25 per cent above current HECS levels. That means that, for the first time, universities will be required to think about what they are offering to students and about what students, as graduates, get when they are paying back their HECS as their contribution to their education. It also means that universities will need to look at what is being levied by the other universities. For the first time, what students think of the quality of their education will be systematically publicised so that there will be a richer form of information available to students to help them choose the best university to attend.
We are also increasing the capacity of universities. At the same time as increasing HECS places in universities, we are allowing universities, having filled their expanded number of HECS places, to then, if they wish to, offer full fee paying places to Australian students. Once the HECS places have been filled, up to half as many full fee paying places again may be offered. This package also increases by 7.1 per cent the money available for the education of nurses and by 9.7 per cent the money available for the education of teachers.
There is a $138 million learning and teaching performance fund. Universities that meet certain requirements in providing quality teaching and learning to students will be able to access $138 million in support of quality teaching. For too long in this country there has been far too much emphasis on research in universities, to the exclusion of quality teaching. As parents we want many things for our children, and amongst those things we want our children to be educated in universities by people who are not only committed to teaching but also trained in teaching. It seems absurd that we have professionalism in school teaching but only a quarter of those who teach in universities have any kind of qualification or training for what is considered to be a fundamental task. The government will also be establishing, at a cost of $22 million, the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership. This will mean that academics themselves will be not only determining standards in quality teaching but also working with one another to maintain and improve those standards.
Much has been said about industrial relations and the workplace environment in universities throughout the last few weeks. This package means that, for the first time, no university will be able to refuse to offer an Australian workplace agreement to an academic. Importantly, there is a $55 million workplace performance funding pool in the package. That means that universities who meet strict criteria for workplace relations and performance will be able to access $55 million to provide additional resources to support salary supplementation to outstanding academics. There is also $36 million for a collaboration and structural reform fund. That means there is money available to co-locate TAFES and senior secondary colleges with universities.
More than $50 million will go into the fair go program, which is intended to provide support for low-income students in enabling courses preparing them for university and to see that universities are required to reach out into—and will be financially rewarded for reaching out into—low-income communities to support young people who have never seen a university and perhaps might not previously have been able to. There is more than $30 million specifically to support Indigenous education. A business-higher education roundtable will be established, and there will be an increasing emphasis on graduate skills assessment. 
This package contains a range of things, but fundamentally it is about reform. It contains almost $11 billion of additional public investment in higher education over the next 10 years. It contains, finally, flexibility on HECS charges levied on students. Loans will be provided to full fee paying Australian students in public and private universities. (Extension of time granted) It contains performance based funding pools not only for learning and teaching but also for workplace performance; governance reform; and an advancement in workplace relations reform. The next major frontier in university reform, of course, is to reform the way in which university research is funded. That is an issue to which the government will be seriously addressing itself next year.
In concluding my remarks, a number of people need to be thanked for bringing us this far. There have been many shrill and opportunistic things said in opposition to the package. Many of the things said by those who are opposed to it have been untrue, misleading and intended to strike fear into the hearts of everyday Australians. I say to the young people of Australia, who will benefit ultimately from the substantial improvement to the quality of education they will receive—through the employment of more staff, the construction of more buildings and the provision of more places—that it will do us no good at all as a country if all we do is fund more places such that they ultimately find that the institution from which they receive their degree has a mediocre, if not poor, reputation internationally.
It is most important that we understand that the quality of education is being judged not within Australia but against international benchmarks. The case for reform rests on a number of things, but we need to understand that our universities are competing with the very best in the world. Already a trickle—and it is at risk of becoming a flood—of the brightest young Australians are leaving this country to receive a university education in North America, Singapore or Europe. They do so on the basis that they are being courted to receive an education in a world-class university. We need to understand that, if we continue as we are, we will create a culture of mediocrity in universities.
It is fundamentally important that we realise it is not just about increasing investment in higher education; it is also about changing the way in which universities are regulated and administered. I did not see the Leader of the Opposition's higher education policy, which was produced in 1998 and subsequently, I understand, effectively destroyed by the then Leader of the Opposition. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition. I say to him, `You know that this country needs much of what is in this package.' The Leader of the Opposition said earlier this week that if the government does what is right for Australia he will support it. I challenge the Labor Party to support this—to put aside childish, undergraduate-like behaviour and shrill opportunism for its own sake and instead look towards the future of the country. This is extremely important.
I would especially like to thank the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee for its outstanding leadership. Professor Deryk Schreuder, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, and the incoming President, Professor Di Yerbury from Macquarie University have shown outstanding leadership through this. It has been extremely difficult for them to lead 38 vice-chancellors, bring them to a common position and actively engage the political process and do so knowing that at times there are some people in the sector who do not agree with everything we are trying to do which we know is necessary for our future. To John Mullarvey, its chief executive officer, I say, `Thank you for what you have done.' 
I would also like to thank the officers of the Department of Education, Science and Training. It is common in this country to criticise public servants as much as politicians, but I would very much like to pay tribute to Bill Burmester, Carol Nicoll, Maria Fernandez and a team of wonderful hardworking public servants who have worked 18-hour days to get us to where we are. I would like to thank my staff. I would particularly like to pay tribute to Peta Lane. I also take this opportunity to especially pay tribute to four senators who put Australia's interests ahead of their own interests and ahead of political opportunism and who did not easily or enthusiastically embrace the reforms early. But when they scratched away the political rhetoric and the opportunism that have been put about by the Labor Party and looked at the facts, the problems that face Australia and our future and what will be required to deliver the future that we all want for our children they realised that this package is absolutely essential. (Extension of time granted).
I would like to especially pay tribute to those four senators: Senator Meg Lees for her leadership—she is a woman of substance; Senator Shayne Murphy—any bloke that likes trout fishing has got to be all right, in my view, and he is a bloke that looks you straight in the eye and deals with you straight; Senator Len Harris of One Nation—he said to me, `I am a man of my word'—who enthusiastically looked at the facts and consequently supported the package; and  Senator Harradine, who is as ethical as he is focused on detail.
Finally, it is obvious that the Australian Labor Party has failed. It has been given the choice of changing or proving change is not necessary. It has sought to oppose things for its own sake. I say to the Labor Party that knowing what you are against is not the same as knowing what Australia needs. I strongly commend these amendments. I commend the bill to the House, and I thank all those people who had the courage to make this happen and especially my own colleagues for their support and enthusiasm.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,59,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—Voters will have a very clear choice when it comes to education at the next election. On the one hand, they will have the choice between the Howard government's 25 per cent price hike or Labor's commitment to reversing these fee increases. They will have a choice between a third of Australian university students jumping the queue or paying full fees of up to $100,000 or Labor's abolition of full fees and our commitment to entry on merit, not money.
The government, of course, wants a shrinking proportion of people going to university. Labor wants 20,000 extra people a year going to university and another 20,000 going to TAFE. Do we want to see this government sit back and do we want to see quality decline? Or will the public vote for Labor's commitment to properly index university funding, to put an additional $312 million into universities to make sure that they are properly funded and that class sizes are reduced and the quality of education is improved? It is only Labor that will make sure that the University of Western Sydney and Victoria University are properly funded. This government has let those two universities down so severely. 
This is a very sad day indeed for Australian universities. I say to the Howard government: this is only the beginning of the fight. We will be taking this fight right up to the election and beyond. A Labor government will reverse the unfair changes in this bill and provide universities with the support they need to become world class without making Australian students shoulder more and more debt. I can tell you we will be campaigning on these issues right up to the election and right through the election. We will not be supporting any legislation that drives more and more Australians, especially young Australians, into deeper and deeper debt.
This is always what has been at the heart of this legislation. There has been one thing that the previous minister for education, Dr Kemp, and the current minister have always wanted: a huge price hike. That is what this legislation has been about—only a price hike. That is not reform; it is just a price hike. For Labor, the battle to keep our universities open to all qualified Australians is not over just because this legislation passes the parliament. We will reverse these changes and we will make sure that those young Australians and older Australians who are qualified to go to university will have the opportunity to do so.
This legislation is all about hiking up the cost of a university education. We want to make sure that there is a fairer way. We have put our policy on the table. It has been out there for six months for everybody to see. We will show that there is a different way from the Howard government way: a fairer way, a way that actually gives all talented Australians a chance to get a university education. It will not be based on their bank balance. That will not be Labor's way. That is the Liberal way—the Liberal way is about how much money you have in your bank balance. But Labor's way will be about how hard you have worked—that is the Labor way. If you have worked hard, if you have got the marks, you will get a university education. We believe in expanding opportunities, creating more publicly funded university places, not fewer. We do not believe that Australian students and their families should be driven further and further into debt. That is at the heart of this legislation. These students are going to be driven further and further into debt just because they want to expand their university education and contribute to the nation's prosperity.
We will see the figures when the university offers come out next year, but we know that at the moment there are about 20,000 qualified Australians who miss out on a university place. The minister acknowledges this. Of course there are not 20,000 new places in this legislation. (Extension of time granted) As I said, there are 20,000 students already missing out on a university place—20,000 students who have studied hard. We know that many of them have just finished their exams. Many of them will be applying to go to university and at least 20,000 of them next year are going to be sorely disappointed because this legislation does not include 20,000 new places.
Can you actually believe—I must say that I find it extraordinary—that this legislation does not even create enough publicly funded places to keep pace with population growth? The proportion of people going to university as a result of this legislation will decline. How can that be good for Australia's prosperity? What sort of government does that? This government's answer is that 35 per cent of places at universities can go to those who pay full fees.
—If you've got the money. 
—If you have the money, you will get a university place. We know how much we are talking about. We are talking about $100,000 or more. So it will be the case that if you have the money you will be able to buy your way into university ahead of other students who have better marks than you. This is certainly not fair. It is not the Australian way of doing things. This government is determined to limit the number of publicly funded places and to basically say, `If you've got the money you will be able to buy a place.'
I thought—and many of you would have heard this catchcry—that the government were against queuejumping. Many of us have heard the argument time and time again from this government that they are against queuejumping, but not when it comes to a university place. When it comes to a university place and making sure that the privileged and the wealthy can get into university without the marks, the government are all for queuejumping. That is exactly what they are on about. Labor, by contrast, will abolish all full fee paying places for Australian undergraduates, because we want to make sure that it is merit, not money, that determines how you get a university place.
Honourable members interjecting—
—Let me point out to people on both sides of the House that while their body clocks may compel them to interject between 2.00 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. the chair makes no such provision. 
—In the policy that Labor announced in July, we showed that we aim to do what no Australian government has ever contemplated—and certainly this government does not contemplate it. Labor in government will give every Australian with the motivation and the marks the opportunity to get a tertiary education. That has never been done before. We on this side of the House do not believe in turning away qualified Australians who are committed to furthering their education. That is why we are determined to create 20,000—
—You're getting a message.
—There would be no hope of you getting it, Wilson. We are determined to create 20,000 additional university places and another 20,000 TAFE places. While we are talking about places, last night it was the case that government senators voted against Labor's amendment to create an additional 20,000 places. They voted against it. They should be ashamed of themselves, because they do not want to provide the places that are necessary.
Let us look at what has happened to student fees. This is not the first time this government has put up fees. In 1996 a degree in a middle level course like economics or science cost $7,300—before Dr Kemp got his hands on it. Now it costs students $15,700. That is your legacy. (Extension of time granted) With today's changes, the HECS fees will go up by another 25 per cent. So those students doing a basic science degree who were paying $7,000 when this government came in will now have a debt of $20,000. That is what you are putting on the shoulders of these young people. And this from a minister who paid nothing for his degree—nothing! So the government has already increased fees for students by 115 per cent. Students are already overloaded with heavy debts at the same time they are about to start a family and buy a home. We are already near the top of the world scale when it comes to student contributions. We also know that Australian university graduates are already delaying starting a family and buying their homes—that is already happening without this further increase in debt. There were 90 amendments that Labor moved in the Senate. Each and every one of them was voted down by the government and the Independents. I will not test your patience by going through each and every of the 90— 
—Give us 50 of them.
—No, I won't do that. I just want to highlight a few, because people need to know where the government stand and what they voted against. Labor amendments would have stopped the 25 per cent fee hike. We would have stopped it in its tracks. We would have banned universities offering new Australian undergraduates full fee degrees that already cost $100,000. We would have created 20,000 places, but of course the government did not want to do that. We would have made sure that universities received proper indexation, but of course the government voted against that. We would have prevented the 20 per cent penalty on student loans; improved student financial assistance; scrapped the seven-year learning limit; and scrapped all the ideological industrial relations conditions. But, no, the government did not want to do that. And, most importantly, in some ways, when it comes to our democracy we would have safeguarded universities from ministerial interference in what they teach students. These amendments were critical to making this flawed, shoddy and, most of all, unfair bill acceptable. But the government and the Independents could not even sustain an argument. Senator Vanstone was not actually capable of answering any of our amendments or dealing with the question of whether or not they should be addressed.
I want to touch on a couple of final issues which have been very, very important in this debate. Time and again the minister has been told that the No. 1 priority for our universities is the lack of indexation of grants. Time and again the minister has been told that by the Australian vice-chancellors in particular. Time and again he ignored this concern and continued to push ahead with his plan to make students pay more. Without proper indexation of university grants, it will be the case that universities will have to put up their fees by the full 25 per cent—just to tread water. The minister likes to talk about reform and flexibility. But forcing all universities to put up fees to pay for this bill is not reform. Anyone can put up a price, and that is what this bill is really all about. I must say I am extremely disappointed in the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee not pressing the government to make sure that this package included full indexation. It was at the top of their list of concerns, but did they press the government to deliver this? No, they did not, otherwise we would have seen it in this bill.
By contrast, Labor's policy does contain a fully funded commitment to indexation: $312 million to properly index university funding. You cannot tell me this government does not have $312 million to make sure that universities are properly funded and students do not have to pay any more. (Extension of time granted) The government's university changes are also still a bureaucratic nightmare. They give this minister—and all future ministers until this legislation is changed—unprecedented power over what universities can teach and students can learn. That is an extraordinary attack on one of the institutions at the heart of our democracy. Any suggestion that the amendments made in the Senate as part of the deal—part of what I have to say was a backroom deal between the government and the Independents—are to reduce the minister's intrusive powers over universities is completely wrong.
I will give you an example of why it is wrong. It is wrong because it is with these powers that this minister—and we all heard him say this in question time, so we know it is true—has threatened to make the University of Melbourne cover the $5 million funding cut. This is true, isn't it, Minister? The minister intends to make the University of Melbourne fund the cut that is facing the Victorian College of the Arts. That is what this bill is all about. The minister has the power to do it. That is why the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne has likened this minister's proposals to those of `authoritarian regimes'. That is what this legislation is about. He went on to warn that giving that sort of power to a minister in perpetuity is a real disaster. That is what the University of Melbourne Vice-Chancellor had to say, and he used to be one of the minister's chief supporters—not anymore. The amendments passed in the Senate to address these concerns do not reduce ministerial control. They in fact simply change the mechanism through which he can exercise it. The minister will still have the power to micromanage the types of courses offered and the numbers of students enrolled in them. I can say this to the parliament and the universities: Labor will not dictate to universities what they teach or how they employ their staff. 
At the eleventh hour last night we had the final attempt at a cave-in by the Independents. I understand the minister actually had to go, cap in hand, to a very late in the night emergency cabinet meeting to finalise his deal with the Independent senators over industrial relations. I gather there are a few in the cabinet who did not want this to happen. They have come up with a quick fix in the final hours of this two-year process that once again does not remove industrial relations conditions from all university funding.
—Good!
—We hear `good' from the other side. They are clearly still committed to the government's ideological conditions. We will make sure all the staff at Deakin University know exactly what the member thinks. Despite the `line in the sand' claims from the Independent senators, every one of the extraordinary conditions—and they are extraordinary—that this minister and, of course, the previous minister for industrial relations want are going to remain. They are not gone; they have just been moved from one funding pool to another. They are still there; this government still wants to put its fingers into the way in which universities manage their industrial relations.
This of course has always been a threshold issue for us. The government should not be imposing industrial conditions on educational funding. This money is supposed to be for improving the quality of education in our universities and not coming through blackmailing the universities to implement this government's industrial relations conditions. Funding for universities is far too important to be left to the ideological obsessions which we know the current minister for health certainly believes in. There are of course also a number of universities which continue to be worse off as a result of this package. I cannot actually see the member for Lindsay here at the moment, but we know what her advocacy has meant for the University of Western Sydney.
—Advocacy?
—It is advocacy. I know you will be surprised, but she has in fact advocated that they not be given additional funding. (Extension of time granted) Universities like the University of Western Sydney and Victoria University in Melbourne serve some of our most disadvantaged communities. They will be millions of dollars worse off as a result of this package. The Victorian College of the Arts will be devastated by a funding cut of more than 30 per cent. The Minister for Education, Science and Training shakes his head, but of course the only way in which they are not going to lose money is by him forcing the University of Melbourne to pay up, and not because he is actually giving the Victorian College of the Arts any more money. 
There is nothing in the amendments that we are currently debating which will make sure that the University of Western Sydney, Victoria University or the Victorian College of the Arts have their positions improved. The member for Lindsay, the member for Macquarie and the member for Parramatta, who is sitting over there—and we know he has not done anything; in fact, he says that his constituents are just a bunch of whingers if they talk about Medicare or if they complain that the University of Western Sydney does not have the funding that it needs—have not made sure that the University of Western Sydney is properly funded. They have done nothing to protect the university that provides such outstanding services for the people of Western Sydney. 
I say to the Australian people today: this provides us all with a very real choice at the next election. The Howard government will have increased—because we know this bill is going to go through—university fees first by 115 per cent and now, today, by another 25 per cent. That is the first thing—it is a substantial difference between the Labor Party's policy and that of this government. Labor will not agree to any further increases in university fees. There is another major difference that the public have in front of them. This government says that you can jump the queue and buy your way into university if you have the money. Labor will abolish all full fee paying places, because we do not think it is fair. We think you should get into university based on your marks, not on how much money you or your parents have in the bank. Under Labor there will be no increase in fees. There will be no $100,000 degrees. I say to the Australian people: we will fight every way we can to make sure this does not happen.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,59,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-12-04,"—There is no doubt that this is indeed a sad day in higher education in Australia. The students in Australia have been sold out—sold out by the government, sold out by the four Independent senators and sold out by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who claim to represent the universities. But in fact they do not represent the students; they do not represent their families; they do not represent the university staff and other groups in the sector.
The Greens cannot support the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and amendments agreed to by the government and the Independent senators at approximately 1.15 p.m. today in the other place with a vote of 31 to 29. This bill was a turkey when it was first presented, and the turkey is still a turkey, no matter how much you dress it up or sex it up. Just as the US President was prepared to pose in front of a plastic turkey during his recent visit to the troops in Iraq, now we have the Minister for Education, Science and Training prepared to present us with a slightly more palatable, though still off, turkey of a bill.
Anyone who has listened to some of the impassioned speeches in the other place in the last few days by Greens, Democrats and opposition senators will know the import of this bill and why it is such a sad day for Australian students and their families. The government, and especially the minister, is in a state of denial. The minister comes into this place regularly talking all manner of figures but basically missing the target. The minister and the government are in a state of denial over the D-word—that is, debt. We are talking here about student debt. That goes to the core of the issue here. The government is really silent about debt. I do not think the minister used that word once during his speech a minute ago. 
I heard the minister on the radio this morning talking about how any eligible Australian student can walk into any Australian university and not have to pay a cent in up-front fees. That is true; I did it back in 1975, and the minister did it as well. But the minister did not tell the Australian people this morning that those students—here and now—have to pay up front or go into debt. They have to pay more and more, and they have to pay some of the highest university fees in the world. The minister did not tell those listening to the ABC this morning that students and their families would be lumbered with debts ranging from $30,000 to over $100,000. He did not say that this debt burden is forcing more and more of them to drop out of university. He did not talk about the failure of the government to adequately support students via any substantial income support schemes. He did not say that the policies of this government are forcing more and more students, and their families, to decide that they just cannot afford to go to university. Why can't they? Because they are going to be lumbered with a debt, and at the end of the day having a university degree is no real guarantee of a well-paid job. Many Australians, especially if they come from the poorer sections of the community, do not like debt. It is clear that, as a result of the government's mistreatment of the university sector since it came to office in 1996, more and more young women, for example, are being forced to make a choice between university, a career and paying off a HECS debt, and opting out and having a family.
—What rubbish!
—It's not rubbish at all.
—Order! The member for Moncrieff! The member for Cunningham will address his remarks through the chair.
—It is no longer easy to do both, and this is a backward step. The minister fails to realise that university is not some sort of apprenticeship scheme; there are no guarantees here. People take a risk in deciding to go to university, in giving up paid employment for three or four or more years. Their friends and mates are off working and buying homes and having families, while they sit in lonely rooms and libraries studying and researching. So, despite what the minister would have us believe, there is no guaranteed job at the end of the day for our university graduates and no guaranteed six-figure income. Students know this and, as a result, this increasing debt burden is scaring them off. I was informed just this morning of a young girl from my electorate who has decided not to go to university because of this debt burden. Her sister was amazed and disheartened to hear that the Independent senators had caved in overnight.
I went to university in 1975, when it was free, thanks to Gough Whitlam and his government. It can be free again today, and it should be free. I understand the Tories in the UK are advocating the abolition of university fees—good on them.

—Order!

—Order! The member for Cowan! The member for Cunningham has the call and the protection of the chair.
—A university education is a right, not a privilege, and we should be supporting students, not putting barriers in their way. I think we should forget about user pays in this instance, because it is not fair when we talk about it in the context of higher education. Debt does deter students from going to university, and the government and the minister refuse to admit this. The minister cannot fail to be aware of the debt burden facing Australian students. He merely has to talk to them, to go out and speak to them. If he truly listened to the students and their families, he would not be allowing the universities to increase fees by up to 25 per cent, he would not be putting a seven-year cap on their so-called study entitlement and he would not be starving the universities of real funds for infrastructure, staffing and course delivery. (Extension of time granted) The minister would not be forcing the universities down the privatisation path, down the path to elitism, and the government would be doing all it could to support equitable access to tertiary education in this country. This package is really about reducing the burden of debt on the government, not on students. It is about transferring more of the costs onto students and their families. It is also about further privatisation of the higher education sector. We cannot agree to that: the money should be going into the public sector, not being pocketed as the profits of private companies. 
This is a very important issue. As Senator Stott Despoja pointed out in the other place, the industrial relations linkage is still there. There is a $50 million bribe that the government has put up to further its attacks on unions. In summary, we have increases in HECS, 39 universities are worse off, equity issues have been abandoned, the independence of our universities is further compromised, there is no improvement in student support and there are more up-front full-cost fees. In the interests of present and future generations of Australians, the Greens oppose this bill.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—by leave—I present a proposal, together with supporting documentation, for works in the parliamentary zone. I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone: Artwork 7 at Reconciliation Place.
This motion proposes artwork 7 at Reconciliation Place. Artwork 7 will be made of red oxide concrete. On the northern side of the artwork—that facing Lake Burley Griffin—there will be a number of irregularly shaped corten steel panels. Within each panel a grid of small holes will be drilled forming the shape of Australia. The holes will provide an opportunity for people to leave messages that record their experience of the separation of children from their families. Randomly etched across the steel panels will be quotations from children who have been separated from their families and those who have cared for them. Behind the steel panels there will be a movement activated speaker which will emit the song Took the Children Away. 
The southern side of the artwork features a tall, textured concrete cliff face, at the base of which will be a small water source that spills water each end and over the southern face of the artwork. The water will collect in a pool at the base of the artwork and flow across a small channel into the adjacent grassed area, where it will collect in a small pool adjacent to a contemplative bench. At the eastern end of the artwork there will be an interpretative plaque, providing a brief description of the history of the separation of children from their families. At the western end there will be a reproduction of a letter in which an Indigenous man requests that his children not be removed.
The artwork will be approximately 4.5 metres long and 2.8 metres high. The artwork has been designed to meet the Australian standard for visual access, AS1428.1, and its height will be consistent with the existing constant horizon visual line along Reconciliation Place. The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal, pursuant to subsection 12(1)(b) of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories was advised of the proposal on 5 December 2003. It is proposed that the works commence in early 2004 to be completed by 9 May 2004 for NAIDOC week.

The original proposition was, in my view, clearly unacceptable. The process of consultation has been substantially better on this occasion. The National Sorry Day Committee have confirmed to me their indication to the government that they approve of the wording as proposed on this occasion. Given their approval and given that it is a matter for the stolen generation, it is not appropriate for me to second-guess, but I think in any event they are correct. It is appropriate that we are giving this recognition. It is a small part of the recognition that needs to be given to issues to do with the stolen generation, but it is a welcome move in the right direction and I support it.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I move:
That the amendment be agreed to. 
This is a relatively minor amendment compared to the ground shaking education measure which had passage today. It revolves around a Productivity Commission review of the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 relating to the conduct of public inquiries into monopolistic pricing. In it the commission recommended that such inquiries be conducted in a transparent manner with input from—but not by—the regulator who, for present purposes, is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
In making the recommendation, the Productivity Commission cited the concern that there may be a perceived conflict of interest if the same agency is, `responsible for assessing the costs and benefits of price regulation, responsible for the implementation of any price regulation, but not responsible for implementing the alternatives.' The government did not accept this aspect of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. It was our view that in most cases the ACCC would be best placed to undertake public inquiries into monopolistic pricing, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, in most circumstances the expertise of the regulator may help to expedite a price inquiry and, secondly, the regulator may also have access to data about and an understanding of the relevant industry that cannot be matched by another existing or ad hoc inquiry body.
However, the government recognises the Productivity Commission's concern that there may be circumstances in which the conduct of a price inquiry by the body with regulatory responsibility may give rise to a real or perceived conflict of interest. In such circumstances it is appropriate that the act provide for an alternative to the ACCC as the body to undertake the pricing inquiry. That is why the government does not accept the amendment previously moved by the opposition which would preclude anybody other than the ACCC from undertaking an inquiry. However, given that it is expected that inquiries will predominantly be undertaken by the ACCC, it is appropriate that this be recognised in the act.
Acknowledging the concerns of the Australian Democrats, the government therefore proposes to move an amendment to this bill. The amendment provides that, where the minister wishes to have a body other than the ACCC undertake an inquiry, the minister must, having confirmed that the body will undertake the inquiry, table a statement in each chamber of the parliament, firstly specifying the body that will undertake the inquiry and secondly giving the minister's reasons for requesting the external body rather than the commission to hold the inquiry. This amendment reflects the primacy of the ACCC in conducting inquiries, as no such statement to parliament will be required where the ACCC is the inquiry body. However, the amendment recognises that circumstances may arise where another body would be more appropriate than the ACCC to conduct the inquiry. In such a situation the minister should be able to select that other body to conduct the inquiry, having explained to the parliament his or her reasons for doing so. This amendment provides a sensible middle course between the Productivity Commission's view that the ACCC is never suitable to undertake pricing inquiries and the opposition's view that the ACCC will always be the most suitable body to undertake pricing inquiries. I commend the amendment to all interested parties and particularly to my colleagues in the House.

"Tollner, David, MP",CLP,2003-12-04,"—Firstly, let me put on the record that I support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. Secondly, let me put on the record that I am a member of an industry superannuation fund—or a union fund, as many people call it—and that I worked for an industry superannuation fund, namely the Australian Retirement Fund, for over nine years prior to coming to this place. For that reason I have views that may differ somewhat from those of some of my colleagues on this side of the chamber. Fifteen years ago, superannuation meant that you were a public servant or a well-paid executive, or that you were putting your savings into a retail entity with a high level of fees and charges and doubtful rates of return. The introduction of compulsory superannuation and the spawning of industry superannuation funds changed that. Industry funds introduced unionists to decision making that was once an exclusive employer or commercial preserve, investing funds in capital projects and capitalist projects, in property, in markets and in securities. 
Super funds in Australia have grown from a modest proportion of the investment market in the late 1980s to around $550 billion today. The industry funds that were virtually non-existent in the mid-eighties are currently worth about $56 billion—roughly 10 per cent of all superannuation assets in Australian accounts. These funds have over seven million members, which is about 30 per cent of all superannuation accounts. These days, the superannuation industry is rich in people whose background is about the defence of workers' rights but whose future is about maximising the return on investments for their fund members. I know some of them—they seem good people. They are in charge of funds that grow through contributions and investment returns by millions of dollars each week. In other words, the socialists have become capitalists. Early in the game, several employer groups worked furiously to persuade governments and private companies that employer superannuation fund investments would increase the power of union bosses to use the same standover tactics in investment as they once used on building sites. Perhaps there are arguments to support that theory but I do not know what they are. 
The fund that I used to work for, the Australian Retirement Fund, was and still is a great industry fund. The fees are low and the returns have been very good. Simply put, it is a market leader. However, I have heard today from members opposite that the Australian Retirement Fund and other industry funds do not want this legislation and they do not want competition. Let me tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. Most industry funds will welcome choice. This legislation will allow them to branch out into new markets, access new members, grow their economies of scale and, as a result, offer better services to their members.
I must put on the record that I have some minor concerns with this legislation being passed now. Firstly, I am concerned about the level of disclosure that funds and financial advisers currently must provide. I know that some members opposite share this concern. In January this year the Australian Consumers Association's Choice magazine ran the results of a review of the financial planning industry. The results were not good. They said: 
We've assessed advice provided by financial planners three times in eight years and found serious problems each time. The industry's ongoing failure to improve its standards is disgraceful.
However, I am aware that many financial planning associations are working feverishly to rectify these problems and restore public confidence in their members. I am aware also that currently being discussed in the other place is the Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003. It aims to achieve a new level of legislated disclosure for financial advisers. I note also that ASIC have suggested a model or a framework for the disclosure of fees. I understand that the Australian Consumers Association support that legislation. It will take time but somewhere along the line we will have an open and accountable financial planning industry. 
One thing that I find interesting is that one of the opposition's proposals is to ban commissions for financial advisers. That is a crazy step. It should be handled by the industry. Many funds that some people see will be losers—that is, public sector funds, corporate funds who cannot attract members and other industry funds—have the financial power to put pressure on the organisations that employ financial advisers and require them to be much more open in the way that they collect their fees.
The other concern that I have with this legislation is the impact it will have on business, and in particular small business. Small business at the moment complains about the level of red tape and bureaucracy involved in their non-core activities. This legislation will, I think, add to that. However, I am aware that technology is catching up. There are things called electronic clearing houses, which make it easy for employers to pay money to several funds through one outlet. However, I am sure that there will be some small businesses in Australia that do not have access to this technology, do not use computers and will still be required to send several cheques over several months to several different funds.
To sum up—and I do not intend to talk for long on this bill; I merely want to put my points across—on balance I support this bill. The possible problems with the disclosure of fees and poor financial advice are being dealt with as we speak. A lot of work is going on behind the scenes by the industry and by regulators, like ASIC, to ensure that proper disclosure mechanisms are put in place. The red tape for business involved with this bill is far outweighed by individuals' fundamental right to be able to choose a fund. As Australians, we should be encouraging choice. The other thing is that I think some of the best performers in the superannuation market are those funds to which Australians have limited access because of their current working conditions—namely, the industry superannuation funds, which I think are market leaders.
So, on balance, I have no problems at all in supporting this bill. I think it is a great step for Australia. The industry and the regulators will now have to work together to put in place some mechanisms—some checks and balances—to ensure that Australians get a fair deal, but the opportunities that those Australians will have, stemming from this legislation, are awesome.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,65,1,speech
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—It is my pleasure to sum up and to thank everyone for their contributions to the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2002. The legislation provides employees with a long overdue right to determine where their superannuation fund is invested. This is a government that believes in choice and believes in allowing people to take control of their retirement savings. The opposition parties have been denying Australians choice in superannuation for far too long. Choice of fund will benefit members through greater competition in the superannuation industry and increased community awareness of the importance of superannuation savings. Competition will have positive effects for members of superannuation funds. For example, in our experience in the telecommunications sector, lowered call costs dramatically followed the introduction of competition; whereas attempting to regulate prices had little impact at all. The government wants the benefits of competition to flow to members of superannuation funds. 
The inability of employees to choose their superannuation funds has meant that individuals have been excluded from the process of saving for retirement. It is no coincidence that there is currently $7 billion and 4.6 million accounts on the Australian Taxation Office's lost member register. The current arrangements particularly damage and disadvantage the interests of itinerant workers and those in multiple part-time jobs. It is important that everyone is involved in the decisions affecting their retirement income. Choice of fund not only empowers employees to make decisions but allows them to have a better connection with their superannuation savings. It helps us to avoid the psychology of `set and forget' that many Australians have developed towards their own retirement. Being involved in decisions about where their superannuation contributions are paid will mean that employees will start to consider the adequacy of their retirement savings sooner rather than later.
As others have observed, the bill provides for choice right at the start of a person's employment life and causes them to reflect on the level of provision they are making for the future. Too often, Australians only start thinking about whether they have made adequate provision for retirement when they reach retirement, and the tragedy is that by that stage it is too late. It is much like an aircraft carrier or an oil tanker that can be moved significantly over time but by relatively slow degrees. We do not want a situation where Australians are in effect all gathered together on the bridge or the bow of the Titanic, seeing the iceberg approaching but being unable to take corrective action at that late stage. We want them to take that corrective action early in their careers by making informed decisions about their own retirement, and that is what this bill aims to allow them to do.
A number of arguments against choice have been advanced. Seven have been put to us in the ALP motion, and I would like to address each one of them briefly. The first argument is that the bill makes no provision for clear disclosure of fees that will accumulate to fund managers. This bill should be read in conjunction with the bill which I hope and pray will pass in this chamber within the hour, the Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003. That bill provides the most comprehensive regime of disclosure for people providing advice and products in financial services that has been witnessed anywhere in the world.
I recently had in my office one of the most senior members of the Thai banking and financial community, a senior adviser to the government of Thailand, and he said frankly that he has not witnessed another regime anywhere in the world with the comprehensive quality of the national licensing regime that is about to be introduced through the Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003 and that will commence operation on 11 March 2004. That regime is a harmonised licensing disclosure and conduct program across advisers and providers of all financial products, from managed funds to insurance and superannuation. Anyone providing financial services such as financial product advice must be licensed or authorised to provide those services. Licensees must have requisite experience, training and qualifications to provide a financial service. In delivering financial services, a licensee must adhere to conduct requirements that prohibit activities such as false and misleading behaviour. 
The financial services reform also imposes comprehensive disclosure requirements on service providers such as financial advisers and superannuation funds. Disclosure under FSR occurs at different stages in the supply of financial products and services, including when a licensee provides a financial service, when an adviser then provides advice on a client's specific needs, and before selling a financial product. The criticism most frequently directed at the regime is that the disclosure requirements are too onerous. For example, the product disclosure statement provides essential details about a financial product, including information about fees and charges. So I can assure all members of the opposition—and the member for Solomon, who has just spoken—who have had concerns on this question of disclosure that there is no financial system in the world which will have the levels of transparency and disclosure that Australia's financial system will have after the passage of this bill.
There was concern from the opposition that the bill contained no regulation or banning of fees and charges. The whole point of choice is to foster a competitive superannuation industry that will maintain downward pressure on fees and charges. At the moment, because we are providing, in effect, statutory monopoly organisations dotted all over the financial services world to manage retirement income, there is simply no competitive pressure to force prices down. There is nothing to stop funds jacking up fees when members are not permitted to leave—that is, when there is no real portability. The only way to minimise fees and charges is to build a competitive and efficient superannuation sector. The answer is not the sort of ineffective, bureaucratic, red-tape solution proposed by Labor.
The opposition has proposed that there should be an exemption for small business. The bill carefully balances concerns about compliance costs with the need to provide universal coverage and benefits to all Australians. This government believes in superannuation choice for everyone. It considers choice in superannuation a basic right and will not seek to carve out large numbers of employees, as proposed by Labor. There are already financial institutions that disburse superannuation on behalf of employers to the different superannuation providers of each employee, significantly helping to reduce compliance costs. In fact, I am aware of financial institutions that provide this service free of charge, provided the employer selects a fund operated by that institution as their default fund. Small businesses, and employers more generally, will write only one cheque to the clearing house—which is exactly what they do now.
There were suggestions by the opposition that funds under this regime will cease to provide a life insurance option. This claim is also false. IFSA, a major industry group that also represents insurance companies, testified at a recent Senate hearing that choice would not jeopardise group life insurance. It was also suggested that there is no provision for a comprehensive and effective consumer education program. It is my pleasure to disabuse the opposition of this concern and to confirm that the government has allocated $14 million to a member education program. 
One of the key messages for employees will include which specific employees are affected by choice of fund. The education program will encourage employees to take an interest in what is being offered, as different options in superannuation suit different people. The education program will reassure Australians that they do not need to change funds—they are under no compulsion to do so—and that their best option may be to stay with their existing fund. In fact, research shows that a majority of employees, when offered choice, remain in their existing relationship, so concerns about a wholesale churn after passage of the bill are not well founded. Most people are happy in their current fund, and the point of the measure is to ensure that those who are not happy are not held hostage under some regulatorily sanctioned monopoly. Another key message of the education campaign, to be run by the ATO, will be that, while the task of employers is to provide information to their employees, they are not under an obligation to advise—and nor should they accept responsibility for advising—employees about which fund to accept.
This, of course, is a key point. While I am excited about the impact of the measure on introducing competitive pressure and driving down costs and fees, the great benefit of this measure, in my view, is the way in which it is going to provide an engine for financial literacy among the nine million Australians in the work force. It is going to provide them with a powerful incentive to understand the way in which saving for retirement works. It is going to cause them to think about the equities market, shares and other assets. They will be educating and informing themselves and, as a consequence, they will be much better equipped to make decisions about their own financial futures. The opposition called for a cap on fees. The enhanced disclosure under financial services reform will lead to increased transparency and comparability of fees and charges. 
It was argued that a defect of the bill was that it makes no provision for same-sex couples. In fact, same-sex couples are not covered elsewhere in the superannuation legislation. Same-sex couples will have equal access to choice, just like every other employee in Australia will. Furthermore, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has expressed to the Senate that she is concerned about actual cases of discrimination in the payment of death benefits governed by those other provisions.
The seventh and final quibble or frustration with the measure expressed by the opposition is that there is no prohibition on financial service providers offering incentives to employers to belong to particular funds. This is exactly the kind of problem that choice of funds will remedy. At the moment, there is nothing to stop an employer from signing up their employees to a high-cost, low-service super fund, and if an employer does pay employee super entitlements to high-cost, low-service fund there is nothing an employee can do short of leaving their employer.
In conclusion, the opposition will tell us on a measure like this, like on so many others, that they are not opposed to the principle of choice but opposed to the way in which it is being implemented here. In this case they will find seven reasons why, in spite of their support for us in principle, they cannot engage in the sort of bipartisan practical gesture of support that the new broom—the Leader of the Opposition—would imply. This is a good measure. It is an important reform and I urge the opposition to follow through with their commitments to bipartisanship on matters in the national interest and support this important initiative.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The government has agreed to 16 Senate amendments made to the bill. A number of these amendments form the government's responses to recommendations Nos 1 and 2 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report on the provisions of the bill tabled on 13 August this year. Ten amendments relate to amendments to the binding third party provisions in schedule 6 of the bill. Three amendments relate to changes to the child representative cost provision in schedule 7 of the bill. These amendments are also the result of further consultations with relevant stakeholders.
Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you may have observed that in this House, and even on the Notice Paper, there is a considerable degree of interest in the matters that are the subject of the remaining amendments. They have been introduced by the government to amend the binding financial agreement provisions of the Family Law Act 1975 to overcome the problems raised in the recent Family Court decision in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission v. Rich and Rich. It is case No. SY5067 of 2002.
In light of the issues raised by this case, I do intend to undertake a review of the provisions relating to binding financial agreements in the Family Law Act. The purpose of the review is to ascertain whether the original intention of the provisions is being fulfilled. But the particular problems identified in this legislation which members have been interested in are matters raised in the Rich and ASIC case. These provisions will now enable the courts to address issues raised by third parties whose interests might have been prejudiced as a result of family law financial agreements. The measures are very important and have been implemented in a timely and effective way.",REPS,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,66,1,speech

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
This bill amends two acts—the National Health Act 1953, and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1997.
Over the past few years, this government has delivered a series of reforms, such as the 30 per cent rebate, Lifetime Health Cover and no-gap schemes. These reforms have made private health insurance a more attractive and affordable option for all Australians.
This bill builds on these very successful initiatives, and will drive increased value for money in private health insurance products by allowing funds to be more efficient and responsive to members' needs. 
Specifically, the bill does three things.
Firstly, it decreases the regulatory burden surrounding health fund product design. Currently, health funds are required to seek approval from the Department of Health and Ageing for changes to rules and products. There is an overwhelming view that these arrangements are overly burdensome for both industry and government, and that they restrict competition. This bill cuts red tape for health funds by removing the existing regulatory regime, and replacing it with strategic monitoring and enforcement arrangements.
Funds will now be free to respond to members' needs, and implement changes to products without detailed assessment. However, the government will closely monitor the performance of health funds against a series of performance indicators that are designed to ensure changes are consistent with government policy objectives and maintain the principle of community rating. Where a fund fails to meet these performance indicators, or is discriminating against higher risk members, it will be required to explain its actions, and may face serious administrative sanctions.
Secondly, this bill enhances and strengthens consumer confidence in private health insurance. There is agreement from all parties that consumer protection and confidence in the private health insurance industry is essential if the industry is to survive and prosper.
The bill contains measures to ensure consumers are provided with more meaningful and transparent information about health fund products and rules. It increases the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman (PHIO) to investigate complaints and resolve disputes in a timely and efficient manner. It also establishes an annual `state of the health funds' report. This report will provide consumers with much needed information on the performance of health funds.
Thirdly, the bill improves on some minor aspects of Lifetime Health Cover legislation to sustain high levels of membership in private health insurance.
A single Lifetime Health Cover birthday will be established. This will increase the effectiveness of health fund promotional activities, and make it easier for consumers to remember to take out private hospital cover before incurring a Lifetime Health Cover loading.
Amendments contained within this bill will also ensure that Australians living overseas for periods of greater than one year and those veterans who lose entitlement to a Department of Veterans' Affairs gold card do not unfairly incur a Lifetime Health Cover penalty.
Similarly, Australians living overseas on their 31st birthday and those migrants who entered Australia after the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover will be allowed a 12-month period of grace to take out private health insurance without penalty.
I am glad to have the opportunity to acknowledge on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health the range of stakeholders including health funds, private hospitals and industry peak bodies, that have contributed to the development of a range of reforms to private health insurance, and that give rise to this bill.
With almost half of all Australians having private health insurance, there is no doubt that the private health insurance industry is operating effectively alongside the public system. The bill delivers a balanced package of reforms that will drive competition, empower consumers to make more informed decisions and encourage the industry to be more accountable for its performance. In short, the bill will help to make sure private health insurance remains affordable, and within reach of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. ",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,67,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—As indicated in the Senate debate earlier this year, Labor does support the Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 in the interests of good management of the private health insurance sector by government, fair treatment of consumers and better mechanisms for investigating and acting on any problems in the private health insurance industry. This bill amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998. On 11 September 2002 the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, announced a package of reforms designed to streamline the regulation of the private health insurance industry and provide consumers with better value for money for their private health insurance. This bill gives effect to some of those measures.
At present, registered health benefits organisations are required to submit all rule changes, no matter how insignificant, to the government for approval. This places a considerable administrative burden on the health benefits industry. Part 1 of schedule 1 of this bill amends the National Health Act and the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act by removing this rule change assessment process and replacing it with a system of monitoring and compliance. This will remove the inefficiencies associated with the existing rule change process and allow registered health benefits organisations to be more responsive to the needs of their members.
To make sure that the government can effectively monitor the performance of registered health benefits organisations, part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill also establishes a set of indicators for monitoring the performance of registered health benefits organisations. These indicators will be used to identify registered health benefits organisations that breach the National Health Act and alert the Minister for Health and Ageing to practices that may be contrary to health policy. They will be particularly important for monitoring whether registered health benefits organisations continue to fulfil their community rating obligations, which are designed to ensure that private health insurance is affordable for all Australians.
Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill will amend the National Health Act to increase consumer protection within the private health industry. In particular, increased powers to investigate and resolve disputes and complaints are given to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Part 3 of schedule 1 of this bill provides for the production of an annual `state of the health funds' style report. This report will be produced by the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. The report will contain information that is vital for assessing how organisations in the private health insurance industry are serving their members. It is obviously hoped that this information will be used by consumers to make better choices.
As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has indicated, part 4 of schedule 1 of this bill amends the National Health Act to make a number of minor changes to the lifetime health cover regulations. As the parliamentary secretary has indicated, there is the establishment of a notional annual birth date of 1 July for the purposes of administering the Lifetime Health Cover system. People between the ages of 30 and 65 who join a health fund before the next notional birth date will not incur a Lifetime Health Cover loading. It is a bit like the system for racehorses: everybody turns a year older on the same day, according to the lifetime health benefits system. They should really have picked the same day as racehorses, then we could all have had joint birthdays, but presumably there is some convenience in it being the start of the financial year on 1 July. 
The changes to the Lifetime Health Cover regulations also ensure that there is recognition of coverage provided by the Veterans' Affairs gold card arrangements. That period of coverage by gold card would count towards calculation of the Lifetime Health Cover loading. There are some new arrangements in relation to new migrants who come to this country over the age of 30. They now have 12 months to make their private health insurance arrangements without being subject to a Lifetime Health Cover loading.
The changes ensure that every Australian citizen who has been overseas on their notional 31st birthday gets a similar 12-month period of grace to rearrange their affairs when they return to Australia. They ensure that Australians who have hospital cover and go overseas for periods in excess of 12 months will not have that time overseas counted towards any potential Lifetime Health Cover loading, because obviously it is inappropriate to require people to carry Australian based private health insurance for a year in which they will be overseas for the complete duration.
As I have indicated, Labor support this bill and are prepared to allow its passage through the parliament without any opposition from us. However, I want to take this opportunity to indicate that there are a number of unaddressed issues with private health insurance that might be beyond the ambit of the bill before us but need to be noted whilst this House is giving consideration to regulation of the private health insurance industry and to matters like Lifetime Health Cover. If we go back to the election which originally delivered the Howard government to office in Australia—the 1996 election—it is probably important to recall that during that election the Prime Minister said:
What I can give is an absolute guarantee that any change—
in private health insurance premiums—
in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified.
Whilst it would not be like me normally to end a contribution using the words of the Prime Minister, I understand it might suit the convenience of the House if I seek leave to continue my remarks on another occasion.

That the amendments be agreed to.
This is a great moment for financial services in Australia. The government, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the minor parties, the opposition and industry have been working in a largely collaborative way to ensure that the transition to the Financial Services Reform Act is as smooth as possible and the benefits of the regime are realised. The government and ASIC have been working very closely with industry members to clarify any uncertainty about the operation of the FSR Act that has arisen during this transition. We believe that the initia-
tives in this Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003, along with other steps taken to date, will provide greater comfort and certainty for industry participants to transition into the FSR regime by the licensing date of 11 March 2004.
I want to take this opportunity to encourage all of those yet to transition to lodge their applications as soon as possible, as ASIC have stated that applications received after 10 December cannot be guaranteed. I would like to reinforce that the government will not be extending the transition deadline. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer who is now Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in the other place, as the principal architect of this excellent initiative lifting the quality of governance in financial services and the transparency and disclosure of products and services to Australian consumers.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I want to speak today about the strong sense of pride that is steadily building around the working class suburb of Broadmeadows—or `Broady', as it is affectionately known locally—a suburb at the centre of the city of Hume in my electorate of Calwell. You can compare Broadmeadows to suburbs such as Bankstown in Sydney or Inala in Brisbane. Like these suburbs, it has evolved over time and has changed from a strong Anglo-Celtic community to one that now represents a microcosm of multicultural Australia. Broadmeadows has a history of struggle, honourable labour and now, more importantly, a strong sense of community pride. It has been a gateway for new Australians and has welcomed and settled over the years Greeks, Italians, Maltese, British and, more recently, Vietnamese, Turkish, Lebanese and Iraqis. Some 40 per cent of Broadmeadows residents speak a language other than English at home, with over 130 different languages represented in the area.
The fierce pride which locals hold for Broady was evident during a recent controversy instigated by some who suggested it was time to change the name of Broadmeadows in order to alter what they believed was a negative preconceived image. Adding to the outrage felt by the locals is an advertising campaign currently run by Tattersalls which seeks to trade on those preconceived images in order to sell its lottery products. People—in this case, Tattersalls—who run expensive campaigns that trade on old stereotypes for their self-interest are doing a great disservice to the pride felt by the people living in the Broadmeadows community.
The community of Broadmeadows has evolved over the years. Although it has retained much of its traditional demographic, it now boasts an exciting and dynamic nature. Broadmeadows is known as a place that takes care of its own. The community works closely together, collectively meeting life's challenges. Whether it is the corporate sector or the volunteer networks, all work hand in hand to build a better community. Broadmeadows has had its difficulties. It has also had its successes and success stories. As Age reporter Michelle Griffin noted recently in an article entitled `A history of social stigma and success stories', Broadmeadows still has poverty and inequity but the community deals with it together as friends and neighbours.
That is something that we are all very proud of. People born and bred in Broady have never felt anything but pride in coming from Broadmeadows. From Eddie and Frank McGuire, John Ilhan of Crazy John's mobiles fame, champion veteran power lifter and former Victorian Senior of the Year Sonja Rutherford, ABC broadcaster Francis Leach and former Age editor Bruce Guthrie to Judge Irene Lawson of the Victorian County Court and Australian Rules footy icon Bruce Doull, Broady has and will continue to have its share of success stories, whether they be lawyers, doctors or entrepreneurs. But it will always treasure the generations of honourable working people who have built successful families and futures for their children.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Calwell Electorate: Broadmeadows</title>,Statements by Members,69,1,speech

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003 and the National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003. I will commence my contribution with some comments on the National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003. As the minister indicated in his second reading speech, the purpose of the first bill is to correct the rate of National Residue Survey levy applicable on certain exports of lambs. The amendments to the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 validate the levy already collected at an agreed rate of 8c per head first set in June 1998 in respect of lamb exports with a value of more than $75 under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Amendment Regulations 1998. It is surprising, to say the least, that this drafting error has been in place for some years without correction—in fact, since 1 July 2000. I would appreciate an explanation from the minister as to why this problem has remained uncorrected for so long. I note that the Sheep Meat Council of Australia and its member organisations are committed to an NRS transaction levy rate of 8c per head for lamb exports with a value of more than $75. I note that the Sheep Meat Council of Australia has formally requested that this drafting fault be corrected. I would also like to know when the request was made. The levy recovers the cost of the lamb industry's residue monitoring program, which is required for market access. Labor supports the bill.
The second bill is the National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003. The purpose of this bill is to amend the National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Act 1998 so as to validate the levy already collected in respect of lambs with a sale price of more than $75 per head. The bill is complementary to the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003, and once again Labor is happy to support the bill.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY CUSTOMS LEVY RATE CORRECTION (LAMB EXPORTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,71,1,speech
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—in reply—As the opposition spokesman has said, the National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003 and the National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003 are relatively non-controversial. The legislation corrects an error that has occurred since July 2000 when a levy of 4.7c per head was applied through a drafting fault in the regulations rather than the intended rate of 8c per head. The peak industry body, the Sheep Meat Council of Australia, and its member organisations are committed to an NRS transaction levy of 8c per head in respect of lambs with a sale price of more than $75 or lamb exports with a value of more than $75. The Sheep Meat Council has formally requested that this drafting fault be amended and that there be validation of the levy already collected at the agreed rate of 8c set in June 1998. The levy recovers the cost of the lamb industry's residue monitoring program, which is required for market access. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003 proposes an amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and affects only the maximum rate of levy that may be applied to the research and development component of the wine grapes levy. The maximum rate currently is $3 per tonne of wine grapes and the present operative rate set under the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulation 1999 is also $3 per tonne. This amendment will allow future changes to the operative rate to occur within the proposed $10 maximum rate. Any attempt to increase the actual levy must meet the 12 levy principles introduced by the government in January 1997.
One of the principles relates to the need for demonstrated support from the industry—in this case, the wine industry—for any change to the levy rate. That will require proper consultation with the industry and evidence of support for any increase. Labor will ensure that all 12 tests are met before any levy is endorsed by the parliament, and we will be ensuring that we widely consult with the industry. The Australian wine industry first sought the imposition of a levy in 1979 to assist research and development through the Grape and Wine Research Development Corporation. Since then, the operative rate of the levy has been increased to $3 per tonne, with the last levy increase occurring in February 1999.
This industry has expanded enormously in recent years, with exports now valued at around $2.4 billion. Some of my colleagues from South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and perhaps Queensland may disagree, but the Hunter is Australia's premier wine region. In their own right, winemakers in the Hunter make an outstanding contribution to the industry, the local economy and the national economy and play an increasingly important role in Australia's tourism sector, which, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you know I have a deep interest in. 
As the minister said in his second reading speech, the Australian industry is globally recognised as a technological leader. Australian growers and winemakers have always been open to new ideas and keen to adopt new technology. That is clearly the key to our success in the international marketplace. Support for this amendment from the Winemakers Federation of Australia confirms the industry's commitment to research and development as a platform for the future. The Winemakers Federation is the declared winemakers organisation for the purposes of the legislation and represents some 95 per cent of wine production in Australia. As with other rural R&D arrangements, the government matches the expenditure of these levy funds on eligible R&D projects up to 0.5 per cent of the determined gross value of production of the industry concerned. The amendment will provide the industry with the capacity to seek an increase in the operative rate of future vintages from 1 July 2004. On that basis, the opposition supports the bill and the changes wholeheartedly.
I will just go for one moment to the amendment's impact on my own local region. The Hunter is emerging as an export engine room of the Australian economy. This has had enormous implications for the region's economy. My own home town of Cessnock was founded on coalmining and has, therefore, experienced a massive economic adjustment over the last decade or more, with coalmining moving further up the valley. Only one coalmine now remains in Cessnock. Also, the textile and clothing industry has effectively moved on, and there have been reductions in other areas such as aluminium production. So wine tourism has been my local home town's great saviour. More people now work in wine related tourism than in the coal industry, which is a significant change indeed. As small as this amendment might seem, it is important for the industry in its quest to further strengthen its position in a competitive global market.
On that basis, I want to make one quick reference to a little bit of a disagreement my local winemakers are having with the Geographical Indications Committee—a body under the auspices of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. They are seeking to have some subregions identified for marketing purposes in international markets. This is always a difficult debate within the industry, and one we have dealt with since the French in particular decided, under the WTO arrangements, to push their right to claim the names of certain wine regions. We accept that, but we must go forward collectively to ensure we have the balance right. In my own area, for example, winemakers are still very keen to export under the Rothbury subregion label, something they have been doing for some time. It is a label that people in our overseas market identify with. It is very important that the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation listen to my local people and what they are saying about these issues. This is no half-smart trick to secure some regional advantage over other winemakers in the nation; this is an issue which they see as being very important in their ongoing efforts to grow their market share in the international marketplace.
So I appeal to the Geographical Indications Committee to have another look at what the Hunter Valley's winemakers are putting forward as a sensible means of protecting the integrity of the branding of our Australian wines but, at the same time, ensuring that the Hunter winemakers continue to make inroads in those international markets. Once again, Labor supports the amendments. ",REPS,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT (WINE GRAPES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,73,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—In rising to speak on the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003 I want to do three things. Firstly, I want to pay tribute to my local grape growers and winemakers, who have had the foresight to create—and I respectfully disagree here with the member for Hunter—perhaps the premium wine growing area within Australia. Secondly, I want to address the issue of the wine equalisation tax and, thirdly, I would like to address the provisions within the bill and specifically make a pitch for an adequate share of research and development grants which will flow from the amendment to small winemakers and boutique wineries.
The growth of winemakers and grape growers within the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port region, which comprise my electorate of Flinders, is a great story. It is a story of pioneers and people who have taken on those who have said it could not be done—people such as Nat and Rosalie White, Ballieu Myer, Brian Stonier, Sir Peter Derham, Andrew and Terryn Hickinbotham, Gary Crittenden and a host of others such as Lindsay McCall and many other people with great courage, foresight and determination and incredible winemaking skills. Together, over 120 wine grape growers and over 50 winemakers have created an industry on the peninsula which has tremendous impact in terms of the quality and branding of our area and directly in terms of the agricultural success and income for the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port regions. Theirs is a story to be proud of; it is a story that they should be absolutely proud of, because this industry did not exist on the Mornington Peninsula 30 years ago. The pioneers and those who have come along as the industry has progressed, who have invested their time, money and capital and, above all else, their energy, deserve success and congratulations.
Within that context, one of the issues which the Mornington Peninsula Vignerons Association has raised with me, about which I am passionate and which I have raised at all levels of government, is the notion that the wine equalisation tax might perhaps be adjusted in some small way to take into account the needs and concerns of small winemakers throughout Australia and, in particular, within my electorate of Flinders. This tax, which was established in 1999 as part of the new taxation provisions, does have an impact on small wineries. In particular, the National Small Wineries Association has argued that a WET can have detrimental effects on some small wineries as it is based on the sales price, not volume. In that context, I have made representations to the Treasurer and to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, and to the Assistant Treasurer in person only this week, in relation to the fact that what we are looking for is an exemption on the first 600,000 litres of domestic sales under the WET. That is a position I have put publicly and privately, and it is one which I will maintain and work towards.
—And supported by the member for Pearce.
—And supported by the member for Franklin.
—And Maranoa.
—And I am happy to say it is supported by the members for Pearce, Maranoa and Franklin. We have bipartisan support—that is the value of the Main Committee. I now want to move on to the third part of my presentation. I want to talk about the provisions of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003. This levy for research and development was introduced in 1979 to help the Australian wine industry. Since that time, the Australian wine industry has undergone a significant transformation. Traditionally, the industry had been focused on the domestic market. Since 1979, there has been significant growth and expansion in the export market. Australia now ranks as the fifth largest exporting country in the world in relation to wines and, within the panoply of Australian exports, wine is playing an increasingly significant role. Research and development has been part of that growth and in particular there is more that can be done. 
Looking at the background to this bill, we see that the government is proposing an amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 in response to the recommendations of the Winemakers Federation of Association. So it is the winemakers who are driving this change. Effectively, the amendment will increase the levy on grape production so as to allow for a larger pool of funds to be available for research and development. The pitch that I want to make to this House and to all of those involved in administering the research and development plans approved by the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation is simple: there needs to be a balance between the interests of the larger growers and the smaller growers, or the boutique winemakers, so as to ensure that an adequate proportion of funds are dedicated to the smaller growers—those with the high-value product which in particular are leading our capacity to export. Their work, their brands and their names open the markets for Australia overseas.
Unashamedly, not just for the Mornington Peninsula but for small winemakers throughout Australia, I make the representation to the parliament that an adequate proportion of research and development should be focused on the high-value products because they crack open the door and open the market for all Australian products. Producers such as Stoniers, Red Hill Estate, Dromana Estate or Paringa Estate, or any such vignerons, have a key role in developing and branding the Australian industry. In that context, what this bill will do is threefold; firstly, it will increase the technical ability to respond to world consumer preferences and deliver products that are price and quality competitive; secondly, it will remove some of the barriers to viticulture research and allow for monitoring the impact of viticulture on the environment; and, thirdly, above all else, it will enhance our reputation for delivering on flavour and value across the range of all price categories.
I particularly want to ensure that there is adequate provision in the research and development for some of the more complex varietals grown in areas such as the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port, where they have small wineries which make premium wines, so that these products can be enhanced. In that context, I am delighted to support the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003, but I emphasise my position both on the wine equalisation tax for small vignerons and winemakers and on the need to ensure that there is an adequate distribution of research and development funds, again, for the small and boutique wineries.",REPS,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT (WINE GRAPES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,73,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—I rise in the Main Committee today to talk about the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003. The proposed change to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act dealing with wine grapes relates to the maximum rate of levy that may be applied to the research and development component of the wine industry grapes levy. The current maximum rate is $3 per tonne of wine grapes, and this amendment will allow for possible future increases in this operative rate to occur within the proposed $10 maximum rate. As outlined by the minister in his second reading speech, the Australian wine industry first sought to impose a levy in 1979, with the funds going towards research and development. That levy is now set at $3 per tonne. 
The federal electorate of Maranoa is a very important emerging wine growing industry in Australia. My interest goes way back in history because it was my great-grandfather who first travelled in a bullock wagon carrying vines from the Hunter Valley region of Australia to my home town of Roma, where he first settled in 1863. In fact, I well recall my early holidays working in the cellars packing grapes; I might have been eating more than packing. So I have a very long association, through my family, dating back to 1863 in my region. Whilst mine is a very diverse agricultural electorate and I am very proud of the strengths of our wine industry and also of the producing areas within the electorate, the places that would stand to benefit from the boost in research, which is what this bill is about, and to develop under the maximum allowable rate of $10 per tonne are in the Stanthorpe region—the Granite Belt: Dalby, St George and Roma. There are also a number of table grape growing communities in Maranoa, including Emerald, Cunnamulla and St George. St George aside, they have the potential over time, with good research in the wine industry, to develop and diversify their products, producing not only table grapes but also wine grapes and moving into the related industry. St George is already growing wine grapes as well as table grapes.
The wine industry are always looking to strengthen their exports, and I believe this bill will provide for the development of new research and technology. We in this House are all proud of the way the wine industry have grown their exports and the way they are going about developing new markets and also enabling themselves to take on what were considered to be some of the premium wine growing areas of the world. I think our wine growers have demonstrated that they can match it with the best in the world. Their reputation now, which is of course supported by the strength of our growing exports from Australia, is vindication of the wine industry's strength and its place in our national economy.
Parts of my electorate are already seeking to expand their knowledge, their know-how, of wine and wine tourism. For instance, Stanthorpe State High School, which is in the Granite Belt, in conjunction with the Queensland Wine Tourism Training Centre Steering Committee, currently has a funding application before the federal government and the Australian National Training Authority for assistance towards a college of wine tourism to be based in Stanthorpe. The federal government has already given Stanthorpe high school money for a science laboratory, which I opened last year. 
What impresses me about taking these facilities to high school campuses is that it introduces the high school students, whilst they are still studying, to an industry that is in their district. In other words, it links them to job opportunities and potential careers in their own community. So often we have talked in this place—and I know that in my own electorate we often talk about this—about the greatest export from our rural areas being our young people. This is a great initiative of the Queensland Wine Tourism Training Centre Steering Centre. I am certainly supporting it, and I look forward to a positive result on the funding application.
The study that Stanthorpe State High School has done, which has been developed within the wine and tourism industry, demonstrates that wine is associated with tourism, and tourism and hospitality are job creators for all our electorates. Of course, as I outlined, if the application before the federal government at the moment to establish the training centre in Stanthorpe is successful, that too will lead to a focus for the Queensland wine industry for training in winemaking and tourism, because the two are very much linked. The Stanthorpe State High School is undertaking the lead agency role in the establishment of this college of wine and tourism. The school has a very well-established, productive relationship with the wine industry and is regarded as a leader in the provision of vocational education in Queensland. For instance, Stanthorpe State High School today has some 25 students who have been oriented to employment in the wine industry, including 10 school based trainees, which reinforces the earlier comments I made. The school currently supports 36 school based trainees, and it is now anticipated that with the construction of a college of wine and tourism there will be a significant increase in student numbers both from the Granite Belt as well as from northern New South Wales and the south Burnett regions of Queensland. 
I know that our time is limited this morning but I would like to support the member for Flinders. We heard the member for Franklin refer to the WET tax. I certainly support the exemption for our small wine producers. Our small wine producers are a vital part of regional development. They are a vital part of creating jobs in their regions. I believe that we have to look again at the WET tax, because I know that small wineries do struggle to meet this commitment. I certainly hope that the minister will be able to shed some further light on whether we are making progress in this regard. The wine industry and small wine producers are looking for some relief. The measure certainly has my support, as was outlined by the member for Flinders in his earlier presentation.",REPS,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT (WINE GRAPES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,73,1,speech
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2003-12-04,"—in reply—I thank honourable members who contributed to this debate for their support for the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003. All of them come from wine producing areas, as do I. Therefore, we have a particularly keen interest in this legislation. As a very progressive industry, the wine industry has always been conscious of the importance of research and development to make sure that it maintains its cutting edge. In fact, tomorrow night I will have the privilege of presenting the Wine of the Year Award in Adelaide, which again will underpin the excellence of the Australian wine industry and its capacity to compete effectively around the world. Indeed, in spite of difficult trading barriers, the wine industry has done exceptionally well in that regard. But it is a fact that there is a large number of comparatively small wineries in Australia that compete for just three or four per cent of the market. In that regard they face particular economic difficulties. I have spoken about those difficulties in the past. The government has responded through the wine skills program to help provide assistance to small winemakers in developing business plans and understanding more about the business that they are in. 
Many people have entered the wine industry because of its glamour and because of the perception that it is an industry in which profitability is almost assured. There is no such thing as a business in which profitability is assured. Even in an industry that has been as successful as the wine industry, if you want to succeed you have to have some plans for your business and an understanding of how you are going to sell your product. It is just not good enough to have a passion for producing good wine—though that is often the motivating influence among people entering the profession—you also need to have some idea about where that wine is going to be sold and how it is going to be placed on the market. It has been in marketing and in providing suitable outlets for the production from small wineries, particularly those with less than 1,000 tonnes of production, where there have been particular difficulties. The wine skills program is a very successful response to those difficulties. We have also had a major review of the issues associated with small wineries to try to better position them for the future so that they can also be partners in the great success that this industry has been over recent times. 
I know the industry talks a lot about the so-called wine equalisation tax—the WET tax—and I, as well as other members who have spoken, have been subjected to the view expressed by small winemakers that they should receive further concessions. It is important to note that small winemakers who make sales through the cellar door already receive significant concessions from the federal government and there is also a range of concessions provided by the states. I think there would be merit in simplifying those concessions but that would require agreement from the states, and that does not seem to be forthcoming at the present time. The industry does receive concessional taxation, when wine is compared with other alcoholic beverages, but I am aware that the industry would always like to receive further concessions. That is essentially a matter for the Treasurer in dealing with tax policy, and I know that the industry has been active in lobbying the Treasurer in that regard. 
Of course, this particular bill is not about the WET tax. It is about the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act and increasing the maximum allowable rate of the research and development component of the wine grapes levy. The proposed higher maximum allowable rate will take effect from 1 July 2004, which is the identified levy year for this particular levy and is therefore the most appropriate date from which to commence the new maximum rate. This amendment to the maximum rate will have no direct financial impact on the Australian government or, for that matter, on producers themselves. Any future increase to the operative rate is actioned through a regulatory process that will need to meet Australian government requirements, including adhering to the levy principles. Of course, any future change through this process comes under the appropriate scrutiny of the parliament. This amendment has the full support of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, which is the peak winemaking body representing the Australian wine industry. I thank honourable members who have indicated their support for this legislation.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I made a few remarks on this report earlier, and I wish to continue from where I left off. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I must say I am most pleased to see you in the chair, because I know of your deep interest in these matters as a distinguished member of the panel. I will refer back a little in time and talk about the conferencing we were having with the Manager of Opposition Business, the whips and the Speaker. If we want to get reform in this parliament we really do need to have a commitment from the government. If we do not have that commitment from the government, which obviously has a majority in the House, we will not get reform. I am not reflecting on the honourable member for Wentworth, because I acknowledge his fine contribution to the Procedure Committee as someone who has just come into this parliament. It has been very valuable. But we have to involve the key players.  
It is for this reason that the Australian Labor Party have adopted as policy that we should change the name of the Procedure Committee to the Procedure and Modernisation of Parliament Committee and have as members of that committee the Speaker, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business. With such a committee bringing down reports, I think you would see that a government would be, in the main, totally committed to it. Notwithstanding the good work of the Procedure Committee over the years, I think too many reports have languished and gathered dust in the bowels of the parliament.
I congratulate the chair of the committee, because I understand that at her party room meeting she spoke to coalition members about the report. You would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that there was a tad of excitement at our party meeting on Tuesday. I have to say, as much as it pains me, that arrangements for second reading speeches were not very high on the agenda.
—I seek to ask a question under standing order 84A.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—The member for Wentworth would like to ask a question. Is the honourable member willing to take the question?
—I will take the question.
—Is the member seriously suggesting to this chamber that questions of procedure of this important parliament are even less important than the issues that were referred to at the meeting he just mentioned?
—I must reply truthfully to the honourable member for Wentworth and say that, as much as I get very entangled in the procedures of this place and in wanting to improve them, it is a passion not always shared by my colleagues. I regret to say I must answer in the negative. I thank him for his question.
I did not have the same opportunity as the chair of the committee, but I think it is the case that members of parliament should not be concerned about these proposals. There is this opting out procedure. As I said before, I am not in favour of it continuing indefinitely, but I think it has been a good transitional arrangement. Clearly, newer members of parliament coming in after the next parliament will want to use this chamber much more than the House so that they become familiar with interventions. If members can handle interventions, they are certainly going to be able to handle a question at the end of a second reading speech.
I commend these proposals. I think it is fair to indicate that the former Manager of Opposition Business, now the Leader of the Opposition, has indicated his strong support for this. I believe he is committed to reforming the parliament. He is certainly committed to seeing more extemporaneous contributions in both this chamber and the other. I think that would be a good thing.
Although we had in the standing orders since the beginning of Federation—and it was removed only in 1965—the standing order that said that you could not read a speech, I can well remember points of order being taken about a member reading a speech. Erskine May is still the authority, to the extent that it says that a member may only refer to copious notes. I commend the report to all honourable members. I particularly commend the work of the members of the committee—particularly the member for Wentworth—for their contribution to six reports in this parliament.

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-12-04,"—Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I could not help but notice as I was sitting here listening to this important debate—before the speech from the honourable member for Chifley, I should add—that you were rubbing your eyes and staring at the ceiling. Indeed, it was even observed that you were actually propping open one of your eyelids.
—You're not reflecting on the chair, are you?
—Not at all. I suspect this was because you were listening intently to what was being said, Mr Deputy Speaker, but finding the topic and the speeches rather soporific.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—I ask the honourable member for Wentworth to come back to the question before the chair.
—Some people say that the reason we often have an empty chamber is that soporific or boring speeches are given by members of this House: they are set pieces; they are not speeches which are given off the cuff but speeches which are read. I think it is fair to say in your defence, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the reason that you were propping open your eyelids and looking at the ceiling is because one of those occasions was occurring in this very place. That is a reason why we ought to think about the sorts of reforms that are being proposed in the Main Committee by the Procedure Committee.
It is also important to note that there are other possible explanations for the emptiness of the chamber, which is part of the problem being addressed by the Procedure Committee. One explanation, unfortunately, is the incredible amount of committee work that many of us have to undertake. I sit on four committees of the parliament and I sit on several other committees of the backbench of my party. I find that I am continually going from one meeting to another. I do not have the opportunities that I would like to sit in the House and listen to some of the second reading speeches, which I think are of great importance.
The other problem is television. We have TVs in our rooms. Why would we come down to the chamber if we can sit in our rooms, put our feet up and listen to the speech as it is being given without having to go all the way down to the chamber? Another problem is that we have constituents and lobbyists continually knocking on our doors wanting to have a bit of our time, wanting us to hear their arguments and wanting to advance their cases in relation to particular aspects of either their work or their constituency concerns. So there are a lot of calls on the time of ordinary members of parliament.
I have mentioned a few of the reasons we sometimes have an empty chamber for second reading speeches, which is the concern of the Procedure Committee and the matter that is before the parliament at the moment. I agree warmly with the comments of the member for Chifley regarding the need for this reform, but I am not sure that the mere fact that we are going to shorten the second reading speech by five minutes is necessarily going to lead to greater participation in the parliament and more members coming in to listen to what is being said.
There is also a caveat. We ought to recall that the second reading speech is a formal occasion as far as the government and opposition spokespeople are concerned. It is important from the point of view of the courts of the land and tribunals that they observe, hear and are able to read precisely what the government has to say about any piece of legislation, so that when it comes to interpretation, as is provided for under the Acts Interpretation Act of the parliament, they can take into account those comments. However, courts do not take into account the observations of ordinary members of parliament in their debates on a particular measure; therefore, there is an opportunity for greater flexibility in our procedures in that regard. This is where it seems to me that we can make an advance that might solve this problem of sterile debate and an empty chamber. 
That advance is in the proposal put forward by the Procedure Committee to permit questions. It is suggested in the proposal that, at the commencement of his or her address, the speaker could opt in or opt out of accepting questions. I would prefer to be a little more dictatorial on that and suggest that the trial is not going to be effective unless we require every second reading speaker, other than the formal set piece debates that I have mentioned, to submit himself or herself to that interrogation or to the possibility of interrogation.
At the end of the day, it seems to me that the real reason this measure will enliven debate is not because we will not be listening to any more soporific speeches or we will be dragging people out of their rooms because they are not taking meetings with constituents or listening to lobbyists or watching the TV. The real reason is because they will be able to take points on their opponents—and that is what this chamber is really about, at the end of the day. As Disraeli said, the duty of the opposition is to oppose. Members of the opposition will be able to come in and take points on government speakers. Indeed, it will also work the other way around: members of the government will be able to take points on the opposition and expose the emptiness of their concerns and their opposition to government legislation.
I can see benefits and merits in this proposal from the Procedure Committee from both points of view. But at the end of the day I think it will really achieve some improvement in relation to the problem that it is designed to address. I commend the chair, the deputy chair—the member for Chifley—and the other members of the committee for this proposal. There should be some improvement in the amount of interaction in the debate in the parliament so as to improve our presentation and the level of debate and to solve the issues of the sterile debate and the empty chamber. I support the proposal.

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2003-12-04,"—I rise in this adjournment debate today to talk about a wonderful program that many years ago as Minister for Veterans' Affairs I had the pleasure of conducting on behalf of the Keating government. It was known as Australia Remembers. I say this because only a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane the Greenslopes Private Hospital, which used to be known as the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital, had a special function to which they most graciously invited me, along with my wife, as the special guest. They billed it as the Australia Remembers dinner. It was a wonderful occasion. They invited people who were involved in the commemorations back in 1995.
Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, you may remember that in 1995 we celebrated—or commemorated, rather; it was not so much a celebration—the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. We took the opportunity of thanking all those generations of people—such as the generations of the 1930s that were brought up after the Great Depression—who were asked to go and fight for their country at a time when this country's sovereignty was at risk, when we actually did have Japanese submarines in our waters, when Darwin was bombed and Broome was strafed, if I remember correctly, and there were Catalinas in the bay there. As part of the celebrations I went up there and we held special commemorations. It was a wonderful time. Ex-service men and women were remembered.
Some people say that it was that remembrance program that reignited interest in Anzac Day and, in many respects, that is why we are getting so many thousands of people coming along to Anzac Day ceremonies. At Cleveland in my own electorate, I remember that before Australia Remembers you would get 300; now we are getting 3,000. I think that is replicated right around the country. That is a marvellous thing. The reason is that at the time we made sure that the program was on a completely bipartisan basis and that the young people—in fact, the member for Moncrieff might remember it as he might have been at school then, although probably not; but in any event he would remember it—the children, the youth of this country were being told about how much they owed to the generation of that time.
Mr Alan Kinkade is the General Manager of Greenslopes Private Hospital, which is a hospital owned by the Ramsay Health group, owned by Paul Ramsay. They organised it at their expense. They invited people who were involved at the time. I had the great pleasure of seeing once again a person who is so well known in this country and not understood much—particularly by people from my side. I talk about the one and only Bruce Ruxton. Bruce Ruxton was there. He is a friend of mine. I have no hesitation in saying that. He is the sort of person who will carry you on his shoulders a thousand miles. He is that sort of person. If he is you friend, he is your friend. He did a marvellous job during his time as the president of the RSL in Victoria.
Others turned up as well. Mr Paul Ramsay himself, who it is very difficult to get to come to these sorts of things, came along because he himself has a great emotional attachment to that generation of Australians. I was very honoured to see him there. There was Mr Cyril Gilbert, who was a prisoner of war in Changi and with whom I had the pleasure of visiting the Changi prison in Singapore. Then there was Josie Jones, a wonderful lady and a close personal friend of mine from Mildura, who went all the way up there to be part of this remembrance dinner. I want to say that I cannot believe how well the Ramsay Health group did this. 
Alan Kinkade used to be the manager of the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney some time ago, and his new job is at Greenslopes. At Greenslopes, they concentrate on veterans. It used to be a public hospital but it was sold by the Commonwealth government at the time, just before I became minister, to the Ramsay Health Group. I want to place on record the marvellous job that they do for the veterans of Queensland. I want to place on record that in all the time I have been a member of parliament not once have I received a complaint about the service that that hospital gives to the veteran community. All in the veteran community love to go to Greenslopes Private Hospital if they have to go to a hospital—that is the one they want to go to.
I want to thank Alan Kinkade, the people in charge of the Greenslopes hospital, Paul Ramsay and those wonderful veterans who fought so hard for us during those dark years. I want to place on record in this parliament that I truly appreciated what they did with the Australia Remembers dinner.
