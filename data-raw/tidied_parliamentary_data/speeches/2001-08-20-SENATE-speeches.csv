"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2001-08-20,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 16 August 2001 of Mr Reginald Gillard OAM, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Macquarie, New South Wales, from 1975 to 1980.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Gillard, Mr Reginald</title>",Condolences,0,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-20,"— The Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001 is the product of two broken promises from the Prime Minister. The Senate made him keep his first promise that the price of ordinary beer would not increase as a result of the GST: it was demonstrated that ordinary beer served across the bar would actually suffer a large increase in price, and the government was forced to backflip by reducing the level of beer excise. The Prime Minister then promised that all the money collected during the period when beer prices had risen would go into a foundation to reduce the impact of excessive use of alcohol and other legal drugs. He signed a memorandum of understanding with the Democrats, setting out this commitment and undertaking a range of specific commitments that the foundation would be accountable for. These promises have now also been broken, because the foundation has been short-changed and has not been set up as a properly accountable body.
On 14 August 1998, just before the last election, John Howard said about the GST:
Across the board there is virtually no change in relation to alcohol. A tiny CPI equivalent rise in relation to ordinary beer. Perhaps a small reduction for low alcohol beer.
Then on the John Laws program on 23 September, he said:
There will be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer prices.
The Prime Minister said that the price of ordinary beer would only go up by 1.9 per cent, and yet he oversaw a program that put it up by more than 10 per cent when excise indexation is taken into account. The Prime Minister repeatedly gave an absolute watertight guarantee that the price of ordinary beer would go up by only 1.9 per cent, and it is Labor that forced him to honour that promise.
In April, when the government and the Democrats signed an agreement to establish a private foundation, we were told that the government had collected some $155 million in surplus excise payments during the period from 1 July 2000 to 3 April 2001. This bill has only allocated $115 million to the foundation. Including the additional $5 million to go to heritage hotels, this leaves an unexplained gap of $35 million. The government has refused to produce the Treasury figures that were relied upon to arrive at its calculation of how much had been collected. The figures it showed to the Democrats have never been shared with the rest of the Australian community. What has the government got to hide? Why won't it allow Treasury to produce the figures on which its calculations are made?
The Senate inquiry has heard that the government now argues that the figure of $150 million was an estimate for a full 12 months at the higher rate of excise. However, it has also heard from the brewers, who advised by letter last Friday that in fact they had paid out $145 million above the original estimate. The Australian public are entitled to know whether all the money unlawfully obtained through the overcharging of excise is being returned to them; there are strong grounds to believe it is not.
The agreement the Democrats actually signed off on on 3 April said that the private sector foundation was to be given the full agreed $115 million from the surplus beer excise collections during 2000-01. However, the government has now decided to spread the handover of the money over four years, without any adjustment for interest. In the case of the Natural Heritage Trust, the government paid interest on the sum while it was held by Treasury. In this case, it has refused to hand over the unlawfully collected excise and has refused to pay interest on the money while it is held by the Treasury. This short-changes the foundation by more than $13 million, at the current long-term bond rate of six per cent. This comes on top of the other $30 million or so short-changed because of the dispute over undisclosed estimates of excise receipts. 
The deal between the government and the Democrats also contains a number of broad intentions about how the foundation is to operate and stipulates various things about how the money is to be allocated. This includes at least 85 per cent being paid out to professional and community organisations and various minimums to be spent in the first five years on treatment and rehabilitation and on public education and prevention, including an overall minimum of 20 per cent on Aboriginal programs. A maximum expenditure of 10 per cent on administration and promotion in the first year is stipulated. Because this agreement was negotiated in private there is no information about how these proportions were arrived at, and they are not included in this bill. As they only apply during the first year, when $10 million will be spent, there is no indication of the proportions that will apply in subsequent years. Hence, the proportions do not apply to the vast bulk of the proposed spending. It is understood that some of these matters may be dealt with in the constitution of the foundation, but unfortunately that document is not available to throw any light on the subject. I call on the minister to table the foundation's constitution, so that the Senate can know what it contains.
The Labor Party was amongst the first to advocate that the surplus excise collections should be spent through a foundation, and that remains our view. Labor proposed the following specific priorities: promotion of responsible drinking patterns; research into and treatment of alcoholism; support for community partnership projects related to alcohol education; reduction of domestic violence due to alcohol; and reduction of substance abuse in indigenous communities. We highlighted the fact that a significant proportion of draught beer sales occurs in rural areas and suggested that particular attention should be provided to programs in rural and regional Australia. A number of these themes were also picked up in the agreement entered into by the Democrats, but I am disappointed that some issues, such as reduction of domestic violence, were omitted.
The opposition is concerned that its proposal that the foundation should look at programs to reduce the impact of domestic violence was ignored or overlooked in the negotiating process. We wish to insert this objective at this stage. The focus of the foundation will depend significantly on who is actually appointed. Once again, this is a process that we have no information about, except that the government and the Democrats will select people behind closed doors.
It is difficult to discuss this bill because it deals with only a small part of the total proposal and the details of the foundation itself have not been revealed. There are a number of key areas of concern. Firstly, there is a need for the constitution of the proposed foundation to be tabled in parliament before this bill is passed, because the bill is hard to interpret without that information. Under the 3 April agreement, this constitution was to have been completed between the government and the Democrats by mid-April.
It is not even clear exactly what sort of body the foundation will be. The 3 April agreement refers to the foundation as being an `incorporated charitable trust'. However, the bill simply includes two versions of the name under the definition of `foundation' in section 4. It is objectionable that the constitution has not been open to comment by others and that it will not have any parliamentary consideration. At the inquiry, the nominated chair of the foundation suggested that he thought the foundation might be a company limited by guarantee, but he could not be very sure.
Since the bill was introduced, the government has announced a list of people whom they propose to invite to form this foundation as a private entity belonging to those people. This unusual process was apparently agreed between the government and the Democrats, but I think it should be the subject of wider scrutiny. The board members will not be statutory office holders, they will not have fixed terms of office, they will not be subject to any accountability requirements, there are no public conditions of appointment and remuneration and there is no procedure for the appointment of replacement members. This is unacceptable given the large amount of public funds that will be distributed by the foundation. 
The people who are nominated appear to be very worthy individuals, and I make no criticism of them—they obviously have expertise in alcohol and other drug programs and in managing community grants programs. However, I think they are putting their reputations at some risk in being involved in such a strange and unaccountable process. Others active in the field will have cause to question how these individuals were chosen, to whom they are accountable and whether they will have any conflicts of interest when it comes to deciding which grants are approved. There cannot be much confidence in a secret process that leads to appointments lacking any clarity about the terms and conditions.
The next issue of concern is the part of the deal for the foundation to submit a detailed business plan `for approval by the government and the Democrats by August 2001'. This business plan is the document that will guide the foundation's work, but it is approved through a political process. The agreement envisages that the business plan would be tabled in parliament. However, the bill contains no requirement for the business plan to be released and no requirement for the foundation to operate under open and transparent processes, free of bias. Given the massive rorting of the public purse to the tune of $20 million per month on political advertising over the last six months, there are legitimate suspicions about the government's motives. Why would the Democrats accept the word of a dishonest government which has frequently broken its promises?
The 3 April agreement envisages that procedures for the foundation to report annually to parliament should be in the constitution of the proposed trust. However, this should be done with parliamentary authority in accordance with the annual reporting provisions applying to similar bodies. The standard and timing of reports should be determined by parliament in line with normal practice for similar bodies. It is inappropriate for a body to determine on its own behalf how and when it will report to parliament. If the bill does not deal with these matters, it is quite possible that the foundation's constitution will not require it to report to parliament or that the foundation itself may resolve in future years to stop reporting.
The provision for a replacement body to be nominated by the minister if the funding agreement is terminated increases the need for the accountability requirements to appear in legislation and not to rely on the constitution of the initial recipient of funds. The government has been unable to provide satisfactory responses on this issue. The best it can suggest is that the annual reporting provision might be built into the funding agreement in some way, but it suggests it will take the form of a requirement to report to the minister and that the minister may table the report. This is not the same thing as reporting to parliament and it does not give parliament the ability to review the reports or for the body to be considered through the Senate estimates committee, as would be the case for any other body handling such sums of public funds.
The agreement also makes reference to monitoring and reporting on the cost effectiveness and social impact of the foundation without clarifying by whom or to where the foundation reports. These matters should not be left to chance. The bill is also silent about the role of the Auditor-General. The 3 April agreement envisages `independent auditing of the accounts and performance of the foundation'. Given the large amount of public money involved, this should be conducted by the Auditor-General with parliamentary authority. The use of a commercial auditor will introduce problems in achieving the proper level of scrutiny of how the organisation has performed. The body of expertise in the Australian National Audit Office, in relation to maintaining the probity of community grants programs, would be ignored.  
It was suggested at the Senate inquiry that the Auditor-General had agreed to use his powers to audit these accounts, but it is quite possible that the new foundation board will not invite the Auditor-General to do so and that the Auditor-General would not be able force the board to comply. The board could appoint an auditor of their own choosing, simply because they are an entirely private company under this bill, free of any accountability to government or to parliament.
The agreement refers to procedures for approval of grants, but does not specify any requirements in relation to how probity and management of conflicts of interest will be managed in running what is a very large grant program by any measure. The legal issues concerning how funds will be recovered by the foundation from non-performing grant recipients also needs to be resolved to ensure that public funds are not misused. The consequences and liability of board members for any maladministration by the foundation or its staff are left up in the air, because the foundation is being created as a private body external to government and is isolated from the probity and auditing provisions that decades of experience have proven are essential for protecting public funds.
Labor's preference is that the foundation should be established on the proven model of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation. This is a body with a statutory base and direct lines of accountability to parliament and the Auditor-General for the spending of public funds. It is widely recognised as independent in its decision making and enjoys support from all political parties—partly because, somewhat uniquely, each political party has an MP on the board, which gives it full transparency. There should be a defined board membership and a process for filling vacancies and all of the normal accountability provisions for a person holding a significant public office: defined terms of appointment and remuneration, declarations of interest, removal for bankruptcy and limits on directors' liability. The foundation should be subject to the Auditor-General and report formally to parliament. Many of these provisions apply to the Natural Heritage Trust, which has a similar role to play in the distribution of funds to community projects. There should be controls on excessive remuneration and political advertising.
Labor is a strong supporter of the concept of the foundation and sees a large backlog of work to reduce the harm caused by alcohol abuse. It is a pity that the concept has not got off to a smooth start because the normal procedures that have been developed over the years to manage the fair and efficient distribution of public funds have been ignored. I hope the Senate will support the amendments that the opposition will move to achieve this very desirable outcome. We hope that our amendments will make the bill better and ensure the success of the foundation by putting in the proper accountability and reporting mechanisms from the start, rather than this rather inadequate approach that the government has adopted. As I say, we will be moving a series of amendments in the committee stage, and I will address those then.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-20,"—I am very pleased to at last be speaking on the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001, which was delayed during the previous sitting and therefore has delayed the actual establishment and the start of the work of the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. I am very disappointed that Labor seems to be so intent on muddying the waters, but I will deal with that later as we move through the committee process.
This is a major opportunity to put a significant amount of money into the prevention of abuse of legal substances of alcohol and petrol and other related substances that particularly young children are likely to abuse, such as glue. Unlike tobacco, which when used as directed is deadly, alcohol when used as it is supposed to be used can indeed be quite a beneficial substance. I realise that there are some teetotallers out there that would still argue with that, but I think most Australians would overwhelmingly agree that alcohol does have something to add to our lives if it is used wisely. 
I am sure, again, that most Australians will be well and truly familiar with various drink-driving campaigns and a raft of other campaigns to try to get us to use alcohol responsibly. But, unfortunately, despite all of the efforts to date, more than 3,000 people die each year from alcohol related causes and, indeed, the economic cost is estimated to be over $1.3 billion still. So, despite the work that has been done, there is a lot of work to do and therefore this funding is extremely important.
We argued at the time that the GST came into existence that beer excise must remain stable, as the government did promise, and that any extra collected should not be kept by government. Basically we have this fund thanks to the beer drinkers of Australia. Indeed, there was a suggestion that it should be called the `Beer Drinkers Foundation'. Never mind, we obviously have upset a couple of people by calling it the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation, but that is basically what it is set up to do—to work from one end of the problem, the education end, actually informing people of the dangers of abuse and misuse, through the spectrum of prevention to a raft of health issues and then on to rehabilitation for those people who have succumbed to unfortunate habits and practices.
As the beer lobby was mounting their protest against the additional excise collected on draught beer, they surveyed beer drinkers and said, `Okay, if we can do anything about this, if we can get the money back, what do we do with it?' Overwhelmingly, they said that they wanted it put into some sort of a charitable trust, foundation or whatever to basically look at issues related to this and a raft of other charitable matters. The overwhelming majority agreed that the extra should go to a charitable cause. So the foundation has been born. It is the result of negotiations between me as the then Democrats leader and Prime Minister Howard earlier this year. It is evidence of what can be achieved through negotiation and discussion when each side is prepared to compromise and to take on the other's concerns.
There is ongoing debate—and the ALP has raised the issue this morning—as to exactly how much money we should be talking about. If you talk to the beer industry you get one figure, and you get another figure from Treasury. In the end we asked for independent modelling and the final outcome is somewhere between the two. Around $120 million extra was collected between those two critical dates, and that is what we are dealing with today. This is the one difficulty we had in the negotiations with government. We believed that it was abundantly clear—and I will deal with this again in the committee stage— that:
This bill will ensure that the full equivalent of the increase in excise collected on draught beer since 1 July 2000, less $5 million allocated to the Historic Hotels initiative, is appropriated and allocated to a Foundation to be called the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation.
Thanks to their decision just before the last budget to in fact appropriate this money over four years—again the jury is out and there are some discussions as to precisely what the amount of money is—the government have probably short-changed the foundation of about $10 million over four years, and that is the amount of money that the Democrats would now like to find repaid by government back into the foundation. At the moment, as it stands, $115 million is being appropriated through this bill and being put into the foundation.
I am very surprised that the opposition seem to be so vague about the appointments to the board. The announcement was made quite some time ago now. They mentioned that they were aware of some invitations, but the formal announcement was indeed made quite some time ago. I do not have a lot of time this morning to go through the enormous list of qualifications of all of those who have been appointed, but I will go through very quickly in alphabetical order, with a few details on each, the people who have accepted and who are indeed already announced as members.
I will start with Professor Ian Webster, the chair. He is the current president of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, the chair of the National Advisory Council on Suicide Prevention and visiting physician to the Matthew Talbot Hostel for the homeless. Cheryl Bart is chairman of the Australian Sports Foundation and chairman of its audit committee. She has had a long involvement with charities. Dr Ngiare Brown is currently working with World Vision Australia's indigenous programs as a preventative health coordinator. She is executive officer of the Indigenous Doctors Association and has a long history of involvement in this area. Reverend Tim Costello is involved, as people in this place are probably well aware, with the urban mission unit of the Collins Street Baptist Church, which offers hospitality to homeless youth in Melbourne's city centre. He has had first-hand experience of the difficulties with drug detoxification programs. David Crosbie is currently the CEO of Odyssey House in Victoria, one of Australia's leading alcohol and drug treatment agencies. He is also a member of the National Expert Advisory Committee on Alcohol. 
Dr Peter d'Abbs is currently with both the Menzies School of Health Research and the Queensland health department. Prior to joining the Menzies School of Health Research in 1992, he was in charge of research and evaluation at the Drug and Alcohol Bureau in the Territory. He has done extensive work in developing an alcohol strategy for Cape York communities. Scott Wilson has worked in the field of alcohol and other drugs for many years. He is currently manager of Alcohol and Other Drugs Services in Alice Springs.
Anne Mosey has worked with remote Aboriginal communities for over 10 years in the Northern Territory and Western Australia to assist them in the development of strategies concerning alcohol abuse and petrol sniffing. Professor Tim Stockwell has been director of the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University since 1996 and served as deputy director for seven years prior to that. Dr Bernadette Tobin is director of the Plunkett Centre for Ethics in Health Care at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney and a senior lecturer in philosophy at the Australian Catholic University. Scott Wilson is state director of the Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Council of South Australia, which is the only indigenous organisation of its kind in Australia. He is a very important member of the foundation, as indeed all of these people are. They all bring a vast range of expertise. So I am more than happy, if the opposition are still not sure of any details of who is on the board and what their qualifications are, to give them the complete details, which were publicly released about 2½ months ago.
The objects of the foundation have also very clearly been released. They formed part of the discussions of the Senate committee that looked at this legislation. Roughly, this legislation is to prevent alcohol and other licit or legal substance abuse, including petrol sniffing, particularly among vulnerable populations such as indigenous Australians and youth; support evidence based alcohol and other licit substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation research and prevention programs; promote community education, encourage the responsible consumption of alcohol and highlight the dangers of licit substance abuse; provide funding grants to organisations with appropriate community linkages to deliver the abovementioned services on behalf of the foundation; promote public awareness of the work of the foundation; and raise funds from the private sector for the ongoing work.
About 80 per cent of this money is intended to be spent in the first four years. Hopefully the foundation will be ongoing. It will therefore need to raise additional funding from the community and the private sector—hopefully from the industry generally; that is, not just the beer industry but the alcohol industry generally. I would hope that other foundations would perhaps consider at least working cooperatively with this foundation, and I particularly point here to the wine industry. So the objectives are clearly set out. As the foundation now begin to meet—they have had one initial meeting—we will be able to see the way in which they make progress on these issues.
This brings me to the whole issue of accountability. It is absolute nonsense to suggest, as the opposition have, that somehow this foundation is not going to be accountable. I again draw their attention to the Senate committee report. I will not go through pages 2 to 5 of that report but just quote one example: 
The Bill requires the Minister to table a copy of every funding agreement, and any variation to the agreement, in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days.
I therefore find it quite extraordinary that the opposition should come in here and say, `We will never know what is happening; we will never know where the money is going; we will have no idea in the future of what is going on.' That is absolute nonsense. We wanted an independent foundation that would not in any way be controlled by any department and that would not in any way simply be putting money in as replacement funding for any existing state, territory or Commonwealth alcohol and drug related program. We want this money to be new money and to be spent independently, and I think we have established a board that is very able to determine the priorities as far as spending is concerned.
The funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the foundation will clearly specify a range of accountability and reporting requirements, including the requirement that the foundation provide six-monthly progress reports to the department, as well as an annual report for presentation to parliament through the Minister for Health and Aged Care. While we want this foundation to be completely independent, obviously it has to be fully accountable, and we have made sure that it is fully accountable. Parliament will be able to see step by step what it is doing and where the money is going and how it is spent, and they will be able to do that on a regular basis. The Auditor-General has already agreed in principle to audit the accounts of the foundation under agreements contained in the Auditor-General's governing legislation. So to suggest for a moment that there is some conflict or some concern about who will audit it, how it will be audited and whether it will be audited by the private sector is not the case—there is no problem. You have only to go back and look at the committee report, which no doubt you have already read, and look quite clearly at what you apparently have great trouble reading: I again refer the opposition to pages 2 to 5 of the committee report which set that out extremely clearly.
I will not go through the opposition's amendments in any great detail and I will very quickly touch on the suggestions made by Senator Evans that somehow we are not seriously concerned with indigenous issues. As the memorandum clearly states, at least 20 per cent of total expenditure will be used for projects targeting indigenous Australians. The opposition have an amendment dealing with this which is absolutely unnecessary. The position is very clear; there is an undertaking. Two indigenous members of the foundation have been working for a long time on indigenous issues. I can assure the opposition that their attempt to suggest that there is a problem in this area is completely unfounded. Indeed, from my discussions with indigenous communities and Aboriginal people over the last few months, I can say that they are looking forward to participating not just on the alcohol issue but particularly on the petrol sniffing issue.
As most senators would be aware, petrol sniffing is an issue that flares up from time to time. Current estimates show that there are around 500 full-time sniffers in Central Australia. As far as I can ascertain, there is only one adequately funded program in Central Australia and that funding does not seem to be as consistent as it should be. We have an opportunity to make a difference, to put in some checks and balances and to try to give young people something to do. This is why there is someone on the foundation with expertise in sport and recreation. Boredom is a major factor in what leads young people down the path of sniffing petrol and abusing alcohol.
The other initiative I wish to mention, and it has been touched on, is the Historic Hotels initiative. As we have heard again today, the hike in the price of draught beer had a considerable impact in rural areas because that is where, proportionately, there is a greater amount of draught sold. It had a particular impact on smaller hotels and those which did not have access to gaming. Those hotels with poker machines were able to cross-subsidise so that the price of beer did not jump as much as it should have. Those who were without any means of cross-subsidising, who basically had to rely just on what they got from beer and food sales, were hardest hit. We are particularly interested in this initiative. It is only a small amount of money—only $5 million— but hopefully, as we see the results, it will increase the interest of government in continuing the funding in this area. 
As we go through the committee stage I will deal further with the issue of domestic violence. I do not suggest for one moment that this is not a major, indeed a critical, issue that all parliaments across Australia—state, territory and federal—should be dealing with and doing far more about. But to start further dissipating what is funding specifically for alcohol and other legal substance misuse into an area on which we could spend $115 million within 12 months and still not adequately provide the required services is not the way to go. If this is an issue—and I hope it is an issue for both government and opposition—let us see some real funding from normal budgetary sources going into prevention, support accommodation services and specific programs for abusers or people who have been abused, largely women and children. This is not the time to take more resources from this one-off money that is going into drug and alcohol programs. Inevitably, there will be a spin-off as a natural and normal course of events. If we can reduce the level of abuse of alcohol and associated areas, I believe that, quite naturally, we will see a reduction in domestic violence. I do not believe that to specifically earmark money from drug and alcohol programs and move it into this area is appropriate at this time.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-08-20,"— The Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001 is the product of two broken promises from the Howard government. Mr Howard said before the last election that the price of ordinary beer would not increase as a result of the GST. Labor exposed the large increases that ordinary beer served across the bar would actually suffer. Labor forced the government into another backflip to reduce the level of beer taxes. This bill is a direct result of that backflip.
Today, however, I do not want to focus on these aspects of the bill. It is too important an opportunity to just play party politics. Alcohol abuse is a major problem. It is destroying individuals, families and communities. It affects all communities, but it is a serious problem in indigenous communities. When non-indigenous people drink inappropriately, it is most often behind closed doors. Indigenous drinking, however, is often a public event. I would point out that there are many indigenous people seen on our streets who do not drink. A study entitled `Somewhere to sit down safe', undertaken by Bob Durnham in Cairns in the mid-1990s, has confirmed this. Many indigenous people are often wrongly considered to be drinkers. However, there are also those who do drink. There are many indigenous people who are alcoholics. Alcoholics do not drink sensibly. Like heroin and other illegal drug users, they have to abstain. It is a sad indictment of us all that alcohol is such a problem in indigenous communities. This bill provides a real opportunity to do something substantial to combat alcohol abuse in these communities. I want to spend some time focusing on this problem. I also want to focus on the link between alcohol and violence, particularly domestic violence. I will not go into the technicalities of the bill. Labor's minority report from the Senate inquiry does that in detail. My colleague Senator Chris Evans has also outlined our thoughts on these matters. Given that, there is not much detail in the bill.
I want to express what I believe the people of Queensland, and particularly North Queensland, see as the major issues this foundation must address. $115 million is a significant amount of money. We need to do something significant with it. I hope that if these suggestions are not included in the bill they will at least be included in the foundation's constitution or business plan. Combating domestic violence needs to be made part of the bill. The submission to the inquiry by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care states that the foundation's objectives are broad enough to include domestic violence. I would prefer that this issue be identified explicitly. The 20 per cent funding for indigenous alcohol programs also needs to be enshrined in the legislation. It is currently in the memorandum of understanding between the government and the Australian Democrats, but it needs to be in the legislation. 
The problems of alcohol and substance abuse will not be solved in four years. We need to consider how we can maintain and expand this fund into the future. Alcoholism in indigenous communities is a growing problem. It will take at least one generation to address. Even if it could be stamped out tomorrow, the social impacts of the violence and the health problems it is causing will live on. Alcohol has scarred so many lives. It, and the problems it creates, will not go away quickly. Before we can tackle alcohol and substance abuse, one must first understand and contextualise the problem. Geoff Genever, in a report to the Apunipima Cape York Health Council in 1999, points out: 
Apart from selected individuals, for 85 years Aboriginal people living in Queensland were legally forbidden to consume alcohol. When prohibition was lifted in 1965 no-one forced them to drink, the decision to do so lay with the individual and with them alone. Therefore, it would be wrong to present Aboriginal people as victims and it is not the intention of this report to do so. However, there are realities that should be considered. Amongst these is the fact that as a people their legal drinking  experience is limited and they were subjected to extensive pressure to drink from a variety of sources. I believe this should be recognised because it has a bearing on the damaging drinking levels and widespread associated violence that is a feature of contemporary life in Aboriginal communities. 
We have seen rapid change in the past century. During periods of rapid change there are winners and there are losers. People in rural and regional Australia, where many indigenous people live, are more often than not the losers in this changed process. The new economy we hear talked about is more evident in Sydney and Melbourne than in Cape York Peninsula, the Burdekin or Mount Isa in western Queensland. This phenomenon, however, is not restricted to the regions. Increasingly, people in the outskirts of cities are also becoming disenfranchised. 
In rural and regional Australia primary industries are still a major economic driver. Primary industries, however, have been in decline, for economic and ecological reasons, for many years. This decline has seen associated business and employment opportunities disappear. We have seen not only significant economic change, but also social change over the past century. The roles of men, women and children have changed significantly for many people. There has been rapid change for many people, especially in regional Australia. Many people from all age groups and all backgrounds have become confused about their roles as a part of this process. Many have turned to alcohol as a way of escaping the boredom or misery of their lives. This is truly a sad thing. If we want to maintain and continue to develop a humane and just society, we cannot afford to ignore these people. We need to look to solutions rather than seek to blame these people for their misfortunes. 
I often feel that our society is flawed. It is producing such wealth for some and such poverty for others. We preach competition in the marketplace, and cooperation in families and communities. People and families, however, run the businesses that make up our market. There is a great paradox here that needs to be discussed. Communities must have a greater role in the decision making process. We cannot just keep leaving it to the market. We must keep asking ourselves fundamental questions about the way our society functions. This is particularly important for us, we who sit here as the nation's representatives. 
Real questions are starting to be asked about whether our current economic and social paradigms are good for our communities. I raise these issues because alcohol abuse and addiction cannot be addressed in isolation. Solutions must be holistic and community driven. Alcoholism, and the misuse of other drugs, is just one symptom of this economic malaise. Alcohol is increasingly becoming an escape, a way out for those who are disenfranchised in the community. It has become increasingly abused, leading to violence as well as to alcoholism and its associated health and social problems, and this is the case in all of our communities. Alcohol and substantial abuse, therefore, cannot be considered in isolation. We need integrated approaches that provide long-term solutions for individuals and for communities.  
The Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care submission to the Senate inquiry points out that alcohol is second only to tobacco as a cause of death or preventable hospitalisation. It estimates that in Australia each year there are approximately 4,000 alcohol related deaths and just under 100,000 hospitalisations. The cost to the community has been estimated at $4.5 billion. Yet in the submission from David Crosbie, CEO of Odyssey House in Victoria, to the Senate inquiry he estimates that the Commonwealth allocates less than $1 per person to prevent or reduce alcohol related harm. 
Since the introduction of the National Drug Strategy in the mid-1980s, there have been significant changes in the way the broader community views alcohol consumption. When I was 18, driving while affected by alcohol was acceptable to people, especially people who lived in the bush. You were not a `bloody idiot' back then. These achievements, however, have not flowed through to indigenous communities. Dr Peter d'Abbs from the Menzies School of Health Research, in his submission to the Senate inquiry, states: 
With some notable exceptions, alcohol services and programs targeting indigenous Australians remain too few in number to be able to make a significant contribution to reducing the burden of alcohol related harm. 
Where they do exist, he says, they are inadequately resourced in areas such as security of funding, staff training and development; they are not strongly based on evidence or best practice guidelines and they are rarely evaluated. These attributes are more marked in programs and services to address petrol sniffing and the use of kava. This is a clear call for a large proportion of the foundation's funds to be directed towards combating alcohol abuse in indigenous communities.
I now want to spend some time discussing this issue. Firstly, I want to say that I believe in a safety net. I believe in the state's responsibility to provide welfare. For a society to be just and humane, it must support and protect the most disadvantaged in the community. Statistics clearly show that indigenous people fall into this category. However, there seems to me to be an increasing mood in the community to blame the disadvantaged for their situation. `It's your fault you don't have a job.' `It's your fault you are dependent on welfare.' In many instances, however, there are not the jobs; there are not the opportunities. In these situations, blame makes no contribution. Disadvantaged people need more compassion, not more denigration. Welfare, however, can be disempowering. It can take away from people their feeling of self-worth. Alcohol is an easy escape in this situation. Initially it can provide joy in a joyless life. Those using alcohol as an escape, however, quickly become dependent. Any happiness associated with escape quickly disappears and becomes craving. This is the situation for a vast number of people in indigenous communities.
I am hearing from Aboriginal leaders like Noel Pearson that alcoholism has become the cause rather than the symptom of problems in Aboriginal communities. These leaders are calling alcoholism an epidemic in their communities, an epidemic that needs to be directly targeted. A few weeks ago Bob McMullan, the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, and I met with Noel Pearson and people from the Cape York Partnerships program in Far North Queensland—a process supported by the Queensland Labor government. Tim Jaffer, the coordinator of Cape York Partnerships, also spoke with the Labor caucus's government service delivery committee last week in Cairns.
Noel Pearson has outlined many of his ideas in an as yet unpublished paper entitled `Outline of a grog and drugs (and therefore violence) strategy'. I would like to touch on some of the things that Mr Pearson and Cape York Partnerships have identified as important. Firstly, there is recognition that alcohol is the problem. It is destroying Aboriginal communities on Cape York Peninsula. It is no longer affecting just young men; women and older people who have never drunk before are becoming alcoholics. This is particularly disturbing. Alcohol abuse by indigenous men has been a problem for some time. In recent years, though, women and children—young children—are increasingly becoming involved. Sober role models in the community are disappearing. 
Cape York Partnerships uses a holistic approach and sets out four strategies to address the problems facing Aboriginal people on Cape York Peninsula. The first strategy involves getting and holding onto good resource people. Whenever programs are developed and run, there is a need for good people to be involved—people with vision and skills, people who see opportunities and work with others to achieve them. We need to develop the capacity of people within indigenous communities. This involves building skills but also building people's self-worth and understanding.
The second strategy recognises the need to change the welfare state. It is estimated that $150 million in welfare payments, including CDEP, enter Cape York Peninsula every year. I spoke earlier about the paradoxes in our current economic system and the role of competition in business while we preach cooperation and community when tackling social problems. Aboriginal people in many ways have a far more cooperative structure in their society than there is in the competitive society we all live in. Yet we in the broader community judge them within the context of our values. Indigenous people feel more of an obligation, a responsibility to each other, in particular to family members. We in the broader community need to respect these structures.
One's feelings of obligation and responsibility, particularly for extended family, however, can be abused when alcohol becomes part of the culture. Alcoholics are addicts. They need alcohol and crave it. They will use any means possible to obtain it. Alcoholics can take advantage of people living in a culture in which people feel obliged to support each other. They demand money from non-drinkers to purchase drink and demand alcohol from kin who have it. You have a cycle whereby anybody with any money or alcohol is caught. The simple thing to do is join the whirlpool of alcoholism. To deny your kin brings ridicule and abuse, and often violence. This whirlpool is engulfing individuals and families, with whole communities now being sucked into this alcoholic haze.
Where you have large numbers in the community dependent on welfare, you have large amounts of money coming in small parcels directly to individuals. Incentives to save are difficult to develop when your income is small and barely covers necessities. When this income is fed into an alcohol-centric community and a sharing culture, it disappears very quickly, leaving many without money for food or basic necessities for the rest of the week or fortnight. The current welfare system is feeding the fire of alcoholism in many communities. We need welfare. Every society that seeks to call itself just and humane must have a safety net. I am not questioning the payment of welfare to indigenous people. However, people have suggested that we must look at better ways to provide these necessary funds for communities so that basic needs—not alcohol—are the priority. Making payments weekly rather than fortnightly has merit, and I understand is being trialled in central Australia. Cape York Partnerships is looking at ways to pool payments so that families can develop savings plans.
Often, indigenous councils are dependent on the incomes they receive from their canteens. They are dependent on revenue from alcohol to provide services to their communities. The Queensland Auditor-General found that canteen income totalled $3.6 million last year. Communities that decide to ban alcohol or restrict sales may need financial help to continue to deliver services until a new economy is developed. The third strategy of Cape York Partnerships stresses the need to develop a real economy on Cape York Peninsula. To do this, I believe we need to broaden our understanding of economic activity in the community. We need to recognise contributions that are difficult to value in the short term. We need to value our environment and recognise and reward good management. We need to support innovation in education and in the delivery of training that assists indigenous people to achieve real jobs.  
The final strategy is about better government. Governments need to find ways to deliver better services to all communities, particularly indigenous communities. Cape York Partnerships is currently experimenting with `negotiation tables'. These involve government sitting down with communities and developing programs in partnership. Programs to combat alcoholism in indigenous communities need to be developed and delivered by indigenous people, and they need to be owned by the community.
Many indigenous leaders are now of the view that alcohol has become such a problem that programs about sensible drinking will not work. Alcoholics cannot drink sensibly. These indigenous leaders believe many communities are going to have to ban alcohol for some period to get on top of the problem. However, as ATSIC points out in its submission to the inquiry, these are decisions that indigenous people need to make themselves.
I would now like to focus on the direct link between alcohol and domestic violence. Much domestic violence, particularly in indigenous communities, occurs as a direct result of alcohol abuse. I can therefore understand why the government's focus is on alcohol. The alcohol problem, however, is not going to be solved quickly, so we need to develop ways of preventing violence. We need to do this parallel to solving the alcohol problem.
In conclusion, more than 20 per cent of funding should be directed towards programs in indigenous communities. I would like to see a figure of at least 20 per cent enshrined in the legislation. I hope that domestic violence will become enshrined in the legislation or, at least, in the constitution or business plan. You cannot deal with alcohol problems, particularly in indigenous communities, in isolation from domestic violence. My final advice is taken from ATSIC's submission to the inquiry:
The success of any program in producing better health or harm reduction outcomes depends on the acceptance of that program by the community.
(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-20,"— The Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001 is a welcome initiative which will inject much needed funds into the campaign against alcohol and other licit substance abuse, into community education and into rehabilitation services. I wish to focus my remarks on the problem of alcohol abuse, as alcohol is the most widespread of all the licit drugs this bill deals with. This is not to minimise the dreadful and harmful effect of other problems, such as petrol sniffing and glue sniffing. These are matters about which there has been discussion in the debate thus far on the second reading of this bill and which were before the Senate committee.
Alcohol abuse imposes an enormous social and economic cost on the community and, according to the Department of Health and Aged Care, alcohol abuse is second only to tobacco as a preventable cause of death and hospitalisation in Australia. It is estimated that alcohol abuse costs the community $4.5 billion a year, or $250 for every man, woman and child in Australia. These costs include lower productivity because of lost workdays, health care costs, road accident costs, and legal and court costs. There are 4,000 deaths and 100,000 hospital episodes per year caused by alcohol abuse. I talk about the economic costs, but the social costs are horrendous and largely fall on the shoulders of families and extended families. These social costs are devastating. Alcohol abuse causes enormous dislocation and disruption within individual families. It is the cause of many marriage breakdowns, split families and untold suffering. Mention has been made of domestic violence. Alcoholism triggers, if not causes, much of the domestic violence that is unfortunately widespread in Australia. Alcohol abuse is a cause of poverty in many families and the burden then falls largely on the extended family.
One of the most disturbing trends in recent years is the increase in drinking by young people, including underage drinking. Much work has been done already to combat the harm caused by alcohol abuse, and a lot of this work has been done by government and non-government organisations. A national alcohol strategy has been endorsed by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, and there is a National School Drug Education Strategy. In my own state of Tasmania, the Department of Health and Human Services spends over $4.5 million per annum providing alcohol and drug withdrawal services throughout the state. The state Department of Education funds three curriculum officers to provide policy, professional development and resource support to all schools and commits $200,000 per annum for school drug education. In 1997, a state-community consultative review was conducted in Tasmania, which led to schools being directed to develop a school drug education policy and implementation plan in consultation with parents, students, staff and community representatives. 
The money that is being spent on rehabilitation services, for example, is not sufficient. How many of us know of alcohol addicts? How many of us know of a person who has come to the conclusion at last that they have a problem, who has finally been prepared to admit that they need help, but who has met with the response, `No, there is a waiting list,' when the phone call is made and who then cannot get into detox because there is a waiting list of two or three weeks? Once a person admits that they have a problem, the first step has been taken. Why should they wait? Why should they be put on a waiting list for three weeks? In that time you know as well as I do what happens.
It has been estimated that at least one per cent of the population—180,000 people—have a close family member with serious alcohol problems. The individuals who have this illness and their families bear a substantial social cost. When a family is faced with the task of coping with a family member who has a serious drinking problem, it is often very hard for them to know what to do. The person with the drinking problem is usually in denial and will not seek help for themselves. Professionals will not accept a person for help unless the person accepts help voluntarily. Also, the cost of this help can be very expensive, although some offer help on an ability to pay basis.
As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, Alcoholics Anonymous does very good work in the rehabilitation process. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so that they may solve their common problems and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for Alcoholics Anonymous membership. They are self-supporting through their own contributions. Alcoholics Anonymous is not allied with any sect, denomination, political party, organisation or institution. It does not wish to engage in any controversy and it neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Its primary purpose is to have the membership stay sober and to help other alcoholics achieve sobriety. There are Alcoholics Anonymous group meetings in all cities and in most towns throughout Australia.
Returning to what state, territory and the federal governments are doing, Mr David Crosbie, the CEO of Odyssey House Victoria, in a submission to the Senate committee in July 2001, said:
In the last five years, Commonwealth and State funding for alcohol research, prevention and treatment has been woefully inadequate, particularly when due consideration is given to the burden of disease and social problems associated with alcohol misuse. (Conservative estimates suggest that Commonwealth expenditure specifically allocated to treat, prevent or reduce alcohol related harm amounts to less than $1 per person per year ...)
Remember that alcohol abuse costs every man, woman and child in this country $250 a year. This bill is most welcome and it appears to have the support of the community and, indeed, of industry. According to the Australian Associated Brewers Inc.:
It is ... important to note that it was the AAB, which on behalf of beer drinkers, surveyed beer drinkers to establish what they wished to happen with the disputed beer excise.
This research was conducted in January 2001, and it suggested strongly that beer drinkers believed that the excise should be placed in a trust administered by an independent, charitable foundation to fund causes such as alcohol related medical research.
There has been some concern expressed that the bill does not provide sufficient accountability to parliament. I have been listening to what has been said in the chamber, and I am aware of the points that were made in the Senate committee report. I will listen further to the various arguments put forward on this matter during the debate. The government appears to have chosen an unusual way of establishing the foundation compared with, say, the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. However, these are unusual circumstances. The government has collected this money and then realised that it should not have done so. The question is whether this money belongs to taxpayers or to beer drinkers. I believe the foundation is entitled to money derived from the interest on the $115 million, and at this stage—depending on the arguments one way or the other—I indicate my support for amendments which would give effect to this. If the government considers that it is not entitled to the $120 million, it must also accept that it is not entitled to keep the interest it derived from this money and that it should pass this on to the foundation. 
I will speak briefly about the advertising of alcohol. According to the Department of Health and Aged Care, the misuse of alcohol is second only to the misuse of tobacco as a preventable cause of death and hospitalisation, as I mentioned before. We have seen the banning of tobacco advertising in Australia, but there appears to be very little restraining the advertising of alcohol—particularly of wines, which are far worse than beer when it comes to binding alcoholics.
The costs of alcohol abuse are second only to the costs of tobacco use—or misuse—and, while cigarette advertising is banned, there is no similar ban for the advertising or sponsorship of alcohol. There have been studies done which have linked the advertising of alcohol to increases in drinking amongst young people. In 1998, the federal health minister launched an industry backed alcoholic beverages advertising code and complaints management system to ensure that advertising of liquor is not glamorised or inappropriately aimed at vulnerable people in the community. Dr Wooldridge said:
Alcohol advertising is a significant part of our daily lives in Australia. 
He went on to say:
The alcohol industry spends over $70 million a year on advertising their products. 
This was in 1998. He further said:
It is imperative that this advertising is used in a responsible manner which does not adversely impact on the community, particularly those more vulnerable to advertising such as children and young adults. 
It is very encouraging to see the alcohol industry associations working together in this way to develop the Code and I will be monitoring advertising closely to ensure that the spirit of the Code is upheld so that all alcohol advertising is responsible and reflects community expectations. 
I would like to hear what the government think of the effect of the advertising code for alcohol. Give us an update. What effect is alcohol advertising having on people's drinking habits? Is the government concerned about the increase in drinking by young people? The government is spending $5 million on a campaign to reduce consumption of alcohol by young people and yet it is allowing the alcohol industry to continue to spend of the order of $70 million a year on advertising and sponsorship, especially of sport.
Alcoholism is a disease. It is an illness. It enslaves people and their families. It pushes their families into poverty. Those who live with alcoholics—spouses and children—are enormously affected. Children are the forgotten people in this area. They need to be counselled as much as the alcoholic needs to be counselled. Where in this legislation is support going to be given to that area?
I asked questions in the estimates committee about this foundation and about rehabilitation. I asked whether the new funding would improve availability and access to rehabilitation services to avoid the waiting times for admission, which can contribute to a person with alcoholic problems continuing their addictive behaviours. There is an answer there, but I would like to see a little more elaboration on that. I hope that that might come forth during the committee stage of the debate.
We should not lose hope. In particular, the alcoholics and their families should not lose hope. One of the key steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is to understand that you cannot beat it alone but that you need to make the decision that there is a problem. That is the first step. Having made that decision, the second step is to seek help and to be constant in your resolve not to drink. Amongst the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is the understanding that you need to appeal to a higher being who will sustain you and deliver you from the slavery of addiction. ",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I rise to speak on the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001. This bill establishes the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account, which will disburse funding for education, rehabilitation and prevention of alcohol and other licit substance abuse. Let me begin by providing some background to this bill, which stems from another couple of broken promises from this Prime Minister in the last 12 months or so. From 1 July last year, this government has collected an increased excise on beer and other alcoholic beverages. This came about because the government amended the manner in which excise was calculated, to give effect to its tax reform measures, particularly the replacement of the wholesale sales tax with the GST. 
When the increase in beer prices was foreshadowed in May of last year, there was considerable media attention given to this issue. Certainly, in the Northern Territory it attracted a lot of comment from the Hoteliers Association, which was not at all happy with the decision. It was predicted that the price of draught beer could rise by up to 20c a glass, or nine per cent, whereas the Prime Minister, in his 1998 election campaign, had promised that the price of ordinary beer—and I will turn to the definition of `ordinary beer' later—would rise by no more than 1.9c. Another promise from this Prime Minister that was followed by another broken promise 12 months later.
The government have consistently maintained that `ordinary beer' meant package beer only, whereas the Labor Party have purported that it should be interpreted as also applying to draught beer. At that time, the Australian Labor Party signalled our opposition to the government's proposed increase and foreshadowed a proposed amendment to the legislation introducing the excise amendments in the Senate. We now know that difficulty arose from the manner in which these excise duties were to be introduced and, without going into the technicalities of these, the proposals to amend the beer excise were finally introduced in June last year to commence on 1 July. This put hotel owners in a position of having to collect the excise, which they did, from 1 July last year, while knowing all the time that both Labor and the Democrats had signalled an intention to oppose the changes when the relevant excise tariff amendment bill would be debated in the Senate.
The brewers announced that they would pay the higher excise under protest, and major brewers, including Lion Nathan and Fosters Brewing Group, signalled an intention to challenge the collection of the excise in the Federal Court. By January 2001, it was reported that major brewers had lodged statements of claim against the federal government seeking a return of the disputed beer excise and that they were working on plans either to refund the tax to drinkers—possibly through price reductions—or to give it to charities. In February, the brewing industry announced results of a survey that they had conducted in which 75 per cent of drinkers voted to put any excise refund towards alcohol related medical research or remedial programs or charities, rather than to lower the price of beer.
The Australian Associated Brewers then stated that it intended to use any refund from the government to establish the Beer Drinkers Foundation, which would be the biggest charitable foundation in the country, with well over $100 million to invest. On 3 April 2001, in the midst of the prolonged debate in the Senate over the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001, the government announced it had reached another agreement with the Democrats to prospectively reduce the excise rate on draught beer to no more than a 1.9 per cent increase. The Democrats agreed to legislation that would validate the excise collected on draught beer from 1 July 2000 to 3 April 2001 and to allocate most of the amount collected in excess of the new reduced excise rate to establish a new independent foundation, to be known as the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. The Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia and the Australian Medical Association have welcomed the establishment of this foundation but are still calling for further commitment to an integrated strategy for the prevention and treatment of drug related problems, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. 
It is no secret that problem drinking and the use of other licit drug substances, apart from the obvious health impacts on the user, are major causes of social and economic problems in Australia today. Sadly, these effects are seen all too often in my electorate of the Northern Territory. I want to take the opportunity this afternoon to spend some time considering the scope of the problem in the electorate of the Northern Territory and, along the way, hopefully dispel some of the myths and stereotypes about alcohol consumption in the Northern Territory. For example, many Australians believe that alcohol abuse is endemic throughout the Aboriginal community; but, in fact, in comparison with non-indigenous Australians, a far larger proportion of Aboriginal people abstain from alcohol. One of the reasons for this myth is that public intoxication is simply more visible where Aboriginal people are concerned.
One of the major cultural differences apparent to visitors to the Northern Territory is that Aboriginal Territorians drink in public spaces. For non-indigenous Territorians, such drinking is largely restricted to hotels, restaurants and homes. Consequently, a lot of drinking and subsequent intoxication in the non-indigenous community occurs in a lot more privacy, such as their homes. By contrast, Aboriginal Territorians frequently choose to drink in public places, such as parks and reserves. For this reason, intoxicated indigenous people are more visible more often than non-indigenous people, who tend to prefer to drink in the confines of their homes.
It is also a fact that among indigenous Australians those who do drink are more likely to do so in a harmful way, with binge drinking a common factor. On a national level, the proportion of consumers who drink at harmful levels is 13 per cent, while the level among Aboriginal drinkers is 68 per cent. This means that, according to standards for harmful drinking set by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the level of harmful drinking in the indigenous community is over five times more than that of all alcohol consumers. While addressing this level of harmful drinking seems a daunting task, we know that in the Northern Territory much good work has already been done. A wide range of strategies has been used to deal with alcohol issues, including important community based initiatives like the Thirsty Thursday initiative in Tennant Creek. In 1996, the licences of Tennant Creek hotels and takeaway outlets were amended to close these facilities on Thursdays and to prohibit the sale of wine casks larger than two litres. This initiative, which had the support of most of the Tennant Creek community, reduced the consumption of pure alcohol by almost 20 per cent and also reduced the level of alcohol related violence. This initiative also has important economic benefits for families of those who drink at harmful levels, with families able to buy food and clothing and to meet rent payments and other expenses when payday comes around.
It also must be recognised that a lot of good results came from the Northern Territory's Living with Alcohol program. Through this program, the number of road deaths and injuries as well as alcohol related hospitalisations was substantially reduced through the introduction of a levy on all drinks with an alcohol content over three per cent. Over a five-year period, we saw the program reduce the level of harmful drinking in the Northern Territory by one-third. The program provided an additional $4 million a year into community programs and activities, with recipients including treatment and care facilities, sports and recreation clubs, schools and Aboriginal communities. But sadly, since the levy was dropped as a result of the successful High Court challenge to its validity by—and I cannot help but say this today—the now probably diminished CLP—that is, the Northern Territory government up until last Friday; but more on this later—this funding has not been replaced, and the fight against harmful alcohol use has suffered accordingly. 
In this context, it is pertinent to examine the resourcing of sobering-up shelters, which have been put in place with the collaboration and support of local communities—an essential part of dealing with alcohol and related problems in the Territory. These shelters have been another important response to address the problem of alcohol abuse. It is well recognised that night patrols and sobering-up shelters are important harm minimisation strategies, and for this reason any diminution of their capacity or their funding is a cause for concern. Only this year I learned that, for the lack of $40,000, the Alice Springs sobering-up shelter was forced to close its doors for one day a week. This might sound insignificant until you understand the consequences of a 24-hour closure every week over a one-year period. In short, as a consequence of closing for a day per week, the number of people admitted to the sobering-up shelter dropped by 726 compared with the number for the equivalent period in the year previously. In the same period—that is, the 24-hour closure period over 10 months—the Alice Springs police made a total of 1,065 apprehensions without arrest. The Drug and Alcohol Services Association in Alice Springs estimates that in this same period almost 800 of these individuals would have been accommodated in the sobering-up shelter had it been open at the time.
There can be no question that we face significant challenges in addressing both the abuse of alcohol and other drugs and especially the social and economic impacts of it on those who are around people with a substance abuse problem. Neither can we deny that the magnitude of these impacts in relation to alcohol, petrol sniffing or the use of kava, as we have seen in the Northern Territory, is deeply felt by indigenous communities. For this reason, while I am pleased to see that there is some targeting of funds to Aboriginal programs, I am not happy about the framework of the way in which these funds have been allocated. The memorandum of understanding between the government and the Democrats merely talks about 20 per cent of the funds going to `projects targeting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people'. 
There are two other problems with the memorandum of understanding. Firstly, it commits the apportioning of expenditure only to the first of four years. This means that we could potentially see as little as $2 million of the first year's $10 million being allocated to indigenous programs. The other issue is that the effectiveness of indigenous programs depends upon consultation with and the involvement of communities at all levels. While we in the Labor Party support the notion of using evidence based programs, it will be equally important to the success of any program that decisions about allocating funds take into account the unique circumstances—and they are indeed unique circumstances—of each community.
We welcome the inclusion in the foundation of members from the Northern Territory—two, if my memory serves me correctly. Local knowledge and experience are important. But we also believe that the foundation needs a local indigenous representative with contacts in relevant agencies, particularly agencies run by and for indigenous people. In the context of meaningful decision making about allocating funds to organisations in the Northern Territory, this is vital.
There are, of course, some concerns with the administrative arrangements of the foundation. Under this bill, we have set up an account before we know how it is going to be spent. A constitution is yet to be developed or approved for this foundation, and there is as yet no agreement between the department and the foundation on specifically how these funds will be spent. 
My colleague Bob McMullan expressed his disappointment that the objects of the foundation did not include domestic violence. I would like to take this opportunity to advise the Senate why this is considered such a grave omission by those of us on this side of the chamber and, particularly, by those of us who come from the Northern Territory and represent those constituents. In the period from June 1998 to June 1999, a total of 2,522 incidents of domestic violence were reported to 28 government and non-government agencies that collect data in the Northern Territory. Ninety-nine per cent of the victims of these reported incidents were female, and 42 per cent of these incidents involved children being exposed to the violence. The 1998-99 statistics tell us that 79 per cent of offenders were affected by alcohol or other drugs at the time of the incident. These figures demonstrate a very strong association between reported domestic violence, particularly against women in our community, and substance abuse. In fact, the association is even more striking when the offenders are distinguished by the language that they speak. For offenders whose main language is an indigenous Australian language, alcohol or other drugs are involved in 90 per cent of the reported family violence incidents. 
The Senate should be aware that my colleague Mr McMullan, the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, has called for the bill before us to include funding for domestic violence programs. On the basis of the figures I have just presented, I hope that the government will understand how concerned people, particularly in the Northern Territory, are to ensure that domestic violence programs will be deemed eligible by the foundation when it considers applications for funding. It cannot be emphasised strongly enough that effective efforts to deal with substance abuse can potentially reap enormous social benefits for families affected by this. For example, children who suffer poverty and malnutrition because of the alcohol abuse of a parent suffer greatly reduced educational outcomes. Turning this around can significantly affect the future of these children.
In conclusion, I hope that the arrangements for the foundation that is established ensure that at least 20 per cent of the funding goes to Aboriginal programs, that these programs are not required to be alcohol or drug specific and that they can include family violence, and I hope that the foundation ensures community consultation and the involvement of Aboriginal people in determining where the money goes.

—It's the first time you've worried about that.
—No, I am genuinely concerned.
—I will answer the question, Madam President.
—Here comes Senator Vanstone. My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services. Is the minister aware of a major report by the research consultancy group Labour Market Alternatives, released last week, which compares the effects in northern and western Sydney of the Howard government's $850 million cuts to child-care funding? How does the minister respond to the report's finding that between 1997 and 2000 an estimated 1,547 women in Western Sydney were forced out of work or prevented from seeking work as a direct result of the coalition's cuts to child care? Isn't this clear evidence that the Howard government's child-care cuts have had the greatest impact on lower income families and increased the gap between rich and poor?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child-care Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I ask a supplementary question, Madam President. It would appear to me that Senator Vanstone is blaming the messenger, but I would like to continue asking her to make some comments on the report. Is the minister also aware of the report's finding that, whilst women's labour market participation fell in Western Sydney between 1997 and 2000, the participation rate rose in northern Sydney? Is the minister aware that Labour Market Alternatives found that in the same period five long day care centres closed in the west and none in the north, even though you are blaming the messenger? Is this not more proof that this government's policy of reducing access to quality child care has forced many women on low incomes out of the work force and forced the closure of child-care centres in Western Sydney?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child-care Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question

I have not seen it myself and, therefore, I have not read it all. I am also aware that there are some problems associated with the report. I am aware of the remarks that the New South Wales minister has made, or provided to Senator Evans, I think, who made a press release in relation to this matter. I just say, in relation to the New South Wales government, that between 1996-97 and 1999-2000 in real terms Commonwealth support has dramatically increased in funding for preschools in this area, whereas expenditure by the New South Wales government in fact decreased by nine per cent. I thought it was a little unusual that Minister Lo Po would enter into that debate. 
The report claims that five centres closed in the Fairfield-Liverpool area and none in lower north Sydney. It is actually completely misleading: it does not take account of centre openings and is only referring to closures in community based services. Between 1996 and 2000, more long day care centres opened than closed in both the Fairfield-Liverpool area and in lower north Sydney. The methodology has some problems that I think should be drawn to the senator's attention. The survey was unrepresentative of the Fairfield-Liverpool and lower north Sydney areas. It was sent to 163 centres, with only one-third of them responding. It makes the claim that there is reduced labour force participation because of changes to child care. That is simply not proven—the participation statistics reported in the press are for all women in the labour force, not women with children under 12—and it does not, of course, take account of wider economic changes. There are, in fact, more people in the Fairfield-Liverpool area getting child assistance.
I think the important thing to go to though is the allegation that we have cut child care. Claims that the Commonwealth government have cut child care are worse than misleading. Expenditure is higher now than under Labor. We spent more than $4.3 billion in the last four years, over 30 per cent more in real terms than Labor in its last four years. They are the facts of the matter. We are spending more in real terms in our four years than the senator's colleagues spent when they were in government. Real funding on child care is increasing. There are more families getting assistance and there are more children in child care as a consequence. This is the most female friendly government Australia has ever seen. I see people over on the other side smirking, because they do not like that idea, but the facts are that far from driving women back into the kitchen, which is what the senator's colleagues said we wanted to do, there are now more women working, the unemployment rate for women is down, the participation rate for women is up and our contribution to child care has played a significant part in that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child-care Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-08-20,"—I covered methodology problems in my first answer. I just draw your attention to that. It was sent to 163 centres, and only a third responded. I covered the comments about labour force participation in my first answer, but the senator does go back to the question of the report focusing on centres closing, and I noticed that the newspapers that were given this report have without question published those findings, without coming back to the government and saying, `Is that true?'

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-08-20,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services. Is the minister aware that, according to the recent ACOSS report on breaching, 17,703 people received third activity test breaches between September 2000 and February 2001, which is a 160 per cent increase on the previous year? Can the minister confirm that these individuals receive no payment for eight weeks? Aren't people less likely to find jobs and more likely to become homeless as a direct result of this breaching policy, perpetuating the poverty cycle that the minister has so often spoken of wanting to address?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Welfare Entitlements</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-08-20,"—Madam President, that leads me to my supplementary question. I hope that that gentleman in the gallery was not one of your people who had in fact breached their third activity test. Isn't the minister's claim that people can access clean slate provisions if they start a Work for the Dole placement a deliberate mistruth, given that your department has admitted in the Senate estimates hearings that people have been refused clean slates because there are not enough Work for the Dole places in many regions?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Welfare Entitlements</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-08-20,"—I thank the senator for her question. It is another timely question which gives me the opportunity to make some points that need to be made. Regarding the question you raise in relation to breaching, and in particular the ACOSS report, I simply say that there are some factual errors in the ACOSS report but none that I want to particularly highlight. I think the issue that they have raised is important. We do not deny at all that there has been an increase in breaching. We say that the previous government was lax in this area and simply did not do enough. We implemented some reforms that we believe have been a dramatic improvement in the policy of breaching. Those reforms basically come down to `three strikes and you are out', as opposed to there being no staged process towards a breach. I think unemployed people are better off under this system where there is a staged process. 
I also make the point that some surveys have been done to ascertain the support for breaching. It may interest you to note that there is significant support for the system amongst people who have been breached on the welfare system. So it is not just people outside the welfare system saying, `Yes, if the rules are broken, people should be breached,' but people who have in fact been breached themselves also show a significant level of support for this process. The impression that some are trying to create is that Centrelink simply breaches people willy-nilly for almost anything, and that is not the case.
I attended my first Centrelink board meeting early this year and Sue Vardon, the chief executive officer of Centrelink, and I had a discussion about those people who are being breached who are at risk, about whom we would all be concerned. I am talking about people who perhaps have some sort of mental disability or who are homeless or who have some other particular problem. These people are not easy to handle for Centrelink, and I will give you some examples. If someone says that the letter did not arrive— and let us just assume that the letter did not arrive— and they are not on the phone they are not easy to contact.
An incident having occurred in the gallery—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! The Senate will come to order!
—Senator, just to continue on this issue, the question of when to breach someone who is a welfare recipient is not a new question. It is a question that welfare agencies around the world constantly have to deal with. The difference between your government when it was in power and this government is that we do want to make sure that those people who are entitled to welfare get every penny they are entitled to—but not a penny more. We also want to ensure that people live up to the commitments and expectations that are there. We think it is reasonable that someone keeps an appointment that has been made with Centrelink.
Senator, you need to understand, with great respect, that the people who most strongly are concerned about the welfare system are not the high income earners but the people who are on very low incomes, for whom the advantage of working over being on a benefit is not as substantial as it is, for example, for you. What they say to me is, `I work 37½ hours for my salary, and I think it is fair enough that you expect someone on welfare to do everything you ask them to do.' If they have got good reason, they are not breached. Finally, people can of course have their breaching record wiped clean by going on Work for the Dole.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Welfare Entitlements</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-08-20,"—I will have a look at the Senate estimates. There may be some areas where there should be more Work for the Dole, and I would hope that means that you will support an expansion of those places so that there are more places available.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2001-08-20,"— Senator Schacht asked me a question in the last sitting week about letters being sent from the Departmentof Veterans' Affairs. I seek leave to incorporate a response in Hansard. 
Leave granted. 
The answer read as follows—
SENATOR SCHACHT asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 9 August 2001.
Why are Australian veterans, many of whom are elderly and sick, receiving letters that state `limited resources' are causing delays in the processing of their claims?
The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:
In any claims processing system there is a time-lag between receipt of a claim and its finalisation. This is influenced by a number of factors including the priority allocated to the claim, fluctuations in workload, the complexity and completeness of the information supplied and whether there is a need to seek further information to enable the claim to be determined.
In recognition of these factors, all State Offices of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) send letters letting veterans and their families know that compensation claims processing can be a lengthy and complex process, and that to ensure fairness, priorities are set in order of need. DVA has a service charter that sets out a time within which it is expected that claims will be completed and meets this standard for the majority of its claims.
The wording quoted by Senator Schacht is in the letter sent by the Western Australia State Office since 1998 as it's standard response to compensation claims. It has been used for all cases except cancer or death claims, which are elevated in priority. The letter was introduced at a time when there was a significant backlog of claims in the office. However, the average time taken by the Western Australia State Office to process compensation claims for 2000/2001 is only one day over the national service standard and the letter will no longer be used.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Veterans: Delays in Processing of Claims</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's response.
I suppose I should be grateful that the minister did not try to provide a serious answer to what is an important issue because there can be no excuse for what has occurred in relation to these questions. I would, however, place on the record that these particular questions have been drawn to the attention of Senator Hill and the government quite regularly, as has the general issue of unanswered questions on notice. These questions were placed on the Senate Notice Paper some 13 months ago, as I mentioned. In fact, I was being too generous when I said 362 days ago. I have just added it up again and I think it was 392 days ago. You have to ask, Madam President, what is so special about these questions that they have been left for over a year unanswered and why the Prime Minister is so reticent to provide any answer at all.
You may be aware, Madam President, that these questions are listed on the Notice Paper under the headings `Administration: Kirribilli House' and `The Lodge: Renovations, Restorations and Repairs'. I suspect that that really does go to the nub of the matter because we have touched on, in these questions, some issues that are apparently sensitive to the government and to the Prime Minister. They go to trying to establish how profligate the Prime Minister may have been in relation to his own comforts and the excesses of the refurbishment process undertaken at Kirribilli House, in particular, while Mr Howard has been the Prime Minister. Truthful and accurate answers to these questions would elicit full details on just how much has been spent over the past five years on moving a staircase and building another one at Kirribilli just to keep staff separated. We would also know the full glory of exactly how much money was spent on knocking out a wall of the dining room at Kirribilli simply to accommodate a large antique 20-seat dining table and the horsehair covered chairs that go with it, some of which were made to go with it. 
We would also know the full cost of the period refurbishment of the reception rooms at the Lodge, which is a prime ministerial residence that, as you would be aware, Madam President, is rarely used by the Prime Minister because he prefers the Sydney residence, Kirribilli House. If these questions were answered, we could get information in a format that would allow us to directly compare the costs for these particular residences under Mr Howard with the costs when Mr Keating was Prime Minister. If these questions were answered, we would have comprehensive figures that would allow an `apples with apples' comparison. That is what we are after in relation to this matter. That is what the Prime Minister and the government do not want to provide. I think that is because these questions would simply show up the current Prime Minister's excesses in this area.
You would be aware, Madam President, that the current Prime Minister has attempted to make political mileage out of comparisons between himself and his predecessor. He has done so on specific costs for Kirribilli House and the Lodge, but it has always been on the basis of what I would describe as `apples and oranges' comparisons. That is why these questions are so important. The Prime Minister—or those that prepare the answers to questions that have been asked—has always chosen the cost figures that have been used, and we all know how statistics and figures can be manipulated if you are selective about the figures that are included. 
There are a number of questions on notice from estimates committees dealing with aspects related to the costs of Kirribilli House and the Lodge, which have been asked by both Senator Ray and me. We have been seeking answers regarding those issues for some considerable time, dating back again well over a year. Again, we have got a situation where these answers are held up. I suspect it is for the same reason. To say they are being held up is generous. I think it is more likely that it is a cover-up of details of excessive expenditure—and this is of taxpayers' money of course—by the Prime Minister on these official residences.
We cannot have these answers in over a year, but this is at the same time that the Prime Minister's department found time to write an extraordinary defence of the Prime Minister's spending as a devoted chapter in last year's departmental annual report—six pages, which somehow failed to mention at all a cabinet decision that Kirribilli House was to be used primarily for guest-of-government purposes. All the time in the world can go to preparing a chapter in the Prime Minister's department's annual report, but you cannot answer these questions. We have got to ask again why so much time and effort was spent on that defensive chapter in an annual report and there is no inclination to answer questions on notice that have been around now for over a year.
This is a growing pattern. Senator O'Brien drew attention in the last sitting week to questions that he has asked and, because time is short before the election, it is the opposition's intention to draw attention to these matters if they arise. This is the same Prime Minister who was so sanctimonious for so long about raising the standards of parliament. All that self-righteous indignation about parliamentary accountability is proven to be nothing when the government finds itself in office. We have got questions on notice left on the Notice Paper for almost 400 days, simply because accurate answers would embarrass both the Prime Minister and the government.
We do, of course, have the opportunity in the Senate to address these issues and I am taking advantage of that opportunity under the provisions of the Senate standing orders now to address the issue of the absolute lack of standards in parliamentary accountability that have been followed by this government. I have heard Senator Hill's pathetic explanation—I am trying to be generous here—in trying to defend the indefensible. I would remind Senator Hill of his own words when I raised these grossly overdue questions on the costs of Kirribilli House and the Lodge during estimates committee hearings earlier this year. Senator Hill at that time said that these questions had remained unanswered for an unacceptably long time and he generously accepted personal responsibility for following the answers up with the Prime Minister's office. I do not really know who to blame, Madam President— 
—He has the same success rate in cabinet, I understand.
—I know that he is not flavour of the month around there with the Prime Minister and his office but, given that he wanted to accept personal responsibility, as far as I am concerned he can have it. What action have we seen since that generous offer from Senator Hill on 28 May? Nothing, of course. Absolutely nothing has occurred and, as I say, it is probably an indication of the level of influence that Senator Hill has with the Prime Minister's office. But Senator Hill would be aware that comparisons are drawn on these matters between Mr Howard's performance and that of his predecessor, Mr Keating.
I will conclude my remarks so as not to delay the Senate any longer on this important matter. I remind Senator Hill that, if he would care to check the parliamentary debates database, he will find these words that he himself uttered on 9 May 1995. Senator Hill said: 
If this Senate is going to have any authority at all and if there is ever going to be any executive responsibility to the parliament, this Senate has to enforce its provisions. It has to require the minister to answer questions. There is no point at all in having a process for putting questions on notice if the minister is simply going to refuse to answer them.... One suspects, of course, that he does not want to answer these questions until after the next election. One, therefore, has to ask the question: what is the government seeking to hide in this matter?
Rule out Senator Hill, replace Senator Hill's name with mine, update those comments from 9 May 1995 to 20 August 2001, and I think I would be comfortable making the same comment. More importantly, when these words are drawn to Senator Hill's attention, I hope he will take heed of those sentiments, I hope he will take heed of those words, and I hope he will seriously now undertake—not like the commitment that was given in May this year—a real commitment to provide the Senate with answers to important questions that have not been provided in over a year.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-08-20,"—Perhaps I did not take the issue seriously and perhaps that relates to the fact that Senator Faulkner asks many petty questions relating to expenditure of the Prime Minister's department in relation to official residences. I have had to sit through literally hours of these questions in estimates committees about nonsense about additional costs relating to the relocation of the staircase, which was primarily done for safety reasons, about how many bottles of wine are being served to official guests, from which state those wines originate, what the cost of each bottle was and whether advice was sought on the cost of each bottle and the like. With that background, it is not surprising that the Prime Minister has put other matters ahead of this in priority. 
If, on the other hand, I was to take the matter seriously, perhaps I would have to accuse Senator Faulkner of double standards. When Mr Keating was in the Lodge and questions of a similar nature were asked of him, what was his response? He was not prepared to provide that information. For example, when he was asked about expenditure on two Austral Ezyhide Extend-A-Lines that were installed with a specially fabricated steel support frame, his answer to the question on notice was:
I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of resources and effort that would be involved in extracting the considerable detail requested by the honourable member.
When Mr Keating was asked similar questions relating to the extra expenditure on new clothes lines at the Lodge which were totally unnecessary—we all know he was a very interventionist Prime Minister— he was not prepared to authorise the effort to provide such an answer. It is tit for tat, but I am not prepared to come in here and say that Senator Faulkner is not entitled to an answer to the questions. What I have said is that, in the order of priority, it is reasonable for the Prime Minister to have put other matters first. Nevertheless, I will refer the matter again to his office in view of the fact that it is causing Senator Faulkner such serious anxiety, and we will see what the response is.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today. 
I think it is important to highlight the double standards applied by the minister. It was interesting that the minister was about three minutes late for question time today. She has been late before. I understand that sometimes ministers get held up. That is perfectly natural. But let us, for argument's sake, say that this was the third occasion on which she was late for question time. On the same basis that she applies to unemployed persons—people who are on Jobstart— in this country, she would be fined $24,000 today for her failure to attend question time on time. That is the third occasion, for argument's sake, on which she has failed to attend question time on time. It is her third offence and, under the government's regime, she would be penalised eight weeks worth of income support. I understand that the minister is on about $3,000 a week. She would be penalised $24,000 for her failure to attend question time on time. 
I think most people in this country would say, `Gee, that is a bit harsh to fine someone $24,000, even on a minister's salary, for being late for an appointment, for being late for question time. That would be a harsh penalty regime and not supported by the severity of the failure to attend.' But that is the very regime that she sought to defend today for some of the most vulnerable people with the least resources in our community. People who are homeless, people who are on disability pensions, people who are struggling to survive in our community and who are in receipt of income support allowances have been penalised up to eight weeks of their income support payments because of their failure to attend an interview. Many of these people, it turns out, failed to attend their interview because they did not get the letter—if you are homeless, you often find access to a letterbox a bit difficult—but also for a range of other reasons. Many have mental or intellectual disabilities which perhaps prevent them from responding appropriately to written correspondence. 
All of these issues have been detailed, but the minister comes in here today and attempts to defend this regime. We know that under this government, as part of a deliberate policy, there has been a 189 per cent increase in the breaching of people on benefits—a 189 per cent increase over the last three years. They have been out there applying a very discriminatory policy on those least able to cope in our community—penalising them, removing their benefits in a very harsh regime. These people have been losing from about $700 to $1,400 as a result of this penalty regime. Now, $700 to $1,400 may not seem like a very large amount to Senator Vanstone or to anyone in this chamber, but for these people it is their only income for up to eight weeks. From the charitable organisations that support these people when they are breached, we know that people are going without food, people are being evicted from their houses and people have been forced to steal because of the poverty that they are forced into by this breaching regime. 
It is not at all clear to me what the government are saying about this, because this information only came to light after ACOSS were able to get it through the Freedom of Information Act. The government took no interest in this matter until then. Now they are saying that they are sort of going to have an inquiry. They think it is fair that people be held to account but they are also going to have an inquiry: it is the `tough cop, soft cop' option that Senator Vanstone and Mr Anthony are playing. It is not quite clear. They seem to have one message for the 7.30 Report about reviewing the policy and responding to ACOSS's concerns, but to another audience there seems to be the `we're tough on the dole bludgers' rhetoric. 
What we do know is that, as a result of this breaching regime, people are suffering. People, through no fault of their own, are being forced into poverty and homelessness because of the pressures applied by a breaching regime that is out of control, that is cutting off people's access to benefits and forcing them into very desperate circumstances. I used the example of what it would mean for Senator Vanstone if we applied the same sort of policy. It has clearly got way out of control. It has been driven by government policy. What I want to hear from the government is what they are going to do about it. Are they going to continue to commit to this breaching policy, or will it be fixed? Clearly, it is having very adverse effects on some of the most vulnerable: the homeless and those with mental and intellectual disabilities. People are being hurt. These are real people who are really suffering, who are going without food and going without basic services as a result of these measures.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-08-20,"—Today the debate is a little bit rich, I think. Here is the Labor Party getting up and preaching about breaching and how onerous the tasks are. Under the Labor government, any breach resulted in a non-payment period. How hypocritical is this debate today. Any breach under the Labor government resulted in a non-payment period. Now a non-payment period is imposed only if a person breaches the activity test three times in two years, and yet the Labor Party policy was `one strike and you're out'. How hypocritical is it to come in here and cry foul now. Also, how hypocritical is it to come in here and say that the system is tough. The requirements are not onerous—let us face it: the overwhelming majority of job seekers meet them without difficulty. 
Why are the Labor Party creating a problem with this one, when their own policy was to cut people off immediately they breached? The policy now is `three breaches in two years'. Eighty per cent of people comply with the system. The requirements are simply to turn up to appointments with Centrelink or the providers—one would say that that is fairly reasonable; to declare earnings from work—most would say that that is fairly reasonable; and to accept job offers—most would say that that is fairly reasonable. I talk about most people agreeing with that, and there is strong community support for breaching penalties. People are saying, `Why should my taxes be going to someone who is not turning up to Centrelink for employment, who is not turning up to the providers, who is not declaring their income or who does not accept job offers?' But, interestingly enough, most of the job seekers—a la 78 per cent of the job seekers—support breaching those who do not meet activity test requirements without good reason. Even 69 per cent of those who have been breached support breaches. Isn't that interesting: those who are involved in the system support what is currently in place and yet the Labor Party do not. One might ask: what is it that the Labor Party would plan to do if ever the country was unlucky enough to have a Labor government in the near future?
—Put people out of work like they did last time.
—That is right, Senator Calvert: we have to remember that the last time they were in government they had over a million people out of work and yet they cut their support off immediately they breached. That is why this whole debate today is so hypocritical. The way in which the media reported it is even worse, because they make no reference whatsoever to what Labor did when they were in office and they make no reference whatsoever to the high rates of unemployment that were in existence when the Labor Party were in government.
There are safeguards in place to address the circumstances of the most disadvantaged. One would think that there were no such safeguards, listening to the dishonest bleating from the Labor Party. Before a breach penalty is imposed, job seekers have an opportunity to explain why they could not comply. They have access to an appeal and review mechanism. Around one in seven job seekers are exempted from activity tests for illness, personal crisis, homelessness, bereavement or for being in remote areas and the like. Yet the Labor Party are saying that there are no such safeguards in place.
The hardest thing is to get people to tell us about the problems that they are having—problems like drug abuse, homelessness and so forth. If the system is not informed, the system cannot help them. What I would like to hear from subsequent Labor speakers is why, when they had in government a `one breach and you're out' policy, they are now challenging a system with a whole lot of safeguard clauses that restricts non-payment to three breaches over two years. It is quite dishonest to say that this is a very tough system on people who know their responsibilities to the other taxpayers in this country. It is a joint responsibility; it is not a singular responsibility.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I rise to take note of the answer from Minister Vanstone this afternoon, reminding the Senate, of course, that the minister was late to get question time under way. Senator Knowles has talked about hypocrisy. Let me just remind the Senate that last year, when Senator Newman was the minister for this portfolio, she said that only a small number of those receiving unemployment benefits would ever reach the stage of being cut off altogether. Yet we have seen from the release of the ACOSS report that 17,703 people have in fact received the third activity test breach between September 2000 and February 2001. So, in only a six-month period—a small window of opportunity—there has been a 160 per cent increase on the previous year. A matter that I also addressed to the minister went to the diminishing number of Work for the Dole places in many regions, but I will get to that in a minute.
When an unemployed person breaches their requirements under this act for the third time, there is an eight-week penalty, which amounts to $1,431. How does this government expect those people who will no longer receive unemployment benefits such as the Newstart allowance to actually keep up their rent payments and to buy food and to undertake the activities they will need to undertake to go about looking for a job—finding a bus fare, a train fare, getting on the telephone, actually undertaking the day-to-day activities you need to undertake in order to search for a job?
What kind of people are we talking about who are affected by this? We are talking about those people who have low literacy and numeracy standards, who may not even be able to understand the letters and the requirements that come through the mail asking them to front up for these appointments. We are talking about those people who may suffer with a mental illness. We are talking about indigenous Australians. We are talking about those people who are homeless or may be affected by any drug or alcohol reliance problems. They are mainly those people who are young in our community. `Do not worry', says Senator Knowles, `if you get this please explain letter or, worse than that, if you actually get cut off and do not receive this entitlement, you do have an opportunity to explain to Centrelink what has happened or you have access to a review.' These are people who, if they have actually breached the activity test for the third time, are probably feeling very disempowered, have low self-esteem and need intensive assistance to help them on the path of finding employment; they do not have the skills to be able to explain what is happening or to access a review. So, all up, we have a system which is actually failing these people.
It is interesting that a press release put out by ACOSS last Monday says this:
These findings—
that is, the findings showing the increase in the number of people who have been penalised for breaching the activity test—
contradict the government assurances that social security penalties are only used as a last resort. They confirm the experience of many welfare agencies who are experiencing a wave of demand for crisis help from individuals and families whose social security payments have been reduced or stopped in this instance.
That is what is happening under this regime, under this federal government. The cost of having to help these people is shifting onto the families and onto the welfare agencies, who are experiencing an increase in demand for their resources and for their services and payments. ACOSS go on to say that there is substantial evidence that, instead of the most disadvantaged job seekers being protected from harsh penalties, they are in fact being let down by this government, which is not assisting them.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2001-08-20,"—During question time earlier today, Senator Faulkner rose to raise a point of order when Senator Alston was answering a question from Senator Collins. The point of order he wanted to raise was, as one of his cohort behind him shouted out in case Senator Faulkner forgot, on the issue of relevance, even though the minister was then only 30 seconds into his answer. Madam President then quite rightly ruled Senator Faulkner out of order, but we should be grateful to Senator Faulkner for focusing our attention on the issue of relevance because relevance is the first thing that opposition senators should consider when it comes to question time. Question time, as we know, is the time when the executive government is given the opportunity to give account to the parliament. 
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would like to know what relevance this contribution has for us at the moment. Is the senator speaking to the question or not? It does not seem to me that he is.
—I was going to remind Senator Tchen that he is already a minute into his speech and that the questions that are being taken note of today are the answers that were given by Senator Vanstone in relation to breaching, and I hope that you can tie that into the important issue you are discussing of relevance.
—I am sure I can satisfy you on that, Madam Deputy President, because, as I was saying, question time is an important time for the executive government to give account to the parliament for how they are managing national affairs, and it is a time when important factual information about the state of the nation should be sought and provided. Yet, day in and day out, Labor Party senators come into this chamber armed with rumours, innuendos, urban myths, misunderstandings, half-truths and sometimes straight-out lies, trying to draw a web of deceit to ensnare and frighten the vulnerable and concerned members of our community. How is this practice relevant to good parliamentary practice? How is this behaviour relevant to the responsibility this Senate has to the electors?
—Senator Tchen, are you going to relate this to the minister's answers in some way?
—Yes, Madam Deputy President. Today, the opposition have taken up the issue of fairness—the issue of imposing penalties on people who have repeatedly breached social security support payment conditions. The ostensible complaint by opposition senators is that there has been a 160 per cent increase in breaching.
—It is 189 per cent actually.
—A 189 per cent increase, and that therefore it is a regime which is out of control and people are suffering, as Senator Evans said. One of the first points we need to make is that anything coming from a low base is going to have a high rate of increase. The question we should ask is whether the previous regime was too easy in letting people who should be responsible for their obligations get away with it. What a—if I may use the word—lousy job the previous government has done in policing the system when they were in power for 13 years.
It is totally reasonable for the community to expect people to meet obligations in exchange for support from the community and it is totally reasonable to apply sanctions to those who refuse to comply. Do I hear opposition senators object to that? No. If we do apply sanctions, we have to look at the situation of breaching. The issue here is that the requirements that this government now has in place are not onerous. Overwhelmingly, the majority of job seekers meet the requirements without difficulties. Can I point out that breaching occurs when there is non-attendance—not through lateness, not when there is a reasonable excuse, but through non-attendance, non-respondence.
According to Centrelink information, more than 80 per cent of job seekers do not breach. Only 2.2 per cent of 1.28 million people who received unemployment payments in the last financial year served non-payment periods because they incurred three breaches. Senator Knowles pointed out that the previous Labor government's policy was `one breach and you are out', whereas under the current regime the policy is warnings and breaching. Furthermore, lots of things are under way to improve matters. The government is well aware that the system needs to be adjusted to make sure that no-one is unfairly disadvantaged. There is now a system in place where Centrelink has introduced a third breach alert to advise social workers—occupational psychologists— before the third breach applies, and a warning pilot program is in place.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Vanstone today. My colleagues have pointed out the number of penalties that have been imposed on people for breaching. The number that I have is 349,100 penalties. The consequences of what happens to people when they are breached—from $700 to $1,400— and how they manage to survive, are very dire indeed.
My colleagues have pointed out most things that I was going to point out, so I would like to turn to a report in Queensland. This was reported in the Sunshine Coast Daily this morning and it is about Mr Brian Smith, who lives at Bokarina. Mr Smith is a former Centrelink worker who had his mature age allowance cancelled, not once but twice, and on both occasions it was through no fault of his own. Mr Smith's health care card and a mature age allowance of $200 per month, which he depends on for five medical prescriptions, was cancelled because, according to a letter to him from Centrelink, he had failed to return his six-monthly review by 7 August, as was requested.
As I said, Mr Smith was a former Centrelink employee. He was a Centrelink employee for more than eight years, so he has eight years experience of dealing with other people. Consequently, Mr Smith was fully aware of his obligations and recognised the importance of returning the form on time. Mr Smith had in fact returned the form early. He returned the form on 30 July, but the system had obviously failed Mr Smith and his benefit was cancelled. So although he did the right thing and returned the form early, somehow the system went hopelessly wrong and his benefit was cancelled. It was not until Mr Smith went to his local Centrelink office and explained his situation that a staff member realised the mistake and restored his entitlement. In the Sunshine Coast Daily, Mr Smith was reported as saying:
I was fortunate that I had a recent term deposit mature which gave me sufficient [funds] to manage for now. However, can you imagine the trauma the elderly or frail, or even the sick, would go through?
Mr Smith is 63 years old and obviously does not think that he is an elderly gentleman, but a lot of people do not have savings. As my colleagues have pointed out, a lot of people have nothing to fall back on. In its report, ACOSS found that people who are breached have to steal, have to go without food and have to do the most dreadfully undignified things to survive. That is not good enough in a country like ours.
We are a civilised society. We should be giving people dignity. If people are unemployed, they are entitled to benefits. Those of us who pay taxes do not begrudge that. We should never put people in the undignified position of having to steal food, of having to lie or of having to do dreadful things to survive. It is not on in a civilised society. ACOSS also have found cases which show that often the most vulnerable Australians are penalised because they have difficulty negotiating bureaucratic red tape. We should have workers there to help them. Imagine being homeless because you have nothing to fall back on. It is absolutely outrageous. A lot of this is through no fault of these people.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-20,"—I would like to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the answers given in question time dealing with the issue of breaching. It is a concern that I and others in the Democrats have raised in this chamber a number of times over recent months—indeed, even longer than that. As well, concerns have been raised out in the general community. It really has come to a quite significant head now. In the last week we have seen a number of reports highlighting the fact that we are really facing a crisis situation in relation to the number of people being forced into poverty by the excessive levels of breaching. A report has been released by ACOSS and the Welfare Rights Network. They are probably amongst the best qualified organisations in the community to comment on the range, the impact and the nature of breaching, and indeed on the unreasonable way in which breaches often are put upon people by Centrelink. There is any number of reports from welfare agencies which work at the grassroots level about the extreme and unreasonable implementation of breaches by Centrelink. Many of those breaches have been overturned on appeal, either internally through the review officer or through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, but in the meantime the person involved has had to undergo enormous stress and loss of income, and often these people are not in the situation of having much income to get by with. Really, our major mechanism for alleviating poverty is actually operating in a way that is generating poverty. That is clearly a ridiculous and unsatisfactory situation. 
The Democrats commend ACOSS and the other groups supporting the independent inquiry that has been established to look at this issue in an independent and non-partisan way—not just to identify the problem which I think has already been identified to a fair degree but to also identify solutions. Certainly the Democrats will be very keen to assess the findings and outcomes of that review. The opposition are quite rightly pointing to the dreadful situation at the moment, but they of course may soon be in the situation where they themselves will have the power to fix it, and the Democrats are keen to hear some firm commitments from the ALP. We want to hear that they will act to significantly reduce the number of people currently being penalised. Quite clearly there has been a huge increase in the number of people being penalised and breached by Centrelink. It cannot seriously be suggested that, in the last 12 months or three years, 189 per cent more people suddenly are not doing the right thing, suddenly are trying to cheat the system and thus are receiving welfare. That is clearly not the case. There is no evidence or any plausible suggestion that there has been a sudden massive leap in the number of people trying to rort the system, in which case clearly there is an excessive and unnecessary increase in the degree of harshness in the implementation of this so-called principle of mutual obligation by the federal government which is leading to an enormous degree of hardship out in the community. There has been any number of stories of people being forced into homelessness and losing accommodation as a consequence of being breached, again showing how absurd the situation is. A system that is set up to try to stop people falling into such situations as homelessness is actually operating in a way that forces them into it.
Just last week the Salvation Army highlighted that around 11 per cent of people have turned to crime after Centrelink cut off their welfare payments. The Melbourne Catholic Church archbishop Denis Hart said that there is a need to minimise breaches of welfare recipients as well as a need to increase the level of unemployment benefits and public housing. The Head Injury Council of Australia highlighted their concern that many people being breached are indeed sufferers of acquired brain injury and are not being properly assessed or recognised by Centrelink. Mental illness organisations also have raised similar concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Australians are clearly being forced into greater poverty and hardship as a result of inappropriate implementation of the mutual obligation principle. The Democrats are extremely concerned about it and call on the government to act immediately.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-08-20,"—I present the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services entitled Prudential supervision and consumer protection for superannuation, banking and financial services: First report, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The committee's report on prudential supervision and consumer protection of superannuation and financial services addresses the last of the terms of reference given to the committee on their establishment in October 1999 and is the committee's first report on this term of reference. The committee have been unable to present the report before now because of the large number of other inquiries, the high workload of the committee and the number of reports on bills that we have undertaken. In fact, we will be having our 100th meeting tomorrow afternoon. In the report the committee have commented at a broad level on the adequacy of Australia's current prudential regulatory framework. In particular, we considered the overall performance of APRA—the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—and ASIC, as well as various regulatory issues, including matters associated with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.
In the near future, the committee intends to table a second report which examines in greater detail five case studies we chose as examples of poor management of superannuation funds by some trustees and poor management of mortgage schemes by some solicitors. These studies illustrate why the role of the regulator is so important. We have referred in general terms to those case studies in this report. I think it is unfortunate that we were unable to present the first and the second reports concurrently because they should be read as one. The second report certainly builds very much on the first report.
In summary, the committee found that, in the wake of the major reforms arising from the Wallis inquiry in 1997, the current regulatory framework is still complex and confusing to some. More needs to be done to improve awareness of the roles of the regulators, especially to clarify the role demarcation between APRA and ASIC and to streamline the entry point for consumers by having a one-stop shop for regulatory and consumer affairs. While problems with the system of having two regulators have been identified, the committee does consider that these are not insurmountable and that a number of measures are currently being taken to address some of the issues. The committee has also found that there is scope for APRA, as the major prudential regulator, to improve its performance in some areas, especially in supervising superannuation entities. While some sectors receive top class assistance and oversight, there are some serious shortcomings in other areas, particularly in relation to the regulation of small to medium size superannuation funds.
The committee considers that there is a great deal of scope for APRA to assist trustees to perform their duties more effectively in the best interests of fund members and has made a number of recommendations in this regard. For example, the committee believes that fund members should, as a matter of course, be given more detailed information from trustees about such things as fees and charges associated with the administration of funds and remuneration of trustees, among others. The committee is also concerned that trustees, fund managers and administrators who have been convicted of fraud do not practice in business administration of superannuation again until certain conditions are met. We are also concerned to ensure that applications for financial assistance when fraud has been committed are dealt with expeditiously.
The committee considers that, generally speaking, ASIC is operating effectively. However, we do have some reservations about the timeliness and effectiveness of the regulators' enforcement activities in some areas, particularly in relation to APRA's activities. In the wake of the recent collapse of HIH and Commercial Nominees of Australia, the mismanagement by some trustees of some superannuation funds and the mismanagement by some solicitors of mortgage schemes, it must be ensured that, in the future, early warning signals are heeded and appropriate action is taken, particularly by the regulators. The adequacy of resources for both regulators must be carefully considered to ensure that they are able to carry out their duties effectively. 
During the inquiry, the committee also found a number of regulatory issues that needed to be addressed. These included the system of levies imposed on the various financial sectors to fund the prudential regulators. The committee also found that the standards of auditing need to be addressed and that there are various aspects of the SI(S) Act which we consider require clarification and further investigation. The committee believes that regulators are entitled to rely very heavily on the accounts and the audit reports of those accounts. Because of the importance of enhancing the effective supervision of superannuation funds in particular, the committee will be holding a roundtable on auditing later this week. This meeting has attracted an enormous amount of interest and we look forward to reporting the outcome to the Senate in the near future.
The committee is grateful to the many individuals and organisations which took the time to write to the committee to express their views and give evidence at the public hearings. Their cooperation and willingness to provide information to assist the committee's inquiry was much appreciated and gave refreshing insights into the many issues facing prudential regulation and consumer protection in Australia. On behalf of the committee, I would also like to record my appreciation to the secretariat for their work during the inquiry and for assisting us to produce this report. In addition to thanking previous members of the secretariat, I would also like to thank, in particular, our hardworking secretary, Miss Sue Morton, the team of research officers, especially the principal research officer, Louise Gell, and the executive assistant, Jade Ricza. Tracey Noble, Anne O'Connell and Anne Willenborg also made valuable contributions to the research work undertaken during this inquiry. Our committee has produced something like 14 reports since we commenced two years ago. I think that is a pretty high record. The committee is also grateful for the valuable assistance provided by staff of the Information and Research Services of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, especially David Kehl, and other officers of the Department of the Senate who contributed in a number of ways to the completion of this committee's report.
As chairman of the committee, I indicate that I have a great deal of confidence in the oversight and supervision of superannuation in this country. I think of late there have been some unnecessarily alarming reports from some people, some with vested interests. Our job is to highlight the problems. The system does need finetuning. It is essentially a finetuning exercise. We have indicated that the regulatory regime is in fine shape, but there are aspects that the committee would like to be addressed, and addressed in a timely manner. I believe it is essential for all responsible players within the industry to act responsibly and to make responsible statements.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-20,"—The report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services that we are considering is an important one. Why is it important? It is important because the committee has undertaken a very thorough examination of the prudential regulation of financial services in Australia. Prudential regulation includes banking, insurance, superannuation and solicitors' mortgage funds. It is particularly important because every Australian would have one of those financial products. A total of $497 billion is now invested in superannuation. Billions of dollars have been invested through solicitors' mortgage funds. It is a matter of unfortunate note that in recent times a small number of superannuation funds have experienced severe difficulty. It is also a matter of note that recently there have been a significant number of solicitors' mortgage funds where losses in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars have occurred throughout Australia. The committee carried out a specific case study of solicitors' mortgage funds in my home state of Tasmania. 
The committee carried out a year-long investigation and the report is unanimous. I think it is important to stress that the report is unanimous. The report is very critical of some aspects of regulation in this country and also goes to some important changes that should be made. Firstly, I might just refresh the Senate's memory that it is the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who presided over the creation of the current regulatory framework of financial services in Australia. He said in 1998: 
Once implemented, Australia will have a stronger regulatory regime designed to better respond to developments in the finance sector, including globalisation and technological change and the needs of businesses and consumers. Once implemented, Australia will be a world leader, with best practice, leading edge financial sector regulation. 
Unfortunately, I would have to say, as deputy chair of the committee, that the committee could not reach that conclusion. In fact, on page 7 of the report there is an interesting illustration of the old regulatory framework and the current regulatory framework. I might just hold that up for the Senate. The current Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is in the other place, Dr Kemp, has unfairly referred to Labor's Knowledge Nation as `spaghetti nation'. If you look at this diagram of our current regulatory framework in Australia, you could find no better description of the current regulation of Australia's financial industry as spaghetti regulation. In summary, it is very complex, it is disjointed, it is messy, it is unclear and it is not delivering. 
Let me go to some of the unanimous findings and recommendations of the committee report. The committee found that the current regulatory framework is complex and confusing and that there is scope for APRA, as the major prudential regulator, to improve its performance in some areas. In reference to ASIC: 
The committee has some reservations about the timeliness and effectiveness of the regulator's enforcement activities in some areas. The committee noted many examples of poor standards of stewardship by trustees, in particular through speculative, inappropriate and unsound practices and loan arrangements. The committee considers it imperative to provide certainty and clarity in the regulatory framework. There is evidence of regulators being poorly resourced and staffed inadequately. 
The committee found that the current regulatory framework was complex and confusing. We went to a number of case studies, flowing from which a second report and detailed recommendations will be handed down soon. We received over 200 submissions. The majority related to two case studies: a commercial nominees superannuation fund and solicitors' mortgage schemes. The committee also found that there was evidence of buck-passing from one regulator to another. The committee recommends that APRA improve its oversight of trustees; that APRA act more quickly when matters come to its attention; that fund annual reports identify any payments to trustees from the fund, broken down into directors' fees and other payments; and that all significant administration fees, charges and commissions paid to both fund managers and development managers be disclosed. A trustee fund manager or administrator who has been convicted of fraud should not practise again until certain conditions are met. One of these conditions might mean not practising for 15 years. Compare this to the very light-feathered touch of ASIC, when it suspended Mr Hudson in Tasmania, one of the persons caught up in the solicitors' mortgage fund scandal. He was conditionally suspended for just six months. 
The committee also found that the minister must act expediently and efficiently in making a decision under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to grant financial assistance to a fund that has suffered as a result of fraud or theft to minimise the hardship that superannuation fund members could suffer. This is a very important protection to fund members in this country. It provides, in the event of theft or fraud, for 100 per cent compensation. I might say in passing that this is the 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud that the Liberal government attempted to water down last year to some 80 per cent. On that issue I am pleased to say that again the committee unanimously concluded that the current 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud should also be maintained.  
The committee went further, though. In respect of superannuation moneys, when a person retires and collects their lump sum, it recommended that the current protections in the event of theft and fraud in the SI(S) Act be extended—this is a very important recommendation—to include an appropriate range of pension and retirement annuity products. The committee found that there were far too many examples of Australians who have retired, received a lump sum and invested that money and who are being ripped off. There was the appalling case of solicitors' mortgage funds in my home state of Tasmania. The vast majority of victims were retired Tasmanians who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases, of their retirement moneys. 
The committee further considered that, for example, the early warnings of problems with EPAS superannuation and CNA, another superannuation fund, appear to have been overlooked by the regulator. The collapse of HIH Insurance is yet another example where early warning signals seem to have been ignored by the regulator. APRA should review its approach to risk management and increase the attention it gives to the prudential supervision of superannuation entities, especially those in the small to medium sized fund environment. APRA provided the committee with a long list—a litany—of small to medium sized superannuation funds which failed to address basic regulatory requirements. We also found that ASIC's resources are stretched to the limit. This is hardly surprising, I suppose, with the recent rash of major financial collapses: HIH Insurance, One.Tel and a number of other financial institutions. So there should be a review of the resources at the disposal of ASIC and APRA.
In relation to the staffing of both APRA and ASIC, many highly skilled and qualified staff were regrettably lost when ASIC was forcibly removed by the Treasurer from Canberra to Sydney. All this has impacted on the effectiveness of the regulatory framework in Australia.
Finally, the committee believed that auditors should be genuinely independent. There are far too many examples of conflict of interest when some auditors carry out their responsibilities. Auditors are critically important for the effective regulation of our financial system. 
In concluding, this is a very important report. It is a unanimous report. It is very in depth and it has some very important recommendations. It concerns me that there is a level of complacency amongst the government—not amongst government senators, I might say, on our committee—in thinking that we have some sort of world's best practice regulation when clearly the facts do not indicate that. We have spaghetti regulation. It is complex, disjointed, messy and unclear. You have only to look at this diagram of the mess of regulation we have in respect of financial services in this country. I look forward to the implementation of the recommendations of this very important report by a future Labor government.

I think of late there have been some unnecessarily alarming reports from some people, some with vested interests. Our job is to highlight the problems. The system does need finetuning. It is essentially a finetuning exercise. We have indicated that the regulatory regime is in fine shape, but there are aspects that the committee would like to be addressed, and addressed in a timely manner. I believe it is essential for all responsible players within the industry to act responsibly and to make responsible statements. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-20,"—The report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services that we are considering is an important one. Why is it important? It is important because the committee has undertaken a very thorough examination of the prudential regulation of financial services in Australia. Prudential regulation includes banking, insurance, superannuation and solicitors' mortgage funds. It is particularly important because every Australian would have one of those financial products. A total of $497 billion is now invested in superannuation. Billions of dollars have been invested through solicitors' mortgage funds. It is a matter of unfortunate note that in recent times a small number of superannuation funds have experienced severe difficulty. It is also a matter of note that recently there have been a significant number of solicitors' mortgage funds where losses in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars have occurred throughout Australia. The committee carried out a specific case study of solicitors' mortgage funds in my home state of Tasmania. 
The committee carried out a year-long investigation and the report is unanimous. I think it is important to stress that the report is unanimous. The report is very critical of some aspects of regulation in this country and also goes to some important changes that should be made. Firstly, I might just refresh the Senate's memory that it is the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who presided over the creation of the current regulatory framework of financial services in Australia. He said in 1998: 
Once implemented, Australia will have a stronger regulatory regime designed to better respond to developments in the finance sector, including globalisation and technological change and the needs of businesses and consumers. Once implemented, Australia will be a world leader, with best practice, leading edge financial sector regulation. 
Unfortunately, I would have to say, as deputy chair of the committee, that the committee could not reach that conclusion. In fact, on page 7 of the report there is an interesting illustration of the old regulatory framework and the current regulatory framework. I might just hold that up for the Senate. The current Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is in the other place, Dr Kemp, has unfairly referred to Labor's Knowledge Nation as `spaghetti nation'. If you look at this diagram of our current regulatory framework in Australia, you could find no better description of the current regulation of Australia's financial industry as spaghetti regulation. In summary, it is very complex, it is disjointed, it is messy, it is unclear and it is not delivering. 
Let me go to some of the unanimous findings and recommendations of the committee report. The committee found that the current regulatory framework is complex and confusing and that there is scope for APRA, as the major prudential regulator, to improve its performance in some areas. In reference to ASIC: 
The committee has some reservations about the timeliness and effectiveness of the regulator's enforcement activities in some areas. The committee noted many examples of poor standards of stewardship by trustees, in particular through speculative, inappropriate and unsound practices and loan arrangements. The committee considers it imperative to provide certainty and clarity in the regulatory framework. There is evidence of regulators being poorly resourced and staffed inadequately. 
The committee found that the current regulatory framework was complex and confusing. We went to a number of case studies, flowing from which a second report and detailed recommendations will be handed down soon. We received over 200 submissions. The majority related to two case studies: a commercial nominees superannuation fund and solicitors' mortgage schemes. The committee also found that there was evidence of buck-passing from one regulator to another. The committee recommends that APRA improve its oversight of trustees; that APRA act more quickly when matters come to its attention; that fund annual reports identify any payments to trustees from the fund, broken down into directors' fees and other payments; and that all significant administration fees, charges and commissions paid to both fund managers and development managers be disclosed. A trustee fund manager or administrator who has been convicted of fraud should not practise again until certain conditions are met. One of these conditions might mean not practising for 15 years. Compare this to the very light-feathered touch of ASIC, when it suspended Mr Hudson in Tasmania, one of the persons caught up in the solicitors' mortgage fund scandal. He was conditionally suspended for just six months. 
The committee also found that the minister must act expediently and efficiently in making a decision under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to grant financial assistance to a fund that has suffered as a result of fraud or theft to minimise the hardship that superannuation fund members could suffer. This is a very important protection to fund members in this country. It provides, in the event of theft or fraud, for 100 per cent compensation. I might say in passing that this is the 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud that the Liberal government attempted to water down last year to some 80 per cent. On that issue I am pleased to say that again the committee unanimously concluded that the current 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud should also be maintained.  
The committee went further, though. In respect of superannuation moneys, when a person retires and collects their lump sum, it recommended that the current protections in the event of theft and fraud in the SI(S) Act be extended—this is a very important recommendation—to include an appropriate range of pension and retirement annuity products. The committee found that there were far too many examples of Australians who have retired, received a lump sum and invested that money and who are being ripped off. There was the appalling case of solicitors' mortgage funds in my home state of Tasmania. The vast majority of victims were retired Tasmanians who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases, of their retirement moneys. 
The committee further considered that, for example, the early warnings of problems with EPAS superannuation and CNA, another superannuation fund, appear to have been overlooked by the regulator. The collapse of HIH Insurance is yet another example where early warning signals seem to have been ignored by the regulator. APRA should review its approach to risk management and increase the attention it gives to the prudential supervision of superannuation entities, especially those in the small to medium sized fund environment. APRA provided the committee with a long list—a litany—of small to medium sized superannuation funds which failed to address basic regulatory requirements. We also found that ASIC's resources are stretched to the limit. This is hardly surprising, I suppose, with the recent rash of major financial collapses: HIH Insurance, One.Tel and a number of other financial institutions. So there should be a review of the resources at the disposal of ASIC and APRA.
In relation to the staffing of both APRA and ASIC, many highly skilled and qualified staff were regrettably lost when ASIC was forcibly removed by the Treasurer from Canberra to Sydney. All this has impacted on the effectiveness of the regulatory framework in Australia.
Finally, the committee believed that auditors should be genuinely independent. There are far too many examples of conflict of interest when some auditors carry out their responsibilities. Auditors are critically important for the effective regulation of our financial system. 
In concluding, this is a very important report. It is a unanimous report. It is very in depth and it has some very important recommendations. It concerns me that there is a level of complacency amongst the government—not amongst government senators, I might say, on our committee—in thinking that we have some sort of world's best practice regulation when clearly the facts do not indicate that. We have spaghetti regulation. It is complex, disjointed, messy and unclear. You have only to look at this diagram of the mess of regulation we have in respect of financial services in this country. I look forward to the implementation of the recommendations of this very important report by a future Labor government.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ludwig) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-08-20,"—On behalf of Senator Denman, I seek leave to incorporate her speech in Hansard. I understand that it is customary practice. The Government Whip has been advised and has seen the speech. 
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The intent of this bill is not to ban alcohol or to demonise it. However we must acknowledge that for society there can be a cost to the consumption of alcohol in terms of alcohol related violence, family breakdown, insurance premiums, traffic accidents and a raft of other unintended consequences.
Thus this bill sets to reserve certain amounts from the beer excise toward programs aimed at reducing the effect that alcohol consumption has on the community. Additionally the bill intends to focus on the use of other licit substances such as petrol sniffing and solvent.
The amount of money involved is substantial, totalling $115 million in revenue, of which 85% must be allocated to professional and community organisations.
The Labor Party has no problem with the intent of this bill, as we acknowledge, as any thinking being would, that although alcohol as with other psychotropic substances can be a great social lubricant it also has the potential to cause great social harm.
There may be those that suggest we should ban alcohol, but history has shown us that idealistic as it may appear, the harm caused was greater than the harm avoided. This also ignores the fact that most users of alcohol are socially responsible. 
The main objectives we have relate to the prudential arrangements of the bill. In other words, why has a private company been set up to administer the money, rather than a public body emulating The Victorian Health Promotion Foundation or the Australian National Council on Drugs just to mention two examples.
As our minority reports shows even the Department of Health and Aged Care “....admitted there was no precedent for using a private company this way.”
Additionally, the removal and replacement of members over time may see the scope and the direction of the Foundation change. This may water down the operations of the Foundation to a point that they may well become a puppet rather than a truly effective instrument for moderation and responsible use of alcohol.
The Labor Party is also questioning the amount of revenue collected by the excise with the department being unable at the time of the inquiry, to supply such figures, but we suspect the amount may exceed the 120 million dollars muted. This is backed up by the brewers, who suggest the figure is closer to 180 million dollars. We intend to follow this up in estimates.
As the revenue will not be distributed as collected, but staggered over a four year period the Government of the day will be able to collect interest on those cash reserves rather than the Foundation. As we point out, this is a tricky approach and denies the Foundation interest on their own reserves.
Overall the Labor Party is happy with the general direction of the Foundation's brief that includes the prevention of alcohol and other licit substance abuse, using evidence based research in. terms of treatment, rehabilitation, research and prevention programs, community education and public awareness campaigns.
We would like to ensure that alcohol related violence is included in the terms of reference, both in terms of domestic violence and other social violence, as this can be one of the most violence producing substances, albeit in a minority of occasions. To neglect this in the terms of reference would be erroneous.
Some thought may be given to also allocating a small amount of revenue to the police, nurses and ambulance drivers, as they are often the groups that have to deal with inappropriate behaviour of individuals or groups affected by alcohol.
Thus perhaps the Foundation could consider a training course, if it does not already exist, in handling potentially violent situations as a result of ethanol or other licit substances such as solvent or petrol intoxication. There also may be a need for debriefing for those professionals that have been accosted emotionally or physically as a result of dealing with the minority of those that exhibit violent behaviour as a result of their ethanol consumption.
Has any thought been given by the Foundation to engage in agitation for employment for some of the marginalised groups?
This does not deny, or is it an attempt to enter into the complex and often counterproductive debate concerning genetic, biomedical or social causes of destructive usage patterns, but merely suggests if you are bored and without direction, value or purpose, bad habits are more likely to occur when young and, logically be harder to resolve when older.
Again, this is not suggesting that the complexity of destructive behaviours can merely be fixed by employment. We are simply suggesting that chronic unemployment, particularly if it is endemic to whole communities, must be seen as a contributing factor to inappropriate alcohol and other licit substance abuse.
It is refreshing to see the focus on evidence based treatment education and prevention strategies. The Labor Party supports this approach with this caveat—that, research done merely in academic circles or programs that work in the urban centres may not translate well into more remote or even rural area.
I am sure that the nominated members of the committee are well aware of the limitations of one size fits all approach and I am not telling them how to approach this issue, but I thought it was worth a mention that local knowledge is invaluable, though at times it may be ill informed.
In summation Labor supports the general intent of this bill, but has serious concerns regarding the prudential arrangements surrounding both the administration of the revenue and the security of the members if they are deemed to be unpopular with the government of the day.
Labor has the feeling this bill was rushed through and though there may be a reasonable motivation for this occurrence in its current form, we feel there are some changes that need to be quickly enacted before it will satisfy our concerns. Thus I refer the Senate to the minority report for guidance.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-20,"—I am pleased to speak on the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001 and to sum up the previous speeches. The legislation arises from an agreement between the Prime Minister and Senator Meg Lees to make commitments regarding an amount equivalent to the difference between excise collected on draught beer between 1 July 2000 and 4 April 2001 and the amount that would have been collected using the new rates prescribed under A New Tax System. This amount was determined by Treasury to be $120 million. The agreement was to allocate $115 million to a new body called the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation and $5 million to the restoration and preservation of historic hotels in rural and regional Australia. 
The money for the foundation was committed in the 2001-02 budget. This legislation will establish the special account through which to direct funds to the foundation. It will establish accountability mechanisms for the funding and enable the government to appoint an alternative body to expend the funds should the established foundation not act according to the objectives and spending prescriptions set out in the MOU between the Prime Minister and the Democrats. The overall goal of this foundation is to provide support for community based programs that aim to reduce the alcohol related harm in communities. The foundation will also have a charter to target other licit substances that are subject to abuse and that cause harm, such as petrol and other inhalants. We know that the abuse of alcohol and other inhalants leads to physical ill effects in those abusing and can be associated with suicide attempts, antisocial behaviour and crime.
These are problems that Australian people and communities face every day. As an independent charitable body, we envisage that the foundation will develop affiliations, partnerships and grassroots connections with communities that require expertise and support to address entrenched problems with the misuse of alcohol and other substances. The foundation will support a whole range of activities required in a comprehensive response, with treatment rehabilitation and public education aimed at prevention. The government also envisages that the foundation's charitable status might encourage donations from the business sector and other community members for the further enhancement of work in this important area.
While alcohol related harm could affect any individual family or community, research shows that some population groups are more affected than others. Populations and settings considered to be at risk of alcohol related harm require additional targeted support to ensure that a reduction in harm occurs. Strategies are required that are culturally responsive, that meet the needs of marginalised groups, that recognise the unique settings of local communities and that improve access to services. The Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation will support such strategies by targeting much of its activities to population groups identified to be at particular risk.
Aboriginals, Torres Strait Islanders and young people are, in general, recognised as particularly vulnerable groups, and we envisage that the foundation will support the development of programs that aim to understand the attitudes and behaviours that lead to harm and the development of programs that prevent harmful behaviour in the first place. As the MOU between the Prime Minister and the Democrats clearly states, the focus of the foundation is to be on the provision of effective education, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services that target alcohol and other licit substance misuse. The best evidence and experience has found that a comprehensive set of such activities can change behaviours and outcomes.
While the foundation is intentionally set up as an independent body, it will be rigorously accountable for the expenditure of Commonwealth funds in those areas identified as priorities. The foundation will report to parliament annually on the expenditure of all Commonwealth funds. My colleague Senator Grant Tambling will be taking this bill through the committee stages. He is well versed in these areas. It will be a useful exercise for the Senate to listen to Senator Tambling. This legislation is an important and exciting initiative that should draw the support of all members and senators. I commend the bill to the Senate. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
Ordered that consideration of the bill in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for a later hour.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-20,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition and my colleague the shadow minister for science, Mr Martin Evans, to indicate that we will be supporting the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001. The legislation is a further development of the regulatory arrangements for an Australian space industry. It gives effect to certain provisions of the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation in the field of the exploration and use of outer space for people purposes, signed in Canberra on 23 May this year.
The primary purpose of the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 is to amend the Space Activities Act 1998 to provide for the making of regulations that will give effect to one or more provisions in the agreement. I point out with some pride that, although the Space Activities Act 1998 was introduced by the present government, the preparation for that act was carried out during the last couple of years of the previous Labor government. I was then responsible for the space program.
We began the process of developing the procedures for that Space Activities Act and it was clear that, to have the opportunity to develop space activities—particularly rocket launchers—from this country, we needed to have a regulatory regime. Anybody can launch a rocket from anywhere to anywhere in the world, but there are all sorts of strategic defence, security and environmental issues. We had addressed none of those in Australia, so we began the preparation for the act. At the time it was introduced, I spoke in this place and congratulated the government on seeing it through. We are now seeing a further amendment to carry out the successful agreement signed by Australia and the Russian Federation. In the early to mid-1990s, I was involved in some of the activities that invited representatives of the Russian space program to come to Australia, and they have now visited on several occasions.
This bill will amend the Space Activities Act 1998 to do the following things: create a new part, part 5A, in the act to provide a framework for the implementation of specific space cooperation agreements; include in part 5A, at section 79A, a power for the Governor-General to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to one or more provisions of the agreement; add schedule 6 to the act to include a copy of the English text of the agreement; and include in part 5A, at section 79B, power for the Governor-General to make regulations for the purpose of amending schedule 6. Regulations made under section 79A will, amongst other things, enable the minister to nominate organisations to be appointed or involved in specialised activities within the framework of the agreement and to access the benefits of the agreement, other than the benefits offered under article 11.
The bill will also set out the process by which organisations may apply to be nominated for appointment or involvement in the agreement and, further, set out the specific requirements that each organisation seeking nomination must first satisfy before the minister will nominate it to be appointed or involved in activities under the agreement. The purpose of enabling organisations to apply to be nominated to participate in specialised activities is to provide a mechanism by which organisations that are not parties to the agreement may access benefits arising from the agreement. The purpose of requiring applicants to satisfy certain requirements before the minister will nominate the organisation is to ensure that Australia complies with its obligations under the agreement. The government is of the view—and we support this—that it is not intended that the regulation power under part 5A include the power to create and impose penalties for noncompliance with the regulations. Regulations made in accordance with section 79B will enable schedule 6 to continue to accurately represent the English text of the agreement if and as the agreement is amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties. 
This bill is needed—and we should take this as a very positive sign—because at least four companies are proposing to establish commercial space launch facilities in Australia. There is the Asia Pacific Space Centre on Christmas Island, about which the government has made a major announcement. It has made a major commitment of funds, which I understand may approach $100 million, to get the project under way. There is the Kistler Aerospace Corporation at Woomera, in my home state of South Australia. The Kistler proposal is being developed over several years and is an attempt by that company to provide a totally commercial space launching facility from Woomera. Also at Woomera are Spacelift Australia and the Falcon project.
Two of the four projects envisage the use of Russian launch technology. However, the sensitive and dual use nature of the technology requires agreement between governments to facilitate its release and to ensure control of access. Without a bilateral agreement, the Russian government would not transfer the technology and expertise to Australia, blocking the development of the two space launch projects which are based on Russian systems and depriving Australia of an opportunity to capture a share of the lucrative global satellite market.
The agreement between Australia and the Russian Federation, which, as I have said, was signed on 23 May 2001, provides a legal and organisational framework for the transfer of space technologies, equipment and expertise to the Australian commercial space launch industry. We should all welcome this as we will see the transfer of space technologies from Russia, which has a well-proven record in space technology. We should also note that these projects are going to be carried out in regional Australia. Whether the projects are on Christmas Island or at Woomera, most of the money will be spent in regional Australia. As a South Australian, I have to say that such a project will be a much better example of development at Woomera than the expansion of the present detention centre, which, although it has created a few jobs for local people, has not created an image that many would like us to have—that is, the controversy about the detention of immigrants, the escapes and all those other problems.
As we all know, Woomera in the fifties and sixties and through to the early seventies was one of the leading space centres of the world. Large amounts of money—from the Europeans and the British and from Australia—were spent to develop the infrastructure. It is very sad to go to Woomera these days and to see the state of that infrastructure, with much of it slowly disintegrating or rusting away—it is a desert climate so the rust is rather slow—or to see what happened, very tragically in my view, to the two massive concrete ELDO launching sites that were built in the late sixties for the European Launcher Development Organisation, to launch very big rockets, at the cost of many tens of millions of dollars. Two of these launch sites were built at the edge of Island Lagoon. Then the Europeans decided to go to Guyana to launch the rockets there, as it is closer to the equator, instead of from Woomera. The concrete launching pads, the underground control centres and all the other paraphernalia that went with them comprise, even today, a massive site—a 10-storey concrete structure on the edge of an escarpment that goes down into Island Lagoon. What is particularly tragic is that in the mid-eighties, when there seemed to be no future for space launching in Australia, the Australian defence forces agreed that the SAS, our premier antiterrorist organisation, could use the concrete stands for target practice. So you now see them pockmarked by hand grenades and bazooka shells. Even more tragically, to test their ability to blow things up they put through the underground bunkers a large amount of explosives and blew the roofs off, so they have been utterly destroyed. 
—Like the CLP in the Northern Territory!
—Yes, I suppose like the CLP—utterly destroyed. Maybe they are going to Christmas Island, as part of the Northern Territory, to take off and never be seen again, Senator Conroy. But, to me, the worst example of how Australia, through the seventies and eighties, had given up on space was that we could, willy-nilly, destroy two launch facilities and wreck them when, as the Russians I met when they came here in the mid-nineties said, with little adaptation they could have been used again to launch rockets from Australia.
You also can see at what is called the `range head' in the Woomera area large launching pads, block houses and command centres. Even in the mid-nineties one of the launch centres was kept in working condition by the Royal Australian Air Force. The equipment was there; the only thing lacking was the commitment. I remember quite a few years ago an expert in the Indian space program coming to Australia and thanking us profusely for ending our space program in the early seventies under the McMahon government. We sold off, at giveaway prices, the tracking equipment and other equipment that was at Woomera. The Indians bought it dirt cheap, took it to India and now use it as part of their space program. They can now launch their own rockets into space. There is a sad saga of missed opportunities in Australia from the early seventies through to the very late eighties, when it became clear that some of us in government and some commercial interests could put it back together.
One of the old sayings we have in Australia when something is not too difficult is that it is not rocket science. I can assure you that you do not have to be Albert Einstein to build a rocket to launch into space. One of the senior executives of the company that built our Anzac frigates—it used to be called Transfield—at Williamstown in the early nineties, and who was interested in being involved in commercial rocket launches, said that building an Anzac frigate at Williamstown was immeasurably more complicated and sophisticated than putting together a rocket that could launch a satellite into low earth orbit or even geostationary orbit. Certainly it is costly, certainly it is complicated, but it is not as complicated as we are led to believe by the sights from, say, Cape Canaveral in America and the massive space programs the Americans run. That is another aspect that is often confused. Some of the bureaucrats in Treasury and Finance that I ran up against when I was minister thought that a minister in the Australian government who had an interest in space wanted to develop the equivalent of NASA in Australia and spend hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. You can launch a rocket with a low earth orbiting satellite for a matter of a few million dollars and the agreements with the Russians show that you probably can build these rockets for less than $10 million and put two or three small satellites in them for low earth orbit. You can even buy from the Russians a much larger rocket for geostationary orbit.
It is not expensive. What is expensive is the cost to the current account of this country of buying satellite services from other people. Billions of dollars a year go out of this country to buy the services of satellites and other people's rockets because we do not do it. We spend directly $2 billion or $3 billion a year and then access telecommunications from someone else's satellite. Even our Department of Defence has to use satellites owned by other commercial operators. We recently had the argument in the press that if SingTel buys Optus they will get access to the satellite that has our defence department communications signals on it. SingTel is partly owned by the Singaporean government. In our own national interest, in our defence interest, I cannot see why Australia should not have a capacity to launch rockets to put up communication satellites for our own defence forces. I cannot see why we cannot launch satellites from Australia to provide commercial services for Australians, whether they are telecommunications services, whether they are broadcasting services or whether, even more importantly, they are environmental monitoring services. One of the projects Kistler wants is the provision of security monitoring services for Australia. Other companies want to photograph the earth's surface and use various technologies to explore for minerals. It is much cheaper to do this from a satellite. It is much cheaper to monitor, say, overgrazing in the pastoral regions of Australia from a satellite. You can get accurate photographs. Global positioning is another major new area. We are buying all those services off someone else's satellite at full cost to our current account deficit. 
This is not a matter of some airy-fairy bunch of lunatic scientists with a wish list to launch satellites and rockets from Australia; this is about economic development for Australia, it is about economic development in our regions and, above all, it is about our own economic security and our defence security. I am disappointed that for 20 years Australia has been out of the space activities area. We have plenty of scientists in Australia who have full qualifications to work in this industry. They not only have qualifications to build the rockets; they also have qualifications to make various satellites with various adaptations. If we are looking for good, value added jobs for young Australians the space industry is one industry that can provide them.
This bill is another small step forward. I want to say as the minister formerly responsible for the space program that I am delighted that the government have continued with these activities. I am delighted they have made a commitment to infrastructure on Christmas Island. I hope the Kistler project and the other projects at Woomera can proceed. I do not claim to be technically proficient in this area, but the advantage of Christmas Island is that as it is so close to the equator rockets and satellites are able to be launched on an equatorial orbit at the most efficient cost. Woomera is very suitable to launch what are called polar orbit satellites, which go over the north and south poles. Woomera, with empty ground all around, also has the advantage that there is not a risk, if something goes wrong, of lobbing a rocket or a satellite on a nearby town. Both Christmas Island and Woomera have real advantages. With what the government are doing and with what the private sector is starting to do, I say to all governments of all persuasions: this is not an issue that you can turn away from and say, `We don't have to be involved,' or, `It's too expensive.' It is already expensive for Australia because of the billions of dollars of income that we are missing out on. Instead, we are paying the money out to somebody else. This is an example of why we ought to be the knowledge nation and the clever country. We ought to be able to launch our own rockets with our own satellites or provide those services to the many other countries and corporations who believe that this will be a very useful industry to have solidly based in Australia.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-08-20,"—I rise on behalf of the Democrats to support, in some respects cautiously, the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001, which makes amendments to the Space Activities Act 1998, to which Senator Schacht referred. As I recall, Senator Schacht, Senator Minchin and I were the senators involved in that debate a couple of years ago. As South Australians, we had a particular interest in that legislation.
The legislation provides for regulations that will give effect to certain aspects of the agreement between Australia and the Russian Federation signed in Canberra in May this year. The agreement relates to the cooperation between our two countries in space activities for peaceful purposes. I recall that during the debate in 1998, while there was cross-party support for fostering support and resources for the space industry—and it is certainly something that the Democrats have watched with interest and keenly debated as an area that we should be more involved in and more excited by—there were also quite a few unresolved issues such as liability and whether or not we should be able to put fissionable materials in space. It was a good debate, but I think there are still some unresolved issues.
The bill provides a legal and organisational framework for the transfer of space technologies, equipment and expertise to the Australian commercial space launch industry. It will also authorise the making of regulations that will then proceed to implement in detail the treaty between Australia and the Russian Federation. This is necessary in order to protect a number of aspects of the proposed arrangement. Included in the treaty are the protection of the intellectual property and some of the physical property that is involved with the Russian launch facilities and the nature of the dual use technology that is involved in space activities. There are also issues with duty and import costs, both into Australia and into Russia, that need to be eliminated in order to have a cost-effective industry. It is a requirement of the Russian government that their space related imported goods and equipment are duty free. 
Currently, there are four companies interested in using Australia as a base for commercial space launch facilities. Two of these companies intend to use Russian technology. The most advanced proposal involves the Asia Pacific Space Centre plan, which will be based on Christmas Island and will use Russian technology. Senator Schacht referred to this in his remarks.
The Democrats wish to register their concerns about the Christmas Island project on environmental grounds. We understand that, while Environment Australia is satisfied by the environmental assessment, there do exist dissenting views about the operations of the APSC and the attendant environmental impact on Christmas Island. As already mentioned by some members in the House of Representatives, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 June this year Mr Warren Nicholls, an environment consultant, has labelled the environmental impact statement for the launch centre as `shoddy'. In reference to the water supply on Christmas Island, Mr Nicholls is quite explicit as to the impact of a `spill'—presumably fuel. He states:
The water supply on the island is a critical issue and if there was any spill either while transporting stuff there or during the launch it could go straight into the water supply—in which case the island's finished.
On the other hand, Mr Nicholls was equally concerned about the serious impact of noise pollution from a rocket launch on the many native species that inhabit the island's fragile community. Noise pollution creates a serious threat to the island's native species. Therefore, the Democrats call for further environmental assessment of the impact of the project before it proceeds.
Minister Minchin has made much of the potential benefits of this industry. Based on estimates that the industry will achieve 20 per cent of the international launch market, Australia can expect $2.5 billion to be added to its balance of payments until 2010, not to mention the several thousand new jobs that would be created over that same period. I acknowledge that many of those would be in regional areas, which is no doubt of particular interest to the relevant minister here today, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.
However, there are suggestions that there is already an oversupply in the satellite launch market worldwide. Indeed, the projected supply of commercial space launches far exceeded estimates of demand over the coming decade, according to Mr Bruce Middleton, the Managing Director of Asia Pacific Aerospace Consultants, at the ninth Australian International Aerospace Congress. Indeed, Mr Middleton claims that the four space launch proposals will have difficulty making a profit. In such a case, it would be difficult for those economic benefits to be anywhere near the magnitude of the government's claims.
Another concern that the Democrats have had throughout this debate is the issue of Commonwealth liability: how much is the Commonwealth liable for in the event of an accident? I understand that the calculations for maximum probable loss, for insurance purposes, are quite extensive. There are three basic criteria for choosing the flight path with the lowest practicable risk: will there be any risk to human life; will there be any significant damage to property through the multiplier effect; and are there any uninsurable specific sites?
We note that, in calculating the safety envelope of any particular launch or, conversely, the risk level of any launch, our regulations have been based on FAA regulations in the US, which replace the former NASA regulations. We have been assured that these regulations are rigorous in estimating the risks during each phase, demonstrated by the very robust safety record in the US. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a fact that I do not think has been raised previously: all rocket launches, with few exceptions, occur in an easterly direction, owing to the direction of rotation of the earth. Therefore, launches from Florida and, indeed, Japan and Russia or from Guyana in South America occur over vast expanses of open water. Of course, launches from Christmas Island would also be in an easterly direction. However, except for a very narrow corridor, significant amounts of land potentially lie in the path of a launch, being the Top End of Australia, the archipelago of Indonesia or West Papua and PNG further to the east. This is not to mention the concerns of the offshore oil and gas industry on the North West Shelf off Western Australia. So while the risks have been calculated with a threshold of an incident of only one in 10 million—whether that be human life or physical property—there is nonetheless a risk. 
We must remember that rocket science is not perfect; indeed, all science is necessarily based on assumptions. One has only to take a look at the respected plane manufacturer, Boeing. Boeing's Delta class rockets have not proved to be reliable. A recent Boeing Delta IV rocket's failure has been blamed on a faulty part. The Ariadne 5 rocket also suffers from unreliability. To be fair, the Russian launch technology that will be used in two of the four proposals is superior and proven.
Rather than providing prescriptive guidelines as to the necessary requirements and considerations to ensure that any particular launch will achieve the lowest possible risk, the onus is completely on the flight operator: that is, the operator must convince the regulator that the safety of the launch, with regard to people and property, is at an acceptable level. This would typically be done using cost-benefit analysis.
I would like to point out that this is also a commercial operation and, with some doubt over the commercial viability of the Christmas Island project, there will be further incentive for the operator, APSC, to ensure their insurance premiums are as low as possible—that is, to ensure a lowest possible maximum probable loss. This in turn means that, in the event of a catastrophe, the Commonwealth's liability will necessarily be greater. I hope the minister is completely satisfied that the level of Commonwealth liability is the absolute minimum possible.
I understand that the level of technology transfer from Russia to Australia will be minimal in the early stages of the partnership but that there is the potential for this to increase further down the track. This is an excellent opportunity for Australia to consolidate its place in this rapidly growing high technology and high value industry. However, we should not just become users of these new technologies in the way, for example, we are in the ICT industries—we are very good users but not necessarily producers. We must foster innovation to ensure that we develop our own intellectual capital in the space industry. 
The Democrats therefore urge the minister to ensure that the development of Australian expertise is encouraged at every step. We must be more than simply a real estate agent for the Russians; we must also be able to benefit from their experience and expertise in space launch technology. With those concerns mentioned—and with some caution—we do support the legislation and commit to the record again our strong support for developing these kinds of cutting edge new technology industries.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-08-20,"— Senator Stott Despoja has covered a number of things that I was going to refer to in my speech, and I congratulate her on that contribution. The opposition, as indicated by my colleague Senator Schacht, supports the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001, amending the Space Activities Bill 1998. The Bills Digest outlines the purpose of this bill. This bill permits the operation of an intergovernment agreement between the government of the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth that would facilitate the import of Russian space technologies for possible launch from Australia. It provides for the making of regulations between the Australian government and the Russian Federation in relation to the field of exploration and the use of outer space for peaceful purposes. 
It is essential that this bill provide the making of regulations in order to protect the intellectual and physical property involved in the space industry, particularly the Russian launch facilities proposed for Australia's IOTs—Christmas Island in this case. It is important that we have regulations that are fair and reasonable and that protect Australian citizens from anything that may arise from the malfunction of a satellite launch. 
This is the first time that the Russian Federation has signed an agreement of this nature with any other country. The agreement, which was signed on 23 May, clearly shows that Australia has the appropriate geography for such an endeavour. Australia can play a very significant part in this global space industry and it can gain significant benefits from being part of such an industry. This is where any government needs to pay particular attention. Our industrial sector has the potential to play a significant role here and capture some of the benefits from the space industry. Investing in R&D would be at the forefront of that— something that this government has not, to say the least, excelled at in recent years. 
I would like to highlight the fact that the space base has the potential to be a lifesaver for Christmas Island, where the satellite launch facility is set to be built starting this September. As the shadow minister for territories, I am fully aware of the conditions on Christmas Island. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go there because of the provisions, until recently, of the Remuneration Tribunal—which is another interesting story in itself. Christmas Island is apparently considered as being overseas, so shadow ministers cannot travel there, nor can they use their study money because it is not regarded as overseas travel! So here you have a classic catch-22. I understand that recently the Remuneration Tribunal has reconsidered that, so maybe I will get a chance to go at some point.
Christmas Island has gone through a rocky time since 1998 when the Christmas Island Resort Casino was closed down and taken into receivership, leaving around 300 workers on the island without jobs. Many of those workers are still waiting for their entitlements. Since that time, the new owners of the resort, Soft Star Pty Ltd, have not reopened the resort as a casino, despite stating that they would reopen within 18 months of owning it. That time is clearly up. The resort has not reopened and that has frustrated the community of Christmas Island. Soft Star Pty Ltd, by the way, is the sister company of the Asia Pacific Space Centre, the company that will build the satellite launch facility. 
The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, has clearly stated that this space base will `underpin the economic future of Christmas Island'. Considering the impact on the economy and the loss of around 300 jobs on the island at the closure of the resort, that underpinning stated by the minister is a godsend. This is a very costly endeavour, costing around $800 million. Let us not forget that the federal government's contribution of $100 million, which was announced after the budget, is coming out of the government's contingency reserve—something which was highlighted by my colleague Mr Tanner in the other place. Clearly the government has come up with this package of $100 million for the Asia Pacific Space Centre because of the possibility that they may go to another country. That is probably the reality. I am advised that the $100 million will pay for upgrading the island's runway, new port facilities and the construction of the spaceport's mission control.
However, I would like the minister in his response to give the Senate a breakdown of the $100 million and what it will be used for. Here I would refer senators to the House of Representatives Hansard of Thursday, 9 August where Mr Peter Slipper, in the Public Works Committee reference, indicated:
The estimated cost of the common-use infrastructure upgrade is $68.6 million. 
I am interested to find out exactly how much is taken up. This was highlighted by Mr Warren Snowdon in the House of Representatives, and I quote from Mr Snowdon's contribution to the debate on the reference to the Public Works Committee:
Of interest to me is the fact that the government has announced expenditure of up to $100 million in connection with this space facility, yet today we have seen a reference to the Public Works Committee of works estimated to cost only $68.6 million.  
Mr Snowdon then asserts:
I can only assume that the other $32.4 million, which is not accounted for in this reference, is money that will be given to the Asia Pacific Space Centre—the proponents of the launch facility. If this is the case, it leaves open the question as to what the money is going to be used for. It is important that we know exactly what this money has been appropriated for. We have identified the $68.6 million, but we do not know what the remaining $32.4 million is to be used for.
Given that Mr Slipper indicated the amount of $68.6 million and that the entire appropriation out of the contingency reserve is $100 million, I ask the minister, in his response, to clarify the breakdown.
Probably the only major difficulty in relation to this proposal—or, at least, the only one that has been voiced to me by people on Christmas Island—is the lack of consultation. The community have indicated to me that they are frustrated by the lack of response from the Commonwealth when they have asked questions about the Asia Pacific Space Centre proposal. In fact, I am advised that the islanders found out about it after the government had made the announcement. Whilst many people on the island will benefit from the project, many more simply want to be informed by the government of exactly what is involved with having such a facility on the island. I think that is pretty reasonable. They have indicated to the opposition that they are not particularly interested in finding this out from newspapers, many of which take quite a long time—with tyranny of distance being a major factor—to get to the island, and that they want to know, first hand, precisely what is involved. 
I have had constituent letters from Christmas Islanders who are worried about some of the negatives which may come from the space base and—as, I think, Senator Stott Despoja indicated—both water and noise have emanated as being major concerns. The government has a role to play in reassuring them on the concerns that they have raised and, as was indicated before, environmental matters should be of a concern to us, as they are of concern to the community on Christmas Island. As I understand, newspapers have also picked up on this matter, with reports about water supply on the island identifying a critical issue. It is important that the government clarify today to the islanders exactly what is envisaged, and it is important that the government clarify which issues the islanders have legitimate concerns about and which ones are simply resulting from a lack of communication.
Time is running out, as APSC want to start the construction in September this year. The space agreement between the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth government, signed on 23 May 2001, established a formal framework for space cooperation. However, I am advised that, after three months have passed, there has not been one—and I stand to be corrected—open forum or public consultation convened by either the operators of the satellite launch facility, APSC, or the federal government.
The Christmas Islanders obviously have mixed views about the proposal. Clearly, they are not particularly well informed, and it is critical, in a project of this magnitude, that as much information as possible is provided. Considering that, as Senator Ian Macdonald has estimated, there will be 400-odd jobs during the construction phase and more than 500 jobs when the satellite launch facility is in operation, it is appropriate that more consultation occur. The project will be a major short and long-term job creator. I ask Senator Macdonald, in his response, to indicate what community consultation the government and APSC will be undertaking or have undertaken—in case I am incorrectly informed—to ensure that the people of Christmas Island are aware of all the issues surrounding this project. Of course, we support industry development on Christmas Island. It is clearly needed to boost the island's social and economic future. However, the community involvement has to be at the forefront of that endeavour.
I also raise, inter alia, the important role Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Ltd has played in this whole process. The company is currently the largest employer on Christmas Island, as it employs 180 people. The launch facility is to be built on land that is leased by Phosphate Mining Company, and the company has been very supportive of this proposal and deserves to be given public credit for this. It has a long history on the island, it is community based and it has been very supportive to the community on the island.  
In summation, it is clear that there are substantial benefits to be gained for the community of Christmas Island from this proposal, as there are for the whole of Australia, and I think it will be an exciting time for Australia and for Christmas Island. Australia will be able to demonstrate our capability in the launch areas as a result of this legislation. We support the legislation and we look forward to the increasing development of Australia's space industry. In conclusion, I ask Senator Ian Macdonald to clarify these comments of Mr Slipper:
The estimated cost of the common-use infrastructure upgrade is $68.6 million.
Mr Snowdon indicated, in the House of Representatives, that this would seem to leave $32.4 million unaccounted for. I ask the minister to take the opportunity in his response to clarify precisely the breakdown of the $100 million.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-08-20,"—The Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 is significant not only because it will permit the operation of an intergovernmental agreement between the government of the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth that would facilitate the import of Russian space technologies for possible launch from Australia but also because it plays a major role in providing a space base to be developed and used on Christmas Island. I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that Christmas Island comes within the federal electorate of the Northern Territory.
As a background to this legislation, representatives of the Commonwealth and the Russian state signed the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation in the field of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. The signing followed a saga of various proposals for the launch of foreign space rockets with satellite payloads from a number of proposed local facilities. This agreement also provides for the exemption of imported specialised space related goods and equipment from an Australian duty of up to five per cent.
The Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill, which passed through the parliament in early 1999, involved an exemption for space objects such as satellites launched from Australia. Australia had maintained a space agreement with the former Soviet Union. The Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Field of the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes, dated 1 December 1987, concerning cooperation in the field of exploration and the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, is to be replaced by this new agreement. 
This legislation will involve an amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, with the minister to authorise project concessions under guidelines to be developed. The provisions of the bill amend the Space Activities Act 1998 to provide for new regulations to give effect to the provisions of this agreement. Regulations made under section 79A should enable the minister to nominate organisations to carry out specialised activities. Item 4 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new part 5A in the Space Activities Act 1998, the principal effect of which is to allow the making of regulations to give effect to the provisions of specified space cooperation agreements—in this case, it will be this new agreement. Item 6 of schedule 1 of this bill inserts a new item in the Space Activities Act 1998 that contains an English text version of the intergovernmental agreement with Russia.
Soon after the budget was announced this year, the federal government provided $100 million for a new facility on Christmas Island—the world's first commercial astrodome from where Russian built Aurora rockets will be launched. Christmas Island, as people would know, is 2,500 kilometres west of Darwin and 500 kilometres south of Jakarta. As my colleagues have said, the launches are expected to start as early as 2003, with up to 15 launches per year, each costing $160 million. This facility is being built by the Asia Pacific Space Centre, which is owned by the Australian millionaire David Kwon, in association with his Russian partners and the federal government. We have been led to believe that this will generate up to 400 jobs during the construction phase and up to 550 jobs when fully operational. 
An article in Aviation Week & Space Technology on 28 May said, in part, that projections show a sustained market for the launch of at least 30 commercial satellite missions per year but also show little growth to support multiplying launcher developments and a dwindling insurance reserve. The article goes on to say that the projected commercial market cannot sustain all the launch systems that are here today, let alone all the launch systems that are going to be in place by the end of year. On behalf of the Christmas Island constituents I represent, I would want a guarantee from the minister that the expected launches per year that have been promised by APSC will in fact come to fruition. We know that to date Mr David Kwon has not been too good at keeping his word when it comes to one particular casino on the island. I draw the Senate's attention to a press release from Minister Macdonald dated 23 June, in which he says:
The Allen Consulting Group estimates the APSC project would increase Gross Regional Income to Christmas Island by $33 million per annum, with a net gain to Australia of $1.3 billion.
This is certainly welcome, and no doubt some people on Christmas Island would look forward to this influx of income. The minister's press release goes on to say:
I am also very pleased that Mr David Kwon, APSC's Managing Director, has today—
that is, 23 June, nearly two months ago—
announced that he will reopen the Christmas Island resort which means more jobs.
We are still waiting for that resort to be opened. In fact, people on Christmas Island have been waiting many months for that resort to be opened. I would say to them, `Don't hold your breath; you might have more luck getting more boatloads of illegal immigrants to the island than you would getting a job at the Christmas Island resort at this stage as it hasn't opened.' The casino side of that resort definitely stays closed. People on Christmas Island were hoping that the casino would generate most of their jobs. We would like to be satisfied, when we hear discussions of 15 launches a year happening at a facility being built by APSC, that we have guarantees from the minister that this will be the case. An amount of $100 million was given to upgrade the facilities on the island and we know, as the minister has said, that this will pay for expansion of the island's runway, and that new port facilities will be constructed and there will be construction of the spaceport mission control.
As we know, infrastructure on the island is extremely poor. The number of times I have been to the island and the number of inquiries I have been involved in through the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories have highlighted to me—and it has been highlighted by the Grants Commission report into the facilities on Christmas Island—that more than $100 million is needed to bring the infrastructure of Christmas Island up to speed. It goes to the number of aeroplanes that can fly in and out each week, the kind of airport that they have and the need to upgrade the runway, the telecommunications system and so on. While we welcome the $100 million to upgrade infrastructure on the island, we know that it is nowhere near enough to bring the island into line with what they need, according to the Grants Commission report that was produced some years ago.
It is also important that the community be satisfied with and consulted about the way in which these matters are being or will be developed. As our shadow minister, Sue Mackay, highlighted in her contribution to this debate, there are mixed reactions on the island to this space base. While on the one hand we have some of the community quite pleased to see that this space base is going to go ahead and that the infrastructure will be there, there are a significant number of people who are dissatisfied with the way in which consultation by this minister has occurred. They want, in fact they demand, to be included in the consultations about the development of this infrastructure.  
We have here a minister who flew to Christmas Island with Senator Minchin and made this announcement about a space base being built on the island, without prior advice to the community that he was not only coming but that he was making this announcement. In fact, the shire president, Andrew Smolders, was advised about the announcement by telephone after the ministerial party had arrived on Christmas Island. This is a government that continues to ignore the legitimate, democratically elected shire council of Christmas Island and does not give even the president the courtesy of a prior warning about the announcement, let alone involve that president or the council in activities that are happening there. Minister Macdonald has shown a great reluctance to consult with the council and to communicate or negotiate appropriately with the community of Christmas Island. This is a minister who has effectively refused to acknowledge, as I have said, the importance of the shire council as the democratic forum which represents the whole community of Christmas Island. Although you might not want to accept the fact, Minister, it does not only represent the chamber of commerce. That is only one group on the island. There is much broader representation on the island and those people expect to be consulted by the federal government on which they rely for their funds and development of their infrastructure.
When questions have been raised by the community of Christmas Island about the Asia Pacific Space Centre proposal, there has been a great degree of frustration about the lack of response they have received from the Commonwealth. As I said, there are mixed views on Christmas Island about the proposed APSC project. Those views are mixed because people are concerned primarily that they have not been provided with appropriate information by the company or by the government. Perhaps those mixed views would not be there and perhaps there would be a cohesive view and a degree of excitement or even a welcoming view about the development of this project if the shire council and the people on the island had been consulted properly.
It is a small community that has been affected by the closure of the resort facility which, as everybody should be aware, is coincidentally owned by a sister company of the Asia Pacific Space Centre. Promises were made when Soft Star became the owner of the resort—Soft Star being the name of the sister company related to the APSC—that they would have the resort up and running as a resort and as a casino within 12 months. As we have highlighted, they gave that commitment again to the minister no less than two months ago, on 23 June.
The $100 million was not in the budget. It came out of the blue. We had a budget in early May that did not include any reference to $100 million going to the Christmas Island space centre. Suddenly, we have $100 million pulled out of the back pocket, out of the blue. The announcement that the federal government was going to provide this money for infrastructure for this project took a lot of people by surprise. It came less than five weeks after the budget. We now know, after a lot of digging and prodding, that this money is coming out of the budget's $919 million contingency reserve, but it is an allocation of money that has not been scrutinised by the parliament. It was not included as a line item in the budget and quite cleverly was able to elude the estimates process, since people who might have asked questions about this money would not have been aware that it was about to be allocated, because it was allocated after estimates finished. 
The contingency reserve, with an allocation of $919 million for 2001-02, is, as I understand, designed as an allowance to reflect anticipated events that cannot be assigned to individual programs in the preparation of the Commonwealth budget. The government's own budget papers said the reserve should not be used to fund any new policies. So we have a federal government whose own budget papers suggest that the contingency reserve should not be used to fund any new policies. Am I led to believe that this government did not know about this agreement with APSC and the proposal to build a space centre when the budget was being handed down? We are all being led to believe that, although we have had a federal budget handed down and have gone through the estimates process, this matter was of such importance, such significance, that it was not part of any anticipated events in the week the budget was handed down. Suddenly, five weeks later, we have got to find $100 million to fund a space base on Christmas Island.  
I do not believe for one minute that this project was not in the pipeline when the budget papers were being formed and I do not believe for one second that Mr Kwon and APSC began any discussions at all with this government after the budget was brought down. I actually believe, and I probably have good cause to believe, that this project was signed, sealed and delivered well before the budget papers were brought down and that it was always the intention of the government to use these reserve funds. Perhaps the minister responsible might be able to provide us with an answer as to why that is the case. As I said, there was no mention of this funding in the minister's media release regarding budget funding for the Indian Ocean territories and the projected payments for 2001-02. 
Concerns have been raised about the environmental matters relating to this proposal. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 June this year, titled `Manna from the heavens as we join space race', Mr Warren Nicholls, a freelance consultant used by the Asia Pacific Space Centre, is quoted as saying that the environmental impact statement for the launch centre was `shoddy'. He goes on to say:
The water supply on the island is a critical issue and if there was any spill either while transporting stuff there or during the launch it could go straight into the water supply, in which case the island's finished.
This would of course cause grave concerns to the residents on Christmas Island. They have many questions about these statements that they believe are still unanswered. The article goes on to say:
Noise from rocket launches was the main threat to fragile species—
I assume he is referring to the unique species of birds on the island—
And a noise demonstration by APSC was “hopeless” ... “just a joke”. “Where you have so many species that are endemic to the island, you have to be extra careful.”
Recommendations from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, in accordance with section 931 of the administrative procedures of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, state that there are 65 conditions attached to this proposal. Even Senator Hill—one of your own colleagues, Senator Macdonald—has recommended that more than 65 strict environmental conditions for the proposed satellite launch facility be attached to this proposal. Senator Hill's press release of 10 May states:
In making these recommendations Senator Hill noted that their implementation might in some cases require that launch activity at the proposed facility be halted temporarily or permanently if monitoring detects significant negative impacts upon the environment.
One would have to ask the question of the minister responsible for overseeing this space project: what consultation has occurred with his colleague Senator Hill and what consultation has occurred between the shire council and Senator Hill's office?
We know that the launch facility is to be built at South Point on Christmas Island. This is all under the mining lease. The Phosphate Mining Company— members of which I have just met this week in Parliament House—has had to make arrangements with the Commonwealth over this land and has had to reschedule its mining operations so that it could mine out the areas to ensure that they are available to the space company. There are companies on the island that are more than accommodating of this proposal. In fact, if you look at what the Phosphate Mining Company is undertaking, it is going out of its way to ensure that the area needed for the space project will be mined in order to accommodate this proposal. Yet, there are quite a few residents on Christmas Island who are doubtful the project will ever get off the ground. As I said, it is not only a matter of getting the project off the ground but having 15 launches a year in a context of nearly three years in which we have seen the Christmas Island casino being closed down and the resort being closed down. The minister will stand up and tell us that the resort is open. It is only open for bed and breakfast, with a limited number of rooms each night; and there are no restaurant facilities. There are no casino facilities available. We are waiting for matters to be settled so that the workers at the Christmas Island casino can be paid the proper entitlements that they were due many years ago. If this government were sincere about looking after the people on Christmas Island, it would have taken it on as a liability and paid it out long before now. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-20,"—The Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 is a very important bill for Australia's space future. It is a bill which the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party have indicated their support for. There is a speech to conclude the second reading debate which the duty minister was to deliver. I happen to be here on duty and I was going to do that as the duty minister. I have not come prepared for a debate on Christmas Island, but I will take the opportunity, for which I am grateful, to discuss some of the issues that have been raised in relation to Christmas Island because that is my direct responsibility as minister for territories.
I briefly indicate that the bill before us amends the Space Activities Act to provide a framework for implementation of a specified space cooperation agreement. The agreement provides for a legal and organisational framework for the transfer to Australia of sophisticated launch vehicle technology, information and other space related technologies. It will also facilitate Australian access to Russian technical expertise and enhance collaboration between our two countries in scientific research and technological development. The new regulation making power provides a mechanism to enable both parties, as well as public sector organisations that are not parties to the agreement, to voluntarily access it. In accordance with the new regulations made under the new power, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources will be able to nominate organisations to participate in the agreements, subject to agreement with the Russian government. 
This bill is adequately described in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum. I do not think that I need to go into any greater detail than that. Suffice it to say, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, and the parliamentary secretary to Senator Minchin, Mr Warren Entsch, have done a fabulous job in getting Australia into this stage of its development of its space industry, and I congratulate both of them and the government generally.
But I despair when I hear the contributions that have been made by the two most recent speakers for the opposition in this debate. I guess I can excuse both Senator Mackay and Senator Crossin, because they have never been in government and they do not understand what government involves. It is not a game; it is a serious matter. I am a little disappointed that Mr Snowdon in the other place made certain remarks; as a former parliamentary secretary to the minister for territories, he should know a little bit more about how government works.
Mr Acting Deputy President, let me tell you about Christmas Island. It is a territory of Australia, and it is in a difficult situation. There is one form of economic activity on the island, and that is the phosphate mine. It is very well operated these days by Phosphate Resources Ltd and the board of directors of that very progressive company, which a couple of years ago won Australian trade awards for its exports. However, phosphate is a finite resource and it will run out at some time. When it does, what are we left with? We are left with a very special island environmentally and a place that a lot of people have made their home, but one with absolutely no economic activity at all. 
The former Labor government thought that you could fix every ill on Christmas Island by putting a gambling casino there. They worked to put the casino in, and for a little while it did work. But eventually it became bankrupt, it went into liquidation, because the customers were not coming. In spite of efforts at the time—this is in the time of the Labor government, so I can only go on what I have read about it— the customers stopped coming, the resort went into liquidation, there were fights between its various owners and it closed up.  
—It was in 1998; it was in your time.
—We are then left with the situation where some people think that the whole future of Christmas Island depends somehow on waving a magic wand: suddenly the casino will open and everything will be rosy. It is not like that unfortunately, Senator Crossin. If you paid some attention to the area that you are supposed to represent, you would know that the solutions are not that simple.
—Why did you sell it off to someone who does not want to open it as a casino? Why didn't you sell it to ComsWinfair?
—The resort is open, in spite of Senator Crossin's comments that it is not. It is open today, and I and many other people have stayed there. You probably stayed there when you were over there the other day, did you? It is operational. That shows how much this alleged representative of that area knows. The resort is open. The casino is not opening because nobody wants to run it. Nobody wants to lose their money. Senator, if it is such a good thing, why don't you get a consortium together and put your money into it and open the casino? You will not do it because you know, like everybody else—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would ask you to ask the minister to direct his comments through the chair.
 (Senator Murphy)—Yes, I was about to ask the minister to do that. Having been raised through a point of order: Minister, can you please direct your remarks pursuant to the standing orders.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I did not want to take a point of order while the minister was speaking, but I have been trying to listen very carefully to what he has been saying and it has been impossible to hear due to the incessant and consistent interjections from, firstly, Senator Mackay, then Senator Schacht and then Senator Crossin. I did not draw them to your attention because they were so loud that I thought you might address the matter. I ask you to ask those senators opposite to abide by the standing orders.
—I am sure all senators know the standing orders. I call the minister.
—We have one opportunity to assure the future of Christmas Island and it is something where Christmas Island has a natural advantage: it is close to the equator. There was a proposal by a very courageous, forward-looking and progressive Australian, Mr David Kwon, to put this space base there. He is putting a lot of his money into it—doing much more than those opposition senators who can only nitpick and pick little technical arguments to try to put this procedure into disrepute. Senator Crossin says that she supports this; at least she should understand that without this space base it is very difficult to assure a prosperous and profitable future for the people of Christmas Island. That is why the government has been working with Mr Kwon and the Asia Pacific Space Centre for nearly three years to try to make sure that this facility goes ahead. While Senator Crossin says yes, she supports it, and Senator Mackay says yes, she supports it, they then turn around and nitpick—for example, saying Mr Kwon cannot keep his word. Great, Senator Crossin: that will encourage investment where we need it!
—Are you going to open the casino or not?
—Senator Crossin wants me—representing a government that has nothing to do with the operation of the space centre—to guarantee that there will be 15 launches a year, and she suggests by implication that, if there is not, it is a fraud and it will not go ahead. Senator, maybe it will not go ahead but, if so, it will not go ahead because of lack of government support; if it does not go ahead, it will be because of people like you, who continually knock and criticise and try to undermine the work that has been done by this government for the people of Christmas Island. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am saddened that you have an opposition that can only knock the good things that this government has tried to encourage, that PRL has tried to encourage, that the people of Christmas Island have tried to encourage. I could go through at some length what Senator Crossin said and all her negativity, her pettiness, her technical objections to these sorts of things— 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That is a reflection on Senator Crossin: I would ask the minister to withdraw it.
—I do not accept the point of order.
—Not `pettiness'?
—No, I do not accept the point of order; I call the minister.
—We do want to make sure that this goes ahead. I appeal to Mr Beazley to pull his junior troops into line and to get them on board in 100 per cent Australian government and Australian parliament support for this proposal. The reason why this government, through a lot of very difficult negotiations, was able to make the offer it did to APSC was that APSC was about to—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The minister has implied that we do not support this project: my point of order is that at no time during our debate did we ever say that, so he is incorrect.
—There is no point of order.
—I acknowledge that the senator said she supported it, but then she gave a speech attacking the proposal and doing everything she could to throw cold water on this. I call upon Mr Beazley to bring these junior troops into line, so that we can get this facility which will be good for Australia and very good for the people of Christmas Island. The people of Christmas Island should look askance at the nitpicking criticism we keep getting from Senators Crossin and Mackay on this issue.
Mr Snowdon in the other place made a couple of speeches which I have to say, with some regret, that Senators Mackay and Crossin have just repeated in large paragraphs. It really shows their interest in part of it. I am disappointed in Mr Snowdon, who should know better. He has been involved in this. He went through the whole procedure when the casino went there. He knows better than most why it failed. The senators should talk to him and get some inside information on what it is all about.
This consortium had been made very attractive offers by a government in South America. Those offers were such that it was commercially attractive for them to go there. This government has been working on this proposal for a long time. In spite of the allegations—and they are only allegations by the opposition speakers—the consultation on this proposal has been enormous, and it has been going on for two or three years. I am sorry that Senator Mackay did not have the guile to be able to get Christmas Island—
—The guile?
—But I have been there five times and I speak to these people all the time. David McLean, the previous shire president, was opposed to this proposal. We had a lot of discussions. For those of you who know him, David McLean is a character and is a part of the UCIW internecine wars that are always happening on Christmas Island. They are always at one another's throats, and the position he takes depends upon what the UCIW is doing at the time. However, most of the people on the island believe and understand, as the government does, that this is the sort of proposal that can assure the future of Christmas Island. Not only have I spoken with people every time I go there—
—And you've been there a lot.
—I answer letters that are written to me and I speak on the radio. To suggest that there has been no consultation by me is not only ludicrous and ill informed; it is false. In addition to that, Mr Entsch, the parliamentary secretary, went to Christmas Island late last year for meetings specifically about this proposal with the shire president, with the president of the Chinese Literary Association and with the president of the Islamic Council. The environmental impact study done by APSC involved an enormous amount of consultation and, as environmental impact studies are, it was done by the government with the community, explaining everything that was going to happen. When an environmental impact study comes in, the environment minister is required to look at it carefully. It is a very fragile environment, and that is why Senator Hill has imposed 63 conditions, and that is why the company has accepted those conditions, and that is why this will go ahead in the very best environmentally precautionary way. That is all because of government initiatives and government keeping the environment close to mind, with the conditions imposed following the environmental impact survey. So we have done all those things. As regards the announcement, things move quickly. 
—They are moving pretty quick in the Northern Territory today.
—The shredding machines are moving quickly up there.
—Senators Mackay and Crossin would not understand this, because they have never been in government, but you have to work quickly and you have to work depending upon what foreign governments are doing and you have to work with the market. The decision was made that the government would put $100 million into this. That decision was made one day, and as soon as possible thereafter Senator Minchin and I got on a plane and went to Christmas Island. We did not stand here and announce it. We did not go out and announce it through a press release. We did the people of Christmas Island the courtesy of going over to Christmas Island and making this announcement, and at short notice we invited everybody that we could to come along and hear the announcement. We invited all of the shire council. Regrettably, they all happened to be in Perth doing some sort of study leave at that particular time. I tried to ring Mr Smolders, who, if he has had a complaint, has not, I might say, communicated that to me since that day. I rang him and told him—at the same time that we told the community of Christmas Island—what this federal government was doing to support the island. I left a message on Mr Smolders's voicemail machine, because I could not get in touch with him.
—That's very good communication.
—He was involved in a conference and apparently could not be withdrawn. However, when they say there was no involvement from the Christmas Island council, the shire clerk—the CEO of the Christmas Island council—was actually sitting in the room when the announcement was made, and he was fully briefed at the earliest possible time.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am getting really annoyed by the constant shrieking, like a galah's, coming from the other side of the aisle. I would plead with you to ask opposition senators to cease interjecting. It is impossible to hear the minister's contribution to this debate. They were heard in relative silence. I would like to hear what the minister says, even if they do not want to.
—As I said before, senators should be aware of the standing orders, and it is unparliamentary to make incessant interjections. I would ask senators to take that into account.
—Time is catching up on me, unfortunately. Questions were raised about infrastructure. The $100 million that the federal government is providing to this proposal is not going to the company; it is going to public use infrastructure on the island. It will support the $60-odd million each year which this government spends in capital and recurrent funding on the Indian Ocean territories. As a result of that, Christmas Island, as Senator Calvert well knows, has one of the best hospitals in any small community anywhere in Australia. The other facilities on the island are being upgraded as we speak. The number of housing projects on Christmas Island is a credit to this government, to the administration and to my department. Each year, $60 million is spent on infrastructure and recurrent expenses on that island, and then you have Senator Crossin coming in here and saying nothing is being done. This $100 million will, as has been indicated, go to extending the runway, putting a non-swell port on another side of the island and building a road from the port to the site. 
We, as a government, have to be careful of what we say is being put into particular projects because this will be an open tender process for these things. If we tell the tenderers exactly what we are expecting to spend on any particular item of infrastructure, you ruin the tender process. Unfortunately, Senators Crossin and Mackay, having never been in government, do not understand that sort of thing. So I will not be telling you exactly what is going to what, because we want to have an open tender, we want to get the best deal for Australia and we want to get the best deal for the people of Christmas Island.
There is talk of some other money, beyond the $68 million of the $100 million the government has committed. As the project proceeds, that money will go into a number of related infrastructure items, such as weather bureaus, telemetry and a space research centre to be set up on the island to make Christmas Island one of the world's leading facilities for space research. That is going to happen on Christmas Island, within Australia, and you are trying to stop that, Senator, with your nitpicking and criticism.
 (Senator Murphy)—Direct your remarks through the chair.
—On a point of order, the senator is continually misleading the Senate by misrepresenting what I have said.
—Senator, resume your seat. There is no point of order.
—We hope this will become world leading edge space research on Christmas Island, bringing scientists from the world over to Christmas Island. This is what the government has done. Senator Minchin, Mr Entsch and, if I may say with some respect, I, as well as the PRL and Mr David Kwon, have done a fabulous job of getting this where it is. Most of the people on Christmas Island understand it; occasionally the union will run around and raise all sorts of furphies about poisonous gases coming out but, by and large, most people understand what is happening, and anyone who has asked us has been fully and factually briefed on this proposal. We have done all the environment work. The Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 before us today puts in place the space regulation which will ensure the safe and profitable launch of facilities on Christmas Island.
I thank the other parties for their support for this bill. I just wish some of the Labor Party people would be as generous and supportive of this proposal on Christmas Island to make sure that the Christmas Island people do have a sustainable future.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-20,"—The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2001 is supported by the opposition. It deals with a number of announcements that the government made in the budget recently. We do not have any opposition to these measures because they are an extension of benefits. We support the government on them and we will not be moving any amendments to this bill in the committee stage.
The bill deals specifically with a number of areas which are not insignificant in cost to the revenue and are, therefore, a cost to the Australian taxpayer. But I think the Australian taxpayer, by and large, would agree that these improvements and these new measures are beneficial to our veterans community. The first major area that the bill deals with is the extension of the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The scheme will be extended to include all Allied veterans and mariners with qualifying service from World War I and World War II. I think there are 20 Australian veterans left from World War I. There may be some others who have been living here—Allied mariners, et cetera—but, at the most, there would not be more than 10, I would imagine, if any at all. Certainly for Allied veterans and mariners with qualifying service from World War II, this is a significant initiative of the government. It is significant alone in that the estimated cost of over $30 million a year indicates that a sizeable benefit will be available to a considerable number of Allied veterans living in Australia. The estimated cost in 2001-02 is $19.5 million; it rises to $33 million in 2002-03, $31 million in 2003-04 and $30 million in 2004-05.
While it is a matter of interest for the community, the interest that we have in this matter is that it is a bit difficult to make this estimate—to know the number of Allied veterans and mariners who have qualifying service and who are now living in Australia. Currently, it is estimated that there are about 350,000 veterans with access to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, using on average 34 to 35 concessional prescriptions a year at an annual cost of about $325 million. So the scheme is not a cheap scheme by any means but it is a very worthwhile and necessary scheme to provide benefits to our Australian veterans. Therefore, I say to the minister that one of the questions in the committee stage is: can they be more specific in how they arrived at the estimation of around $30 million in a full year to extend this to Allied veterans and mariners? The figure on these estimations has to be only marginally out and you have a blow-out in the budget, running to $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, $20 million, et cetera. Again, I do not blame the department for not automatically being sure how many Allied veterans are now living in Australia.
Another issue is the extension of the gold card to Allied veterans, which has been promoted by groups in the veterans community. I have seen figures that up to 90,000 Allied veterans with qualifying service are now living in Australia—obviously, British veterans being the largest number. There are veterans from the Second World War, not only from Great Britain but from all the Allied countries—France, Holland, Italy, Greece, and Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Denmark. There are also Russians; several thousand Russian veterans emigrated to Australia in the 1980s. I have met some of them and they fought at those famous battles at Stalingrad and Leningrad, right through to the capture of Berlin. Their war experiences are quite outstanding and astounding to those of us who have not served in such a military conflict. The extension of this benefit is very important to those Allies, and this will be a significant benefit to them. 
The department is using the average of 34 or 35 concessional prescriptions a year for existing Australian veterans. We are interested to know whether the department believes that Allied veterans will be using the same number of concessional prescriptions a year and, if not, what is its judgment on that? Also, does it have any concern that there will be an increase in the number of concessional prescriptions available for this benefit?
Turning to qualifying service, for those people not involved in the veteran community, an Allied veteran must be aged 70 or more and have qualifying service. `Qualifying service' means they must have been in areas designated as seeing action or they must have been in harm's way, or some such phrase, and of course have been an Australian resident for 10 years or more. This is not an insignificant increase in the budget, but the opposition supports the government on this particular proposal.
The other major area of this bill refers to the extension of the war widows pension to all war widows who have remarried. They will all now get the pension. Previously, if you were a war widow who had remarried before 1984 you did not get the pension. In 1984 the Labor Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Arthur Gietzelt, was able to convince the government of the day, the Hawke government, that this restriction should be lifted. In the argument over cost it was lifted only for those widows who remarried after 1984. Those who had already remarried before 1984 still were not able to get the war widows pension. The government has now taken the decision to remove that restriction so that all war widows, no matter when they remarried—of course, being a war widow means you have qualifying service—will get the pension.
I have to say that there has been an ongoing campaign with many governments by the War Widows Guild and the veteran community to remove this restriction. Though there were a number of inquiries, it was very difficult to argue why there should be a cut-off date of 1984. In those days I suspect that my former colleague Senator Gietzelt found it difficult enough to convince Treasury and Finance to make the concession post 1984 and that he had to put up with a compromise that said, `You can do it for the future ones, Arthur, but you can't do it for the ones up until 1984.' I think the bean counters in Treasury and Finance had some success in what they would have seen as restricting the availability of the war widows pension, but it did leave a very awkward anomaly in that a lot of war widows who had remarried who thought they were eligible felt that they were being harshly dealt with because they had remarried before 1984 compared with those who had remarried after 1984. 
I also want to make a comment generally about the war widows pension and the supplementary pension. The government would be aware, as we are in the opposition, that there has been considerable lobbying in the veteran community for an increase in the general rate of the war widows pension. In the restricted financial circumstances that this present government has now placed us in, with the reduction in the surplus from $14 billion that it was supposed to be this year down to $1½ billion, lots of these quite reasonable requests from the veteran community will not be able to be met automatically by the Labor Party if we are in government in a few months time or the coalition government if, unfortunately, it continues in power. But I think one area that can and ought to be looked at as a priority in the war widows area is the supplementary pension. I think an increase in the supplementary pension should have a higher priority than any increase in the war widows pension because the supplementary pension goes more to people with real need. Everyone gets the general pension. Some may ask, `If Kerry Packer were a veteran, would Mrs Packer really need an increase in the war widows pension if she were eligible for it?' You would say no. But, for somebody coming from a low income background with the pension as their sole source of income and livelihood, an increase in the supplementary pension would do more good than any increase in the general pension if you had to prioritise where you spend the money.
I note the estimate of how many war widows disaffected by the 1984 decision are still alive in 2001. In 1998 the government estimated that some 4,500 war widows pension recipients were alive in 1984, with an average age then of 64. The government estimated that there were about 4,100 war widows who had not received the pension prior to 1984 who were still alive as at 1997, with an average age of 77 years. Obviously, because of the normal rate of mortality in the human race, some of those people have passed away, so we are looking at a figure of fewer than 4,500. That is not a large number of recipients, but it is a very important number who will have that anomaly removed. 
I re-emphasise, because some people have been very critical of this anomaly, that up until 1984 any war widow who remarried did not get the pension. The change was made in 1984. It did not go all the way, but it meant that all those who remarried after the 1984 decision of the Labor government became eligible for the pension. We congratulate the government on removing this restriction for those who remarried before 1984 and are still alive. I believe that this is a very important and significant measure. In a bipartisan way, the opposition will support the government.
I also want to take this opportunity to speak very briefly on a matter of some heartburn in a small number of cases—that of the payment of the $25,000 to prisoners of war of the Japanese. The government pushed that legislation through this parliament in a matter of a couple of days. At the time the opposition said that, although we supported the measure, it might be useful to take an extra week or so putting it to a committee and having a chance to look at whether there were anomalies in the way in which this matter was being dealt with and whether all the people who got the benefit should get the benefit. I have had a couple of cases raised with me that indicate a difficulty. As I said, there are not a large number of cases. I do not think the government is going to change the legislation, but maybe the government could consider an ex gratia payment.
There is one case I will use as an example that I had not thought of. It involves a former member of this parliament. Tony Lamb, a former member for La Trobe and for Streeton on two different occasions in the federal parliament, pointed out that when he was four years old his father died on the Burma railway. His mother had died previously in the early 1940s, so his father was a widower. His father still joined up, and the kids were put with an aunt and other relatives while he went off to serve Australia. He died on the Burma railway, but because he died after his wife there was no widow. Tony raises the issue: how do you handle the case—not that I think Tony was desperate for the money—where the veteran outlives the widow who died before he gave service? That is one case.
Another case that I heard of that I think is more compelling—and I certainly do not want to use any names here—is where a veteran came back from the war, was married, had two or three children, the marriage lasted several decades and then, through circumstances that I am not sure of, the veteran and the wife separated and got divorced. The veteran subsequently remarried, but he passed away in the last few months before the government's announcement. The $25,000 went to his estate. Because the widow died in the past six months, the money has gone into her estate and will go to the children of the non-veteran. I have had this raised with me: is it very fair that the actual children of the veteran who was the prisoner of war get nothing but the stepchildren inherit the $25,000?
I know that when you draw up legislation you cannot draw up a rule to cover every one of these examples, but maybe under regulation there could have been some discretion given to make some payment. I call on the government to give this consideration. I do not think there are many cases, but I think the cases that are there are very heartfelt. It seems particularly hard to me that the children of the veteran do not get the money and the stepchildren of the non-veteran get the money. It is unavoidable; it is what the law says. Although this is not in this bill, I wanted to take this opportunity to raise it. I have written to the minister himself about Mr Lamb's case. He pointed out what the legislation says.
I have already raised in this place and with the minister the case of Jan Ruff-O'Herne, who is now a citizen, and I got a letter back saying that she was not eligible. I asked if the minister would support an ex gratia payment from the Minister for Finance and Administration of an appropriate amount in view of her suffering and her promotion and publicising of the terrible suffering of the so-called comfort women. She has just received a major award from the Dutch government, although she is now an Australian citizen, for not only the work that she has done in promoting the issue of the comfort women and compensation but also in going to the United Nations. As a result of her work, the issue of rape is now considered as part of the genocide descriptions of the War Crimes Tribunal and the International Criminal Court. That, in itself, is a major achievement for which, for a long time to come, Jan Ruff-O'Herne should be recognised. Again I say to the government that an ex gratia payment to her would be very appropriate. 
My time has almost expired. The opposition supports this bill. We have no amendments. I notice that Senator Harris is moving an amendment. I will hear what he has to say and have some further discussion in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-20,"—I speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2001 on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The bill gives effect to key initiatives in the budget in the area of veterans' affairs. Those initiatives are positive ones, and hence the Democrats support this bill. It will amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to fix recognised anomalies in the repatriation system, specifically initiatives to benefit war widows who lost their pensions upon remarriage and Commonwealth and Allied veterans who served alongside Australians during the two world wars and also to apply a change in recognition of superannuation to veterans' pensions that has already been applied to social security pensions as part of broader changes in the budget restoring the previous treatment that was in place until a few years ago.
The bill restores entitlements to war widows who remarried before 1984 and had their pensions cancelled. I understand that about 3,000 widows are expected to be affected positively by this measure. The Democrats have received many letters from widows on this issue, as have, I am sure, many others in this chamber. The bill also recognises the service of Allied veterans who served during World War I and World War II by granting them eligibility for the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Eligibility will be extended to Commonwealth and Allied veterans who are over the age of 70 who fought alongside Australians in either of the world wars and who have been resident in Australia for 10 years or more.
Finally, the bill will amend the treatment of superannuation assets for those over 55 years of age but under the pension age. As a result of these changes, the government will not include in the income test for social security pensions any money withdrawn from superannuation assets by this age group. The bill makes similar changes to the income testing of payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. While the Democrats welcome these initiatives, we believe it is appropriate to point out those areas in our repatriation system that still need reform and change and those areas that are being highlighted regularly by the various veterans' advocacy organisations around the country. When speaking to this bill, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs,  Mr Bruce Scott, said:
This government has always worked closely with the ex-service community to identify issues of concern and to address those issues.
Whilst this bill does address some of  those issues, quite clearly there are other issues of concern, some of them quite significant, that have not been addressed. The Democrats believe it is appropriate to highlight those on this occasion whilst acknowledging the positive measures contained in the bill. For example, we recently received correspondence from the National President of the RSL identifying the issues that they would like to see addressed in the lead-up to the federal election and these are consistent with the issues highlighted by many other veterans' organisations.
The seven issues of longstanding concern are: that eligibility for free medical and hospital treatment— the gold card—be extended to all qualified Australian veterans over the age of 70; that all non-qualified veterans who seek a social security pension from Centrelink should not have their DVA pension counted as income when the size of their Centrelink pension is calculated; that the new Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme recommended in the Tanzer report be enacted; that existing funeral benefits for veterans be lifted to $2,000; that the war widows income support supplement be unfrozen, or thawed, and indexed; that the Australian National Audit Office recommendation on funding assistance to ex-service organisations to allow them to hire more pension advocates be implemented; and that the Australian War Memorial be funded for extensions to the Vietnam and Korean galleries. 
It is appropriate to highlight these areas of ongoing concern to try to generate support from all parties and current and future governments to address these matters. The first issue—that eligibility for the gold card be extended to all qualified Australian veterans over the age of 70—is one which the Democrats have highlighted and supported in the past. I welcome initial signs of a possible turnaround by the Prime Minister on this issue on 26 July on ABC radio—I think in Perth—when he commented specifically on providing the gold card to Korean War veterans. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, admitted today that there was clearly `an overwhelming case that people who are veterans of later conflicts than World War II should receive the gold card at broadly the same time after the conflict in which they were involved took place, as was the case with people from World War I'.
The Democrats have long supported widening access to the gold card to all Korean War veterans once they reach the age of 70 years and believe the same policy should apply to Vietnam and other veterans. We also support extending access to those World War II service personnel who enlisted but were not sent into war zones, including BCOF members who served in Japan after 1945. Many veterans have written to me and to other Democrat senators, and I am sure to other members of parliament, about the gold card campaign. I have assured them that the Democrats recognise the special obligation the nation owes to veterans. They were healthy when they enlisted and they went where they were sent. If they need medical care now, I believe we have an obligation to provide it.
The second point, which is one that has been raised many times before in this place, including by the Democrats, is that non-qualified veterans who seek a social security pension from Centrelink should not have their DVA pension counted as income when the size of the Centrelink pension is calculated. When I first entered the Senate close on four years ago, on behalf of the Democrats I committed to raising this issue and trying to get it addressed and voted on in the Senate. It has been raised in Senate speeches and also in estimates committees through questions of the relevant minister. It was not until June last year, with the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000, that the opportunity arose to put the amendment. It was pleasing to see the support of the Labor Party, through Senator Schacht, for that amendment. Labor are strongly on the record as supporting the initiative. We will try to hold them to this in the future.
The bad news is that the amendment that was passed by the Senate was defeated twice in the House of Representatives by the coalition, so it has been unsuccessful at this time. I note that the then Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman, who was handling the legislation in the Senate, indicated that the government would examine the issue in a budget context. Unfortunately, we now know that the government, whilst they may have examined the issue, did not address it in the budget. This is despite the fact that a number of veterans I spoke to before this year's budget who had lobbied the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on the issue said they had received encouraging signs from the minister. It was disappointing for those veterans that there was no movement on this issue in the budget. If leaked memos that appeared prior to the budget are any indication, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs did recommend and did try to get this change made but he was knocked back by the Expenditure Review Committee, which is a great shame, because it is a clear-cut anomaly that has been identified for many years. Indeed, it was identified by the coalition in their own policy documents before they came into government in 1996. Throughout that time, whilst they have examined and acknowledged it, it has still not been addressed. It is still a clear issue of concern for many veterans' organisations and individual veterans. 
Another issue which was notably absent from the budget was the rate of the totally and permanently incapacitated, TPI, pension. TPI advocates have for some time been seeking an increase in the TPI rate, highlighting its loss of value against the male total average weekly earnings. The failure to index this pension to the male total average weekly earnings has meant that, unlike some other pensions, its value overall has declined over time. It is currently about 48 per cent of MTAWE and, although CPI indexed, has failed to keep pace with MTAWE. The Democrats support the indexation of veterans' pensions and compensatory payments to male total average weekly earnings or CPI, whichever is greater, as we do with regard to social security pensions. We have long argued that all pensions—including, for that matter, the war widows pension and the service pension—should be indexed more regularly: quarterly rather than six monthly.
Having read with interest the submissions from the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Servicemen and Women and the Vietnam Veterans Federation on the inadequacy of the TPI rate and their proposals for rectification of this matter, I have written to Minister Scott in the past expressing the Democrats' concern at the erosion in the rate of TPI and requesting that he take the issue to federal cabinet for consideration and addressing. Again, the government did not address this issue in the 2001 federal budget. I certainly hope that it will be an issue that does get some focus in the lead-up to the election.
Finally, I would like to briefly point to the issue of the war widows income support supplement, which has been frozen since 1986 at around $120 per fortnight. The widows who qualify for the income support supplement are often amongst the neediest in our community. The supplement is available only to those women who have no other income except the war widows compensation. Many have not worked outside the home, they have looked after their veteran husbands and they do not have superannuation. If they are renting, they are in particular trouble as rents certainly have risen quite a bit since 1986 when the income support supplement was frozen. Again, this is an issue that disappointingly was not addressed in the federal budget or in this bill.
However, the Democrats do acknowledge the measures that are addressed in this bill. Indeed, another measure in the budget that was also included was the payment to prisoners of war of the Japanese, a measure that we also supported at the time. But we are concerned that longstanding issues of concern for veterans continue to be ignored or not addressed by the government. Certainly the Democrats pledge to continue to try to highlight and be a voice for those issues of concern to the veteran community. Having said that, we do support this bill and the measures contained within it and congratulate the government on those. We do not have any amendments to move and will listen to Senator Harris's argument in relation to the amendments that he will put forward.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-08-20,"—I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2001. The bill refers to the veterans of World War I and World War II. As other senators in their speeches in the second reading debate have made reference to `other veterans', I will do the same, but in doing so I am in no way saying that any defence personnel is greater or lesser than any other. Last Saturday, 18 August, was the 31st anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. As I indicated to the members in the chamber earlier, I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate into Hansard a speech on the dedication of Vietnam Veterans' Day in Mareeba by John Newman. 
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
DEDICATION VIETNAM VETERANS' DAY Mareeba 2001
We of different faiths and some, perhaps of no particular faith, gather today as one to remember those of the Australian Armed Services who gave their lives in or a result of their involvement in the Viet Nam War.
We dedicate this day to their memory lest they and their noble deeds be forgotten and pass into oblivion. Like those of our nation who have deservedly won the respect and gratitude of its citizens in recent years in Peace Keeping Forces in various parts of the world, they went as representatives of Australia to Viet Nam. There they served with distinction and honour in accord with the highest standards and the very best of Australian Military tradition. But, unfortunately, they did not receive from all sectors of the Australian community the gratitude and respect which they deserved and to which they were justly entitled.
We dedicate this day also to all who survived that war, especially those who suffered physical and psychological wounds which, in so many cases, prevented their ever being able to resume their normal lives that were interrupted by their war and post war experiences. We dedicate this day too to their families and spouses who suffered along with them, especially when the damage of war service done to their lives made it impossible for them to resume the relationships that they had enjoyed and cherished beforehand.
The cost of war service is very high, its price list is long and varied. Lord God, may all in this nation remember with due gratitude every one of its Armed Service personnel who paid that price by being involved in the Viet Nam War.
BLESSING:
God our Father, we thank you for our gathering today. Grant to the surviving Viet Nam veterans gathered here on this occasion a convivial time together at the conclusion of this service, bless them with health and prosperity in the future and the opportunity to gather again in memory and solidarity in another years time. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen
—I thank the Senate. There are three major parts to the bill that the government is introducing, the main one being the extension of access to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, RPBS, for Allied veterans. These Allied veterans will come from countries such as France, Brazil, Canada, Singapore and approximately 40 other very interesting and varied countries, many of them with economies many times the size of our own. The list is obviously very long. I cannot declare more strongly that the responsibility for those veterans belongs with their own countries and not Australia. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs stated in his media release on 22 May this year:
... this Government has worked hard to advance the interests of Australia's veterans by addressing areas of need identified in close consultation with ex-service organisations.
That is very commendable. However, the first part of this bill extends pharmaceutical benefits to those who did not fight in World War I or World War II as Australian soldiers. They were not Australian veterans. Their only association with our men was purely on an Allied basis. They were not fighting as Australian soldiers but there solely by chance or association. They were neither Australian citizens nor Australian soldiers, and any benefits they are entitled to from their war service originates from within the countries they represented during their fighting years. I have great difficulty in agreeing to extending any benefits to any veterans other than our own, and I clearly indicate to the Senate that there I include—as I do in the amendments that I will move in the committee stage—those from New Zealand. So I find it difficult to extend any benefits to any veterans other than our own, irrespective of their resident time frame upon our shores.
This section of the bill does not even specify a condition for Australian citizenship. Any legislation that comes into being in this country should be based on conditions of receivership, based on people's uptake of their obligations as Australian citizens. It is to Australian citizens only that we owe our allegiance. People who choose not to take up Australian citizenship obviously do not have Australia's best interests at heart. It appears that the government has no limits in extending its largesse to all and sundry, with no reciprocal responsibilities or commitments required by those so willing to enrich themselves at our expense. There is no precedent for this level of generosity in any other country on the globe. We are truly a country of extravagant gifts. It leads me to cynically wonder if this is another vote buying exercise by the government. 
I reiterate my earlier comments about having a responsibility to Australian citizens. I would like to raise a couple of issues that were relayed to me last week from the Vietnam Veterans Association. The Vietnam Veterans Association at this time are camped on a pastoral property called Kalpawer in Queensland. It is not that they have not attempted to have their issue raised in the proper manner. They have approached the federal government; they have approached the Queensland state government. Neither of those governments has indicated a willingness to assist them. I travelled approximately 900 kilometres in a round trip to spend one evening with these guys. As I rolled my swag out beside them under the Southern Cross, they raised the very relevant issue that the flag of the country they had fought for bears the symbol of the Southern Cross. It was that same Southern Cross that we were sleeping under that night. They challenged any man or any government anywhere in this country to tell them that they cannot at their discretion camp out under those stars anywhere in Australia. I believe it would be a very brave government that would come out and say that they do not have that right after having served their country in that way.
Again I must ask the minister why this generous donation of taxpayers' funding cannot be more appropriately directed to our own needy veterans and their families. Many of these families are now acting as carers for their loved ones who are World War I and World War II veterans and who are now placing heavy nursing requirements upon their families. These family members would be only too grateful to have respite facilities to ease the burden and give them some degree of temporary relief. A loving, caring home environment is the optimal arrangement for these people. But even love has some limitations once exhaustion has set in. 
The opportunity for offering top quality health care facilities to these people should not be missed. We owe it to these soldiers. They, in the prime of their life, willingly offered Australia and its citizens their most precious gift, their lives. We should also recognise that, of those of the Australian Defence Force who went to Vietnam, 501 did not return. These people, the ones that we are speaking about this evening, are the fortunate ones who were lucky enough to come home. These people never asked for any special services, benefits or privileges. Australia took up the social responsibility to care for these returned servicemen as their needs arose. This was an obligation that we as a country owed to these people, an obligation that we took upon ourselves willingly and with gratitude. 
We also have to look at the looming responsibilities that we as a nation will have towards our Vietnam veterans when the time arises. These returned servicemen will require and expect relevant assistance when needed and no doubt will be justifiably resentful should there be any attempts to limit our liabilities while at the same time upholding payments to non-Australian soldiers. The logic is going to be very difficult to justify. 
I am aware that the rationale for the range of medicines and treatments on the RPBS and not on the general Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is that some conditions arising from war service and/or present in the veteran population should be covered. However, the examples quoted in the government's explanatory memorandum go to such things as nicotine patches and Viagra. These are argued to be needed for stress related conditions arising from war. Bandages are also covered under the RPBS, but not under the public PBS. Again, the ordinary elderly Australian citizen is not considered needful of such basic medical requisites, yet non-Australian World War I and World War II soldiers are. How do we justify the issuing of Viagra for stress relief for non-Australian soldiers while at the same refusing this medication for Australian citizens of the same or comparable age in equal need of the medication?
I reiterate my objection to this part of the bill and its granting of taxpayers' funds to soldiers whose only association with Australia was by accident, military orders, conscience or plain good luck and not by any direct loyalty to or empathy with Australia. I would strongly support this bill if the funds were restricted to Australian soldiers and their New Zealand counterparts, who were part of our heroic Anzacs. These gallant men were united by a combined goal to protect our South Pacific area, to the benefit of all. We have not only close economic ties with New Zealand but also close historic and defence ties. These links need to be recognised and supported. Thus, I will move an amendment that limits the benefits, with very justifiable reasons. 
The second major part of the bill relates to the reinstatement of widows pensions to those war widows who were foolish—and I say that with tongue in cheek—enough to fall in love and remarry before 28 May 1984. Others were more astute and married after this important date. 
These women did not choose to lose their husbands, but like their husbands they too were to be victims of the terror of war and they have had to live with the consequences ever since. With 107,953 war widow pension recipients at June 2000 and an estimated 4,000 war widows to be the recipients of this reinstated pension—at an estimated cost of $52 million to $65 million over four years—an asset test should be applied under some circumstances.
I have covered the sections of the bill that I think require the most attention and are therefore of the greatest concern. My justification for raising these issues is based on the use of taxpayers' funds in the most responsible manner, given our budget limitations and our social responsibilities, not only to our veterans and our war widows but also to our grossly underfunded health and aged care facilities. I feel these areas in particular are in dire need of massive injections of additional funds and, should conscience exist or even play a part in our decisions, I have placed on record my views on the justice and injustice of this interesting piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-08-20,"—I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2001. The sixth Howard budget delivered more benefits for the veteran community, and this bill deals with three aspects of those benefits. I think honourable senators have adequately canvassed the provisions in the legislation.
With the greatest respect to Senator Harris, his suggestion that we should not include veterans from other countries in the provisions of the legislation is not one that we as a government will agree to. His first argument was that some of these people came from economically stronger countries. I am not sure that any economy currently enjoys the growth rate that the Australian economy is enjoying as a result of our good stewardship. However, even if we were to talk about the overall strength of the economy, what about a Kenyan veteran or an Indian veteran? Do you say that the Indian government or the Kenyan government has as good a capacity to look after these veterans? I add that the qualification is that they have to be over 70 years of age and they have to have been resident in Australia for 10 years. So these are not opportunists who come to Australia just to try to cash in on some veterans benefits; these are people in the latter years of their lives who have been here for some 10 years.
I also say to Senator Harris that the assertion that this is somehow a vote buying exercise is most distasteful. If it were a cynical vote buying exercise, surely we would have made the legislation to the effect that you have to be over 70 and an Australian citizen. But the qualification is that you have to have been a resident for 10 years. As a result, a lot of people who do not even get the vote will benefit from these measures. Undoubtedly, there will be some other condemnation of the government for doing that, but you cannot condemn this as a cynical vote buying exercise.
The most amazing comment of Senator Harris's was that the Allied forces were somehow together solely by chance or association and that there was really no greater bond between them. I would invite Senator Harris to go to the Menin Gate, where the Belgian community pays great tribute to Allied veterans. I had the great honour to be there when they played The Last Post. They play that at 8 p.m. every night. They did it after World War I. There was a very short period after World War II when they could not do it. I stood there, tears welling in my eyes, thinking, `Eric, get a hold on yourself. This is embarrassing.' But I looked around and realised that everybody else was crying as well. 
I tell honourable senators who make comments like that that, when you experience something such as the ceremony at the Menin Gate or if you go to France and the Villiers Bretonneux—and you will never forget the Australians emblazoned in the school quadrangle—you will understand that the blood of these men and women who fought for freedom is intermingled in the soil of Europe and in the theatres of Asia. That intermingling of their blood was not solely by chance or somehow by mere association; that was a deep commitment by Allies right around the world who fought for freedom and for the values that have held this country in such good stead in its 100 years since Federation. To try to say that the Allied effort was just some sort of get-together that has not brought about a greater bond between those nations that fought for and won freedom, quite frankly, astounds me. I think that any Australian who has been to Gallipoli, or to the Menin Gate, or to Villiers Bretonneux or, I am sure, to many other places around the world, would take great exception to Senator Harris's contribution, which I think defies history and defies the personal experience of so many people around the world.
We, as a country, are very fortunate. We are in an economically strong and sound position. We, as a government, have made a determination that—I repeat the qualification, and it is a pretty stringent one—to survive for 70 years of life after you have been in the theatres of war is, in itself, a pretty good milestone. But then you also have to have been a resident of this country for 10 years. So it is not simple opportunism or that they have come here to gain some veteran benefit; they have to have been here for some 10 years. The fact that we are able to do this is indicative of our approach of trying to be as generous as we can be. Some, of course, criticise us because we have not made the gold card available to this group of veterans, and some people would want us to go a lot further. Senator Harris seems to argue that we should not go as far.
In relation to the references that the honourable senator made to the Vietnam veteran community, I am not quite sure—and I will have to seek detail or suggest that he provide detail to Minister Scott— what he meant by the reference to Vietnam veterans being able to sleep under the Southern Cross. I must say, with respect, that Senator Harris lost me. I am not sure of the detail of that. I am not sure whether it occurred on somebody's property. I am not sure of the circumstances. Suffice to say that the Vietnam community in this country got a terribly raw deal for a long, long time. The gesture of former Prime Minister Paul Keating, on behalf of the Labor government, to hold a memorial service in Canberra, was welcomed by the Vietnam veteran community and was a long overdue recognition. Might I add that it is one of those bizarre things in political life that if a Liberal-National Party government had done it then it may well have been seen as political point scoring. But the fact that a Labor government did it was very good and really healed a lot of the wounds from that conflict, from our involvement in it and, most importantly, from what I consider to be the shabby treatment of that veteran community until recent times.
We still have a long way to go, but since the initiation of the healing process by the Keating government—and I pay tribute to them for that—we have had the Vietnam Veterans Health (Morbidity) Study and we have sought to implement the recommendations of that. We are still following up on other outcomes of that to try to provide as much assistance as possible to the Vietnam veteran community. To say, `Let's support some Australian Vietnam veterans as opposed to some people who mightn't even be Australian citizens—heaven help us,' is to try to run the sort of politics of division that is not welcome in this country and that is especially not welcome within the community that we are seeking to assist with this legislation. It is a very unfortunate contribution to this debate, especially in the context of the veteran community. 
I turn to the comments of Senator Bartlett. I will not be too harsh on him because I understand that the Australian Democrats are supporting this legislation. In my weaker moments every now and then I think, `Oh, to be a Democrat.' You can promise everything to everyone without having to balance a budget. It is not what Senator Andrew Murray would call Realpolitik. Basically, we have to balance what we would like to do with budgetary restraints. Whilst I can accept that it would be nice to deliver on all the items that Senator Bartlett has raised, there would be certain consequences to the budget. As I have attended many RSLs in my home state of Tasmania and the state conference from time to time, I am pleased to report that, in general terms, the veteran community is pleased with the progress that we are making in dealing with the needs of the veteran community. Whilst we are able to deal with some issues at a time, it is virtually impossible to deal with all issues all the time. It is very easy for a party that will never have to make government policy to suggest what ought to be done.
I simply say that we, as a government, recognise that more needs to be done for our veteran community, and indeed for the Vietnam veteran community as well. Senator Schacht made some contributions and, for Senator Schacht, I thought they were quite gracious. He could not quite bring himself to say that this was a generous measure so as a result he had to use a double negative and tell us it was `not insignificant'. I think that really means that it was a significant measure and for that I thank Senator Schacht. I will deal with some of the issues that Senator Schacht raised. He raised the issue of the $25,000 compensation for the Japanese prisoners of war. My understanding is that special circumstances will certainly be considered, but of course not all circumstances.
—Sorry to interject, but is that from—
—That was from a note from the advisers—
 (Senator Murphy)—I suggest that we deal with the question in committee.
—If you are happy, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am happy to take the interjection, just so long as it—
—We will conclude the second reading debate and then we will deal with questions in committee.
—In relation to the restoration of the widows' entitlement, I understand that, as at Friday, 17 August, there had been 2,728 inquiries. The budget had estimated 3,000. Chances are that unfortunately some of those 2,728 will in fact turn out not to be eligible, so it is very hard to put a figure on that. In relation to the cost of pharmaceutical benefits, the numbers of veterans from Commonwealth and Allied countries can only be estimated based on the 1986 ABS survey and mortality rates, as well as DVA's own statistics and Health Insurance Commission data and Health and Aged Care figures. That is the basis of the calculations, but how exact they are will remain to be determined when these veterans make their applications. I thank honourable senators for their contributions in the second reading debate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-08-20,"—I rise in this adjournment debate to continue to read into Hansard the legal opinion of Greenwood QC. I continue from the previous debate and commence at item (d).
(d) other incidents of child abuse may exist and remain unaddressed;
and consequently, it may be open to conclude that the Queensland Government knowingly obstructed justice and obstructed the Murphy Select Committee from properly fulfilling its commission as set by the Senate in December 1994.
We are highlighting that there was knowledge within the Queensland Government and CJC in 1995 that what lay at the heart of the Heiner Inquiry was alleged misconduct of certain JOYC staff (and possibly others) engaging in suspected child abuse.
It is our strong view that the new evidence is so serious that it cannot be merely noted in 2001 but should be subjected to a fresh independent Senate examination.
For the benefit of the Senate, and prospective Federal whistleblower protective legislation, we have decided not to touch on every aspect of our concerns but to concentrate on the more substantial parts which go to supporting our position.
We submit that it is unconscionable conduct for any State or Federal Government, which claims to respect the rule of law and fundamental human rights to:
POINT 1:
knowingly order the destruction of public records containing evidence of the alleged abuse of children while in the care of the State or Commonwealth so that the evidence cannot be used, for whatever reason, in particular, holding public officials who were or may have engaged in such alleged misconduct to account (including their superiors who may have been aware of such conduct).
In this regard, there is evidence (yet to be fully explored by an appropriate body) suggesting that the Goss Government acted in an unconscionable and illegal manner when it knowingly destroyed relevant evidence for the purpose of affording protection to certain accountable Youth Workers and Mr Coyne over alleged offences of criminal assault against children (by whomsoever) placed in the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre by order of the courts or by statute.
The law required that their known alleged misconduct be properly and impartially addressed.
POINT 2:
knowingly order the destruction of public records in its possession and known to be required as evidence for foreshadowed court proceedings for the purpose of preventing those records being used in those proceedings.
POINT 3:
deliberately withhold or conceal relevant information concerning the real status of public records during an appraisal process from its State or Federal Archivist in order to achieve its desire to have such records destroyed by using the archivist's deceptively obtained approval to destroy such records when knowing that access to them is being sought by a citizen pursuant to law.
POINT 4:
buy the permanent silence of any public official from the public purse in a Termination State or Federal government Deed of Settlement about known alleged abuse of children in a State-run institution for the rest of his or her life.
In this matter, the Deed of Settlement of 7 February 1991 used as the instrument to terminate Mr Coyne's employment specifically made such demands.
At the time this matter came before the Senate, it was not disclosed that the following form of words in the aforesaid Deed of Settlement “...the events leading up to and surrounding his relocation from the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre” was about or could be argued to cover incidents of alleged child abuse in the period before the Heiner Inquiry was established.
Unquestionably the Goss Queensland Government knew that abuse of children was an issue of concern at the Centre. On 1 October 1989, the Hon Ann Warner, when Opposition spokesperson for Family Services, cited specific incidents of alleged child abuse in The Sunday Sun (1 October 1989 p 19), calling for the incidents to be investigated.
These incidents led directly to the establishment of the Heiner Inquiry, but it seems that other grievances of a similar kind going back to 1988 may have been aired at the Inquiry.
The drafting and use of such an instrument, coming from any government with the assistance of the Office of Crown Law, in effect, indirectly or directly authorises, or, at the very least, condones the abuse of children in State-run institutions.
We suggest that any Minister/officer or agent of the State/Crown, who possessed knowledge of the nature of these alleged unlawful events which they then specifically required not to be broadcast by inserting prohibiting clauses in a State/Crown Deed of Settlement, would be acting outside the law, and would be engaging in prima facie abuse of office, obstruction of justice and misappropriation of public monies for an illegal purpose if public monies were to change hands as part of such a termination of employment arrangement. The facts show that former Minister the Hon Anne Warner and her then Director-General Ms Ruth Matchett possessed such knowledge when executing the February 1991 Coyne/State of Queensland Deed of Settlement. 
In all these respects, the law is clear. It prohibits such conduct.
We also suggest that it is open to conclude that the contrived nature of Mr Coyne's so-called involuntary retrenchment pursuant to section 28 of the Public Service Management and Employment Act 1988 may have knowingly breached the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 such was the Queensland Government's rush and desire to rid themselves of him, and consequently may invite Federal intervention at that level alone.
By way of additional evidence showing the contrived and prima facie illegal nature of Mr Coyne's retrenchment, on 7 February 1997, Solicitors and Notary John Katahanas & Company, acting for Mr Coyne, lodged Writ (No 1130 of 1997) in the Supreme Court of Queensland. 
Mr Coyne claimed against the State of Queensland:
(a) damages for breach of contract, (b) damages for wrongful termination of employment, (c) damages for breach of statutory duty, (d) damages for deceit, and (e) damages for negligence;
against Ms Ruth L Matchett:
(a) damages for inducing breach of contract, (b) damages for breach of statutory duty, (c) damages for malfeasance in public office, (d) damages for termination of employment, (e) damages for deceit; 
and against both Defendants:
(a) interest on the moneys claimed in paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof pursuant to the provisions of section 47 of the Supreme Court Act 1965, (b) costs, (c) such further and other orders as may be just in the circumstances.
While Mr Coyne seems to have dropped the action after several months, we submit that the lodging of such a Writ in the Supreme Court of Queensland itself gives rise to the existence of suspected misconduct surrounding the manner in which his career was ended in February 1991.
As far as we know, no out-of-court settlement was reached pursuant to the aforesaid Writ.
We request that this grievance be placed before the Senate as soon as possible for consideration. Should the Senate decide to revisit the matter, then we would be pleased to provide a more detailed submission (supported by relevant case law), and, if necessary, to provide oral submissions, as would our client, Mr Kevin Lindeberg.
Yours sincerely
GREENWOOD QC
9 May 2001.
Madam President, I have risen to speak on this issue and read that QC's opinion into the Hansard because the Labor Party refused me leave to table it or incorporate it. 
Hansard records that the former Democrat senator John Woodley spoke passionately on this matter. Senator Woodley said about the Heiner shredding:
... it is totally unacceptable for any Australian government to send to the international community a signal that shredding public records to stop their use in court proceedings or to stop lawful access to them is acceptable conduct in our public and legal administration or in any aspect of public life at all. It brings our reputation as a nation governed by the rule of law into unacceptable disrepute.
I totally—100 per cent—support Senator Woodley's comments there and commend that the Senate accept Greenwood QC's legal opinion in the spirit that it has been read into Hansard, therefore accepting that the only way to assess whether the Senate has been misled or held in disrepute is to initiate an inquiry.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Whistleblowers: Heiner Case</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-20,"—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
For the purposes of answering this question:
the reference to “agencies within the Minister's portfolio” has been interpreted as those that are subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997; and
-	the reference to members of boards is taken to mean non-executive part time office holders. The terms and conditions of employment of full time chief executive officers have not been included. They are employed by the board of the relevant agency and do not receive any additional allowance for being a member of the board.
(1)	21. They are:
Australian Dairy Corporation
Australian Dried Fruits Board
Australian Fisheries Management Authority
Australian Horticultural Corporation
Australian Pork Corporation
Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation
Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation
Cotton Research and Development Corporation
Dairy Research and Development Corporation
Fisheries Research and Development Corporation 
Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation
Grains Research and Development Corporation
Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation
Horticultural Research and Development Corporation
Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation
National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals
Pig Research and Development Corporation
Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation
Sugar Research and Development Corporation
Tobacco Research and Development Corporation
Wheat Export Authority
(2)	No. The enabling legislation for each portfolio agency sets out the appointment processes.
The majority of boards are appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in accordance with the relevant legislation, except for:
-	the board of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation which is appointed by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation; and
-	all members of the board of the Australian Dried Fruits Board are selected and appointed by the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry does not have a role in the appointment process. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 enables the establishment of horticultural product boards and the Australian Dried Fruits Board is the only such board.
(3)	Yes.
