"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-11,—I table two supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to government amendments to be moved in relation to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5510:
Schedule 2, item 1, page 12 (after line 10), after subsection 10(6A), insert:
       (6B)    At least one member must have knowledge of or experience in the tourism industry or another industry associated with the Marine Park.
It is now two or three months since the second reading debate on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008, so I thought it might be useful for the chamber and for participants in the debate to recap briefly on the nature of this amendment and other amendments being proposed by the opposition. As the minister has just mentioned, the government has two amendments relating to prohibiting geological storage operations and in relation to the definition of fishing. Both those amendments from the government have been in response to calls by the opposition, both in this chamber and in the other place, for further work on those. So I am pleased to see that the government has taken the opposition’s lead and addressed those two issues, and I will speak more about them later.
The opposition, whilst generally supporting this bill as being appropriate for the management of one of Australia’s greatest natural icons, the Great Barrier Reef, does believe that there are some inefficiencies in the bill that need to be addressed. They are only relatively minor amendments but they would improve the operation of the bill, and we are certainly hopeful that other senators will support the amendments that we raise.
The first amendment, the one we are discussing now, relates to the new board of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. We are suggesting in this amendment that one of the board positions be for someone who has experience in industries associated with the Great Barrier Reef. I will speak a little further on that later. Senator Joyce is considering moving an amendment on the definition of fishing, which was raised in the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts. By all reports coming from that committee, the existing definition came under some scrutiny, and I notice that the government has also taken up that issue and has its own amendment.
Perhaps the most significant amendment being proposed by the opposition—and I hope it will be supported by all senators—relates to the convictions that were recorded against people breaching the green zones when the green zones were first dramatically altered and increased, back in 2004 I think it was. This was an initiative of our government for all the right reasons, although many would perhaps not agree with that. It was an initiative that the then Howard government brought in to protect even greater areas of the Great Barrier Reef. This, of course, continues the coalition’s very strong support for this natural icon that was initiated back, I think, in the Fraser years in declaring a marine park in the Great Barrier Reef area. The amendment is in line with the coalition’s strong support for the Great Barrier Reef over many decades through legislative action, which, as I say, was initiated by the coalition government.
When the zones were increased, a fairly dramatic enforcement and penalty arrangement came into place. There were some quite substantial fines and the offences were treated as criminal offences. There were quite substantial fines—ranging anywhere from $500 up to, I think, some at $60,000—but, as well as that, the convictions gave criminal records to those convicted. In many cases, these were mums and dads out fishing with the kids in the wrong area. They were fined quite substantially but, in addition to that, they had a criminal record which many found in years to come would inhibit them in certain ways. One person at the inquiry gave evidence that his application for insurance had been treated differently because, when he was answering a question, he had to indicate that he had a criminal record. There were other instances of people travelling overseas who had trouble getting visas because they had to disclose that they had a criminal record. And there were many other instances that were brought to the attention of senators. I particularly acknowledge Senator Boswell, who has been on this case for some time, as have I—and I know Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon have been concerned about these issues as well.
The then government, after a couple of years of this legislation, realised that this was really using a sledgehammer to crack a nut—as they say—and realised that, whilst the fines were appropriate, this having of a criminal record was quite inappropriate for this type of offence. So the then government changed the arrangements so that on-the-spot fines could be issued. These infringement notices then became the norm, and the infringement notices issued to offenders still involved very substantial fines. So there was a real penalty involved. But, with the use of infringement notices, there was no criminal record on the offenders—most of whom, as I say, were family people out for a day fishing in the Great Barrier Reef who went into the wrong zone, either deliberately or innocently, and that attracted a substantial fine, and no-one argues about that. So the criminal conviction matter was dealt with by the infringement notices.
So, post 14 December 2006, most of the people breached for conflicting the green zone laws got this infringement notice and paid a fine but there was no criminal record. Those who had been convicted under the old legislation—before 1 July 2004 and 14 December 2006—were left with the monetary penalty and, in addition, they had a criminal conviction recorded against them. The coalition—through approaches from the recreational and commercial fishing industry and through, as I say, a lot of good work done by Senator Boswell, amongst others—brought this matter to notice, and the previous government indicated in 2007 that it would legislate to remove the criminal convictions of those people convicted between 1 July 2004 and 14 December 2006. This was agreed to not only by the coalition but also by the Labor Party, the then opposition. The then opposition spokesperson, Senator O’Brien, in, I think, Townsville, when approached regarding this issue, said on behalf of the then Labor opposition—and I am sure Senator Boswell will quote his words later, but they are well recorded—’We should have a bipartisan approach to this; we should both adopt the same thing.’

Senator Boswell interjecting—

—Well, more than that, Senator Boswell. He gave the clear impression that the Labor Party was at one with the coalition in addressing this issue. Unfortunately, the then government was not in a position to amend the law when the parliament resumed after the election. We thought and hoped that the current government would honour its election commitment to change the law, but it has not done so. We have inquired about it at estimates on a number of occasions, and I and a lot of other people have written a lot of letters to the government about it, but it has found a deaf ear with the government. So, as a way of implementing not only what the coalition promised but also what the Labor Party promised before the election, we have come up with an amendment.
That is the background to the amendments that are going to be moved by the opposition. I just want to deal briefly now with the amendment before the chair, which relates to at least one member of the board having knowledge of or experience in the tourism industry or another industry associated with the marine park. Appointments have been made to the board, as it now stands, by the current minister. An Aboriginal person, Melissa George, has been appointed—and that appointment is appropriate. Mr Russell Beer, a solicitor from Cairns, has also been appointed to the board. He is a very significant businessperson in Cairns, in Far North Queensland, and he has had a role in government advisory committees previously and is involved with Advance Cairns, which a sort of business-commercial and government promotion bureau in the Far North Queensland area—and that is quite an appropriate appointment.
But neither of the appointees, as far as I am aware—and I do not know either of them terribly well personally—has any direct experience with the Great Barrier Reef. I assume Mr Beer, as a solicitor in Cairns—and I once used to practise that profession in North Queensland myself—would be doing things related to the Great Barrier Reef, but his principal activity is commercial law, which I understand he does very well. But I think the board would benefit by having someone on the board who had direct experience in relation to the Great Barrier Reef.
Our amendment says ‘the tourism industry or another industry’, and that could be a fishing industry, a boating industry or anything that has a relationship to the reef. I would certainly like to have someone nominated by the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators considered by the minister as an appointee to the board. I say that because the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators—a very good organisation—are very responsible people who understand that their future depends on keeping the Barrier Reef in a very pristine condition. In fact, they already spend a lot of their own money dealing with the crown-of-thorns starfish and in many other ways enhancing the unique experience that is the Great Barrier Reef.
There are very substantial monetary benefits to Australia from tourism activity on the Great Barrier Reef. Many thousands of Australians are employed by the tourism activities along, across, near and adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. The administration of the marine park would be better served if we could be assured that there would always be someone there who had some direct experience on the reef. I understand that these are not representative bodies—at least, I understand that that is the government’s position; it was certainly the previous government’s position. They are not representative board members. They do not represent anyone in particular. They are there because of their experience and expertise, as board members, related to the Barrier Reef. But it would certainly benefit the administration of the authority if there was someone there who had a direct and constant association with the reef, an understanding of what is happening day by day, week by week and month by month, an understanding of how the reef acts and an understanding of the importance of the industries that are associated with the reef.
I guess the government would say, ‘Well, look, we’ll consult widely and we’ll appoint people to the reef.’ That is the prerogative of the government. But I think that this amendment would ensure that the government, when picking whomever they like, at least would pick someone who has that direct experience and direct connection with the reef. I urge all senators to support this amendment. It has no cost and is otherwise unexceptional as an amendment, but I think it would improve the bill before us.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-11-11,"—I would like to touch on the amendment that has just been put forward—the industry representative—but I also want to touch base on something else that was shared just before about the convictions of some people up in Queensland, which was alluded to by Senator Macdonald. To remind people of this issue, there were at least 115 and up to 324 fishermen who were deemed to be criminals by the previous federal government for innocently dropping a fishing line in waters that were part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I think everybody accepts that copping a fine for straying into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park green zone is fair enough, but there was nothing really fair about these hundreds of fishermen having a criminal record against their name. If they did the same thing today they would not have a criminal record. So we have here a situation in which people were previously caught under a law that was not right and in December 2006 it was changed—
—Who changed it?
—I will take the interjection. In actual fact it was the Howard government that changed it.
—It was me.
—Let me continue if I may. Family First has supported all the attempts by these fishermen to clear their names and has spoken out on their behalf to highlight the injustice of their situation. Family First raised the issue directly with the then Prime Minister, John Howard, last year and then with the current Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, this year. Family First raised it with the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Johnston, and then with the Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, this year. Earlier this year Family First also moved a couple of motions in support of the fishermen.
To deem these people as criminals is an outrageous act. These people have had a stain on their reputation, which has compromised their ability to have the freedoms that others have when they travel, and sometimes even to get a job, due to putting a fishing line in the wrong area. These are average blokes, average Australians. They are recreational fishermen. Granddad has taken the kids out to dangle a line and pass the time with the family or a group of mates in a tinny—many people can relate to that—and they have made a genuine mistake. As I alluded to before, the Howard government acknowledged that it had made a mistake in December 2006 and fixed the problem by downgrading the offence to an infringement with a $1,100 fine. But the issue here, the injustice that it is not a fair go, is that fishermen still carry the mark of their conviction. It has not been removed, and they still pay the price for the Howard government’s mismanagement of the issue.
Family First supports the amendment that will be coming up a bit later, which will see that the fishermen have their criminal convictions spent. We were originally going down the process of a pardon, but can fully understand that a spent conviction effectively does the same thing. So I can understand that that is perhaps a cleaner way of doing it. Moving the amendment here later on is certainly a good way of going forward if it has the support of the coalition. Basically, a spent conviction will remain invisible to all, and removing the stain from the lives of these fishermen will be a great relief to many. I also think that, when you can realise that a mistake has been made and you clean it up, it shows that this is a fair Australia. It is a pity it has taken so long. The fishermen have had this hanging over their heads for quite a while. I make it quite clear that I will be supporting the amendment which will come up later and which will see the convictions for these fishermen as being spent, and I support giving these fishermen back their lives.
With regard to the amendment being put forward here—industry representation—the problems and the hassles that we have had with these criminal convictions show that it would make sense to have more industry representation. Family First will be supporting that amendment as well.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-11,"—I will deal with each amendment as they come up, rather than taking a lot of time now on each amendment, which I will only repeat later. The Greens will not be supporting this amendment, which deals with the industry representative. The amendment gives one industry specific representation on the authority. I know that the opposition suggests that an Indigenous person has representation. The Indigenous representation is specifically on the authority because of their knowledge and experience of Indigenous issues. That is particularly important for management of such an important area. This authority is not a representative body but a merit based body. We do not believe that there is justification for picking out the tourism industry for representation on this body. Everybody else will be there on the basis of merit except the tourism industry person, who will be there because they are a representative.
If we are going to a merit based body, we do not believe that it is appropriate to be mixing the two. We believe that there is nothing to stop a person with industry experience from being appointed to the authority under the current arrangements. The authority will be undertaking extensive consultation processes, which, if carried out properly, will be sufficient to ensure that the point of view of the tourism industry and other industries will in fact be taken into account. So we do not support the tourism industry being made a special representative on the board. We believe that the process outlined in the current bill is appropriate to deal with the merit based authority. Having said that, we do strongly support the appropriateness of having on the authority an Indigenous person with special knowledge and experience on Indigenous issues relating to the park. We specifically believe that it is important that we do have that knowledge and experience on the board. We will not be supporting the opposition’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-11-11,"—This legislation will bring a tragic saga to a close. This started out as a tragedy and I hope that we can salvage something out of the legislation by passing the amendment that Senator Ian Macdonald and I have moved. To go back a few pages on this, it started off with GBRMPA deciding that they wanted 25 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef for biodiversity regions called regional area programs and then upping that to 33 per cent. I do not blame GBRMPA altogether; we were in government, we made the mistake and we are trying to fix it up today—admittedly six or seven months later, but we are going to achieve that by the fact that Senator Xenophon and Family First, I believe, are going to support this amendment.
We started off saying that the legislation was going to cost $1.5 million or maybe, rounded up, $2 million—but $255 million later! That is what it has cost this government to buy out the fishermen, to pay the net makers, to reimburse the boat builders, to reimburse the outboard motor people and to reimburse the people who process the fish. That is an overrun of $235 million. If you were running a business, Senator McLucas, what would you do to an accountant who came to you and said, ‘This is going to cost $3 million’ but then it cost $255 million? You would sack him on the spot, and I would say that he deserved it. Unfortunately, this is what happened with GBRMPA. GBRMPA told the government that it was going to cost about $2 million. We know that there will always be a bit of an overrun on these things, but $255 million! That is what the Howard government was in the hole for and it paid out.
One of the things that we did find out when the legislation went through was that people were going to be imposed with a criminal conviction. On 7 July 2004, I raised this matter in the coalition party room and we got the criminal convictions changed to infringement notices. So people received a good hefty fine but they were not burdened with a criminal conviction. That left in limbo the people who had been convicted from 1 July 2004 to 14 December 2006. The amendment moved by Senator Ian Macdonald is trying to repair the damage.
It looks as though this amendment has the support of Senator Xenophon, who is always open to look at things openly and correctly; and the senator from Family First. So it looks as though this is going to go through—and I welcome it, because I went out and campaigned on this just before the last election. Just before the last election I went into the Prime Minister’s office and said, ‘This is a nonsense; this is wrong—it is morally wrong to convict these people.’ He agreed and he gave me a set of words that said we would fix it up if we were re-elected. Well, out on the campaign trail I went, as you do, about explaining your policies to the people. I was quite clear. I said, ‘If we are re-elected we will repair this damage to those people who have a criminal conviction.’ Not to be out done, Senator Kerry O’Brien, then shadow minister, said of the Howard government that it was holding fishermen’s votes to ransom. And he announced that it was ‘beyond the pale’. An article in the Townsville Bulletin said:
 ‘Frankly, it is an indictment on this government—
the Howard government—
that they are prepared to play politics about the issues,’ Mr O’Brien said. ‘Those who have been convicted have had these convictions sitting against their names for some time. Why couldn’t the government act before today?—
A fair question. It goes on:
Mr O’Brien said an elected Labor government was also sympathetic to overturning the criminal records of the 324 fishermen convicted for the offence. ‘This is about correcting the initial mistake, and we would take the bipartisan position on that’ he said.
I would be very interested to hear Senator McLucas, because I do not think the government is going to honour Senator O’Brien’s commitment. I do not think they will. If they do then I will be the first to stand up and congratulate Senator McLucas for seeing the light. She does come from Cairns and she does represent these 324 fishermen who have been convicted. She has an office in Cairns. I know many of these people would have called on her and explained the wrongness of this decision. If she is representing North Queensland she will stand up and say, ‘Senator Boswell, you are wrong. The Labor Party is prepared to back this amendment moved by you and Senator Macdonald.’ I hope that is right. I think you are basically a very fair sort of a woman.
—Only basically?
—Well, I will un-qualify that: you are a responsible person. That statement will be tested by the decision you take on this legislation. But I will be the first person up to congratulate you when you say that you support this amendment.
I also want to take into consideration some of the evidence that was given by GBRMPA to our committee. I am shorthanding this, but GBRMPA said, ‘Look, we’re not going to fine people straight away. We’ll warn them. If they’ve got a GPS or a plotter with a downloaded zoning map on board, we’ll fine them. If they attempt to flee when we approach, we’ll fine them. If they attempt to obscure vessel registration numbers when surveillance flights pass or if they’re fishing within a metre of a sign advising that fishing is not permitted in the area, we’ll fine them. And if they over-reach their bag limit, we’ll fine them. Only when these things happen will we take the step of fining these people.’ Well, that is blatantly untrue. In the submission of GBRMPA, that was untrue. Then GBRMPA said, ‘Don’t worry about a criminal offence; it’s not going to make all that much difference.’ GBRMPA said, when the matter of insurance was raised, that it would not prevent insurance being issued unless the conviction raised questions about moral character. They told the committee:
We have similar advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the Australian Passport Office has advised that criminal convictions are not a basis for revoking or refusing the granting of a passport.
That is completely untrue. For GBRMPA to take a position which can be so blatantly shot down they must think we are a bunch of village idiots over this side of the chamber. We were given evidence that on both these issues their position was completely wrong. What did happen was people who took their grandson out in a tinnie got fined $1,000. They did not know that they were in a zone; they did not have any GPS on the boat. They did not have any way to find out. They acknowledged that they may have been in the wrong place, they started their outboard motor, pulled their line up and went away—but they got fined $1,000 for taking their grandson out. That is the case of Mr Alfio Maccarone from Innisfail, Senator McLucas—very near Cairns. Then there was the case of Peter Summerville, who went out fishing with his wife and was fined $1,200 and got a criminal conviction. His wife was fined $840 and got a criminal conviction. It is totally unfair. We have tried to change it. Today is the day that we can put this behind us and remove those criminal convictions from people’s lives.
One of the most powerful submissions we had was from a young guy who worked around people’s homes cutting lawns, doing duties and so forth. He said, ‘This is influencing my life.’ He and his brother came down from Cairns to go fishing and they put the boat in at Innisfail, or somewhere similar. ‘We thought,’ he said, ‘that the Barrier Reef Marine Park was out where the Barrier Reef was. We fished about half a mile offshore. We put the anchor out and within half an hour someone came and told us we were fishing in the Barrier Reef Marine Park green zone. I now have a criminal conviction. I have a young family. If I leave this job I will never be able to get another job.’ He was quite worried. He was a pest exterminator and he did other jobs around people’s houses. He said, ‘How would people like me to be going through their house exterminating pests if they knew that I had a criminal conviction?’ And yet GBRMPA said, ‘Don’t worry about a criminal conviction. It is not going to affect your passport, your insurance or anything else.’ Yet we have direct evidence given to us that all these things are taken into consideration. Senator Macdonald raised the question of a businessperson—a swimming pool manufacturer—who was not able to get insurance. He was going through the insurance process and he found that when it came to the question of possession of a criminal conviction he had to say, ‘Yes, I have.’ Their response was, ‘Well, sorry. We will ring you; don’t you ring us.’ So he was rejected. So, today is the day I hope the entire parliament can join with us—every senator: whether Green, Independent, Labor, National or Liberal—and support this amendment in order to right what was blatantly wrong and to remove the criminal convictions from most of these people. Some of the more severe ones we will not be able to get to, but we will remove the criminal conviction from every amateur fisherman and from most of the professionals.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-11-11,"—In relation to the proposed amendment that Senator Boswell has spoken of regarding spent convictions, I can indicate my support for it for these reasons: following discussions with the minister’s office—which I found very useful—and, of course, with the opposition and from representations I received, it seemed that there clearly was an intent to change the law on 14 December 2006. It was an acknowledgement that the earlier law allowing for convictions had, in a sense, gone too far; that there was a concern that individuals were left with the stain of a criminal conviction and that it was causing significant distress to many of those who had received a conviction. There was a debate as to what the appropriate level was—whether it should be $2,000, $5,000 or $10,000. It seems that a limit of $5,000 would deal effectively with recreational fishers by and large, but anything beyond that would be going more into the realm of the commercial fisher. It is not, though, a perfect solution. There was an alternative suggestion that there should be a pardon by the government in relation to these convictions. That, to me, seems to be an extreme solution for the problem. There was a discussion about retrospective expunging of the convictions. That does not seem to be appropriate. The convictions will be spent in any event under legislation, but what is being proposed here allows for an acceleration of the time frame for the convictions to be spent. Given the legislative change on 14 December 2006, given indeed what the then opposition said in the lead-up to the last election about this whole issue, I think this is an appropriate way forward.
In relation to the other amendment on the composition of the board, I agree with Senator Siewert that it is appropriate that there be an Indigenous representative. That is entirely appropriate, and it is important. In relation to the amendment moved by Senator Macdonald, I have one significant reservation with it. I do not have a problem with there being a representative of the tourism industry; because I think the tourism industry knows that for it to thrive in that area it needs to have an environmentally sustainable, very viable, marine park. I think they have a vested interest in facilitating all that can be done to ensure that outcome. I do take issue with the reference to ‘or another industry’. That would give the minister the discretion to appoint someone from, for instance, the fishing industry, and I think there could well be a real conflict of interest there. If it were to be limited to the tourism industry, I would be amenable to that amendment. I note that this is still an appointment to be made with the authority of the minister, and so there is still significant ministerial discretion. I just do not feel comfortable with that discretion being extended to an industry other than the tourism industry because I can see a potential conflict of interest if the fishing industry were to be invited onto the board.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—I want to briefly respond to Senator Siewert’s issues. Senator Siewert said, quite rightly, that it was important to have an Indigenous person on the board. As I initially indicated, it is a government amendment. It is in the government’s bill and it is being supported by the opposition. I also mentioned Melissa George as an appropriate appointment. Senator Siewert acknowledges that that person has knowledge and experience of the Barrier Reef and of cultural issues relevant to it so she, for that reason amongst others, supports it. But why does the same not apply, Senator Siewert, in relation to the tourism operators? Again, they have the actual knowledge and experience and, as Senator Xenophon has just said, the pristine state of the Barrier Reef is perhaps more commercially important to the tourism industry than it is to anyone else. The tourism industry would have as much interest as even the most ardent environmentalist in making sure the reef is properly managed.
Again, as Senator Xenophon points out, these are ministerial appointments. It is not the industry appointing someone. That is up to the minister. The minister has discretion. There can be five people on the board—a chairman and up to four others. There is currently a total of only four, but it can be five. I think it is appropriate that one of those five board members should be an Indigenous person and that another should have real and direct knowledge and experience of the Great Barrier Reef. It is up to the minister to appoint whomever he likes. Senator Siewert said that the authority would be consulting before the appointment. Of course, it is not the authority who appoints the board members; it is actually the minister. Sure, the minister will consult. It is entirely within his discretion, as I understand it. But this amendment will require that, of the five people whom the minister has to pick, one will be an Indigenous person and another will have direct involvement in and knowledge of industries on the reef.
Taking into account what Senator Xenophon said, and subject to a short consultation with my colleagues in the chamber, I indicate that I could amend my amendment by deleting the words ‘or another industry’. The amendment would read:
At least one member must have knowledge of or experience in the tourism industry associated with the Marine Park.
I will think about that. Perhaps it does not even need the words ‘associated with the Marine Park’. I will give notice of an alteration to my amendment by deleting the words ‘or another industry’ in the hope that it may encourage Senator Xenophon to vote for the amendment.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Senator Macdonald, are you foreshadowing an amendment or moving an amendment to your amendment?
—I am in the committee’s hands as to how I procedurally go about this. I thought I just had to indicate that I wanted to amend my proposed amendment by deleting those words. As to how I technically go about that, I seek the advice of the chair.
—The amendment is before the chair. It will be put in due course. If you seek to amend the amendment before the chair, you need to seek leave to do so.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I will do that shortly.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-11,"—I want to address a couple of issues there. Senator Macdonald, I am sorry if the remarks I made before sounded as though I thought the authority would be consulting before someone was appointed. That is not the point I am trying to make. When the authority makes decisions and considers important issues, it will consult widely—in other words, it will of course consult those who use the park. My argument is that you do not need someone with specific experience or expertise on the board of the authority because they will be consulted when these decisions are being made.
I believe there is a vast difference between the knowledge and experience that an Indigenous person brings to the park and someone who has a vested interest in it. I am probably going to upset some people in the tourism industry with these remarks, but some in the tourism industry are more exploitative than others. Unless you are going to define this person as being a certain type of tourist operator, it will be left up to the government to decide who that person will be and what sort of experience they will bring to the board. Some in the tourism industry are quite exploitative of the natural environment; others, of course, are very good and protect the natural environment. I think they bring a range of experience that the authority can consult when making its decisions. I do not believe it is appropriate to have on the authority a representative who has a vested interest in the tourism industry. You know very well that, next minute, we will have on the phone the mining industry and the fishing industry also wanting to be represented on the authority. We Greens do not believe that is appropriate. As I said, we believe that having an Indigenous person appointed as a member of the authority is important, because of their special relationship with the reef, and we support that in the bill. We do not support the amendment because we do not believe it is appropriate to have industry represented on this authority, but they will be consulted through the process. I want to clear that up for Senator Macdonald, and I apologise if it came across in another way.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

In moving this amendment, can I just say to Senator Siewert: yes, you certainly will upset tourism operators—you are quite correct on that—by suggesting that they are anything but absolutely 100 per cent supportive of the marine park. As I have indicated before, even if they were not that way inclined, their commercial interests would demand that they look after the reef because that is what they actually make their money from.
I have learnt a fair bit about the Barrier Reef over the years, and I cannot think of a tourism industry on the reef that would cause damage to it. The operators take boats out on the reef. They spend their own money, with some government support, on picking up the crown-of-thorns starfish so that in the areas where they take their dive platforms for tourists to go swimming there are pristine reefs. As I said, they spend a lot of money on sending divers down to physically pick up starfish one by one. That is only a drop in the ocean, one might say, but it is certainly something that they do. They are also very particular about any material being thrown overboard from the boats.
I just cannot think of any tourism organisation along the Barrier Reef that would in any way do anything that would damage the reef. They are even very careful about human waste in Barrier Reef waters. They talk about it with their customers. They are very particular. I am desperately trying to think of any industry along the Barrier Reef that could cause damage—even those operating island resorts. Why do you go to a Barrier Reef Island resort? Because it is pristine. The reef is there; there are clean beaches; there is native flora and fauna on the islands. They are particularly involved in that.
Again—if I can convince the Greens, although I am hopeful it will not be necessary—it is the minister’s appointment. At the moment he can appoint anyone. All we are saying is that one of the five has to be someone who has direct and immediate experience on the reef. We are putting that forward because we think it will enhance the ability of the authority to properly manage the reef. So I would again urge support.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-11,"—The ‘tourism industry’ is a very broad definition. Are hotel operators, resort owners and developers tourism operators? I think I heard Senator Macdonald imply that they were tourism operators, so the term ‘tourism industry’ is very wide. I would be reluctant, for example, for a developer to class themselves as part of the tourism industry because they are building a hotel. Are charter boat operators part of the ‘tourism industry’? As we know, some of those people have actually been convicted—I am not going to stray into an argument about the offences—under this legislation.
—No, they have not.
—Yes, they have been; commercial operators have been. If they are charter boat operators, are those commercial operators, whether they be tourism operators or fishers, classed as being part of the ‘tourism industry’? This definition is very broad. I am very reluctant to support the amendment when it has such a broad definition because I do not think it is appropriate that developers, who potentially are going to exploit the Barrier Reef, be on the authority. That is one of a number of reasons that we have some concerns about the amendment. Even with the amendment that removes ‘any other industry’, we will not be supporting it because it is too broad and we are concerned about the protection of this very important ecosystem which is facing a number of threats. We do not believe that it is appropriate to have the tourism industry represented on the board. We do believe it is important that they are consulted and we believe that if process is followed they will be consulted appropriately in the management of the reef.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-11,"—In my contribution I want to focus specifically on this amendment. Many other speakers have talked about a range of issues, and I understand the motivation for doing that, but I am going to address the amendment—as amended, in an interesting piece of policy development—which goes to the question of the membership of the board of the authority.
The government does not support the proposal moved by Senator Macdonald to allocate one extra position on the board to a person who has knowledge or experience of the tourism industry associated with the marine park. It is interesting to note that we debated a similar issue when I was sitting over there and Senator Macdonald was sitting over here. It was around the question of whether or not we needed an Indigenous person on the board. It was, I think, at the end of 2006. The argument from the government at the time was that you did not need anybody with specific experience; you needed generalists who were interested in the long-term management of the authority. I differ with that in terms of Indigenous representation because Indigenous people are the only people who can represent Indigenous interests. That is why at the time I advocated that there be a specific position for an Indigenous person on the board. That has occurred, and Senator Macdonald now says that it is with the support of the opposition. It is a slight rewriting of history, I suppose, but that is not the point we are arguing.
At that time, the government—Senator Macdonald’s government—did not try to move that there be on the board a person with tourism or other industry expertise, and one would wonder why. The answer is very straightforward: because the then government did not think it was appropriate. Senator Abetz actually made a very important contribution. He said:
… if we start picking and choosing with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which has such a large and extensive range of interests associated with it, I daresay we could get a list with over a hundred different categories and classifications on it …
It is not often that I agree so strongly with Senator Abetz, but I suppose in this case he was making a good policy point and I think that policy point stands. He went on to say:
… tourism is clearly vitally important, the various rural sectors on land that might have an impact on the reef, the building sector, a whole range of scientific sectors and climate change experts. Quite frankly, the list could go on. In my own portfolio area of fisheries, undoubtedly there would be recreational fishing interests, commercial fishing interests—the list could go on.
Senator Abetz was absolutely correct then and he is still right now. We appoint people to the board of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on the basis of the contribution that they can make to the ongoing management of the park. When we were in opposition there were a number of excellent members of the board. I think the two most recent appointments are persons who will continue the tradition of providing good management advice to the authority for its ongoing work. We do not need specific interest groups to be represented, because there are other, very broad-ranging ways in which not only the tourism industry but in fact all industries that are associated with the reef are consulted.
We have four reef advisory committees providing direct engagement of key stakeholders on the issues of tourism and recreation, fishing, water quality and coastal development, and conservation and heritage. So there is a reef advisory committee which goes directly to tourism and recreation. We have 11 local marine advisory committees, LMACs, in regional areas right up and down the coast. We also have regional offices of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in Cairns, Townsville and Mackay.
The government is also establishing an advisory body, as recommended by the 2006 review. That process will allow engagement with all sorts of industries, including the tourism industry. As I said, we have two excellent appointments, Melissa George from Townsville and Russell Beer from Cairns. As Senator Macdonald quite rightly said, Mr Beer is a solicitor in commercial law who is extremely well regarded in the north, not only in Cairns but also in Townsville, with well known solicitors MacDonnells Law. He is very well regarded and extremely well connected in the business community and a person whose appointment I very much support.
So this amendment is not required. We simply do not need to quarantine one spot on the authority board for one particular industry. Senator Abetz got it right then. It was the right policy then; it remains the right policy. For consistency’s sake, I suggest that the now opposition stick with the policy that they had then because, as I said, Senator Abetz was right.

(Senator Humphries)—The question is that the amendment, as amended, be agreed to.
Question agreed to.

(Senator Humphries)—We will move to amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 5600.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-11-11,"—The issue here is a little bit complex. I dare to say that I will also be asking the minister for advice on some of the following issues. The issues surround what I believe is not only an onerous and very prescriptive statement proposed for a certain act but also a model of prescription that could be taken into other sections of law. It could set a very dangerous precedent in Australia. I also note that the government itself is proposing an amendment to this. I hope that in discussing this people see it in the light of how they would feel if this was a prescription in other sections of law, even terrorism laws and laws such as that. As it stands, item 9, subsection 3(1) of the bill says:

fishing means any of the following:
searching for, or taking, fish;
attempting to search for, or take, fish;
engaging in any other activities that can reasonably be expected to result in the locating, or taking, of fish;
placing, searching for or recovering fish aggregating devices or associated electronic equipment such as radio beacons;
any operations at sea directly in support of, or in preparation for, any activity described in this definition;
aircraft use relating to any activity described in this definition except flights in emergencies involving the health or safety of crew members or the safety of a launch, vessel or floating craft of any description.
Although it may be put aside by the court, the inclusion of aircraft use in attempting to search for fish is an absolutely ridiculous concept. Someone could be flying over the coast, looking out of the window and saying, ‘I’m now over a green zone and I’m looking for fish,’ and they would be engaged in a criminal activity. This is prescriptive to the nth degree.
I acknowledge that the government must have seen the same thing and have put forward an amendment. The question now is, however, whether this article in this amendment to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, or GBRMPA, would be relied upon for a criminal conviction or whether a criminal conviction would actually relate to something defined in the zoning plan. Which article would the courts use for the interpretation of this action? If they would use the zoning plan and not GBRMPA, then unfortunately both my amendment and the government’s amendment are without cause, and obviously I would therefore look for another avenue to take. The amendment proposed by me is also on behalf of other people in the opposition who have the same concerns—not so much pertaining to fishing but to an overprescriptive definition. If you allow that on one issue, you must be prepared to see it later on in law on other issues. If the court would rely upon GBRMPA then it is the government’s definition as opposed to mine.
I have put both definitions beside one another as a means of comparison. I see that, in the government’s definition, they have certainly curtailed the initial onerous definition of item 9, subsection 3(1) with a new subsection 3(1)(c). However, in so doing, it is still talks about ‘engaging in any activity in connection with taking or attempting to take fish’. I still see that as being overprescriptive. Does ‘engaging in any activity in connection with’ mean that, if I am on a boat with someone who, whilst on the trip, says, ‘I’m going to go fishing in a green zone,’ I am ‘in connection with’ his activity? If I am driving along with someone and unbeknownst to me they have fishing equipment in the car and intend to go fishing, am I ‘in connection with’ that event? The definition of being ‘in connection’ with ‘attempting to take fish’ also heads into an area that is too grey. ‘Attempting to take fish’, I believe, is too grey.
That leads me back to the amendment that is proposed, which basically, in summary, takes away searching for or taking fish and puts in something substantive, which is just taking fish—the action itself. This has been taken out in lines 26, 27 and 29. In liaising with my colleagues it is a point where there is some comfort, and I thank Senator Brandis for his assistance on this. Basically what we are doing here is making sure that there is no room for an overzealous court to go beyond what is precisely the action. I put forward to the government first of all whether they will clearly spell out what is the requisite act on which the premise of a conviction would be based. Secondly, in going through the explanatory memorandum and trying to define it myself, I notice that they talk about the moving of the definition by the GBRMP Act section 38CA to the interpretation section. Is the interpretation section, as noted in the explanatory memorandum on page 53 of 73, the zoning plan? I think those things need to be cleared up. If the GBRMP Act is the requisite act that will be relied on then I will continue forward with my amendment. If it is not the requisite part but it is actually the zoning plan, then neither my amendment nor the government’s amendment will have any effect.

(Senator Humphries)—Senator Joyce, do you seek leave to move your three amendments together?
—I seek leave to move the amendments at this stage. I suppose I can seek leave to withdraw them later on.
—There being no objection, leave is granted.
—by leave—I move the amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 5600:

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I was going to give the opportunity for other speakers to speak if they wanted to. In response to Senator Joyce’s comment, can I say that, as the running sheet indicates, these amendments are in conflict with, and it says similar to, Senator Joyce’s, but I think similar is probably a stretch. I am suggesting I will speak in favour of government amendment (1) on sheet RE380, which is the next item on the running sheet, conjointly.
The amendment that the government is moving is in response to questions that were raised during the Senate inquiry, and it is appropriate that the government respond to those questions. Our amendment will clarify the definition of ‘fishing’ in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. During the Senate debate and during the inquiry into the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts, concerns were raised about the definition. The committee recommended that the definition be reviewed with the aim of clarification. The proposed amendment to be moved by the government delivers that clarification while preserving the integrity of the regulatory scheme.
As under current legislation, under the amended definition a person can only be considered to be fishing illegally in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park if in an area closed to fishing if they have taken a fish, attempted to take a fish or are engaged in activities that are clearly a constituent part of taking or attempting to take a fish from an area of the marine park that is closed to fishing. An example is using fishing equipment or a fish aggregating device in zones closed to fishing. It is and will continue to be for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that someone has taken or attempted to take fish in an area of the marine park closed to fishing. Senator Joyce’s amendments go to a so-called definition of fishing—
—I will explain that later.
—Right. Thank you. Senator Joyce’s amendment goes to defining fishing as not searching for but taking fish. There has been a case that has been in the media in North Queensland about a gentleman who traversed a green zone with a line out the back of his yacht. He was convicted for fishing in a marine park. You have to ask the question: why was the line hanging out the back? Was he searching for fish? I think you have to say he was. But simply because there was not a fish on the end of that line, under your proposal you could argue that he was not actually searching for fish. I think that that would then cause there to be significant debate in the legal system, including the DPP, because you have got to include the searching for fish along with the attempting to take fish in a definition of fishing. It is a linear process. You search, you attempt and then you take. All of that process is in fact fishing. I suggest to the chamber that Senator Joyce’s attempts to say that, if you are in a Qantas jet flying up to Cairns, happening to go across the reef, and you look out the window—this is what Senator Joyce has suggested, perhaps in fun—you could be prosecuted for searching for fish.
I think we have to be very careful here. We know that we are playing the game of politics and the idea is to try and get people to support you, but let us do it on the basis of fact, let us do it on the basis of what is sensible and reasonable. If I am driving down the Bruce Highway towards Fishery Falls and someone says, ‘I’m going to go out in a boat today into a green zone to search for fish,’ are they likely to be prosecuted? Of course not, Senator Joyce. Let us be sensible about this.
This amendment that we are proposing, which will be dealt with next, will in fact clarify, as requested by the Senate committee, the definition of ‘fishing’—something that is extraordinary, for the people in the gallery, to have to define. I think we all know what it is, but we have provided that definition. Therefore, the proposal moved by Senator Joyce is not required. Senator Joyce, you asked for clarification on the interaction between the act and the zoning plan.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-11,"—The bill includes an offence of breaching the zoning plan. Under the zoning plan, fishing in certain zones is prohibited, as you are very well aware. The zoning plan defines ‘fishing’ as taking or attempting to take a fish. It is this definition that is relevant in determining if an offence has been committed. The definition in the bill is only relevant once the offence has been proven. It is used in determining whether a higher penalty applies because the person was fishing using a commercial fishing boat.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—I have distributed to Senator McLucas and to other senators an unsigned and undated advice from the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts in relation to this definition. I will seek leave at a later time for this letter to be incorporated in Hansard so it can be used in any future hearing, regardless of what happens to either Senator Joyce’s amendment, which the opposition support, or the government’s amendment, depending on how it is dealt with by the Senate. In our dissenting report, we indicated that if you are looking at only the green zone offences then, according to this information, the existing definition is okay. Senator Joyce’s amendment deals with the wider bill and other issues. In relation to the marine park zoning issues and offences, according to this advice, to be convicted you would use the definition of ‘fishing’ in the zoning plan not the one in the act. That indicates that you actually have to take a plant, animal or marine product. The wider definition does not apply to offences under the zoning plan, according to this advice. After Senator McLucas has had an opportunity to confirm with the department that this document contains their advice and that it is accurate, I will seek leave to incorporate it into Hansard so in the future people can have that clear explanation—which I think is along the lines of what Senator McLucas just said to the Senate.
Senator Joyce’s amendment deletes ‘searching for’, and Senator McLucas gave an example of ‘searching for’ as a line over the back of a boat going through the marine park. I refer Senator McLucas to the second part of this advice from the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts in relation to ‘attempting’ under the Criminal Code, which would apply to this. The offence of attempting would, I think, cover the situation spoken of by Senator McLucas, in that if you have a line over the back you would be attempting to catch a fish. Attempting to commit any sort of offence is covered under this legislation as well as by the Criminal Code.
In support of Senator Joyce’s amendment, if a marine park tourism operator is out on the reef in a glass-bottom boat and wants to show overseas visitors a big school of fish, they would use their depth sounder on board to find some and they would say, ‘We’ll stop here and this is where you can dive in and have a look.’ The government’s proposed amendment states:
Fishing means any of the following:
                         …                   …                   …
(b) engaging in an activity including searching for fish or using fishing apparatus or using fish aggregating devices in connection with the taking or attempting to take fish.
That tourism operator may run foul of that, though I think I am answering my own question because it is in connection with taking or attempting to take fish, so perhaps my example does not apply. There could be a doubt there, so perhaps what Senator Joyce is saying is appropriate and needs to be supported.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-11,"—I did not wish to speak before the minister previously because I wanted to hear the minister’s answer. The Greens will be supporting the government’s amendment to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. I am just foreshadowing that. We thought the previous bill was okay but we think there was a lot of misunderstanding of the bill in the second reading debate and in committee, but the government’s amendments do clarify things so we will support it. We will not be supporting Senator Joyce’s amendments basically for similar reasons to that pointed out by the minister. We think you need more detail on the definition of ‘attempting to fish’ and the issues that Senator Macdonald was just talking about. I do think you answered your own question in terms of those activities having to relate to attempting to take fish or having the apparatus to take fish.
I also bear in mind the comments that the parliamentary secretary made—that is, that this has to be dealt with through the legal process. You have to provide evidence, and that was something that was also brought up during the committee proceedings. In fact, the briefing that the committee had prior to the committee proceedings was that all of this goes through the legal procedures. There are such things as being able to prove that people were in fact attempting to take fish or searching for fish for the purposes of taking fish.
We do not support the opposition’s amendments. We will be supporting the government’s amendments. We are also mindful of the fact that this is also linked to the issues around proving an aggravated offence, and we are mindful of the complexity of those issues. We will therefore be supporting the government’s amendments but not the opposition’s amendments.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-11-11,"—In the comparison of these two issues what is clearly spelt out first and foremost is that, in relation to people who go fishing, definition 9 in subsection 3(1) was completely onerous. It has now been agreed to by the government. They obviously believe that their own legislation in the first instance was onerous; otherwise they would not be changing it. I am glad to see that. But we are still left in the position where ‘engaging in any activity’, including searching for fish using fish apparatus or using aggregating devices that are associated with attempting to take fish, leaves us in a very grave position. With regard to the interpretation of ‘any activity whatsoever’, I do not know why you need to say ‘including’ because if it is any activity it is any activity—full stop. But, for the purpose of attempting to take fish, there is the question of attempting to take them with what prospect of success. Who is going to be the arbiter of that? I believe that good law is law that errs on the conservative side but this is erring to the expansive.
I hear Senator Siewert’s and the Greens’ position, but they have endorsed it in the belief of an expansive and overarching definition of an act. Once you believe in that concept, you cannot chop and change. You therefore have a position where in other legislation before this chamber you will allow the use of expansive descriptions in a law, one that not only talks about what you are doing but also talks about what you may be going to do according to the interpretation of a third party.
‘Engaging in any activity’ does not close that definition down—it does not say ‘in any activity’ and then have some sort of caveat that mitigates its connection to ‘attempting to take fish’. So any activity relating to attempting to take fish will become something that is once more revisited in papers up and down the coast. Certain people who enforce the law will be within their rights to use, if they wish, an expansive interpretation of ‘attempting to take fish’. What the opposition has done, in consultation with others, is to take this down to something that leaves no shadow of a doubt as to whether you had broken the law—that when you were caught, you were caught.
I also endorse the fact that if someone is going through a green zone with a line dragging off the back of the boat they are obviously in the process of fishing. But this goes way beyond activities that could be regarded as attempting to take fish. In that regard, ‘any activity’ might be just having a line rolled up in the boat while going across a green zone. It is a matter of interpretation whether you are in the process of attempting to take fish simply because you have a fishing rod in the boat.
It becomes onerous when we have government erring towards being big brother rather than working hand in hand with people on the coast. This is a resource that has got to be shared by all. It is a tourism resource, it is a fishing resource, it is a natural heritage resource and it is a recreational resource. It is not just exclusively something that you should only be able to be involved with if you are standing on the beach looking at it. I am a bit surprised that the Greens would adopt a position where they are endorsing laws that deal not only with what you do but also with what people might perceive you might be doing to do.

Inquiry into the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 — additional information

The following forms an addendum to the submission to the above inquiry from the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.
The addendum provides further clarification regarding the definition of “fishing” proposed by the Bill and additional information on prosecutions for recreational fishing offences.

Definition of “Fishing”

To be charged for fishing in a prohibited area in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a breach of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 (Zoning Plan) must be established MI the first instance. The definition of fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 197.5 (GBRMP Act), as proposed to be amended, does not determine what is and is not a breach of the Zoning Plan and therefore an offence. This is determined exclusively by the definition of “fishing” in the Zoning Plan (which is not proposed to be amended) and through application of Criminal Code provisions relating to attempted offences.
The Zoning Plan regulates use of the various zones of the Marine Park. This includes restrictions on “fishing and collecting” in certain zones. The Zoning Plan defines “fishing and collecting” as “taking a plant, animal or marine product”.
The GBRMP Act in its current form, and also as proposed to be amended, makes it an offence to engage in conduct that is prohibited under the Zoning Plan.
The Criminal Code Part 2.4 provides that “attempting” to commit an offence can itself be an offence. In this respect, the Criminal Code notes that, for a person to be guilty of attempting to commit an offence, “the conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence”, and that whether or not this is the case is a matter of fact. It is for the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that a person attempted to commit an offence. At this point, the definition of fishing in the Act (as proposed to be amended) does not come into play. An offence will have been committed if:
a person engages in conduct that is “fishing” (within the meaning of the Zoning Plan), in a zone where it is prohibited; or
a person attempts (as provided for by Part 2.4 of the Criminal Code) to engage in “fishing” (within the meaning of the Zoning Plan) in zones closed to fishing
In the case of only circumstantial evidence, the court is required to draw the inference most favourable to the accused.
This would be an offence of engaging (or attempting to engage) in “prohibited” conduct (Bill Schedule 6, Item 24, 38BA).
It is only once a breach of the Zoning Plan has been established, that the definition of fishing in the Act and Bill, as proposed, is used in the classification of offences for the purposes of determining potential penalties. That is, the prosecution can seek to classify the conduct constituting the offence as “fishing” using a “commercial fishing vessel”. Here, the definitions of “fishing” and “commercial fishing vessel” in the Bill are applied. If these additional elements are proven beyond reasonable doubt, a person can be convicted of an “aggravated offence” (Bill Schedule 6, Item 24, 38GA). If it is not proven, the person is convicted of the “base” offence of engaging (or attempting to engage) in “prohibited” conduct (Bill Schedule 6, Item 24, 38BA).
In other words, the purpose of defining “fishing” in the Act, and reason for its scope, is to classify an offence as “aggravated” only once a breach of the Zoning Plan has already been established.
The definition of “fishing” in the Act does not extend, modify or qualify what can be considered “fishing” for the purposes of determining whether a person has engaged in, or attempted to engage in, conduct that is prohibited under the Zoning Plan. Only the definition in the Zoning Plan and application of the Criminal Code are relevant in this context.
In summary, the Bill includes a definition of “fishing” carried over from the current GBRMP Act, with only one change - “processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken” has been removed from the definition. The definition in the Act and the Bill as proposed is used in the classification of offences for the purposes of determining potential penalties. The offence currently is, and under the Bill would continue to be, determined by the definition of fishing as described in the Zoning Plan and the application of the Criminal Code.

Recreational Fishing Convictions

Attached is a summary of the facts and sentencing remarks of all persons prosecuted for recreational fishing offences committed in the period 1 July 2004 to 16 December 2006. The summary is a “Comparative Sentencing Schedule” prepared and maintained by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP). It is provided to Magistrates and defendants by the CDPP in the context of a prosecution. Its purpose is to facilitate consistent sentencing by providing Magistrates with information on the penalties imposed in cases of similar circumstance. It is also provided to defendants in the interests of procedural fairness.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I thank Senator Coonan for her question, which is very similar to the question she asked me yesterday. I think I told her all that I know about the subject yesterday, and I am not going to be able to add much to my remarks. I do not quite understand the intense interest in this issue. I have been moving through the community in the last few weeks—ethnic communities, cricket matches et cetera—and no-one has actually raised this as a matter of national concern with me. Maybe I am not moving in the right circles. As I indicated yesterday, the President of the United States has consistently emphasised the importance of the G20 in its response to the global financial crisis. The Prime Minister did speak with President Bush to discuss the role of the G20 in responding to the global financial crisis. I do not think there is any accuracy in the suggestion that the President was not fully aware of the role of the G20. As I understand it, the White House, the United States Ambassador and the Prime Minister have confirmed that the President did not make the marks that have been attributed to him in the article in question. Therefore, it seems to me that all the relevant parties have made it clear that the alleged commentary was never made and was inaccurate. The United States Ambassador has said publicly that, as far as he and the American government are concerned, the matter is closed. I have no further information in relation to the role of the Australian Ambassador in Washington. I can take that part of the question on notice and see if I can be more helpful to the senator, but I am not able to help her with that specific part of the question.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Diplomatic Protocol</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-11-11,"—Mr President, I have a supplementary question for the minister. What else is the government doing to help pensioners affected by the financial global crisis?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Pensions and Benefits</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I thank Senator Polley for the good question. The instability in the world financial markets has taken its toll on the investments held by Australian pensioners. The failure and diminishing value of investments affect both the income and the assets of Centrelink customers. The government are closely monitoring the global financial impact. We have taken a number of concrete steps to ease the financial pressure on pensioners. Recent decreases in the official interest rate to 5.25 per cent mean that the social security system needs to be adjusted to take account of the decreased returns on deposits or other investments. Deeming rates are set to reflect returns on investments available to pensioners and other income support recipients.
On 9 November 2008, Minister Macklin announced that the government will lower the social security deeming rates by one per cent. The changes will be delivered by Centrelink, as the primary service delivery agency for government that is responsible for payments of the order of $60 billion per year. The deeming rules are a central part of the social security income test and are used to fairly assess incomes for financial products. Deeming assumes financial investments are earning a certain amount of income regardless of the income they actually earn. However, as interest rates fall, the return available from cash based deposits will also fall as banks lower interest rates.
The government’s decision acknowledges that many pensioners and social security recipients who also rely on own-source income have been adversely affected by the global financial crisis. This is a simple and fair way to assess the income from investments and will reflect the recent reduction in interest rates and the impact of the global financial crisis. The deeming rates will be lowered from four per cent to three per cent for the first $41,000 of a single pensioner’s financial investments, or $68,200 for a couple, and from six per cent to five per cent for the balance over these amounts. This is good news for those Centrelink customers who are part pensioners.
As a result of these changes, less income will be assessed in respect of financial investments for Centrelink customers. Centrelink customers whose rate of payment is currently impacted by the amount of income they receive from financial investments will receive an increase in payment. The changes will come into effect from 17 November 2008 and will be applied to customers’ payments automatically. Customers do not have to contact Centrelink. These measures will apply to all payments, allowances and income support supplements paid by Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
The lowering of the deeming rates means that part-rate pensioners paid under the incomes test with financial investments—mainly in term deposits, shares, managed investments and other accounts—may receive an increase in their pension payment to reflect the reduction in their assessable income. It also means that some self-funded retirees whose deemed earnings meant that they were ineligible for a part-pension now may be eligible. This may be the case where their deemed earnings previously placed them just above the allowable income limits. Again, individual results are heavily dependent on individual circumstances. Self-funded retirees who think they may fall within this group should contact Centrelink. They should not—and I encourage them not to—self-assess. Pensioners already paid the maximum rate will have no change to their pension payments. The government will of course continue to act decisively to maintain the integrity and fairness of the social security system in the face of the ongoing events in the financial markets and the wider community.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I thank Senator Polley for the supplementary question. It does bring us to what the government is also doing in this area. In light of recent declines in the value of shares and managed investments, the government has also instructed Centrelink to undertake a system-wide re-evaluation of all shares and other financial assets held by pensioners, to ensure that the new value of their holdings is used to determine the rate of pensions they receive. The re-evaluation took place on the weekend of 1 and 2 November, and pension payments were affected from 3 November. Market data from mid-October has been used to update these assessment values. It ensures that pensions take into account recent market fluctuations. The process has updated the records of more than 840,000 customers who receive a pension from Centrelink, most of whom are age pensioners.

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Further information in response to Senator Hanson-Young’s Question without notice yesterday (Monday 10 November 2008) on ABC Learning Centres
Points taken on notice:
When was the Minister first informed of the troubles with ABC Learning?
Who are the members of the Child Care Industry Taskforce?
Given a spokesperson for Minister Gillard has confirmed that Don Jones of 123 Careers has met with the Taskforce, what other stakeholders has the Taskforce entered into negotiations with?

Talking points:

The Government has been monitoring the developments of the financial difficulties at ABC Learning closely this year.
On September 24 the Deputy Prime Minister established the Child Care Industry Taskforce in her Department which immediately established contact with ABC Learning Directors and their lending syndicate
Up until 2 November ABC Learning Directors, and its lending syndicate were indicating that ABC Learning was aiming to trade itself out of current financial difficulties.
As Senators would be aware, ABC Learning was placed into voluntary administration and receivership on Thursday 6 November.
The Child Care Industry Taskforce is lead by Group Manager, Michael Manthorpe in the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. He is joined by other senior officers with experience in legal and financial natters, early child care and education policy and communications. The team is supported by various other areas of the Department and in regular contact with agencies across the Australian Government and the states and territories
The Taskforce continues to work closely with a number of ABC’s significant stakeholders including the banking syndicate providing funds, the receiver, McGrath Nicol and the Administrator, Ferrier Hodgson, and the LHMU.
As Senators would be aware Parliamentary Secretary McKew is also in regular contact with early childhood education and care stakeholders.
She has been consulting with stakeholders since the election of the Rudd Government including more than 50 stakeholder meetings, 25 child care centre visits and forums have been held in each state and territory.
A Forum with around a dozen peak national child care organisations is being held in Canberra today. The agenda also includes a discussion of the ABC Learning situation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,5,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-11-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked today.
The Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has once again highlighted the reason why he should not be in the ministry, let alone in the cabinet. His ineptness in question time today was highlighted by his incapacity to answer a single question that was put to him, other than one. It was this one: ‘Does the minister agree that Australian manufacturing is expected to continue its historical decline over coming decades?’ He was very definite on that. The answer was no—absolutely, no—and then he went on some tirade. Embarrassingly for this government, the statement that I included in my question was lifted word for word out of the Labor government authorised document on which the Labor Party seeks to build its emissions trading scheme.
So what we have had highlighted today is the Australian Labor Party in full flight with its spin—talking down manufacturing to promote its emissions trading scheme but talking up manufacturing when talking about industry. You see, the government cannot have it both ways. They speak to the Australian people with a forked tongue. They speak out of one side of their mouth when it comes to emissions trading and out of the other side of their mouth when it comes to the manufacturing sector. To use a term employed by the Prime Minister, he has to level with the Australian people and actually tell them what the government believe. You cannot have this spin, which is so diametrically opposed in two separate portfolio areas. The government have to bring the spin together and tell us what the actual substance is. Either they support the Treasury modelling, and therefore say that that is a sound foundation for their emissions trading scheme, or they reject it—as Senator Carr, the minister for industry, did during question time—and thereby undermine their whole emissions trading scheme.
But of course it does not come as a surprise to those of us on this side of the chamber that Senator Carr has got himself into this great difficulty, because these people only consider spin; they are never worried about substance. A new car plan for a greener future is a wonderful 21-page document, we are told—until you realise that page 2 is blank, page 4 is blank and page 12 is blank. They have put blank pages in this document to try to pad it out a bit, to try to give it substance. But when you ask, ‘Where is the substance?’ there is a chapter called ‘The details’. I started to get excited. I thought ‘The details’ would put some meat onto the bones. So in this 21-page document—in fact, it is only an 18-page document—the details are contained not in 12 pages or 15 pages but in three pages, in a chapter called ‘The details’ on pages 9, 10 and 11. So Labor say to the Australian people, ‘We have the details in three pages for the spending of $6.2 billion’—that is at the rate of over $2 billion per page. And the government say, ‘We’ve got a serious plan for the car industry.’ Of course they do not—and they know it. That is why this pathetic document has to be padded out with three blank pages, to try to make it weighty—to give it some weight in the event that somebody actually were to put it onto a set of scales. Of course, the real scale that this document is going to be weighed on and measured against is that of its results. We had the minister claiming all sorts of wonderful results today—and we will keep him to that.
But I will return to the point on which I started, and it is this: the government have today been caught out by their own overspinning. Sure, they love taking the egg beater to any issue and trying to whip it up, but today the meringue has collapsed on them. It has absolutely collapsed on them, and in fact it is all over Senator Carr’s face because he spun a bit too much and what he said today in question time is a complete contradiction of that which the government is relying on to sell its emissions trading scheme. I invite the Prime Minister to intervene to sort out this mess, to give some certainty to the car industry and also some certainty to the government’s approach to the emissions trading scheme.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,"<title>Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research</title>",Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-11-11,"—That contribution by Senator Abetz really just demonstrates the absolute poverty of the position of the opposition in respect of this issue. For five minutes we heard Senator Abetz complain about the government having confidence in the manufacturing industry. The fact that we had confidence in the future of the manufacturing industry seemed to upset Senator Abetz so much that he felt he had to get up on his feet for five minutes and attack us for the audacity of having confidence in one of the major industries in this country—one that contributes over 10 per cent to Australia’s economy. How dare we have confidence in this economy! And I guess that demonstrates the position that the opposition used to have when they were in government. They did not care about the manufacturing industry. They did very little to support it. They never had a plan for anything. And they want to attack us because we have a plan, we have a strategy and we have a vision for the manufacturing industry.
We do not want to be part of a country that makes nothing. But that is what the previous government, the now opposition, set us on a course to achieve: to be a country with no plan, no vision, no strategy and no hope. That was their vision for Australian manufacturing, but it is not this government’s vision. We are proud of standing up for manufacturing and we are proud of the announcements that were made yesterday, specifically on the vehicle industry—and I will go through some of those in a minute. All the previous government did was to throw some token money at an industry. Did they say to the industry: ‘We want to help you develop into new technologies; we want to help you take the next step; we want to help you position yourself for the next decade, the next two decades, the next 50 years, for the sake of our kids’ jobs, for the sake of our industry, for the sake of working families’? No, there was none of that. It was simply a case of throwing a bit of money here and there, with no plan for the industry, no assistance. It was a pathetic response from them when they were in government, and what a pathetic response we just heard from Senator Abetz, attacking what is a most visionary plan—the comprehensive industry strategy plan that has been outlined by Senator Carr and is 100 per cent supported by the Prime Minister.
A New Car Plan for a Greener Future will provide $6.2 billion in assistance over 13 years. It will revitalise an industry that is critical to the Australian economy and the Australian community. It demonstrates the government’s commitment to manufacturing, its commitment to innovation and its commitment to providing Australia with high-quality, high-skill, high-wage jobs—something the previous government, the now opposition, represented by Senator Abetz, simply do not care about and have discarded. Their view of the industry when they were in government was that it had no hope—’Don’t worry about it.’ That was a shameful position and it was a shameful performance by Senator Abetz in this place today.
Labor’s New Car Plan for a Greener Future consists of a new, better-targeted, greener assistance program called the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which will run from 2011 to 2020 and provide $3.4 billion to the industry, not just as a handout but in strategic placement to generate investment to ensure that the car companies investing in this country invest in new technologies and place this industry—and place Australia, by placing this industry—at the forefront of technology and at the forefront of manufacturing. That is our vision—a vision that we wish was shared by the opposition.
Senator Abetz came in today and asked the question:
Does the minister agree that Australian manufacturing is expected to continue its historical decline over coming decades?
When the minister answered ‘no’, Senator Abetz was upset because there was previous Treasury modelling that indicated that there may continue to be some decline but that does not take into consideration the massive investment that we announced yesterday. We announced that because we have confidence and we are going to put in a plan to make sure that that historic decline, which happened under the previous government’s watch, does not continue. What did we see? Senator Abetz got up and said, ‘But it will continue.’ He was disappointed that this government does not share that pessimism. He was absolutely devastated that this government does not share that pessimism. He wanted to score a point by saying that we were wrong; we should be pessimistic about the industry. That is what he wants. That is what he sees as a victory because that is what he stood for when in government and that is what he stands for now as shadow minister for industry. It is a shameful performance and he should hang his head in shame. (Time expired)

—You’re just as bad, Bananaby.
—I think that interjection is a breach of standing order 184, Senator Marshall. So if you want to retract it, you can.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Marshall, who generally is regarded with some respect on this side of the chamber, is guilty of a significant breach of etiquette in this place in interjecting across the chamber when Senator Joyce had only just risen to his feet. Senator Marshall used what I think are insulting references to Senator Joyce, and I think you ought to ask him to retract his remarks.
—I apologise, but I was in conversation with the Manager of Opposition Business when Senator Joyce started his remarks, so I did not hear what Senator Marshall said. If Senator Marshall feels that he should withdraw the remarks then I invite him to.
—If other senators are offended, I am happy to withdraw.
—We heard Senator Marshall say that they have a plan, they have a vision and they have a strategy. Unfortunately, we are relying on their previous form in how they are going to deliver this. That is the problem with the Labor government—their form in delivering things is so fundamentally misguided. We have had a clear example lately of Labor Party form. We saw Labor Party form with the $10.4 billion stimulus package, which was delivered with no homework. That figure was just plucked out of thin air. Is this the sort of form, substance and diligence that has gone into this program? We saw the form of the Labor government with the bank guarantee, and now we see the fallout of that form being delivered as a complete insult to the car industry. We now have trouble with organisations like GMAC and GE. Finance for the purchase of Australian cars has fallen through the floor because of the form of the current Labor government and their complete and utter ineptitude in the delivery of these packages. It is Labor Party form and ‘diligence’ that is leading the Australian car-manufacturing industry into a period of crisis. The Labor government delivered the luxury car tax, which has actually brought a reduction in the sales of Australian manufactured cars. It is this Labor Party form that we query.
The coalition has a complete record in supporting the manufacturing industry. In fact, one of the greats of my party, ‘Black Jack’ McEwen, was instrumental in bringing structure and support to the Australian car-manufacturing industry in 1963. McEwen talked about bringing about an effective and stable protection of employment and investment in this area. Our position and our history of looking after the car-manufacturing industry are absolutely on the board. I find it completely insulting to hear Senator Marshall talk about the investment that the coalition government put into the manufacturing industry as tokenism and throwaway money. That is a sign of the imprudence and improvidence that characterise this government.
It also will be interesting to see the form of the Labor government when it comes to the emissions trading scheme and how it will affect the manufacturing industry. How many more jobs are you going to send overseas because of your form, your lack of diligence and your tokenism in the way these plans are delivered? The coalition’s argument is not about support for the car-manufacturing industry—it never was. The argument, as always, is about the Labor Party’s capacity to be diligent, to be prudent, to put the homework in and to deliver a package that actually has efficacy and an outcome. There is nothing in the form of the current Labor government that they can clearly put their hand on and say, ‘We delivered a well thought out and specific outcome that can be judged by results.’ There is not one result that this Labor government can put on the books. They have the highest inflation rate and the highest interest rates. Unemployment is going through the roof and manufacturing jobs are leaving our shores. Their form is in their score, and their score is disastrous for our nation. How long will they go on delivering this belief in some nirvana that is waiting out there for us, when they completely and utterly lack any capacity to deliver an outcome for our nation now? We will judge this as it comes before Senate inquiries, and I will bet London to a brick that Labor’s form in this package matches precisely their form in the other packages that they have brought to this nation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,"<title>Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research</title>",Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-11-11,"—Talking about form, I think the Labor Party and the government can speak on our merits and also on our decisive action to make sure that we do not slip into any desperate steps. Obviously, the opposition does not appear to be onside on this point. Global financial systems are experiencing the most significant upheaval in living memory. Here we have the opposition trying to tear things down and trying to throw rocks in a situation where we are able to put security and confidence back into the economy by putting forward legitimate proposals such as the $6.2 billion Green Car Innovation Fund, which was announced yesterday. It balances the economy and the environment.
This is one of the initiatives that we have considered and contemplated to ensure that we provide prosperity in the future for working families. It will help ensure that our economy emerges in strong shape so that we can provide quality jobs and security for working families into the future. This package will result in over $16 billion of additional investments by the automotive sector. It is not about the government putting money forward for a foolhardy suggestion; it is a bipartisan arrangement, with the industry putting money back in, which is essential for both the climate and the economy.
The auto-manufacturing industry is no doubt the pinnacle of manufacturing in Australia. I will go through some of the elements of the plans. We will have an expanded Green Car Innovation Fund of $1.3 billion, brought forward to 2009 and running over 10 years; we will have a better targeted and greener $3.4 billion assistance program for the Automotive Transformation Scheme, the ATS; we will have changes in the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme in 2010, consistent with the Bracks review; and we will have $116.3 million to provide structural adjustments through mergers and consolidation of the components sector and to facilitate labour market adjustments. There will be $20 million from 2009 to 2010 to help suppliers. They are also an important aspect of the manufacturing industry, particularly the car-manufacturing industry. There will be $6.3 million from 2009 through to 2010 for an enhanced market access program, and a new Automotive Industry Innovation Council to bring in key decision makers to drive innovation and reform. Lastly, there will be a $10.5 million expansion of the LPG vehicle system, which demonstrates our commitment to a greener world and greener society.
That is the form. Those are the plans that the government has in place to enhance and provide a stimulus in the market where it is needed and when it is crucial. It is a new deal for Australian car makers and a new deal for Australian car buyers. We seem to have the states that are relevant to this industry, South Australia and Victoria, on board and we seem to have the employer organisations, like the ACCI, on board. But we look across the chamber here and it appears that we have opposition from that side with respect to stimulating the market. I do not know where they are coming from, because the plan is one of the most crucial parts of our sustained ability to prosper in the future.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have indicated that they are well and truly supportive of this initiative. They have indicated that the plan will promote technology and development and improve the skills base of the automotive sector. They also indicated that it will help the industry to increase its responsiveness in changing market conditions, especially the increased demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. This is the path we should be going down to ensure that this particularly crucial industry is protected. It reflects our determination to create high-quality, high-skilled, high-wage jobs, the kind of jobs that Australians want for themselves and for their children. It reflects our desire to give Australians greener, safer, more affordable vehicles and choices. Talking about jobs, the car-manufacturing industry employs 64,000 people directly and an estimated further 200,000— (Time expired)

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-11-11,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Carr. A globally competitive car-manufacturing sector is clearly important to the Australian economy and to jobs. The Howard government invested $3.8 billion in the sector over the six years from 2001 to 2007 to ensure just that. But yesterday’s ‘Rudd rescue’ was bereft of detail as to how it will ensure a globally competitive car-manufacturing industry—an industry that will increase its own investment in the industry in Australia and stand on its own two feet to deliver world-standard cars and provide jobs for Australians.
How will the ‘Rudd rescue’ guarantee that? Minister Carr and the Prime Minister will not guarantee it because they know they cannot. ‘Rudd’s rescue’ is not an evidence based plan, despite the Prime Minister’s promises to the Australian electorate to deliver just that; it is an ill-camouflaged appeasement of Labor’s union mates. It has been dressed up as a response to climate change and to the global financial crisis—a global financial crisis that Prime Minister Rudd says means that year 2009 will get a bit rough. Well, it is a rough response to the rough year into which we are heading. It is a rough response and a rough rescue with no empirics, no evidence and little information. It seeks refuge in the refrains of climate change and the global financial crisis in an attempt to silence the critics of ‘Rudd’s rescue’, and we saw in question time a valid basis for this criticism.
The minister refused to answer a question from your good self, Mr Deputy President Ferguson, about whether the Rudd rescue package will save jobs in the sector. Instead we heard Senator Carr say that the Rudd government does not make promises it cannot keep. What a concession, what an admission. The Rudd rescue package will not save jobs in this sector—and tragically so. The Rudd government knows it to be so. But worse than that was Minister Carr’s answer to a further question from your good self, Mr Deputy President, about how many jobs will be lost in the sector. If jobs are not to be lost, why does the Rudd rescue package set aside some $34 million for a car worker redundancy scheme, and on what basis has that package been calculated?
In question time the government failed to provide empirical evidence to underpin the Rudd rescue package. The minister said that, since the escalation of the global financial crisis on 15 September this year and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, he has not personally spoken to the US heads of Ford or General Motors about the capacity or willingness of those companies to invest in Australia’s car manufacturing sector on a three to one basis. So how can the government claim that the Rudd rescue package will deliver increased investment by the industry in the industry itself in Australia? They simply cannot. The minister says instead that, despite his not having spoken personally to the heads of those two companies since 15 September, there have been discussions with the corporate leadership of those companies. So what, then, are the guarantees that have been delivered by those companies on investment in Australia’s car manufacturing sector? On that question, the minister says that the companies have written to the government. Well, Minister, release that written correspondence to the Australian public. The government must release the letters which the minister himself admits have been written by Ford and GM in respect of this issue. If the government refuses to do so then we will continue to see a Rudd rescue plan which is no better than a rough plan to deal with a rough year ahead.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-11-11,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The collapse of ABC Learning and its effect on childcare across Australia, which requires an urgent response from the Government including an emergency summit of the key childcare providers from around the country, to ensure services to parents and children are available beyond the end of 2008.
Child care in Australia is in desperate need of an overhaul. The crisis that we are seeing with ABC Learning Centres is simply the tip of the iceberg. For years and years, we have seen the child-care sector in Australia being taken over by profiteers and being seen as an industry. Child care should be seen as an essential service. Child care should be seen as part of the lifelong learning that starts at birth. Child care is something that we as parents trust to give our kids the best quality of care so that we can go out to work and pay our mortgages. How was this crisis with ABC Learning Centres ever allowed to happen? How has it been that one corporate entity was allowed to control 25 per cent of the market? How can we say that one corporate entity should be allowed to monopolise a quarter of the child-care sector—for profit, not because we are putting the care of our children first?
Child care should not be viewed or treated as a profit-driven industry; it should be seen as the essential service it is. We have seen over the last couple of weeks a response from the government, a response from the community sector and a response from various child-care providers from around the country to try to get together to talk about what to do next. We know that ABC Learning is responsible for 100,000 long day care places around the country. We know that ABC Learning relies heavily on government funding; it was anticipated to receive up to $300 million from taxpayers through benefits paid to the company and on behalf of parents in this financial year. We have heard from the government that the response in trying to keep these centres open until 31 December this year is a $22 million rescue package. What then? In estimates a few weeks ago, I asked Senator Ludwig, the minister representing Minister Gillard, whether he could explain the federal government’s contingency plans, which they assured me they had. I also asked whether they could explain what would be happening, when it would be happening and what kind of discussions had happened so far to try to avoid the possible crisis that may happen if ABC Learning Centres were to go under—what would happen to the 100,000 children in care in their centres around the country? How do we, as a government—as elected parliamentarians—ensure that we do not leave these families in the lurch?
In response, the department said that there had been some thought given to the issue of ABC Learning folding and that some scenarios had been looked at. Since then, we have seen the $22 million package but we have not seen the details of any type of contingency plan. I have been inundated by various community child-care workers from around the country saying that they have put themselves forward as experts in the sector, people working on the ground, wanting to help the government move forward and ensure that we can keep as many centres open as possible, and yet the biggest criticisms that all of them have come to me with are a lack of transparency in the government’s plans, a lack of transparency in their conversations with government. It is a lack of transparency that led us into this mess in the first place. It is time for the government to shed light on what is really happening with ABC Learning and what types of contingency plans the government has. It is time to ensure that we involve the experts every step of the way.
Today the Senate passed a motion to support an emergency summit to get together the brightest minds in child care from around the country to talk directly to the government about the way forward. I am thankful that the government has taken the opportunity to ensure that centres are open until the end of this year, but we need to be looking beyond 2008. There are people who are willing to help, willing to put up their hands, willing to step in and keep centres open in order to ensure that kids can be dropped off as their parents go off to work and that the quality of care for our kids remains the highest it can possibly be.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2008-11-11,"—I thank Senator Hanson-Young for moving the urgency motion this afternoon. We are here debating this particular urgency motion about the collapse of ABC Learning Centres because, quite simply, the government has comprehensively failed to deal effectively with this problem. The impact of this failure on thousands and thousands of Australian families is indeed likely to be significant and also has the disturbing potential to be long term. It is also a serious failure for all Australians who look to the government for, hopefully, responsible economic management, sadly missing at this point in time.
It is no surprise, but there have been signs of trouble at ABC Learning Centres over many months. The government was so slow to respond that, apparently, it is still working out a contingency plan. In fact, in February this year the ABC Learning share price dropped by 60 per cent. Financial analysts at the time expressed concern about the adverse effects on families who are relying on those centres for child care.
Let me go through a little more of the chronology so that we can see where the gaps have been. Four months later, on 23 June, the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, the Hon. Maxine McKew, put out a press release on ABC Learning, but it was on a fee hike, taking effect from 1 July this year. At the end of July, ABC Learning then flagged a pre-tax loss of over $400 million for 2008.
On 21 August a voluntary halt on trading on the ASX was called for ABC Learning Centres. Then a month later at estimates—and my colleague Senator Bernardi was engaged in the discussion at the time—an officer from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations told the hearing that the department was alive to the question of what would happen to ABC Learning Centres if the organisation failed. One is glad that the department was at least alive, but we are not sure what the alternative was. These issues are very serious for Australians.
On 6 November ABC Learning went into voluntary receivership. The following day the Deputy Prime Minister announced a bailout of $22 million to ensure that the centres stay open until the end of December. The coalition has indicated, through the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister, Mrs Mirabella, that support for the children of families affected by this collapse is welcome. But in reality the government still does not have a proper contingency plan. It cannot say with any specificity what the $22 million will actually be spent on and how it will actually help those Australians whose jobs and childcare places are fundamentally at risk and, most importantly, for many people—and Senator Hanson-Young also referred to this—whether there will be any security for parents after Christmas. Consider the impact of the collapse and what it has done to Australian families: we have 120,000 Australian children attending ABC Learning Centres across the country. We have about 16,000 people employed by the company, many of whom also have children who attend the centres. In the event of centre closures, even if they are able to find a new job, they will be without care for their own children.
ABC Learning caters for between 20 and 25 per cent of the Australian childcare market. It also provides a significant number of reserved places for the children of Defence Force personnel, which is obviously a very significant factor. The organisation has received considerable amounts of money—$300 million in subsidies from government this year and, reportedly, it has a debt of close to $100 million, which is predominantly owed to the banks. The coalition is concerned about the failure of the government in handling this entire problem.
Most importantly, the government should have been able to provide certainty to the thousands of parents who have children in ABC Learning Centres, but we are still waiting to see with any certainty what clear path lies ahead. That degree of uncertainty is clearly reported in newspapers, as well as anecdotally and by our constituents, and is very disturbing to Australian families. I referred earlier to aspects of the chronology of the past few months, but really the government’s time frame for action has been embarrassingly slow.
In September the government set up an education department task force to deal with the collapse, and that was four months after the trading of shares of ABC Learning ceased. They said they were working on a contingency plan but, as far as a contingency plan is concerned, we remain in the dark. We have a promise of $22 million but not a lot of detail around that. It is detail, it is information that Australian families need at this point. Essentially, they are now telling families that they need to wait until mid-December to hear more—that is, just two weeks before the guaranteed funding expires on 31 December. That two-week period immediately before Christmas—and we all know what that is like for families; it is fraught at the best of times, let alone at a time where stories of the global financial crisis are impacting on people’s consciousness and people’s psyche and where they now also have to face this problem—is not enough time if families need to find alternative care. It is not enough time if employees need to find alternative jobs in what is a difficult and uncertain employment market. It is not as though jobs are just going to fall off so-called Christmas trees.
There is evidence that this uncertainty and the lack of a clear plan may also be causing the company to haemorrhage even further. We would all have seen reports in the Australian this morning that the ABC Learning Centres are suffering from serious understaffing and seeking temporary employees from a range of sources. Also in today’s Australian the Deputy Prime Minister said it is up to the receiver to provide details about the 40 per cent of ABC Learning Centres which are apparently and reportedly regarded as unprofitable. But this is very important information. The government has a responsibility to acknowledge this information; it needs to be provided to Australians who have their children in care in this particular system. Some 60 per cent of ABC Learning Centres could be entirely profitable, and we need to absolutely acknowledge that. The problem is that, when you talk about 40 per cent being unprofitable, you end up with speculation. That does not help anyone in this process. It causes families and staff themselves in all of the 1,040 centres to be much more anxious about what is going on and causes them to perhaps then pursue plans to find alternative care for their children and alternative employment for themselves. And the problems will just cascade.
The very serious personal impact of this problem needs to be acknowledged by government, as does the package. Speculation has the potential—and this is very unnerving for those involved in businesses and those whose families have children in the centres—to severely damage the prospect of the currently profitable centres remaining just that. As far as we can tell, notwithstanding the fact that the task force has been in place for over six weeks, there is no evidence of any particular consultation with other industry stakeholders. There have certainly been no reports or statements of that.
The chief executive officer of KU Children’s Services, which is actually Australia’s second largest childcare provider and the largest provider of not-for-profit child care, was quoted in the last couple of days as saying that they had made offers of help but had not had a response back from government. I understand that they are not the only other providers to have done that. There was a forum scheduled for today, to be chaired by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, but it was an already scheduled meeting of the National Children’s Services Forum. It is not, as far as we can tell, an ABC Learning specific meeting, but it is now being used to portray the government as consulting industry leaders on the issue. I hope it is useful. I hope it does actually do something, but to pretend that it is a response to this particular issue is not accurate at all.
The coalition have made numerous calls for the government to provide details of the contingency plans, but they do seem to us to have been very reluctant to do so. In fact, they have gone so far as to try to blame the previous government for the situation in which ABC Learning finds itself, but it is state governments that license childcare centres, not the Commonwealth. One would have thought that the Deputy Prime Minister would be aware of that. If there was such a concern about the rapid growth—

Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—

—It is not rubbish that state governments license childcare centres. That is in fact the case. Had the Deputy Prime Minister been concerned about the rapid growth of ABC Learning childcare centres then perhaps she might have contacted her Labor colleagues in every state and territory some 12 months ago, after the election, and raised the matter with them, but there is no evidence of that either. This approach is a hands-off approach. It is a dangerous approach. It is dangerous for Australian families at a very difficult time of year and at a very difficult time in the Australian economy. The government should acknowledge that this needs better care, hands on the wheel, not off the wheel, and a more responsible approach all round.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I too thank Senator Hanson-Young for raising this urgency motion today, mostly because it gives the Senate an opportunity to look a bit more factually at the circumstances in relation to ABC Learning child care. Having listened to Senator Payne just now, I have to say that she elaborated a very convenient and short-term portrayal of history.
The Rudd Labor government was elected on a platform to reform child care and establish a national early childhood agenda. There were good reasons why this was the case. Senator Hanson-Young raised some of the issues in her comments in relation to this urgency motion, but there are several others that I would like to address. Unfortunately, I may run out of time to recap some of the history, because it is also very important to look at what our contingency plans are. But I must, having been provoked by Senator Payne, at least cover some of those issues.
Child care is a vital service that families rely on in order to meet their employment and community commitments. Given the demands of the modern workforce, both the quality and the security of supply of childcare services are vital. Recent events highlight key inadequacies in the model established by the previous government that we have a plan to address. Unfortunately, the global financial crisis has meant some of those industry inadequacies are coming well to the fore.
In talking about industry inadequacies, let me take you to some of the comments made by former minister Hockey in this area. In the opposition commentary about what government should be doing at this stage, we first had Mr Turnbull saying we should not really be doing anything, that unviable centres should not be maintained, without even the constraint that there were some good, strong public interest grounds for at least doing it for the next two months. Mr Hockey moved back from that position and said, no, he accepted that our $22 million contingency plan was important and should be put in place to maintain support and services for the families and children involved. But he also made another very interesting comment which harks back to the history that Senator Payne has conveniently forgotten. He said that if there is an industry failure then we need government action.
There is an industry failure in this sector. It has been acknowledged that there is an industry failure. Senator Hanson-Young referred to that when she reflected on the concern of a multitude of parties about the dominance of ABC Learning being able to be developed under the policies of the previous government. There is a significant problem. It does not relate solely to the global financial crisis, however. There are a few points that should be highlighted there. ABC Learning has been severely affected by this financial crisis, but it was known for some time by financial commentators that ABC Learning was highly leveraged. As early as March 2006, Macquarie Bank researchers wrote:
At the current share price, strong growth has been factored in and ABC can’t afford to stumble.
This was back in March 2006. Citigroup noted:
Off-balance sheet leverage is quite high and real interest cover is low.
This is the kind of corporation that will come under the most intense pressure, should there be a credit squeeze. This was the case with ABC Learning, and we have known this for quite some time. The problem with the former government was that they were quite happy to allow this type of radical market experiment in the delivery of social services such as child care. That is the problem.
In addition, ABC Learning has quite a significant number of sites overseas. This expansion added additional risks to the company’s overall financial health, such as currency risk and also the difficulty of operating childcare services in markets with different needs. There have also been problems with the board for a considerable period of time. As the Australian Financial Review noted on 7 November 2008:
The composition of the ABC board points to many of the problems that have brought the business down. First up, it was top-heavy with politicians such as former Nationals MP Larry Anthony—
setting aside issues relating to ministerial codes of conduct—
and erstwhile Brisbane lord mayor Sallyanne Atkinson.
—He was not in breach of any code of conduct. That’s a mischievous suggestion!
—I am simply quoting the Australian Financial Review. The article continued:
Rapidly growing companies such as ABC need directors whose core competencies are reading accounts, vetting deals and reining in entrepreneurial chief executives.
Clearly, this was not the case with ABC.
If I recall correctly, I think, for instance, Tony Jones described the previous CEO, Eddy Groves, as ‘the child of John Howard’. This is the level of the previous government’s connection—and ‘problem child’ is probably a better description given the situation. Accordingly, the government has closely monitored ABC’s situation for some time. In fact, I recall that in Senate estimates, when I was a shadow minister, the department indicated back then that they were monitoring market share issues and potential risks associated with ABC. They demonstrated no contingency plan then, Senators, but on this occasion, yes, we do have a contingency plan: $22 million has been provided to work with receivers to ensure these services stay open for another two months. Let us understand this situation. Unlike Mr Turnbull, who suggests that you should simply allow unviable businesses to go—

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Perhaps Senator Bernardi would like to have the precise quote on that issue so that he understands very clearly what his leader has been saying should be the case. But when we have the opposition saying, ‘No, we should have this free-market experiment’—one that allows the delivery of community services such as child care to be vulnerable to market failures and risky market behaviour, which is what has occurred with ABC—we obviously do have a problem. I will use the remainder of my time to go back to the point that Senator Payne made about the lack of a contingency plan. Unlike the former government, we have indeed committed to provide—
—Your forensic skills have not improved since ‘children overboard’, have they?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I would appreciate the opportunity to speak without interruption. I cannot hear myself, let alone deal with this issue.
 (Senator Parry)—Senators on my left, please allow Senator Collins to be heard.
—I do not know why Senator Brandis is quite so excited about this issue, but perhaps he will speak later in the debate and we will be able to understand it. Let us go back to the facts of the matter. There was a forum today, as Senator Payne indicated. That forum represented another shift that has occurred in the early childhood agenda under the Rudd government. That shift is more adequate and comprehensive consultation with the sector, as was outlined in this place in question time and in the other place in question time today. The Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Children, Ms McKew, has been undertaking extensive consultations across the sector to deal with the types of problems that Senator Hanson-Young has been referring to. That we have taken the opportunity today to focus on the most pressing and immediate issue is not, Senator Payne, a pretence. It is using the consultation processes that have been established to undertake the type of consultation that Senator Hanson-Young is pointing out as being critical and important at this time.
That Senator Payne claims that there is no evidence of consultation in the sector is probably more reflective of her limited dealings with the sector than anything else. So let me tell her the other thing that was announced by the minister today in question time. The Deputy Prime Minister announced that an expression of interest process has commenced to ensure that the receiver has the best available range of options for considering the future operation of ABC Learning Centres. She has encouraged the parties, be they for-profit or not-for-profit ones, to register their interest in participating with the receiver on the future of ABC. Once the review process has identified the likely future arrangements for each centre, the receiver, working with the government, will map and sort the registrations of interest against identified local needs. The government is responding to clear public interest. We have a contingency plan that involves maintaining these services for two months with the $22 million, as has been indicated, and also a process, which the Deputy Prime Minister outlined today in question time, for receiving expressions of interest and for mapping against identified local needs as will be required to ensure that delivery of service occurs into the new year.
As senators would be aware, the forum held today involved a dozen peak national childcare organisations. The organisations that Senator Hanson-Young referred to will eventually be communicated with and consulted in relation to communication back to government. Also, as I said, there is this new process that the Deputy Prime Minister outlined today to receive expressions of interest. That will be critical to ensuring that community needs are catered for in this very pressing and urgent situation.
Since I have a little more time than I anticipated, I will go back to the points that I was raising before—and Senator Brandis, in particular, seemed to want to hear more on this issue. I suspect he will be mildly amused that in fact I will spend some of this time quoting what Stephen Mayne said, in a Lateline interview that occurred with Tony Jones in February of this year, because I think this is the best synopsis of the problems with ABC child care.
—You might as well quote a Heinz tomato sauce bottle, Senator Collins.
—Well, that might be your view, Senator Bernardi, but let us have a look at the issues that are highlighted here. The ABC Learning business fails most of the government’s tests, I think it is fair to say. For instance, Eddy Groves’s brother-in-law has had more than $100 million worth of construction and maintenance contracts from the company, most of which have not gone to tender. There is a stockbroking firm—it is called Austock—which has backed ABC Learning ever since it floated at $2 a share back in March 2001. Austock has made almost $100 million in fees backing this company all the way. Bill Bessemer from Austock sits on the ABC Learning board and Eddy Groves at one stage bought a 4.2 per cent stake in Austock, so you have transactions and relationships going backwards and forwards. You have got three executives on the board and you do not have a clear majority of independent directors.
Larry Anthony, the children’s minister in the Howard government, joined the board. The former government gave Eddy Groves’s company $1 million a day in subsidies for its childcare operations, creating an unprecedented company market share in the world. Five months after he stopped being Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony jumped onto the board of ABC Learning, taking all the knowledge with him. It is those types of situations, plus hundreds of thousands of donations to the Liberal Party, the National Party and those types of things, which have never been a particularly good look for the company. That is when Tony Jones then went on to describe Eddy Groves: ‘He was a child of the Howard government, wasn’t he?’
I am very surprised that, under those circumstances, Mr Turnbull made the comments that I said I would eventually take Senator Bernardi to. These were the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, on 8 November 2008:
The reality is an unprofitable business—
regarding ABC Learning—
cannot be sustained indefinitely, so there is clearly a concern about the level of, and the tenure, the extent, of government support.
It looks like this contingency plan, this support, was put together very much at the last minute so I’m a little sceptical as to how much of a plan they really had.
Well, we have a plan to maintain all of the centres for two months to get families through till Christmas. It is a very clear plan. We have a plan to map out community interest in comparison to what existing services are prepared to do to maintain services. We have a plan to ensure child care remains available to these families. We have much more of a plan in our national agenda for early childhood than the former government ever had, apart from putting themselves on boards once they leave this place. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-11-11,"—We have just been witness to an outrageous bunch of indifference from Senator Collins and the Labor Party. The mums and dads of Australia are living in fear at the moment, in fear of many different things. They are in fear of the financial crisis; they are in fear of paying their mortgages; they are in fear of losing their jobs. And what is happening now? They are also in fear of child care. What do we hear from the Labor Party? We have this trawling through history, the corporate annals and the financial reports. We have an attack on organisations that are trying to make money. Is this what we are returning to with the Labor Party? Are we going back to where for-profit enterprise is frowned upon, to where it is wrong, to where you can be employed only by the government?
Let me share this with Senator Collins and the rest of the Labor Party over there: this country was built on the back of enterprise. It was built on the back of investment by private individuals trying to create and provide services for the rest of the country. Yes, occasionally things do not work out. They sometimes do not work out for people who have invested their money, and they sometimes do not work out for those people that are reliant on the services. The coalition is absolutely mindful of this. We are concerned. We share the same fears that the mums and dads of Australia have right now, because we know just how incompetent, hopeless and lethargic this government really is.
Let’s just talk about the lethargy that is being demonstrated. Senator Collins was happy to wax lyrical about how there were warning signs for ABC Learning Centres for such a long time.
—It wasn’t lyrical.
—It was quite discordant, actually.
—It was discordant, but she waxed on and on about how many warnings there had been. What has happened? The government now owns this issue like it owns all the economic issues in this country at the moment. What have they been doing for eight months? Nothing. They have been talking about a plan. Where is the plan? When a crisis comes and the plan hits the fan, as it has now, what do they do? They throw a few dollars at it and say: let’s hope it takes care of itself. They have a specific parliamentary secretary responsible for this, and what have we heard?
—McWho?
—It is not McWho; it is McKew—Maxine McKew, the parliamentary secretary and the member for Bennelong, and it pains me to say that. She has been silent on this, and that is what is really disturbing. It has been left to the Deputy Prime Minister to go out and launch personal attacks against the coalition because we are asking what the government is actually going to do. It is all well and good—and we support buying some interim relief, and that is exactly what it is; $22 million is interim relief—but what will happen on 31 December? Do they all shut down without anyone knowing? There is no plan. They have talked about it. During Senate estimates, Senator Hanson-Young asked and was assured by the department that a plan was ‘alive’ and that the department were looking at this live issue. I say we need now to get a second opinion. We need to bring the defibrillators in. We need to put in an IV and maybe ask a proper doctor to come in and look at what is wrong with this government, because clearly the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the Prime Minister have been asleep at the wheel. Senator Collins spoke about how many warnings there have been. There was a credit crunch and she said that, in the event of a credit crunch, ABC was at risk. Well, the credit crunch came and what did they do? They did not do anything. The mums and dads of Australia are living in fear of your economic incompetence and your indifference. The fear that they are living with has been met with the classic—
—Insouciance.
—Insouciance is the word that Senator Brandis has provided, and I think it is a wonderful word to use on this occasion. They are fiddling while Rome burns.
Government senators interjecting—
—The interjections from the other side only highlight the fact that we have a couple of people there that are going to come out and attack the previous government. I challenge them not to. I ask them: when is the blame game going to stop? That is what the Prime Minister promised. He promised there was going to be a new deal. We now know that ‘a new deal’ is shutting down private industry and attacking private industry. We now know that ‘a new deal’ is to bring in state-run centres and overpowering for-profit industry. I say that is wrong, and the coalition does not support that. But the coalition does support the mums and dads, particularly in rural Australia, who are worried about the potential closure of their childcare centre. That means that mums and dads might not be able to go to work because it is the only option available to them.
We are not indifferent to their pain and to the potential damage that that can cause for them as individuals, as families and as communities. But this government is. This government does not seem to care. It thinks: ‘I’ll just throw some money at it and it will go away. I’ll hide my head under the pillows and the monsters won’t get me anymore.’ Let me tell you that the monsters, the gremlins, are right there in action. They are hiding on their front bench, because there is this effort to supplant and undermine the enterprise spirit in this country. We have a government that, rather than saying, ‘How can we make this better and help to provide more and different alternatives for people?’ simply says: ‘I’ll whack away a bit more of the surplus. I’ll put it in there and buy myself a couple of months and hope the people of Australia will forget about this issue.’ But they will not forget, they cannot forget, because it goes to the very structure and the very heart of their lives.
For those of us who have children, if we want to go to work we need to make sure that our children are well looked after in the event that a parent cannot be at home with them. But what is going to happen on 1 January? Are the government banking on so many people losing their jobs between now and then that they will not need childcare facilities? You would think so, because they have been pushing and advocating that there are going to be job losses in this country. It is in the budget statements; it is in the Treasury documents. It is a great shame. Rather than looking to create and sustain jobs they are driving our economy into the ground and taking families with them. There is nothing more important than to ensure that families have every opportunity available to them, including children.
In her 15-minute speech Senator Collins did not acknowledge that there was a single problem that the government could deal with. She talked about a plan. I would suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, that their plan is a concept that is unknown to any of them yet. They are looking at a plan? They have had 12 months to work on it and they still do not know what it contains. That is an indictment of this government. It is a shame for this government. And the challenge for them is to come clean, make that admission and stop blaming other people for their failures.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech

I have to say that Senator Hanson-Young’s speech is in stark contrast to the ill-informed and petty contributions that we have seen from Senator Payne and Senator Bernardi on behalf of a political party that has a lot to answer for in terms of the collapse of ABC Learning and the handing over of the childcare sector lock, stock and barrel to the free market. After hearing Senator Bernardi especially talking about the great worth of the free market and the private sector, I could only have come to one conclusion in terms of ABC Learning. He did not have any solutions; he did not put forward a case of how we could actually salvage this company; he said pretty much to ‘leave it to the free market’. If we left ABC Learning to the free market at the moment, something like 400 childcare centres would close. That is the plan of Senator Bernardi. That is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth—’Leave it to the free market.’ But more about that later.
Child care and childhood development are areas of which the Rudd government is extremely proud. We understand that parents and workers in this industry would be extremely concerned at the moment and very anxious about the situation concerning ABC Learning. Our priority has been and will continue to be to ensure working families can access child care for their kids when and where they need it, because we know how important child care is—not just child care but quality child care.
The Rudd government was elected with a comprehensive childcare plan, not just for the centres but also in terms of improving the professional standards in child care. This year the government expects to pay $1.9 billion in childcare benefit payments to childcare providers so they can reduce their fees to families. In addition, in the May budget the government increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 to 50 per cent and improved the frequency of payments. At the last election the Rudd government promised to establish up to 260 new childcare centres, and that is something we are working on around the clock. We have also seen the great work that the parliamentary secretary, Maxine McKew, has been doing in the sector. I find it abhorrent that those on the other side would be attacking the parliamentary secretary, who has been doing some fantastic work in the sector. If you want to see the work she has been doing, go to the new website we have set up—mychild.gov.au. It is absolutely fantastic in terms of the work that this government has been doing in the childcare area. I urge those senators across from me to take a look at it.
In terms of ABC Learning, this is a complex and large-scale problem. Just to put it into a bit of perspective, ABC Learning has a 25 per cent share of the long day care childcare market. There are 1,040 ABC Learning childcare centres, of which around 40 per cent are currently unprofitable. There are approximately 120,000 children attending these centres. ABC Learning Centres employs more than 16,000 people. It is a huge, huge task. The government has been acting with great urgency. On 6 November ABC Learning Centres announced it would enter into voluntary administration. The government established a special task force to work with the receivers and the banks throughout the process. On 7 November the government announced it would provide $22 million in conditional funding to ensure that the ABC Learning childcare centres remain open and provide care to the end of December. The $22 million represents the possible cost of supporting the continued operation of the unprofitable ABC centres for up to two months.
Senators Bernardi and Payne, when you listen to them, think that is the end of the process—that it is just $22 million and after 31 December there is no plan forward. That is entirely untrue. During the period, the government and the DEEWR task force are undertaking a thorough review of ABC Learning’s operations. It is envisaged that by mid-December the government will be in a position to make a further announcement about the future of ABC Learning—that is, after working with the receivers and the banks to try and find a way forward. If you think there is some magic solution, what is it? Please— (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-11-11,"—I would also like to thank Senator Hanson-Young for bringing this issue up and giving us the opportunity to explore some of the very serious problems that there are at the moment. Senator Arbib commented that Senator Bernardi had not provided the solution. Last time I looked, Senator Arbib was the one sitting on the government benches. It is the government who should be looking for a solution. Also, Senator Arbib tells us that there is a plan. Well, we have asked; Senator Hanson-Young has asked; questions have been asked in the House of Representatives, over and over: what is the government doing about this? We do not know what the plan is unless we hear about the plan. What we currently have is, basically, a completely incoherent approach to the entire issue.
We had Minister Evans in the Senate today carefully setting out a timescale that had been developed—allegedly developed, I should say—by the government. Firstly, we heard that in September a task force had been established. He neglected to mention that that was set up after ABC Learning said to the government, ‘Hey, we’re in very big trouble; you’d better do something to help us or the industry is going to fall in a heap.’ He then went on to tell us what happened on 2 November and 6 November. He even mentioned that today there was a meeting of the national peak groups. You would have thought, from the way Minister Evans phrased it, that this was part of a coherent and sensible response to developing a quick and urgent solution to the problem. The only problem, of course, was that, at the same time that Minister Evans was saying this in the Senate, the Minister for Education and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, was happily pointing out in her particularly erudite fashion to the House of Representatives that this was just a routine, regular meeting with the ordinary childcare groups who came to see the minister and the parliamentary secretary regularly and normally. She even said that she ‘expected’ that the issue of ABC Learning Centres would be discussed at the meeting. She did not say she was definite it would be. She did not say, ‘Absolutely; it’s going to be our No. 1 priority.’ She said she ‘expected’ the issue would come up at a regular meeting—quite a different version of events from the coherent plan that Senator Evans would have had us believe they were going to make.
I would like to move on to just how decisive all this is looking at the moment. We are getting very used to this now: what is the word of the week from the Rudd Labor government? They used to work on ‘working families’ but—
—Still do.
—Well, no; we have not heard very much at all about working families from the Rudd Labor government—because they know there are going to be fewer of them. But the word of the week at the moment is ‘decisive’; everything is very ‘decisive’. And the Minister for Education and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, in fact commented that the government had acted ‘quickly’ and ‘decisively’ to ensure that parents could rely on ABC centres—until 31 December. That is what they can rely on: until 31 December.
The thing that the Rudd government and Ms Gillard—and the completely-absent-from-this-debate Ms McKew—appear to have overlooked is that children grow up quickly and decisively too. When the new school year starts, in less than three months time, a large number of ABC’s clients, up to 20,000 of them, will be moving on. They will not be requiring full-time child care any longer because they will be attending school. Many of their parents, in the normal course of things, would no doubt have booked in the next crop of children. In normal circumstances, this would not be an issue. The next group of children would be coming through to fill those places.
—Cohort.
—Cohort—good; thank you, Senator Brandis.
—A crop of children.
—A crop of children—yes, why not? But those children would be coming in; we would have those places, and more, filled. But what parent in their right mind right now is booking their child into an ABC Learning centre if they have a skerrick of an alternative? Because you do not know whether, come February next year, April next year or some other time, that childcare place is going to be there. You do not know how much time you or your partner might have to take off work because the childcare place has simply disappeared.
So what is happening is that these parents are looking for other sources of child care. Most of them are searching desperately now for something that at least they can guarantee will be there when they need it in February next year. So what we do absolutely need is some decisive action from this government, and that is not expressions of interest or a plan that we are going to hear about two weeks before Christmas. It is now that we need the urgency summit organised, so that there is a long-term solution, because 400 unprofitable centres are going to look like child’s play as parents vote with their feet on what they think about the decisiveness of this government and enrol their children as far as possible anywhere else. If you are trying to run a business, as every ABC Learning centre is, it is unreasonable not to have any idea of what your market for next year is going to be, less than three months out, because the government cannot quite manage to organise themselves a meeting to discuss this issue properly.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I would also like to thank Senator Hanson-Young for bringing forward this matter of public importance today. I know she has a genuine interest in this issue not just because she is a parent. I also have a genuine interest in this issue, and I am probably game enough to say that I am probably the only member of this Senate who has actually worked in the childcare industry for any extended length of time. I understand that Senator Jacinta Collins has at various times, but I spent 11½ years working in the childcare industry.
In this matter there are two options: the opposition would like these centres closed down or that we come up with some process to allow these centres to continue to operate. The opposition say that they are the great economic achievers of this lifetime. Let me ask: where do you think Australia will be if we have to close down these centres, if parents cannot go to work? The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, has said:
… the reality is an unprofitable business cannot be sustained indefinitely. So there is clearly a concern about the level of and the tenure…the extent of government support.
            …         …         …
… it looks like this contingency plan—
So there is a plan, though we have heard numerous speakers from the other side say there is no plan, and if there is a plan they do not like it anyway—
this support, was put together very much at the last minute. So I’m a little sceptical as to how much of a plan they really had.
We have got a plan. If you want to ensure that there is an ongoing service where these parents can leave their children, whether it be for work or for other activities in the community, then it is important that you do not just talk about what is going to happen between now and the end of December. We are saying that we have a plan as to what will happen after December.
Because we have a commitment to high-quality child care and because we are economically sensible and understand the commitment to the rest of the community if these places are taken out and parents cannot attend work, the Deputy Prime Minister has today announced the registration of interest process. But, no, the other side are not happy with that either. It is obvious that the other side would like to close these centres down and walk away. I have already quoted their leader’s comments. What did we see happen in the matter concerning Stan Howard, the chair of National Textiles and the previous Prime Minister’s brother? We saw money flow left, right and centre to ensure that the workers at National Textiles were looked after. That is what we are doing: we are making sure that the parents, the children and the workers are supported. It is a very important issue. I think the other side have turned this issue into a political stunt. They think they can get cute in their rhetoric on this too. We have heard some glib lines from the other side about this. I could make a few of my own. In fact, in relation to the business with Mr Stan Howard, He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother comes to mind.
I do not think the opposition take this issue seriously at all. We have seen a lot of double standards and hypocrisy from the other side. Senator Bernardi says there is no plan. The Leader of the Opposition obviously thinks there is a plan because he spoke about it on 8 November 2008. There is a plan and it is not good enough that the opposition come into this chamber and try to turn this debate on a matter of public importance into a political stunt. It is a serious issue. I do not think child care was taken seriously by the other side in all the years they were in government. The Rudd government was elected with a comprehensive childcare and early childhood education agenda, which is being pursued through COAG. The Rudd government has the interests of parents, their children and, in this case, ABC Learning employees front and centre. What is critical here is stability and continuity of service for parents, children and ABC Learning staff. That is why we have committed up to $22 million in conditional funding to ensure that all ABC Learning childcare centres remain open and providing care until 31 December 2008. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister made the announcement today regarding expressions of interest— (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-11-11,"—I am glad that I have been able to kick-start some debate on this issue in the chamber. I think Australian mums and dads must be sick and tired of the petty party politics that go on in this place. We have just spent almost an hour hearing about who is to blame for the ABC crisis. There is definitely enough blame to go around on both sides of the chamber. The ABC crisis would never have happened if ABC Learning had not been given the opportunity to monopolise the sector. Mums and dads around the country would not be worried about whether they can drop their kids off at their local childcare centre if companies had not been given free rein over what is meant to be an essential service. Mums and dads would not be worried about whether their local ABC centre is closing if companies were not able to profiteer from an essential service and the essential needs of Aussie families.
The government should have responded sooner. The government are creating more anxiety by their lack of transparency on this issue, keeping parents and the elected members and senators in this place in the dark on the rest of their contingency plans. The $22 million to be used to prop up ABC Learning over the next two months will only keep centres open until after Christmas, until 31 December. If the plan is more than this, let us see it. I hope there is more of a plan. I want to see it. I want the key stakeholders in the childcare sector to see it because that means we can get together and move forward.
We need to know now whether the minister will hold an emergency summit of the key stakeholders in the childcare sector, given that today the Senate voted to call on the government to hold one. We need to know within days when that summit will be held. Senator Collins mentioned that consultations will be happening and that those who were not spoken to today at a luncheon held by the parliamentary secretary—which I must point out was not a crisis meeting; it was simply a luncheon—eventually will be consulted. Frankly, ‘eventually’ is not soon enough. We need to know within days what the minister’s contingency plans are. We need the minister to commit to bringing together the brightest and best minds in the childcare sector. Those involved on the ground—the service providers, the local government associations that run childcare centres in their local areas and the small, independent operators—need to be brought together. We need to figure out how we move forward to ensure we can give parents some certainty after 31 December. ‘Eventually’ is simply not good enough.
We need to be take this opportunity to reform child care in Australia. The status quo simply is not working. We need a full investigation into how we ever allowed this essential service to be monopolised by a private company that puts the lining of shareholders’ pockets above the care of children. The company has a 25 per cent market share and that is simply not acceptable when we are talking about an essential community service. We need a full investigation as to how this happened. We need an emergency summit to move forward to ensure we can give certainty to parents and working families that their kids will not simply be left at the gate on 1 January.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I move government amendment (1) on sheet RE380:
(1)    Schedule 6, item 9, page 114 (line 23) to page 115 (line 4), omit the item, substitute:
9  Subsection 3(1)
Insert:

fishing means any of the following:
              (a)    taking fish;
              (b)    attempting to take fish;
              (c)    engaging in any activity (including searching for fish, using fishing apparatus and using fish aggregating devices) in connection with taking, or attempting to take, fish.
As in the earlier debate, when we were debating these two elements in a cognate way, I put that we would be moving this definition of fishing. As I indicated, this comes as a result of the inquiry into the bill by the relevant Senate committee. I thank the members of the committee for their advice and for the report we received.
First, I need to make something very clear. Senator Joyce has been saying that the reason we have moved this amendment is that the previous definition was onerous. That is not correct. It is simply being moved as a point of clarification. It is not at all to do with the view that Senator Joyce has put to us. It also comes as a result of the contribution you made earlier, Senator Joyce, when you questioned whether it refers to the zoning plan or to the act. That is a very important point, and I think I answered that in an earlier contribution—at least I hope I did.
The amendments we have moved are relevant only to commercial operations. I do encourage you to look at paragraph (c) of the amendment that says:
engaging in any activity (including searching for fish, using fishing apparatus and using fish aggregating devices) in connection with …
—and that is the most important part—
… in connection with taking, or attempting to take, fish.
You should not be concerned about the import of this definition. I think it is a good addition in terms of clarification to the overall operation of the act, if adopted. I commend the amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-11-11,"—I understand that.

The DPP will make an assessment and pursue charges on the basis, initially, of the zoning plan. Subsequent to that, if the person is guilty of fishing in a green zone—and I use that term in the broadest sense because of the infringement notice opportunity, whether the person has a previous record and a whole range of things to be put into that if the person has been found to be guilty—then there is an opportunity, if the person is deemed to be fishing in a commercial nature, for this definition to be instigated.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, have we dealt with Senator Joyce’s amendment?

(Senator Troeth)—We have dealt with that amendment, Senator Macdonald. That was dealt with just before you arrived in the chamber.
—I must say, Madam Temporary Chairman, I am most unhappy about that. It was my understanding that this bill was not coming on for a while and that there were certain things to be done. Apparently for some reason it slipped through very, very quickly. Senator Joyce, Senator Boswell and I, who clearly have major parts in this debate, are rather disappointed that the minister did not do us the courtesy of delaying things.
—With respect, Senator Macdonald, it was let go through by your colleagues and the committee assumed that there were no other speakers on the matter. If you seek leave of the committee we can return to that matter, if you wish.
—As it turns out I think it was Senator Joyce’s amendment that we were discussing. As soon as we saw this amendment come on we all rushed down but by then the matter had been put and I am rather disappointed that that happened. As I understand it Senator Xenophon indicated that he would not be supporting Senator Joyce’s amendment so it would have been defeated with the Labor Party, the Greens and Senator Xenophon not supporting it. I guess we do not need to recommit it and I do not think we were going to divide in any case. I am not sure whether Senator Joyce wants to say something about that matter, although perhaps he just has. If we are now dealing—
—We are now dealing with government amendment (1) on sheet RE380.
—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. The opposition have not spoken on that as far as I know. I think Senator Joyce thought that his last speech was on his amendment, but I do not want to attribute things to Senator Joyce as he can do that himself. Certainly on behalf of the opposition I want to indicate that, with Senator Joyce’s amendment having been defeated, we now come to the government’s amendment on the definition of ‘fishing’. Whilst it is not quite what we wanted, it is better than the original definition in the bill. It was raised in the committee report into the bill. Even the Labor Party members on the committee indicated in their majority report that the definition did require looking at as it was confusing, and I thank Senator Joyce, particularly, and Senator Boswell for raising debate on the issue of the definition. The government’s amendment addresses some of the concerns that opposition speakers had and it is better than it was. So the opposition will be supporting the government’s amendment on the definition.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-11-11,"—For the record, obviously I would have supported my own amendment. I was at an Economics Committee hearing on the top floor and even though I ran, I was not here on time. I believe it was a superior amendment; nonetheless it has failed. For the record, and so that people understand, quite obviously I would have been supported. I imagine that Senator Boswell and others would also have been in support of it. This amendment is certainly better than what the government is proposing now, and I concur with Senator Macdonald that it is certainly a step in the right direction for what was formerly section 9, I think—I do not have it in front of me—in the original act. Regardless of the motivations that have been described by the minister, I am certain that the overarching and overproscriptive capacity of the original act to reach into areas as a form of law, which I do not see reflected in other forms of law in Australia, and the whole intention that was there before—that you could be charged not so much for what you did but for what you thought—is an onerous form of law that we should not be passing in this chamber. So I see this not as a complete fix of that problem but certainly a step in the right direction. I hope, for future reference, regardless of what the act is that we are talking about, we do not revert to pieces of legislation that make criminals out of the way people think. The National Party will be in support of this amendment, not because it is right but because it is far better than what was completely wrong.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

When the committee opened there were no speakers in the chamber on Senator Joyce’s amendment. The chair quite rightly called for a vote to be taken. The chair at that time called the vote for the ayes. Given that we know how people variously around the chamber are going to vote, I then called for a division on the basis that the noes would have it. Opposition senators indicated that a division was not required and, therefore, the division was called off. I would hate others to think that anything untoward occurred in the chamber, given the sensitivity of this issue, particularly in North Queensland. I hope that assists those senators who were not in the chamber because of other committees. I am not at all critical of the fact that we all have other work to do as well as appear in the chamber.

9A  Subsection 3(1)
Insert:

geological storage operations means:
              (a)    operations to inject and store a gas substance in part of a geological formation; or
              (b)    operations preparing for or incidental to operations mentioned in paragraph (a).

These amendments will establish a prohibition on the geological storage of greenhouse gases in the Great Barrier Reef. As senators know, mining and drilling is prohibited in the Great Barrier Reef region. This prohibition was established long before geological storage of greenhouse gases was contemplated, as we know from the debate we had last night. The Australian government sees greenhouse gas geological storage as a critical technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, it has no intention of allowing it in the Great Barrier Reef where drilling operations are already prohibited. The amendment provides clarity and certainty regarding the government’s position and is also consistent with the overarching object of the bill currently before the Senate, which is to establish a modern, future focused regulatory framework for the Great Barrier Reef.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—I indicated earlier that the coalition will be supporting this amendment. In saying that, I want to congratulate Mr Peter Lindsay, the Liberal member for Herbert, for his campaign to ensure that this particular amendment was included in the bill. Way back on 25 June 2008, when the matter was dealt with in the House of Representatives, Mr Lindsay raised the issue of carbon sequestration underneath the Great Barrier Reef. He said that the bill that was presented to parliament did not rule out allowing carbon sequestration under the marine park. As Mr Lindsay said:
I am very pleased that the government has since said, ‘No, it’s not our intention to allow that.’
Mr Lindsay had been publicly campaigning for that. He indicated that he would move an amendment to the bill, which I am sure that the government would support, and he referred to an article in the Australian that included a map showing that there could be carbon sequestration under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I am pleased that the government has introduced this amendment in the Senate to allay the fears of Mr Lindsay and other members of the coalition, who are concerned that at all costs the Great Barrier Reef be protected and looked after. It is one of the great natural icons of the world.
As well as being a great natural asset and something that has brought pleasure to many people over eons, it is also, as I mentioned in speaking to an earlier amendment, a great revenue earner for Australia. Marine tourism in the Great Barrier Reef region is worth $5.1 billion annually and employs some 54,000 people. That information was provided by Access Economics, which did a study in the area just recently. A study commissioned in 2001 by tourism organisations, including Tourism Queensland, and the Cairns City Council and conducted by Hassall & Associates showed that the value of the marine tourism industry in the Cairns-Port Douglas area alone was some $736 million in the previous year. A further study by Hassall & Associates commissioned by Tourism Queensland showed that the marine tourism industry in 2001 paid the following major taxes: $17.5 million in income tax; some $8 million in the environmental management charge; and some $19.9 million in company tax, making a total of $215 million in revenue for the Commonwealth, which then pays out only about $30 million to GBRMPA. Not only is the Great Barrier Reef a great natural asset and great for tourism and employment; it is a real cash cow for the government. The Queensland government receives approximately $124 million of federal revenue through the GST and collects another $19 million in other taxes paid by the marine tourism industry. According to my figures, the Queensland government spends only about $23 million on the Great Barrier Reef.
Through the payment of the environmental management charge, industry contributes some $8 million per year to the GBRMPA budget, of which $1.2 million was payed to the CRC Reef Research Centre. There are over two million visitors to the Great Barrier Reef each year, and research shows that the Great Barrier Reef is the most significant attraction for tourism within the North Queensland region, with about 80 per cent of tourists visiting the Great Barrier Reef at least once. Quite clearly this is a great natural asset; it is also a great commercial asset for Australia, for Australians and for the Queensland government. That is why we have to protect it at all costs, and that is why the opposition will be supporting the government’s amendment to an issue that was rightly raised by Mr Lindsay some time ago.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—I, and also on behalf of Senator Boswell, move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5550 revised:
(1)    Schedule 6, item 24, page 126 (after line 13), after Division 3, insert:
         (1)    Despite any other Commonwealth law or any State law or Territory law, if a person was convicted for an offence under section 38CA of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975:
              (a)    that occurred during the period 1 July 2004 to 14 December 2006; and
              (b)    that did not attract a monetary penalty exceeding $5,000;
that conviction is for all purposes to be treated as a spent conviction under Part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914.
         (2)    For the avoidance of doubt, a conviction referred to in subsection (1) is to be treated as a spent conviction whether or not the waiting period for the offence under Part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914 has ended.
         (3)    Despite Division 3 of Part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914, the exclusions provided by Division 6 of Part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914 do not apply in relation to a conviction referred to in subsection (1).
This amendment deals with a matter that has been of great concern to the coalition for a number of years now. As I indicated this morning—and I will not repeat a lot of what I said this morning—the former coalition government legislated in relation to green zones. The penalties for fishing in the green zones were very severe. Between 1 July 2004 and 14 December 2006, there were a large number of convictions which imposed very heavy fines but also gave those convicted a criminal record. This was never intended; it was an unintended consequence. Senator Boswell and I gave examples of that this morning and of the impact that criminal records have had on ordinary Australians who liked to go out fishing and who made a mistake and went into the wrong zone. As a result of a lot of good work done by Senator Boswell and others, including me, this was highlighted. The previous government recognised that this was an unintended consequence and promised before the last election that, if returned, the coalition would introduce legislation to legislatively overturn the criminal records of people convicted during the period 1 July 2004 to 14 December 2006.
On 14 December 2006, the previous government, understanding the problems, changed the arrangements so that, from that date onwards, people fishing in the green zones could be served with an infringement notice—an on-the-spot fine, almost—instead of being taken to court and, upon conviction, having a criminal record. With the infringement notices, there are still very substantial fines but no conviction is on the person’s record. What we want to do with this amendment before the chair is to put those who were convicted between 1 July 2004 and 14 December 2006 in the same position as they would have been had they been given an infringement notice after 14 December 2006.
This has been the subject of a lot of anxiety by those convicted, for the reasons that Senator Boswell and I mentioned earlier today. This amendment, if it is passed—and I am delighted to hear that both Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon have indicated that they will be supporting the amendment, which means that it will pass—will put to an end this very unhappy period in relation to the Great Barrier Reef. I want to emphasise again that the Labor Party when in opposition, before the last election, also indicated that they would be supporting this form of activity. The then shadow spokesperson in the area of agriculture, fisheries and forestry, Senator O’Brien, quite clearly said in response to a newspaper inquiry that this needed to be a bipartisan approach and he gave every indication that the Labor Party would be supporting it.
Initially we looked at a pardon, but it became clear to us on investigation that a pardon would be difficult to do, as it would create an unfortunate precedent and in fact would be a unique action in Australian legislative history. So, on further reflection, the coalition decided to propose that these convictions between 1 July 2004 and 14 December 2006 be treated as spent convictions under part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914. The Crimes Act actually has an automatic spending of convictions after a period of 10 years. What this amendment does for these 100 or so people who now have this criminal record is bring forward the ‘spending’ of their convictions. So, to all intents and purposes, if this amendment is adopted, those who were fined in that period that we talk about will, of course, still pay the fine—there will still be that very substantial penalty—but they will not have a conviction on their personal record for what amounted to, in most instances, fairly innocent fishing breaches.
It is important to understand that that new regime was a huge step forward by the coalition—from about five per cent reserved away in green zones, it went up to something like 30 or 32 per cent in green zones. So there was a major rearrangement of what people had done on the Great Barrier Reef for many, many years. There was a lot of anxiety about it and a lot of anger and concern at the time the green zones were introduced—however, it went ahead. As a result, people who fished in a certain area where they had been fishing for decades suddenly found themselves in breach of the law and, as a result, faced very substantial penalties and this criminal conviction—which was not intended. What we are doing with this amendment is using the Crimes Act and the provision about spent convictions to say that these convictions in that period are deemed to be treated as spent convictions under the Crimes Act. And the balance of the amendment is to clarify what it refers to.
I am pleased that there has been an indication that there will be majority support for this amendment. I certainly hope that the Labor Party will honour its election commitment and also support the amendment. I went to the Labor Party at the committee hearings and I had written to the minister explaining the problem. If there was a better way of doing this, I was hoping that the government might come forward and say: ‘We understand what you want to do. We agree, as we agreed before the election, that this situation should not continue, and this is a way we can get rid of it.’ But, whilst I got tacit support, one might say, from officials at estimates committee hearings, I could never get their political masters to actually come to the party. I am hoping that, by now, the government will accept that this is an appropriate amendment. It is a very fair amendment and it rights a wrong—an unintended consequence of very strong legislation to protect the Great Barrier Reef.
I would certainly urge all senators to support this amendment. It does not create any undue precedent—which I see the government raised in their majority committee report. That is a facetious argument. It will right a wrong. It will be a great day, I might say, for those who are impacted upon by this and it will clean their slates in a way that will bring closure to this particular incident in Australia’s history. So I urge senators to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-11-11,"—I am not going to go into a great deal of detail, as Senator Macdonald has covered the amendment very adequately. I do, however, want to go on the record because this amendment is in both our names. I want to thank him for his efforts in getting this sorted out. In a previous life Senator Macdonald was a solicitor. He has found a way through this and, in consequence, we have been able to put this amendment up. It is a great day for those people who have had a conviction registered against them. People just could not believe that they had been criminally charged over fishing in a green zone when they did not recognise that they were in such a zone. I went through that this morning and I do not intend to go through it again. I am very pleased, however, that there are a lot of people tonight—324 of them, actually—who will not have to confess that they have a criminal conviction when they go to the police, to an insurance company, to get a passport or to take some other action. It will be a great relief to them to be able to go and apply for another job or to do certain other things that require a clean slate. This will, hopefully, go through today and they will have a clean slate.
I can not understand why, after Senator O’Brien went on the record, there is a change in the attitude of the government. I do not intend to go on about this because I want to clear up this issue as soon as possible, but I do want to put on the record again what Senator O’Brien said in the Townsville Bulletin on 19 October:
Shadow fisheries minister Kerry O’Brien said the government was holding fishermen’s votes to ransom and yesterday’s announcement was beyond the pale. ‘Frankly, it is an indictment on the government—
that’s the Howard government—
that they are prepared to play politics about these issues,’ Mr O’Brien said. ‘Those who have been convicted have had these convictions sitting against their names for some time. Why couldn’t the government act before today?’ Mr O’Brien said an elected Labor government was also sympathetic to the overturning of the criminal record of 324 fishermen convicted for defence. ‘This is about correcting the initial mistake and we would take the bipartisan position on that.’ he said.
There seems, on the part of the government, to now be a complete reversal of Senator O’Brien’s commitment. Be that as it may, I would like to go on the record and thank a gentleman called Wayne Bayne, who carried a lot of the responsibility for organising the evidence given to the committee. I also thank Senator Ian Macdonald for finding a way through this legal maze and coming up with an answer that will technically remove criminal convictions.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-11-11,"—The Greens will not be supporting this amendment. We do appreciate the fact that some recreational fishers who were convicted during this period will potentially not now have a criminal conviction. However, during the briefing that we received on this, the department told us about the approach that was being taken to enforcement at the time. They reminded those of us who were there that there was a strong focus and emphasis on education and that warnings were the primary approach. They told us that when it was first introduced there was an informal amnesty and that the introduction of the approach was phased in. Of the people that were prosecuted, a lot of them had been previously warned. The prosecution approach was only taken when there appeared to be clear knowledge, culpability and/or admission. There were also over-the-bag limits and undersized fish. I am sure that there were people who genuinely did not know that they were in the wrong place. However, I think there is a little reinventing of history going on here. It appears that everybody did not know what they were doing when they were actually fishing. We have heard the story of the tinny, the grandfather and the grandchild and, as I said, I am sure that there were a number of cases like that. I am also sure that a lot of the people that were caught actually did know what they were doing. It is also a fact that fishing contrary to a zoning plan still has the potential for a criminal conviction.
We do note that the amendment limits the spent convictions to those with convictions which occurred to a monetary penalty of less than $5,000. However, we still do not support this amendment. We believe it is inappropriate to set a precedent for deeming criminal convictions as spent when the convictions were in line with the law at the time. There is a legislative scheme for spent convictions in the Crimes Act; one that we are concerned should not be undermined. We are also concerned that while the latest version of the amendment—we do recognise there was a series of amendments here—limits the spent convictions to those with a penalty of less than $5,000, there is still the possibility of persons who did, willingly and knowingly, breach the law receiving a spent conviction. Such a threshold would also take in convictions for commercial fishing related offences. The department’s submission to the Senate inquiry indicated there were 23 convictions for commercial fishing related offences in that period and that a variety of fines had been awarded for commercial related offences, ranging from $1,500 to $40,000. We are particularly concerned that those commercial fishing related offences would be caught up in this. Those commercial fishers should have known full well that they were breaching the law.
We have often debated fishing related offences in this chamber. The last response from the government on this issue was that provisions are in place whereby those who have been caught up in this unknowingly could put a good argument to have their convictions dealt with. It is an unfortunate situation, and I do feel for those people who were caught up in this area, who now have a criminal conviction but who could potentially no longer have one. I remind the chamber that it remains a criminal conviction in some circumstances and that we do not believe that this is an appropriate way to deal with this unfortunate circumstance. We support the approach that the government outlined earlier to this place whereby people who have these convictions can take steps to have their conviction spent. We are concerned with the precedent that this amendment would set.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-11-11,"—The government does not support the amendment moved by Senator Macdonald and Senator Boswell. As we have heard, the issue was considered in detail during the inquiry into the bill. It was the committee’s view that it was not appropriate for parliament to quash the convictions in question through amendments to the bill currently before the chamber.
In reaching this conclusion, the committee made a number of points. Firstly, the majority of recreational fishers apprehended illegally fishing were dealt with by way of a warning—280 out of the 401 in the period in question. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s key approach to compliance is education. Significant efforts were and continue to be made to ensure that people are aware of the marine park zoning plan. Secondly, the decision to prosecute was made by the independent Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions based on the prosecutions policy of the Commonwealth. This policy seeks to ensure consistency in the decision to prosecute and that prosecutions are in the public interest. Thirdly, it is open to a court under the Crimes Act 1914 to discharge a person found to have committed an offence without entering a conviction. This option was exercised on a number of occasions.
Fourthly, any action to legislatively quash convictions would set a concerning precedent. I am sure Senator Brandis would have something to say about precedent setting by legislatively quashing convictions. Persons convicted were prosecuted in accordance with the law at the time, and their offence was proven in a court of law. The law was subsequently changed, and behaviour dealt with by way of a warning or prosecution can now be dealt with by way of a warning, an infringement notice or prosecution. An additional intermediate enforcement option was introduced, and that was supported by Labor in opposition.
The introduction of new enforcement mechanisms such as infringement notice schemes is quite common as governments seek innovative, flexible and efficient ways of securing compliance with the law. This often results in particular forms of offence being enforced through different means before and after regulatory reforms. It is consistent with the fundamental principle of our criminal justice system that persons committing an offence should be dealt with in accordance with the law that exists at the time that the offence is committed. The circumstance is not unique to regulation of the Great Barrier Reef, and neither the government nor the committee is aware of any examples of similar reforms in other areas that involve the revisiting of past enforcement action.
Finally, the difficulties in framing a legislative provision to quash or spend convictions was noted. For example, among recreational fishers who were convicted were people who admitted to knowing that they were inside an area closed to fishing and others who deliberately sought to obscure vessel registration numbers to avoid apprehension. Those people knew they were guilty when they were apprehended. Those people will have their convictions spent or quashed as a result of this amendment. It is an enormous precedent that this chamber looks like it is going set today.
Further, both recreational and commercial fishers were convicted under the same provision of the act. So any action to quash or spend convictions for recreational fishing would inevitably also apply to the conviction of commercial fishers, even though the infringement notices are not now used in relation to such offences. There have never been any concerns raised about the conviction of commercial fishers who have broken the law.
The amendment would apply to convicted persons fined less than $5,000. Presumably, this is an attempt to deal with the difficulties in framing a provision—difficulties that were identified by the committee. It is unclear, however, why the figure of $5,000 has been chosen. The inquiry into the bill was given very clear evidence that the maximum fine received by a recreational fisher was $2,250. I think that is a very important point that needs some clarity. Why choose $5,000, unless you are trying to capture a group of people who are commercial fishers and who have been convicted under this legislation?
During the period in question, from 1 July 2004 to 16 December 2006, there were 23 commercial fishing offences committed for which a conviction was entered. Thirteen of those 23 received a fine of less than $5,000. They would all be given a reprieve under this amendment. The proposition that the offence committed by these people is not serious is simply not true. The majority of the 13 people fined less than $5,000 were fishing from dories. These are small boats that work in conjunction with the mother vessel. So the scale of the offence might be small but the issue is a serious one. They are professional fishermen who should know and play by the rules. The fact is that there are strong incentives not to play by the rules. Scientific studies have shown that the abundance of an average size fish such as coral trout is generally much higher on reefs in marine park no-take zones than on reefs open to fishing. Studies have also shown that the difference in legal size coral trout catch rates can be as much as 12 per hour in a zone closed to fishing compared with five per hour in an area open to fishing.
These are serious offences and it is important that there is effective deterrence. Unfortunately, if this amendment is passed, 13 out of 23 commercial fishers will have convictions quashed when, in our view, they have knowingly broken the law. More generally, the broader implication of the amendment is that the existing Commonwealth spent conviction scheme will be overridden. The normal operation of the scheme means that these convictions would be spent after 10 years of good behaviour. Earlier we referred to other ways and methods for convictions to be spent which would not set the precedent which this proposal will set if carried. The amendment would undermine the coherence and credibility of the spent conviction scheme to give these offences special treatment without any justifiable rationale for doing so. In summary, this is very poor policy that would be poorly implemented. For these reasons, the government does not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-11-11,"—I am anxious to bring this matter to a vote today. It has been going on for far too long. It started its passage through the parliament in June. I do not want to carry on with the debate. Suffice it to say—

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—Thank you for your legal advice, Senator McLucas.
—I’m not a lawyer.
—Then perhaps you should confine your remarks to something that you know something about.

(Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator Macdonald!
—Madam Chair, is there some problem with what I am saying?
—No, but I think you should confine your remarks to the amendment under discussion.
—I was responding to an interjection that was unlawfully given by the minister. It was a nasty interjection, I might say. It is not that I take offence at these things, but the pot should not be calling the kettle black. I simply want to put on record that I disagree with most of the red herrings Senator McLucas has raised. If time permitted, we would go through those red herrings one by one and dismiss them. Suffice it to say that the fines that will be incurred stand. They are very substantial penalties. What we are doing is removing a conviction that was an unintended consequence of the legislation previously introduced. I again commend the amendment to the parliament.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-11-11,"—The Trade Practices Amendment (Clarity in Pricing) Bill 2008 amends section 53C of the Trade Practices Act, which requires the full cash price to be stated in advertising the price of goods and services. The policy of section 53C was originally directed at the promotion of goods and services on time payment to require suppliers to stipulate the full cost rather than merely the periodic payment and to allow consumers, especially less-sophisticated consumers, to make a meaningful comparison of prices with similar goods.
However, recent decisions in the Federal Court have thrown some doubt on the efficacy of section 53C, in its current form, to require a single price to be stated. In two cases, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dell Computers Pty Ltd and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd, the court held that quoting a compound price—that is, the price of the goods plus another compulsory component such as delivery costs or GST—did not contravene section 53C. Those decisions led to complaints that businesses were being permitted to engage in a form of bait advertising by promoting a cheap price which did not adequately disclose the existence of fees, charges and taxes. The former government, the Howard government, prepared amendments to address these concerns, which were ultimately not proceeded with pending a Productivity Commission report into consumer policy. That report was not released until after the change of government.
While this bill does not exactly mirror the former government’s proposed amendments, the policy underlying it is very similar. The principal differences between this bill and the former government’s proposed measures are: the removal of postage and handling charges from the scope of the amendments, exempting financial services, and confining the prohibition to consumer transactions. It is possible to quibble over these differences but, on balance, the opposition is satisfied that the bill addresses the major problems that have been identified since the decisions in the two cases I have mentioned. In relation to financial services, the former government enacted a comprehensive disclosure regime under the Corporations Act. Financial products and business-to-business transactions typically involve more detailed consideration of the costs than most consumer transactions, which are often made impulsively and are simpler.
The amendments will prohibit a corporation from making a representation as to price of goods or services without also specifying the single figure price a consumer must pay in order to obtain the goods or services, to the extent that a single figure price is quantifiable at the time the representation is made. It is not intended that corporations should be prohibited from using component pricing at all but rather that a single figure should be disclosed at least as prominently as the other components of the price. This will enable consumers to more easily compare like products or services and to make informed purchasing decisions. The opposition supports this bill. (Quorum formed)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-11-11,"—In dealing with issues addressed in the Trade Practices Amendment (Clarity in Pricing) Bill 2008 it is very important that we try to bring honesty back into the system of the sale of products. It has been quite evident that, in the past, more and more clouds have been cast over the way products are sold. It has always been the intention, especially of the coalition government, that the consumer would have a right of clear transparency when purchasing products. There have been occasions in the past when this has become obscured by the break-up of goods into parts and the identification of prices of the particular parts has been a mechanism of deception and concern. I think it is imperative as we go forward with this legislation that we acknowledge that trade practices law in Australia has got to march up to the world where we are living. We are living in the 21st century and, ipso facto, the market at times, not always, does fail and the capacity for the market to redeem or fix itself is lost.
Obviously, if we truly had a pure market with easy entry, with easy exit and with a capacity for new entrants to come in and bring a position of honesty into the market then the reliance on the Trade Practices Act would be limited and, in a perfect world, would not be required. But so often in trade practices law, in the life of commerce, the centralisation and the inhibitors that come to easy entry and easy exit in the market mean that the government does have a role. It has a role to step in and act as a conduit to the forces that are not there, to try as best it can to mimic what a free market would be able to do. It has always been the contention of many on the conservative side of politics that, although having a government continually and unnecessarily interposing in the market is not a desired outcome, it is a necessary evil when the market has basically lost the capacity to balance itself by natural action.
Especially with the advent of the GST, in the pricing structure of certain items it was expected that there would no longer be the capacity to break up items into particular parts and price them accordingly as a means and a mechanism to confuse the purchaser. There was one exemption, and that was the exemption for postage and handling and for things that were an addendum and clearly identified as away from the product. But more and more people took the liberty of being able to use an extension of this in such a way as to obscure the price. This piece of legislation, I hope, starts to deal with this facet and to bring it back to what was intended by the coalition: to be a clear—and that is why it is called ‘clarity in pricing’—and a better reflection to the community that is involved with the product of exactly what is part of that product. This should be generally supported. The intent of it is well known.
But I hope that it is also just one step of many steps that we have to look at. We also have legislation on creeping acquisitions that will be coming here in the near future. We are already underway on section 51AC, on unconscionable conduct. Changes have been made and instigated, initially by the coalition government, to section 46, on predatory pricing. And all the time we have to go through the balancing act of making sure that we are not overt in the marketplace but we recognise the marketplace to be imperfectly driven by what John Maynard Keynes always believed to be a desire to centralise to a point—and on centralisation to a point comes the loss of those forces that have the capacity to give the consumer an honest price from an honest marketplace.
More and more, a sense of confusion has been brought about by vendors’ greater capacity to break things up in certain ways so that people cannot really compare apples with apples because what they are actually being sold is a stem, a core, a skin and the flesh, and they are all bundled in such a way that people do not quite know what they are buying. The first price is obviously seen as a good price, but, when they have to add up all the other component parts necessary to get the total product, they actually have a very bad outcome. Clarity in pricing is an issue that we hope starts to deal with this factor.
It is going to be interesting to see, as we progress down this path, what further actions have to be taken so that the consumer can readily see what their price is. It is important that the intent that this chamber is showing, especially with clarity in pricing, is also the intent that it shows on other issues that come before it, such as creeping acquisitions. I look forward to the government being honest in their appraisal of creeping acquisitions. I look forward to them being brave enough to deal with what is truly required in creeping acquisitions. When legislation on section 51AC, on unconscionable conduct, comes forward, I hope that in that issue as well we get a sense of proportion to deal with the fact that, as we currently see under unconscionable conduct laws, we have only had two successful cases in 10 years. That tells us quite a bit about the paucity that is currently in the Trade Practices Act.
Hopefully, with a sense of bipartisan consensus, we can move forward on these issues to bring about a better oversight and a capacity for the ACCC to truly stand up as an independent player in this which works on behalf of the consumer, not on behalf of other interests that may be affecting its decisions from time to time. We also hope, in that process of making sure that the ACCC remains the independent champion for the consumer, that we do not have the occasion where senators are threatened with defamation cases to be taken before—I do not know—the High Court because they dare to question. We do not want that. We do not want a situation where certain people are intimating that there might be legal proceedings against them if they dare to question the role of the ACCC.
Obviously I hope this issue is one where we see a clear consensus so that, with clarity of pricing, we offer back to the consumer the sense that the market is not there to deceive, that the market is not there to basically rip them off. Clarity of pricing really takes the legislation to a position where the coalition presumed it was going to be anyhow with the introduction of the GST. The introduction of the GST was supposed to bring forward a form where there would have to be clarity in pricing. It is just by evolving over time that we now see that further legislation is required. I commend this piece of legislation to the Senate. It should not have been required, but it is required. I hope, for what it is worth, that we can at least shelve this issue so that we have a clear deck before we start taking on creeping acquisitions and unconscionable conduct, which I know will have a far greater resonance within the chamber and will probably involve a more heated debate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (CLARITY IN PRICING) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-11-11,"—I rise to indicate my support for the second reading of the Trade Practices Amendment (Clarity in Pricing) Bill 2008. Borrowing from the title of the bill, brevity is clarity; I do not intend to take too much of the Senate’s time in relation to this bill. I note that a version of this bill was introduced by the previous government and that the coalition supported this bill in its successful passage through the House of Representatives. I think it is important to put on the record a few brief marks about this bill, given my ongoing interest in protecting the rights of small businesses and consumers.
This bill amends section 53C of the Trade Practices Act to require advertisers to present a single-figure price so that consumers know the full amount they will have to pay when purchasing items. Currently, some companies participate in practices which, while not technically illegal, are at best confusing and at worst misleading. Such practices do not contribute to a fair and transparent market where consumers should have maximum choice and small businesses should have every chance to compete fairly. An example that would be familiar to many Australians is that of so-called ‘cheap’ air fares. In what seem like increasingly frequent airfare price wars, we see ridiculously cheap airfares advertised without indication of the associated fees and taxes until after the ticket has been purchased or is about to be purchased. This leaves the consumer in the dark about the true cost of the ticket, which may be far more than those provided by other companies that want to do the right thing by being more transparent in their pricing. Other examples of hidden costs can include on-road and dealer delivery costs for new vehicles and compulsory delivery costs for internet order items such as computers.
This bill will ensure that, when a company makes a statement about the partial price of a good or service, it will also provide the details of the full price. It will do so by making it clear in section 53C of the Trade Practices Act that companies have a responsibility to show component costs in prominent and clear ways. That is good news for consumers, and I commend the government and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Minister Chris Bowen, for addressing what are clearly deficiencies with the current act. However, there are three matters for which I request clarification from the minister in the committee stage.
Firstly, the bill states that the ‘single total price’—namely, the price paid by the consumer to walk away with the product—must be ‘quantifiable’ for it to be presented. I appreciate that in some cases there will be some fees, charges or costs and that a company will not be able to project all the costs and hence will not be able to provide a single total price. In these cases, will the advertiser be required to state prominently that there is a further charge payable and what the nature of the charge will be even if a specific price cannot be stated—in other words, how will consumers be informed in those cases where it is clearly not practicable and what thresholds are there for the practicability of that being enforced? Where are there reasonable exemptions for businesses in relation to this?
Secondly, while the ‘single total price’ is not required in business-to-business transactions, should the business that bought the product then sell it on to an individual consumer, what requirements will be on the secondary business to present all component costs? For instance, if a company bought an airfare from an airline and then sought to advertise it online, would it be required to disclose all component costs to enable transparency and greater choice for the consumer?

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I thank the speakers who have contributed to the debate today, because the Trade Practices Amendment (Clarity in Pricing) Bill 2008 is an important piece of legislation which enacts a measure that will ensure consumers throughout Australia can be certain of the total price that they have to pay for goods and services before they enter into a transaction. This is an issue that has been before us all in various stages. As Senator Xenophon said, it was introduced by the previous government, and it has been amended by this government in consideration of some of the issues that were raised in the committee stages.
We understand that consumers need certainty and clarity. Component pricing, as we know, is the practice of displaying the price for the product as the sum of the multiple parts. I recently saw this in one supermarket where they have started this practice of identifying the taxes, fees and charges associated with some services. It is quite an interesting phenomenon that consumers are becoming much more educated and critical in their comparative analysis of the pricing practices of retailers. But the practice has the potential to draw consumers into purchases based on prices that do not actually fully reflect what they will ultimately have to pay, so it is a consumer protection measure that we feel very strongly about.
Senator Xenophon mentioned the issue of cheap airfares, which is probably the most widely recognised form of component price advertising. We believe that additional compulsory fees and charges should be disclosed, not just in fine print disclaimers, particularly when those additional compulsory charges may be significantly larger than the component price that is highlighted. The amending legislation actually clarifies the operation of the provision that is currently regulated in section 53 of the Trade Practices Act.
The government believe that it is fundamental that every consumer knows how much they are going to pay when they make a purchasing decision. This measure will ensure that, when a business states the partial price of a product, they will also be required to state the total price as a single figure, to the extent that it is known and quantifiable, at the time the representation is made. The bill does not prohibit component pricing. Businesses can continue to list components of a price but this bill will ensure that, wherever it is quantifiable, a total single price must also be provided and in general it must be displayed at least as prominently as the most prominent of any component of price. This measure will ensure that the total amount the consumer will pay must be prominently stated, not just lost somewhere in a footnote. It means if a consumer is drawn to a different, highlighted price then the actual price must also be abundantly clear.
As previous speakers have highlighted just the key provisions of the bill, I want to quickly summarise them. The bill will replace existing section 53 and its associated criminal offence provision, section 75AZF of the Trade Practices Act, and the proposed provision will apply to all representations about price made by business to consumers. The bill requires disclosure of a single figure minimum total price to the extent that it is quantifiable, as I said. In practice the total price that a consumer will pay may depend on optional extras or bundled products that the consumer chooses to purchase. Clearly, these decisions cannot be known by a business in advance. So where there are a range of compulsory but varying charges which the consumer can choose from, a disclosure of the type ‘from $500’ will remain an acceptable representation of price. The total minimum quantifiable price must be stated as prominently as the most prominent of any other price amounts relating to the purchase. This prominence requirement does not only apply to written price representations. The total price must also be prominent, particularly in relation to television or radio advertisements where the price might be spoken, as well as or instead of a written figure.
While the objective of these amendments is to prevent consumer detriment, there are a number of practical considerations that have been incorporated to assist business in complying with the proposed provisions. I note that Senator Xenophon asked questions about the impact on businesses. That has been very much in the government’s mind. Firstly, businesses are only required to state the minimum quantifiable consideration for supply. This means that if a business genuinely cannot determine what the taxes or some other component of the price on a purchase will be when they make a price representation then they would not be required to state them in the total price. Secondly, the bill provides an exemption for charges relating to sending the goods from the supplier to the customer. Such charges, which include genuine postage and handling charges, need not be included in the single figure total price, although they may be included if the business so wishes.
Thirdly, financial services will not be covered by this bill. Currently, section 12DD of the Australian Securities and Investments Act 2001 mirrors section 53C of the Trade Practices Act. It is not the government’s intention to amend the ASIC Act at this time. This will allow the current disclosure regime for the financial services sector to continue. Fourthly, the proposed provision will not apply to representations which are exclusively between bodies corporate. Generally, business customers are less likely to rely on headline prices than general consumers. Any benefits associated with clearer pricing strategies would be likely to be outweighed by reducing flexibility in business-to-business ability to determine the most appropriate format for representing prices.
In conclusion, we believe this is a very balanced measure from a government which understands the regulatory burden and which seeks to minimise its impact on business wherever possible while at the same time delivering the best outcome for consumers. Consumers and industry groups have been heavily consulted on this measure, firstly by the previous government and then again by this government through a draft exposure bill and ongoing discussions with interested stakeholders. The broad support from both consumer and industry stakeholders on the bill is testament to the thoroughness of this consultation.
The bill will ensure that consumers will know how much they are really going to be asked to pay when they see an advertisement in the newspaper or on television or are given a quotation. This measure increases transparency in pricing and further empowers consumers to make the best purchasing choices possible.
I will go directly to Senator Xenophon’s concerns and the questions he asked. In relation to his first question about consumers being advised, I am advised that section 53E ensures that retailers must not mislead with respect to the price of goods and services. This can cover non-quantifiable components. Secondly, compliance costs comply with the government’s regulatory impact analysis requirements and, as I said, industry and consumers have been widely consulted on both the exposure draft and the final bill. Treasury’s advice to government is that this measure has minimal compliance costs because most businesses’ price representations already comply with the measure. The bill only targets shonky pricing representations, such as those raised by Senator Xenophon in relation to low airfare prices. With that, I commend the bill.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (CLARITY IN PRICING) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-11-11,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
The Rudd Labor Government introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Clarity in Pricing) Bill 2008 to tackle the problem of hidden fees and charges for consumer products. I am sure this bill will be welcomed by Australians because it will provide consumers with a much clearer choice when purchasing products or services.
In these times of global financial stress, this Government understands that every little bit counts when it comes to the family budget.
The bill would amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to require that where a business makes a price representation to a consumer, and that amount is less than what the consumer will actually have to pay to acquire the goods or services, the business must also prominently state a total price as a single figure. The changes will only apply to all print, television and radio advertisements.
We believe that it is inappropriate for a business to represent that a product costs a certain price and then use fine print disclaimers to reveal additional mandatory taxes, fees or other charges. The Rudd Labor Government believes that businesses that do not provide a total price, for example, those who choose to exclude taxes from their advertised price, may gain a competitive advantage over businesses that provide full price disclosure to consumers. We believe this is unfair to those business’s who do the right thing by their consumers, and this is just one reason why this piece of legislation is so important.
This Government is committed to ensuring that consumers are not given the impression that something is cheaper than it really is—we want to empower consumers to be fully informed about what they buy.
The key features of the proposed changes are:
Firstly, there will be a requirement for a single price: On enactment of this bill, there would be a requirement to specify the final price as a single figure. This must include all amounts that are quantifiable at the time of advertising. Where the total amount is not known, the minimum price must be disclosed as a single figure.
Secondly, the price must be prominently displayed: the single figure must be displayed clearly. Also, the single figure must be displayed at least as prominently as the most prominent of the other components of the price. This is because the total amount payable is usually the figure of the most importance to the consumer.
Thirdly, the new provisions are intended to apply to the advertising of consumer goods only. It is not intended to apply to price representations between businesses or between businesses and government.
An exposure draft of the bill was released for public consultation in March of this year. We received a number of submissions and based on comments received from a range of businesses and consumer advocates, the Government believes the bill will not impose unnecessary compliance burdens on businesses.
Throughout the stakeholder consultation process, it was argued that including postage and handling costs would create additional compliance burdens, particularly for online businesses, for little consumer benefit. We are of the belief that genuine postage and handling costs are a concept that is relatively well-understood by consumers.
Therefore, the bill provides that the charges for sending the goods from the supplier to the consumer do not need to be included in the total prices. However, if the postage cost is known by the business, and postage is compulsory, the provision requires that the business disclose that price in their representation, either as part of the total price or as a separate component.
The Member for Hindmarsh, Steven Georganas, commented in his second reading speech on this matter that:
“… the previous government looked at this issue during the course of its time in government. The Howard government announced that in the first half of 2005 it intended to do something about component pricing. A year later it released a draft bill and explanatory memorandum for public consultation. The bill was up on the Treasury website for some years, but the issue was allowed to drift without the prospect of any form of resolution”.
This Government believes that was an irresponsible thing to do. We are simply doing what is fair for consumers. This is yet again another example of the Rudd Labor Government doing the right thing by working families. As Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer, Chris Bowen said in his second reading speech of this bill earlier this year,
“It is fundamental that every consumer knows how much they are going to pay when they make a purchasing decision”.
He went on to say:
“It is not appropriate that additional compulsory fees and charges are disclosed in fine print disclaimers, particularly when those additional compulsory charges may be significantly larger than the component price that is highlighted.”
Gone are the days when consumers have to wonder what fees and charges are going to be added when they actually agree to buy something. This bill gives clarity and certainty to buyers throughout Australia.
The Government, however, understands that in some cases the final price may depend on factors beyond a businesses control, which is why the bill requires the total price to be stated only where a minimum total price is quantifiable at the time of the representation concerned. In addition, the amendments will not apply in respect of financial services, where detailed disclosure requirements already exist. Ultimately, the bill targets misleading “component pricing” practices.
Component pricing is the practice of advertising prices as the sum of multiple component parts, for example as $X plus $Y. Component pricing can create an impression that a product is being offered for sale at a lower price than it actually is.
The Australian Government received legal advice in 1999, in the context of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that section 530 of the Trade Practices Act required displayed prices to include any GST payable.
Implicitly, it was understood that Section 53C would also prohibit other forms of component pricing (eg price representations which exclude compulsory ‘taxes, fees and charges’, ‘levies’ or `surcharges’), unless a single figure price was also specified. The Government considers that consumers should be able to readily identify the price they will pay for a product or service. This enables consumers to easily compare prices between like products or services and make informed purchasing decisions.
This is a measure that should have been implemented a long time ago. We, as a Government, do not want to see consumers fall into a trap of being forced to buy something at a price higher than they were expecting. This bill amends the Trade Practices Act to prohibit corporations from using a component price when making a representation as to the price of a good or service. Businesses must prominently specify the single figure price a consumer must pay to obtain the product or service, to the extent that a single figure price is quantifiable at the time of making a representation.
This bill does not prohibit component pricing, provided that a single figure price is also displayed. The limitations on the use of component pricing imposed by the bill would not apply to representations made exclusively by businesses to other businesses or governments.
The changes are intended to protect consumers from misleading advertising. A common example of component pricing is evident when one buys an airline ticket, particularly online.
Airlines often offer cheap rates in their advertisements; however, once you add up the additional taxes, credit card fees and additional baggage fees, a consumer may discover they have no saved any money at all. This certainly is an irritating experience.
Other consumers may be lured into looking at cut price vehicles, unaware that the price advertised does not mention the on- road costs. This bill seeks to clarify these issues. It is the fair thing to do. It will protect Australians and ensure they can shop around for a fair deal without having to stop to read the fine print.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission received 430 complaints over confusing component pricing last year. In addition, Consumer Affairs Victoria has received around 250 complaints so far this calendar year. Many other consumers were likely misled, but did not complain to a regulator. This bill signifies The Rudd Labor Government’s commitment to the protection of consumers. This clearly is a government for all Australians.
Tony Zappia, the Member for Makin, commented in his speech on this bill that “Consumers look to government for protection in relation to their purchases, and both State and Federal governments have a responsibility in consumer law. As we all know, consumers do not always read or understand the fine print that often accompanies purchase agreements”. He is quite right. That is why I am pleased that the Rudd Labor Government has put this piece of legislation up for debate. I believe it is quite overdue.
Mr Zappia went on to say, “The vast majority of businesses that operate ethically will have no objection to these changes; in fact, they will welcome this bill, because it will probably weed out the rogue operators from within their industry. The consumers, however, will certainly benefit from this bill because it provides clarity and certainty in how much a good or service will actually cost them”.
The Rudd Government is delivering on another important pro-consumer reform that the previous government never had the courage to push ahead with.
Chris Trevor, the Member for Flynn correctly noted in his comments on this bill that:
“All too often, with recent modern methods of corporate communication and advertising, we see a figure promoted as the price and, ultimately, the expected cost to the consumer to acquire this product, only to be bombarded with fine print, asterisks, notes, disclaimers and other notable quirks and gimmicks used to hide the actual cost that the consumer must pay. It would be fair to say that, as we trained in the law often say, the devil is in the detail.”
The Government understands that the average mums and dads in our community are not lawyers. We also understand and recognise that mums and dads, the working families of Australia, do not have time to sit down and make complex comparisons between products and their prices. The Government is serious about empowering consumers and strengthening the consumer’s right to know the total price of a good or service. No longer will consumers feel ripped off when they suddenly discover that what the thought they were paying doesn’t take into account hidden taxes and charges.
These reforms will mean that consumers will know the total price they will have to pay for goods and services that they buy. The government is not interested in placing an undue burden on business or trying to fix a problem that doesn’t exist. The proposed bill represents a much welcome and long- overdue correction to the current method of doing business.
It provides a clear correction to a system that was letting consumers down, particularly the most vulnerable of consumers in our communities. Once this bill is passed, I will be proud to go back into my community and tell my constituents that comparing prices for goods and services will now be easier.
To me, this legislation is all about giving a fair go to consumers. A fair go for all is a value that has never gone out of fashion in this country. At the same time as giving a fair go to consumers, the Government has made an effort to ensure this will not affect businesses too much. We have struck the right balance. I request those opposite vote in favour of this legislation to help the working families of Australia be able to make good purchasing decisions. No Australian consumer deserves to be ripped off by unscrupulous business owners. Consumers should not be lured into buying a product or service and then slugged with additional costs. This is a good move by the Government and I commend this bill to the Senate in its entirety. I encourage those opposite to do the same.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (CLARITY IN PRICING) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-11-11,"—Now we turn to matters that are probably closer to heart. It looks like the nirvana for this fiasco is finally over. The Fuelwatch scheme is finally going to come to rest. This has been a complete and utter debacle from the word go. It shows in clear fashion where the Labor Party is on their economic management. This was a dog when it started. It became mangy through its life, and the less said about its demise the better.
Where would they have taken the Fuelwatch scheme? We have managed to go through the process of designing a scheme that was going to do no more than put up the price of fuel and was going to put the independents under threat. It was just a bells and whistles show, a pitch to the Australian consumer who was under the belief that the government was actually doing something substantive. This Fuelwatch scheme really came to its apex when Mr Walker decided that he had had enough and bolted.
—Back to WA!
—Back to WA! I think that that, coming from the inner sanctums of the ACCC, from those who are ordained to take forward this case, really personifies what a complete and utter botch job this was. This was the botch job of all botch jobs. It is now going to come to rest in a quiet recess of some dusty corner of some luminary from the other side. They will refer to it as ‘when we took on the oil companies’. That was their statement aimed at reducing the price of fuel. It was Mr Rudd who went to the Australian people, and that was his statement—he was going to reduce the price of fuel. He was going to take on the oil companies. He was also going to bring down the price of groceries. We got Fuelwatch and then we got GroceryWatch. We almost ended up with Pensionerwatch. This is why there is this incredible scepticism about this government’s capacity to go to detail, this government’s capacity to actually deliver an outcome. It is a scepticism that is building more and more.
We now see the emails going out about their $10.4 billion stimulus package. The jokes are getting better and better as they wait for 8 December to come, when the Australian economy will inspire the re-empowering of the world economy through retail therapy. This is another example of this type of Fuelwatch mentality. The Labor leopard is starting to develop spots and they all look uncharacteristically the same—it is a Fuelwatch scheme. The process and method of the Labor Party’s path through the Fuelwatch scheme of course brings about the desire of the opposition to question where we are going with the latest motor vehicle package. It is not that we do not believe that we should be protecting the motor vehicle industry—we do. We just have absolute trepidation about their capacity to deliver a scheme that does that. Fuelwatch was a fiasco. Its objective was to ‘empower consumers to make informed decisions’—empower consumers by basically giving the oil companies the capacity to lock out independents in price and to take away any chance of the people who could least afford it making the best of the price dips in the marketplace.
Now we see exactly where we are. The ACCC had to make an appointment from within their own ranks for the Fuelwatch commissioner after Mr Walker, rightly, ran away. It was amazing. In questioning the poor gentleman from the ACCC who has landed this job, I said, ‘You must be the luckiest man in the ACCC.’ He could not help but have a wry smile across his face, because he had been landed with this detritus and one of the more unfortunate approaches of Mr Bowen. This will unfortunately have to go on the record of Mr Bowen, on his capacity and aptitude to bring forth a change that delivers an outcome. It failed miserably.
We never gave the ACCC any real extra powers to deal with this issue. The government never said to them that they were fair dinkum, that they were going to take the oil companies on. They never have the courage or the conviction to hand to the ACCC and to the Fuelwatch commissioner the capacity to truly take on the oil companies. There was never the program to talk about bringing alternate products into the market to bring true competition in. There was never the capacity to look at such things as bio-renewable fuels or coal-to-liquids or a greater incorporation of gas-to-liquids; there was just the belief that, if someone is walking backwards and forwards over you, as the oil companies were, and you somehow said, ‘We’re going to scare you to death with Mr Walker,’ that they would believe it. Of course it did not work. In the end it probably made the situation worse, because now the oil companies have seen the capacity of this government to take them on—and I think they would be resting very easily at night. I do not think they would be losing a minute’s sleep about exactly what the intent of this government is when it comes to bringing back to the Australian consumers a cheaper product. We also have the frustration once more that we have seen the price of a barrel of oil go down—I note the price of the dollar has gone down, but it is also starting to head back up a bit—but we have not seen the delivery back to the consumer of a discount in the price, which they deserve.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2008-11-11,"—I rise to speak on this day, the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I—the war that was to end all wars. Of course, sadly, it did not. The horror, the waste, the death, the broken bodies and broken lives, and the wholesale destruction still go on today. And it is in the context of broken bodies and broken lives that I speak today. It relates to the study being undertaken into the intergenerational health effects of military service by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
Australia’s proud military history consists mostly of our troops leaving Australia to do battle in someone else’s country. My good friend John Schumann, well known for his support of our veterans, has written elsewhere that troop departures are characterised by the raising of the national flag, the swelling of the national chest and the dampening of the national eye. He says that when a government sends members of our armed forces into conflict, ordinary Australians sometimes forget that we all share the responsibility.
Government has a responsibility to ensure that our forces are well trained and well equipped. We must ensure that they can be rested and replaced after an appropriate time. When our troops start coming home, we all have a serious responsibility to look after these people and their families when they return. Those with physical wounds must be treated, cared for and compensated, as must those who have been damaged psychologically. If history is a guide, physical and psychological damage will extend to the veterans’ families.
It is perhaps not always known that the physical and psychological traumas suffered by the men and women we send away to fight wars in our name are visited upon their families too—especially upon the children. This was certainly the case for our Vietnam veterans, and there is mounting evidence that the soldiers, sailors and air men and women who are returning from active service and their families are suffering too as a result of this service. The government is therefore to be commended for its open, honest approach to this issue and its willingness to search for the truth, however unpalatable it might be for all of the stakeholders.
The Department of Veterans’ Affairs has started using a random sampling process to select people with military service and invite them to participate in a survey. Ten thousand soldiers have been selected by the research group to register for the study, but the response rate to date has, sadly, been quite low. Many admit to receiving the request for assistance but, for reasons best known to themselves, they are yet to post back their replies and their agreement to participate.
I take this opportunity to urge ex-service personnel—combat veterans and national servicemen—and their families to register for participation. I urge all other Australians to talk to their ex-service and veteran friends and their families and encourage them to register. This is a critical study and it might well determine how future military generations—and in that I include military families—are treated by future governments. The participating numbers need to rise considerably if the study is to be successful.
The study applies to veterans who served overseas during the sixties and seventies as well as those who remained in the military on the Australian mainland. Without this latter comparison group, it might be difficult to use the study’s results to establish that a serviceperson’s overseas service has contributed to their compromised health or to that of a partner, children or, indeed, grandchildren. Much time and effort has been spent designing this study, and to have it fail through lack of numbers would be a tragedy that might well reverberate throughout the whole country for many generations to come.
This request to be part of the study is not made only to those with some lasting difficulties. The study needs the widest sample possible. My plea on Remembrance Day is for everyone who served during the sixties and seventies and served in Vietnam or remained in Australia to contribute to this study. National service personnel are very much part of this program. Their contributions to the information collected will significantly enhance the study’s depth and usefulness.
This study has no relationship to any pensionable status they may be entitled to hold, and personal physical information will not be made available to government agencies. This is a world-first study. No-one has ever done this type of work study before. All previous research done on these various topics does not cover the brief of this study. The Australian government, I am very proud to say, has set aside $13.5 million specifically for this study and a similar prospective smaller one for currently-serving troops. The research work will be done by tertiary university bodies that tendered for the studies. My understanding is that these independent bodies have yet to be selected, but the research work will not be done in-house by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
I understand that many ex-service people have been through studies before and may have felt uncomfortable about the outcomes. I urge those people to put those fears aside. This study is not just about veteran and service personnel; it is also about the families of all future serving personnel. The fact is that troops fighting a war put their lives and futures on the line. It is the very highest form of public service. The nation, through the government of the day, must respond generously and unreservedly to those who claim to be damaged by fighting these wars, and to their families if their lives have been affected in some way by that service. This important study is a measure of my government’s commitment to the health of our veterans and their families, and I urge all those who can participate to do so.
