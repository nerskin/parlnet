"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-07-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:30):  Chair, if you recall, when we finished on this last session I was halfway through speaking on my amendment. I see the minister looking at me a bit strangely. I think I will go back to the top of my comments on the amendment so that we can reacquaint ourselves with where we were up to.


So this is an amendment. As you would be aware, the Greens are opposing this bill because we are concerned that the process is in fact taking us backwards in how we deal with ag-vet chemicals in this country. If this bill is going to succeed, which I understand from the numbers it probably will because the ALP are not supporting their own changes to the process, my amendment seeks to put in place a process to deal with chemicals that are judged to have unmanageable risk and those in the highest risk category.


We believe there is no doubt that some agricultural and veterinary chemicals have damaged human and environmental health—I do not think that is in dispute—and continue to pose risks to both. Risk management should be at the core of any registration program, and those chemicals that pose unacceptable and unmanageable risks should not be permitted in Australia. We want the approach to risk taken by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the APVMA, to reflect contemporary science in toxicology and regulatory approaches in other countries. We are concerned that this in fact is not going to be the case.


Without the re-registration scheme and the associated regulations which this bill pertains to, there is still too much discretion being given to the APVMA to determine undue hazard to the safety of people and the environment, without a suitable framework under which to determine that risk. This amendment is no substitute for a proper re-registration scheme, but it will add to the criteria for reassessment and will operate to ensure that there are some clear and transparent decision-making criteria to guide the APVMA in its decision making about what to reassess.


This amendment asks for the reassessment to occur as soon as possible but is not time bound. This is less constraining than the re-registration process, which would have required the APVMA to undertake reassessment of those high-risk chemicals within 12 months. This amendment also calls on the APVMA to monitor what is happening internationally and to engage in reassessment when the UK, New Zealand, the USA or Canada bans a chemical product.


This amendment builds on the criteria we negotiated with the previous government, which were circulated to members, and is an attempt to build on all the work that has been done to get a more thorough process in this country. We supported the work that was previously done. We are disappointed the ALP is no longer supporting its own amendments. In fact, there are many chemicals that still need to be assessed and we are now going to tie up both the community and producers in ongoing debates and campaigns to get chemicals assessed, whereas through the previous amendments that were made in this place we had a proper process.


What we are trying to do is build an assessment process so that all people who are concerned about these issues actually understand the process and so there is a more defined process. At the moment, with the government taking away the amendments that were made, we are being taken back essentially to the bad old days when we all had to campaign to get chemicals assessed. There are still a number of grandfathered chemicals and, despite what both the ALP and the government have said, there are many chemicals that were grandfathered and that have not had contemporary assessments. As I articulated earlier, some of the previous work has been lost, so we do not know which chemicals were looked at by states. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (10:34):  Obviously the government is not supporting the Greens' amendment, and Senator Siewert acknowledged that in her remarks. I would like to reiterate a few points from what we said earlier and to counter some of the statements Senator Siewert has just made.


The government are not taking the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Removing Re-Approval and Re-Registration) Bill 2014 right back to where it was prior to the Labor Party's amendments when they were previously in government; what we are doing is removing the compulsory reregistration process because we do believe there are sound procedures in place with which to manage agricultural chemicals. I do not think we differ from the Greens in requiring them to be safe for use, but we do think it is important to remove the compulsory reregistration process, as we have said before, because it is an excessive layer of regulation.


We can take into account and we do take into account what happens in other countries. I think that is a very important point to reiterate. Senator Siewert would probably know, having sat in estimates, that there are some actives that are not available for use in Australia that are available for use in other countries, so in some circumstances we do actually lead other countries. I recall the quite intensive discussion around omethoate that we had at Senate estimates a couple of years ago. At that time it was still available for use in New Zealand but was being removed for certain uses in Australia because of our concerns about the potential health impact on children. There was large discussion about its use on tomatoes and about our tomato exports to New Zealand.


We do have systems in place in Australia to deal with adverse events. I know Senator Siewert understands that. Given that we do take into account what happens overseas—we can take into account data that is produced overseas and events that occur overseas, such as a genuine prohibition in another country—that provides parameters for safe and sound use of agricultural chemicals in this country. It is important to note that studies have indicated that up to 20 per cent of our agricultural production could be lost without the use of agricultural chemicals. They are a very important element in our food security. Yes, we need to make sure that they are managed properly. Yes, we need to make sure that they are safe and have proper efficacy. The government believes the action it is taking with this legislation actually provides a sound regulatory framework to deal with the proper safety measures for agricultural chemicals but without overregulation.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:37):  I will not detain the chamber very long. We have been debating the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Removing Re-Approval and Re-Registration) Bill 2014 on and off for a while. I want to make a couple of short points. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture was not meaning to suggest that the Greens are opposed to all chemical use with his comment that if we did not have chemicals we would lose 20 per cent of our production. We certainly do not come from the position that we need to stop all chemical use. We appreciate, and are fully aware of, the role that chemicals do play. We are concerned around the use of toxic chemicals in production. I will not go into the nature of the debate, but Fenthion is a classic example. The debate on that has been going on for 15 years. I think that is too long. It has delayed the industry being able to move to find alternatives. I do not want to see that happen with other chemicals.


I acknowledge that the minister is correct in saying that Australia has led other countries in some areas—I absolutely agree with that—but in other areas it has not. There are still a number of chemicals that are used in this country that are no longer in use in other markets. We believe we need a better process. We think this is a step backwards. We think we need a stronger process in place and that is why I moved this amendment. I understand the government is not going to support this amendment. We will be watching this process very carefully to see how the APVMA go about their assessment processes from now on. We think it is not going to be in the best interests of the industry in the long term because we think we will be back to the trenches fighting over particular chemicals rather than having a clear process for the assessment of chemicals, particularly those with unmanageable risks.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senators Conroy and Singh today relating to the proposed repeal of the carbon tax.


Senator Abetz should think back to what happened for the coalition back in 2001, when the former Liberal president, Shane Stone, described the coalition as 'mean, tricky and nasty'. What I would be putting to the Palmer United Party is that nothing has changed since 2001—absolutely nothing. And if any of you are surprised that the coalition would be mean, tricky and nasty, then you have not thought about the history of this Liberal Party in this country. Shane Stone not only said in 2001 that the Liberals were mean, tricky and nasty; he also said that they were 'dysfunctional' and 'out of touch with the Liberal base'. He went on and said that they were not listening to the Liberal base and they had to be dragged screaming to fix mistakes.


I think the PUP know that that last point, about having to be dragged screaming to fix a mistake, is quite clearly their experience of last Thursday when this Senate descended into the most dysfunctional Senate that we have seen for many, many years in this place. The Prime Minister said, 'We have got situation normal.' Well, I do not know what was normal about last Thursday. When I had a look around, we had coalition negotiators running around here like chooks with their heads cut off—quite clearly running around the place not knowing what was going on, having completely lost control of the Senate. We had the coalition senators after the debate in what was described to me as a 'catatonic state'. I was not sure quite what a catatonic state was, but it is described in the dictionary as 'muscular rigidity and mental stupor'. Well, there was clearly a catatonic state amongst the coalition senators last Thursday! As to what happened, you see it time and time again here in question time: you see Senator Abetz blaming the Labor Party for all of the problems in this country. He blames everyone else. They do not blame themselves. So what did they do with the PUP? They blamed the catastrophic failure of the coalition leadership in this place to be able to negotiate their bill through the Senate on the inexperience of the new senators. So they immediately went to the blame game—they blamed the new senators.


Then we had Senator Lambie blame Senator Abetz. She said: 'The crossbench will make him pay for his silly games.' So, quite clearly, Senator Abetz was out there playing silly games. Senator Lambie also came out and said to the Prime Minister, 'You should sack Senator Abetz immediately.'




Senator Abetz:
  Very sound advice!




Senator CAMERON:
  'Sound advice' says Senator Abetz—well, maybe Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister, will carry it through, given that Senator Abetz is saying that that is sound advice!


Then Senator Lambie went on to say: 'I think they are disgraceful. They need to put someone up there who has communication skills and is not prepared to try and trick you, because that is not the way forward.' Can I say to Senator Lambie: I know you are new in here, but you should learn very quickly about Senator Abetz; you got him in one, and you have certainly belled the cat in relation to Senator Abetz. What you said was: 'We tried to give him a little bit of trust, and they have blown it out of the water. So I guess it is just open slather.' But why would you think that Senator Abetz would do anything other than mislead you? It was a political shambles. It was arrogance and incompetence. They sought to put the guillotine in and then they tried to filibuster their own guillotine. This was a pathetic performance by the coalition, and I think it epitomises everything that is wrong with this government. It is about a government that lied its way to power. It is a government that would lie to other senators. It is a government that would mislead senators as they misled the country. (Time expired)

Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (15:06):  Whatever else you say about me, I am not catatonic! So I thank Senator Cameron for his contribution, and I might confine my contribution to Senator Singh's question. As Senator Abetz said in his excellent opening answer in question time today, 66 out of the 76 senators elected to this place were elected on the basis of 'no carbon tax'. Yet here we are, seemingly in a parallel universe, still debating the same issue, after all this time. You talk about legislative mandates—and perhaps that is thrown about a bit too much in this place. But if there has ever been a legislative mandate in the time I have been in this parliament, it is to repeal the carbon tax. Even today The Australian on the front page had a survey: again, the vast majority of Australians say 'Get rid of the carbon tax.' 


Why? Fundamentally, the carbon tax will not lower global temperatures but it will lead to higher costs for Australian industry and Australian consumers and will make for a less competitive economy. That is why we have had this debate between the coalition, the Greens and the Labor Party over the last eight or nine years.


To summarise: Labor and the Greens lost, and the coalition and the Australian public won. This tax will go. Any impost of $9,000 million to the economy coming from a carbon tax has to go. This is at a time with escalating public debt—a public debt trap left by the Labor Party after their six years in office—skyrocketing public debt and, at the same time, they are opposing getting rid of the carbon tax, which makes is harder for Australian industry. The hypocrisy and the lack of responsibility is absolutely breathtaking. 


I saw last Friday a quote in the editorial in The Australian from Dr Martin Parkinson who, as you know, is the Secretary of the Treasury. He said that if we remain on this public debt trajectory, Australia will be in inevitable decline. That is a fact, and yet this lot want to make it harder to get rid of the carbon tax. That is pretty sensible, isn't it? Only the Australian Labor Party would do that.


The entire genesis of Labor's failure to deal with carbon policy goes right back to the moral vanity of Kevin Rudd. If he had not been so stupid and so morally vain as to seek to impose on this country—my country—before anywhere else in the world an ETS, we would not be in this ridiculous situation that we are in now. He was far more concerned with running around with Al Gore and Ban Ki-moon all those years ago than he ever was about sensible carbon policy. It is the most disgraceful, self-centred and morally vain performance by a Prime Minister in my time. I have never seen anything like it, and it was pathetic. He so skewed public debate in this country that he we are right now still debating this issue. 


The politics of photo opportunity and moral vanity took over from sensible public policy. It was absolutely pathetic and that should be engraved on the tombstone of Kevin Rudd's political career—the absolute moral vanity to commit Australia to an ETS prior to the Copenhagen climate change conference, and that act of political bastardry has set this nation on this course over the last six years. It is a disgrace, and we should never, ever forget the genesis of this entire debate. I certainly will never let the Labor Party or Kevin Rudd forget it. 


In the end, if it was such a good idea, we would have all those other countries, those resource-rich countries, those trade exposed countries like Brazil, Russia, India, China, the United States and Canada in favour. Not one of them has made a commitment in the last seven years. Why would that be? Because they know it is not in their national interest, and this lot hate that they have not been able to sell the fact that this policy is in the national interest because it is not. It harms our national interest and it is a disgrace that they still oppose the carbon tax. (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (15:11):   Rarely have I heard a Senate contribution so lacking in insight as the one I have just heard from Senator Mason. I am going to approach this debate a little differently: I am going to be rational, because nobody can pretend that managing this Senate chamber is easy. As the Manager of Government Business for the majority of the life of the Keating government and also as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for the best part of a decade, I know this as well as anybody who sits in this chamber. 


It is true: we now have a higher proportion of crossbenchers than at any time since 1910. I have got to be honest—and I am disappointed to say this—and I should acknowledge that the Australian Labor Party's representation is at the lowest proportion of Labor senators we have seen since 1938. I do not pretend it is easy for anyone—the government, the opposition, the minor parties or the Independents—to fulfil their chamber management responsibilities. But the principles of chamber management are clear, and we have known them for a very long time.


Much of the negotiation in this chamber of course has to happen off the floor and, in that negotiation, a government has to be clear. It has to be forthright. It has to be frank and straightforward in what it says and what it puts to all non-government senators. A government cannot afford to engage in trickery, shenanigans or double-dealing in this place. 


This means that any motion or amendment that the government wants to put to the chamber it has to provide with adequate notice to every non-government senator. It must fairly and openly share information with all parties. The government of course also should use all the resources it has at its disposal, particularly with the advantages of incumbency from agencies and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel who are expert in drafting amendments so they can meet all the technical and legal requirements of amendments.


I would have more respect for the coalition minister who apparently described the new senator as 'stark raving mad' if instead of saying it to a journalist that they had said it to them. I would have more respect for a minister if they said an amendment was 'crazy, crazy, crazy' if they were to say it directly to the chamber. I would also strongly suggest that a government should never waste time by moving procedural motions when it does not have the numbers to pass them or, if it does have the numbers to pass them, then finds its own proposal unhelpful to its own management. Of course, that is what happened last week.


What we saw last week was the government move and lose two procedural motions on Monday as well as have a suspension of standing orders motion lapse before question time that day. They lost a motion to have the package of carbon bills declared urgent on the Wednesday and had eight carbon price repeal bills and schedule 5 of the clean energy legislation repeal negatived. This is the worst, most amateurish and ham-fisted chamber management I have seen since I have been here.


But, as I said, I do not want to be like Senator Mason; I would like to finish my contribution on a positive note. So, finally, let me say this: we are lucky that the Senate Clerk's office provides such a professional and impartial service to all senators—government, opposition, minor parties and Independents in this place, because I would say that without their integrity we would be lost.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  Of course, I add my remarks in support of what Senator Faulkner said at the very end of his speech. And I am sure that other senators will join me in acknowledging the great work that the Clerk and the Clerk's office do for this Senate and for this parliament as a whole.


Senator Cameron started his contribution by talking a little bit about 'catatonic'. For those who missed the word, 'catatonic' was first described in 1874, if I remember correctly. He used the word 'catatonic', which is a state of neurogenic motor immobility and behavioural abnormality manifested by stupor to describe the actions of some people in this place. I prefer to use the psychological expression 'state of denial'.


'State of denial' was first used by Sigmund Freud and it describes someone or something—or some people, I am sure—who refuses to accept the truth. It is a phrase used to describe a person who is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it, instead insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming evidence.


So let us just cast our minds back to post September last year—




Senator Bilyk:
  Are you describing your budget?




Senator SMITH:
  You will enjoy this Senator Bilyk; please let me finish in the time I have available to me.


What did Labor members say following the September 2013 election? What did the Labor member for Wakefield, Mr Nick Champion, say? He said in an interview on ABC radio's AM program on 11 September 2013 with regard to the carbon tax:


I don't see why the Labor Party should necessarily stay wedded to this concept when everybody else has walked away from it in one form or another.


That is what the Labor member for Wakefield said immediately following the federal election.




Senator Bilyk:
  Why are you wedded to your budget? Everybody else isn't!




Senator SMITH:
  Senator Bilyk, I can accept that one comment from one Labor member may not be enough. So let me give you another. Let me give you the comments of Mr Richard Marles, the member for Corio, on 12 September. He was reported in the West Australian newspaper—very reliable journal that it is. He said that Labor needed to choose its battles carefully, and:


We do need to acknowledge the fact that Tony Abbott won the election and we lost, …


Of course, some Labor senators might prefer to hear from former Labor members—indeed, former Labor premiers. So I might share with you what Bob Carr had to say some years ago about the electorally-sensitive matter of political mandates. What did Bob Carr have to say? He was talking on Channel 9 in 1998 about the Howard government—their re-election and the importance of their mandate.




Senator Bilyk:
  Why not go back to the 1800s again?




Senator SMITH:
  Would you like to listen to what former Labor senator and Labor premier, Bob Carr, had to say? Mr Carr said:


My view is that a government with a majority in any lower house ought to be able to implement its program not subject to frustration by an upper house, …


That is what Labor senator, Bob Carr, had to say.


What we have seen since September 2013 is a perpetual state of denial by most Labor members and, indeed, all Labor senators. And I think it is just worth reflecting on what was happening one year ago today. I would just like to talk about an article in the Sunday Telegraph. It was headlined 'Carbon tax to go as Rudd eyes poll'. This was Sunday, 14 July 2013—12 months ago. The article goes on to say:


KEVIN Rudd will announce plans to scrap the carbon tax within days as he clears the decks for an election.


Kevin Rudd, planning to abandon the carbon tax.


What we had yesterday was not criticism of Independent and minor party senators; it was a criticism of the Labor Party and its decision to stand in the way of repealing the carbon tax. Let's be clear: the coalition is critical of Labor senators who in one breath say that they will repeal the carbon tax and in another breath say that they will keep the carbon tax. Labor in the Senate is operating in a state of denial and it is now time to reflect the proper mandate of this government, demonstrated by its overwhelming election at the polls in September 2013. The time is right to repeal the carbon tax; to free Australian businesses and to allow jobs to be created. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:21):  I also rise to take note of answers to questions I and Senator Conroy asked of Senator Abetz. I start by speaking in support of Senator Cameron's remarks on this debate, when he outlined Shane Stone's comments on the coalition as being mean, tricky and nasty; nothing has changed, as Senator Cameron noted.


I also rise to support Senator Faulkner's comments on the principles of chamber management. What we saw last week from the government was the trampling of the Senate's principles of chamber management and, through that, the lack of government authority in this place. We did not see the sort of adult government that the Prime Minister had outlined—




Senator Conroy:
  Promised!




Senator SINGH:
  had promised he would deliver under his leadership. We saw the absolute contrary: we saw a childish government, in so much as there was certainly no authority in the government. Then we saw the name-calling—which has been reported in the media—by coalition ministers, senators and representatives, based on the fact that they could not get their way and therefore could not manage the standard of parliamentary business that was expected of them; they resorted to the tactic of calling those new senators names. If that was anything like adult, then I do not know what adult is—because that was certainly schoolyard behaviour to me. That was childish behaviour in the first degree.


What we also saw last week, throughout all of these chaotic shenanigans that were going on on the government benches, was a government that actually did not care about the policy at hand. That started early on in the week. That started when, on Monday, the government tried to force through the Senate the debate on the repeal bills immediately, even though it was clear the government knew that the Senate committee report into those bills was not due for another week. After breaching those rules and failing in its first attempt, the government eventually persuaded enough crossbenchers to suspend standing orders and bring on debate immediately. Labor senators spent the week advocating our policy of moving from a fixed carbon price to an emissions trading scheme that would put a cap on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. That was the policy at hand. That was what was important to the debate. But during the second reading debate on those bills on Tuesday, Labor made it very clear that we would be moving amendments to seek to move to an emissions trading scheme—something not supported by the government.


The coalition then spent the week trying to repeal carbon pricing, to leave Australia with no serious policy to tackle climate change. I asked Senator Abetz today, in relation to the price pass-through mechanism, questions about consultation. He clearly did not give any answer as to whether the government's price pass-through mechanisms have actually been consulted on at large. Instead, he tried to play politics with that answer.


I then further tried to ask whether the proposed pass-through laws would only apply to electricity and energy suppliers and not to grocery and other major retailers. Again, there was an unclear answer—if it was any answer at all—from Senator Abetz. I know that in the other place today, similarly, there was a lack of an answer from the member for Sydney when the question was asked of the Prime Minister; he failed to guarantee that grocery prices would fall.



There has been a complete disregard today for providing answers, to the Senate and to the Australian community, about what the government is going to put on the table when it comes to the amended repeal bills that will be presented to this place this week. Instead, we could almost expect to end up with another chaotic shambles like we had last week. That is something that is still on the table. We all know where that ended up last week: with Thursday's farce, when we saw a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister as the government's bullying turned into a debacle when the government finally secured its deal with the crossbenchers to impose a guillotine.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:08):  I move:


That the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013, made under sections 41-45(1A) and (1B) of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, be disallowed.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Perhaps I should explain this disallowance motion so that the Senate may find it easier to follow.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We would be most appreciative if you did, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  This regulation was made under sections 41-45(1A) and (1B) of the Higher Education Support Act 2003. This determination is part of a measure that would cut $2.3 billion from the higher education sector. It precedes the $5.8 billion in cuts to universities and student support which were announced in the budget. It precedes the government's damaging and alarming ideological agenda to change the very structural basis of the higher education system in this country and this government, in all its manifest hubris, likes to pretend that this is anything other than a Liberal-National policy determination. It is a determination of a Liberal minister. 


This Liberal-National party cut is brought about by the Minister for Education, Mr Pyne, who, we all appreciate, is now facing considerable difficulty in this portfolio. This minister has had three separate positions on Gonski. The minister said before the election that there would be no changes to university funding and, indeed, he repeated this promise prior to the budget. We all know what happened in that regard. The minister said before the election he would not raise HECS but now wants to raise HECS to such a level that $100,000 degrees could well become the norm. This is a determination by a minister who, like his Prime Minister, has one modus operandi when it comes to the operation of government policy—that is, the big lie. In no sector of the operation of the Commonwealth has this technique been demonstrated more clearly than in education. This is not surprising because the coalition has long been an enemy of education. The audacity of the minister to introduce these cuts on one hand while pretending the government has nothing to do with them on the other is, by all standards, truly shocking. It shows a contempt for the public, a contempt for the higher education sector. 


Labor does not support the cuts to university funding that this determination would enact and we do not support the further cuts to higher education planned by the coalition. Additional cuts are clearly on the way. Make no mistake: whatever the fate of this as yet unseen legislation, which we are now told may well be ready by October, there is no question about what the government intends to do—that is, to cut higher education still further. The government does not properly understand the value or the role of universities in a knowledge economy because it has a very narrow view about putting money into education.


 It is not, in their minds, an investment; rather it is a cost because they say there has to be some short-term return that can be measured purely in dollars and cents. Therefore, taking money out of education, according to this line of logic, makes economic sense. Universities, it is argued, produce and disseminate knowledge, they help us solve problems, they make new products and processes, they protect our environment and they help us understand ourselves. In doing all of these things, nations grow in stature, economically, culturally and even politically. Universities should not be treated just as mere degree factories because they enrich our lives. That is what we mean by the public benefit associated with investment in education.


Many of those opposite had the very great fortune to benefit from a free education system. Many of them benefited from engaging in university politics, in sports and in clubs. Some would say they benefited so much that they never actually got out of student politics, that they have never been able to step outside their experience of university politics where they faced considerable hostility and that they want to feed that back through the political system to the end of their days. For some reason, there remains a contempt within the Liberal Party about the university system, a contempt which, in itself, beggars belief. This is reflected in every policy they have brought to bear on the sector. It is astounding that they would point to the Howard government's record on this. 


Labor is very familiar with this record. We had to clean it up when were in government. When the coalition formed government in 1996, one of their very first acts was to plunder the higher education sector, without a word of warning. They delivered a massive five per cent budget cut to the higher education sector and none of that was announced before the election of the Howard government. Student fees skyrocketed, Commonwealth supported places slumped and billions of dollars were stripped out of the system in the decade of neglect which followed. They claimed that total government spending for universities increased by 13 per cent in real terms during their time in government. Even if that were true, it would still be a pretty ordinary record. To claim this kind of paltry figure shows the complete lack of understanding on the part of those opposite of the growing role of universities in our society.


Some figures are even more telling. From 1995 through to 2005, direct public payments to tertiary institutions showed no real growth—none whatsoever. It gets worse. Over the same period, total funding per capita of our universities fell by nine per cent. Funding fell due to two things: there were cuts and there was neglect. If we take indexation, the party of self-proclaimed market economists—with the exception of the agrarian socialists that act as their allies—left universities with a system of indexation which was totally and completely inadequate to meet the needs of contemporary Australia. It was a system of indexation so out of touch with the realities of running a modern university that, when Labor adjusted the formula to reflect real cost, it added billions of dollars over the forward estimates—money the coalition had been withholding from universities. With so many economic geniuses in their ranks, one can only assume that it was done deliberately because of hostility! Well, it surely couldn't be just a question of ineptitude! But others would suggest I am wrong on that.


They did not stop there. Not content with draining the budget, they also went after the culture of universities. Sporting clubs, legal services, child care, social events—they all had to go. Of course, that was all tied up with their approach to voluntary student unionism.




Senator Ryan:
  Hear, hear!




Senator KIM CARR:
  This decimated student services. I hear 'Hear, hear' from over there. You see—the policy has not lost its flavour for those on that side of the chamber. Only when Labor undid that wrong and brought in the student support and amenities fee did we begin to see essential services return to strength on campuses.


The coalition's meddling on campuses did not just affect student-run services. The long arm of this sort of neo-right ideology reached back into the staffrooms and the administration blocks, forcing universities to implement aspects of the coalition's industrial relations agenda or risk losing funding. Those were the higher education workplace relations requirements under the legislation at the time, and of course they very much became part of Work Choices. The party that claimed to hate regulation created a special branch of it just to tell universities what conditions they could and could not offer their staff.


Those opposite talk about their legacy in higher education—well, let me say to this chamber: it is a legacy that has not been forgotten. The legacy of the Howard era in higher education left the university system in crisis. It was a decade of neglect and much, much worse.


These actions of over a decade ago sound a warning, because it is the same coalition, with many of the same faces, using the same cabinet submissions to operate on the current policy position—as we see, for instance, with the cabinet submission which was leaked in 1999 which outlines chapter and verse what this government is doing today.


It was two months into their term when the government identified $1.43 billion in cuts to the education portfolio. This was on top of more than $3.7 billion in cuts in their first 100 days of government. Mr Abbott once claimed that universities would experience a period of 'masterly inactivity' under his government. Of course, that was wrong—there has been a great deal of activity. Either the Prime Minister was unaware of secret plans to gut higher education or that was, knowingly, totally untrue. So they started with the $3.7 billion worth of cuts and they continued this with an announced $5.8 billion. We saw it in the past under the Howard government and now it is flowing through to this current government.


Labor set about reducing the damage to the universities and, almost as soon as we formed government, we initiated the most significant review of higher education to date—the Bradley review. We also had the Cutler review, and initiated changes to the research program to ensure that we were able to meet the real costs of research. Under the Labor government, Commonwealth funding for universities rose from $8 billion to $14 billion between 2007 and 2013. And, if we were still in office, that amount, under Labor's forward estimates, would grow to $17 billion by 2017. We increased real funding per student by nearly $2,000 in real terms to $18,000 per year. Labor improved indexation and replaced the hopeless, out-of-date system. We increased funding for the science, research and innovation budget by well over 30 per cent, compared to the previous government. We delivered more capital and infrastructure in four years than the coalition managed to do in the whole decade that they were in office. Labor delivered more than $5 billion in higher education and research infrastructure while we were in office. We began one of the largest reforms ever undertaken in the university system, moving towards the demand-driven system which led to the additional 190,000 extra students in universities compared to 2007. The government talks today about 80,000. Well, that record is well and truly surpassed by actual places in universities—and not at a reduced rate; not the sort of proposition that the government is talking about at the sub-degree level. Because of our initiatives today there are an additional 36,000 students from disadvantaged backgrounds actually at university, and we set the goal of increasing the proportion of the population with a degree to 40 per cent of 25- to 35-year-olds by 2020. For women, that goal has already been achieved. And for the whole community, we were within cooee of reaching that goal already—well before the 2020 date. We provided significant funding for those universities with substantial numbers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 


But this is a government that actually gets rid of equity targets. This is a government that cuts equity programming. We argue that that approach is wrong. We believe that our university system should be for everyone with ability, regardless of how much money their parents have. That is why we also sought to ensure that the university experience itself was a rewarding one and supported the student services and amenities fee.


We made it easier for young people to study through reforms to youth allowance, so that more than 220,000 young people received the maximum rate—a much higher rate of payment—for the first time. So much of what we did was to repair the damage of the coalition's previous government. The reckless damage and wilful neglect wreaked by the government that is now back in office shows us a measure of how the coalition actually operates in government. We are very proud of our record. We take the view that the Commonwealth of Australia should respect the role of universities and, to this end, we want universities to play a leading role in our nation's future. We believe the economic argument for investment in universities is very, very clear; universities directly contribute about $22 billion to our GDP every year; they employ over 100,000 people; university graduates contribute more than $170 billion per year in wages to our economy; and university graduates comprise about one-quarter of the population that generates almost one-third of Australia' wages. There are about nine Australian companies listed on the Fortune Global 500, but there are 19 universities in the world's top 500—that is Australia making its mark internationally.


Universities play a fundamental role in building Australia's future. They are essential to innovation. They produce the knowledge and the ideas. They help build the new technologies. They help build the new industries and they create the new jobs. They play an essential role in local economies. We just need to look at what is happening at Wollongong or in Newcastle—I might add Deakin University in Geelong and the central role that it plays in rural and regional Australia. 


Universities help us to interpret our world and to adapt to change. They help us grow in stature as a nation, and we do not want to see them decimated by a government that has no respect for the work that they do and therefore their importance in our future and the future of a knowledge based economy. 


Those opposite have a long history of attacking not just the university budgets and university culture; they, unfortunately, have a well-ingrained process of denigrating their work. They have an indifference to the importance of intellectual work in this society. Their failure to even, for instance, appoint a minister for science highlights the negligence of the government. Of course, we see this replicated in their cruel cuts to jobs at the CSIRO. They have sustained attacks on the independence of the Australian Research Council where again the level of their indifference to the importance of the research highlights the sinister nature of the attacks that this government has launched on the intellectual work of this nation. 


MPs in the current government have more than once picked out or named a project run by an eminent researcher and mocked them without any understanding or insight into the project, which of course is clearly unfortunate. I say their attacks on climate change science are a disgrace. These projects and the way research funding is allocated are chosen by panels of peers on the basis of expert merit. They have been successful in an environment in which less than 22 per cent of projects are able to be successful and we see, for instance, that that is a measure of the deep competition that exists within the university system. Yet certain members of this government behave as ignoramuses when it comes to the issue of research projects in this country. 


As recently as December, the member for Hughes ridiculed no fewer than 23 recent grant recipients in the humanities, arts and sciences—projects that are amongst the best of the best. If you think I am being too harsh, just think of the member in another place in 2011 who provided us with the revelation that champagne contained carbon dioxide so we should stop global warming by 'drinking chardonnay instead of champagne'. Perhaps this is a measure of the intellectual depth of this government, but I am afraid it is all too serious to be funny. 


We have a government that has set upon a course of action of profound hostility to universities. They have used whatever imaginary budget emergency they can find to demonstrate their capacity for cruel and quite vicious cuts to the university system. Their walking away from the Gonski program highlights that they do not have any long-term commitment to education in this country, and the failure of this government to acknowledge their responsibilities to our society and our future speaks volumes. 


The original money was set aside under these changes when we were in government for the better skills program, the Gonski reforms, but the coalition has gutted Gonski. It is no longer a six-year commitment; it is four years. The fundamental point about the Gonski reforms is the bulk of the money was in years 5 and 6, the very years that this government has walked away from, despite what was said during the election campaign that there would be no cuts to education and that we could have exactly the same approach to schools funding between Liberal and Labor—it did not make any difference. In government we see this government repudiating what it actually said in opposition, and now of course we see that this is a government that clearly is in the business of saying one thing in opposition and another thing in government. Therefore I submit to the Senate that these measures should be disallowed and the government should not be able to proceed with these cuts to the university system.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2014-07-14,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (17:28):  Amongst all the bluster and all the noise we have just heard from Senator Carr, there is one fact that we did not hear: that these are Labor's own measures. On three occasions in three documents last year, the Labor Party proposed these very changes. All the fiction, the confected reasons and outrage by Senator Carr cannot hide this fact. 


These cuts were announced by Labor in April 2013. They were confirmed by Labor in the last budget they presented in May 2013 and they remained in Labor's documents in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook that was taken to the election campaign. Despite all of Senator Carr's mock outrage, these are the proposals that Labor took. 


All we are trying to do is to bring the budget back to a sustainable position and, in this case, the Labor Party is stopping us from implementing their own measures. The problem we have is that, as Senator Carr has said in this place on a number of occasions, it wasn't when he was minister. To be fair, that is because we all lost track of the concertina business cards and the constant replacement of departmental letterheads, because the previous government was so chaotic. In my old portfolio they went through half-a-dozen small business ministers in four years, and I lost track of how many in higher education, science, research and school education. 


The other words we do not hear from the Labor Party when they talk about alleged savings being directed in certain ways to future years—not in the budget estimates for school funding, even though these cuts were in the budget estimates—is a commitment that they will put the money back. This is all empty rhetoric from the Labor Party. It is all empty rhetoric now they are in opposition. It is all empty rhetoric from Senator Carr who is disregarded by his own colleagues whenever they sit on this side of the chamber. Whether it is about the car industry, the Green Car Innovation Fund being stripped, the uncertainty that even the then Managing Director of Holden Mike Devereux referred to under the previous Labor government or whether it is these changes, all we hear from Senator Carr is mock outrage when he is not in a position to actually change the circumstances.


In the confected outrage of his 20-minute address, I heard Senator Carr refer to the great expansion of university access. The truth is the greatest expansion of university access this country came when Robert Menzies expanded the university system. the single greatest expansion of universities from an elite group in our society was through Commonwealth scholarships and a dramatic increase in the number of universities. This side stands proudly by its record in higher education. The problem with Senator Carr is that he mistakes the NTEU position for something in favour of universities. He talks about how important universities are. He talks about how they can be important to creative thought and innovative thought. He talks about their importance as public institutions, being places to nurture our best and our brightest, giving an opportunity for all. Yet the one thing Senator Carr and the Labor Party will not do is set the universities free, because they still must be run, in that famous phrase, by 'Moscow on the Molonglo'. They still must be regulated in a way that no other sector of this economy is. They must all have bureaucrats overseeing each and everything they do, because they cannot be trusted. Senator Carr's position is entirely and utterly incoherent and inconsistent. I turn to a number of other points he raised.




Senator Birmingham:
  He is inconsistent.




Senator RYAN:
  Senator Birmingham, thank you very much. I have lost my train of thought. Senator Carr also referred to the allegation that somehow saving money over the four years of the forward estimates of the budget was going to magically fund Labor's mythical Gonski reforms that were never accounted for. If that was the case, Labor would not have stripped out $1.2 billion from the first four years of those reforms in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. According to the previous Labor government, the students of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory did not deserve to be funded on the same basis as other students. That was gutted by the Labor Party before the election. This government then had to find $1.2 billion to put back into schools education. That move alone demonstrates the hypocrisy and emptiness of what Senator Carr refers to and the fiction that Labor has tried to create that somehow these measures were going to be directed towards schools funding—they were not. 


Senator Carr says that we have a myopic view—I do not know that was the word he used—that this is about spending, not about investment. That betrays Senator Carr's factional home in the socialist left, because it is all spending. It must all be accounted for. There is no magical investment budget paper that says somehow we do not have to borrow that money or raise it through taxation. There are three ways to spend money. You get it from somewhere else within government, you increase taxes or you increase borrowings. Increasing borrowings is just deferring an increase in taxation. But Senator Carr tries to create this mythical separation between spending and investment, as if by somehow rebadging it with an NTEU bumper sticker it does not actually have to come out of the taxpayers' coffers—it all does. 


Given Senator Carr brought it up, I cannot resist mentioning the issue of student unionism. Senator Carr referred to how proud he was that the Labor Party and their Green allies had brought back in compulsory student unionism through the student services and amenities fee. I imagine that now in this ski season, and it is a good one I understand, Senator Carr is proud of those students working part-time jobs so that those select few can get into Melbourne University's and Monash University's subsidised ski lodge at Mt Buller. Of course, the great majority of students cannot get anywhere near it. You will not see those students who are actually working their way through university, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, in the Range Rovers up at Mt Buller this time of year. I am sure Senator Carr is proud of the fact that those students working part-time jobs, pushing trolleys around supermarkets or waiting tables in Carlton's Lygon Street or some other cafe near a university are subsidising the clubs' and societies' activities, the entertainment or indeed the legal services he referred to of the protestors who usually get themselves in trouble on the steps of the Victorian parliament. 


Mr Deputy President, I think I was involved in an inquiry with you on this matter once quite a long time ago. That issue itself portrays Senator Carr's lack of concern about equity. Consider the idea that there is this poll tax, explicitly unrelated to anything to do with your university education, that you pay regardless of your means that is used to subsidise the activities of those who do have leisure time at the expense of those who might have to work. It is used to build Taj Mahals like ski lodges and subsidise those on the basis that the great majority of students can never access them. I find this a profound challenge to any vision of equity in the university education system.


This measure is made necessary by the fiscal mess the previous government left us in. Senator Carr referred to a concocted or invented fiscal budget emergency. That betrays Senator Carr's true perspective that there is no problem with government debt. The Greens and other groups run around supporting the Labor Party, saying there is no problem with public debt. They compare Australia to other OECD nations, but they do not compare actual government debt in Australia. They take a very narrow measure of government bonds on issue. They do not take into account unfunded superannuation liabilities that are not yet accounted for by the entirety of the Future Fund. They do not take into account debt that is held at state government and local government levels. The taxpayer is on the hook for all of that. Over the period of the previous coalition government, the strong fiscal position of the Commonwealth is what made sure Australia's economy was resilient from the external shocks of the Asian financial crisis. It actually provided the capital that Senator Carr claimed credit for spending. The previous coalition government had money in the bank through the Future Fund, the Higher Education Endowment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. Indeed, having a positive balance sheet allowed the Labor government to undertake the most wasteful stimulus program in Australian history. 


Senator Carr cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim credit for spending the money that the previous government saved and then say it is not necessary to save money again. The fiscal situation inherited by this government is on a trajectory that is utterly unsustainable. As a country, we have a choice: we can make decisions now, when we are in a position to make them manageable; or we can push them off, as other countries have done, and then they will get much more difficult and much more intergenerationally unfair. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party in proposing this motion is betrayed by that and also by the fact that this was their measure. I will conclude on this point: this measure was announced by the Labor Party in April 2013, it was in the Labor Party's last budget in May 2013 and it was in the Labor Party's paperwork—the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—before the last election. All this government is trying to do is put in place a saving that the Labor Party themselves took to the Australian people, to actually save the money that the Labor Party announced they were going to save. They refused to do that, and the hypocrisy is on display for all to see.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-07-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:38):  It is fascinating to listen to how Senator Ryan and Senator Carr see higher education. Senator Carr gave Senator Ryan something pretty easy to come in on. Senator Ryan documented Labor's position in April and May 2013. Unfortunately Labor ditched that position when they went into opposition, which was certainly very shameful. Let's look at what Senator Ryan had to say. Senator Ryan did what so many Liberals do these days; he used Prime Minister Menzies as cover when he said, 'Yes, we care about universities, we care about people.'


Let's look at what Prime Minister Menzies did, which was far different from what the coalition is doing now. It is true that, in the 1950s, Prime Minister Menzies did start to take an interest in universities. He recommended that universities needed assistance and that it needed to be a federal issue and something that the then Liberal government should give attention to. That is certainly very much out of step with what we are seeing from this coalition government. The Liberal government back in the 1950s did commit to recurrent grant funding to our universities. And then there were the Commonwealth funds which were made available for capital expenditure. But the coalition policy now is to slash funding to our universities and push the burden onto students. The coalition is handing out free public money to private sector companies which can now make profits out of higher education. This is quite different from the standards that former Prime Minister Menzies brought to this sector.


It is also a reminder of the whole issue of Commonwealth scholarships and how dishonest this government is. One piece of spin that we regularly hear from the Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne, when he is trying to justify this very cruel approach, is that these new Commonwealth scholarships will benefit disadvantaged students. The Commonwealth scholarships we have now are nothing like those we had under the Menzies government. 'Commonwealth scholarships' is just a name. There is no federal government money going into them. The whole arrangement is worked out within universities, which is adding to the pressure that they are under and the difficulties that they face. It is very dishonest to use the term 'Commonwealth scholarships'. For older generations the term has a good ring to it. It comes from the Liberal era of the 1960s and the Whitlam era before they went to free higher education. The term 'Commonwealth scholarship' has a good ring to it. It comes from an era when public money was used to assist students who might have difficulty in being able to go to university to study. 


Again, we have total dishonesty from Senator Ryan—not surprising, because that is what he is getting from his minister—in terms of how the system works. It was interesting to listen to the banter that was going on. Senator Carr was correct in saying that what we saw from the coalition in opposition was quite different from what we are seeing from the coalition in government. Sadly, that is also something we see from Labor; they are a very different beast when in opposition. The challenge for community groups, unions and the Greens is to keep that pressure on so that they honour the decent policies that we hear more often from them when they are in opposition.


It is worth reminding ourselves just how differently the coalition have conducted themselves within the last year. This time last year we were all out campaigning. And what were we hearing from the then Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and Christopher Pyne? They were out spruiking that there would be no changes at all to higher education funding arrangements. That is what we heard from them, time and time again, prior to the election. But look what has happened now. We have seen the very ugly budget that they have brought down. We have seen the extreme measures in so many aspects of higher education funding—one of which we are dealing with right now in terms of the disallowance motion. In June this year, on the ABC's Insiders program, we heard Minister Pyne defending the cuts as 'fair and sustainable'. He pulls words out of the air which have no realism in terms of what is actually happening.


Minister Pyne actually said:


I think that the contribution that students make can be rebalanced …


At the moment the taxpayers are funding 60 per cent of the tuition fees of university students, and universities' students are making up 40 per cent. Under our changes, it will be 50-50.


What we know, though, is if you look at the trajectory of where the coalition's higher education policies are going, you will see that there will be an even greater burden on students.


With regard to the regulation that brings us to this debate, the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013, we do support the disallowance motion. We are very pleased that Senator Carr has brought it on. It seeks to cut over $435 million from the higher education and other grants program over four years. It is another example of where the coalition really are waging war on the funding of the higher education sector, pushing the costs more and more onto students, slashing money out of the universities themselves. 


An issue that has had little attention but which is certainly part of the package is the coalition government opening up, for the first time, the ability of private companies, for-profit companies, to access public funding that once went to our universities. Now they can make money out of it. This is deeply troubling. Many institutions that run them often have little experience of the higher education sector. Again, what do we hear from Senator Ryan about a deregulated system? He was bashing the opposition about the fact that they want some regulations. Surely, we need to have some regulations and some standards in how our system is run. Again, going back to the cover that he tried to pick up for himself and his party, in talking about the Menzies' era, there were regulations then. There were standards. When former Prime Minister Menzies started paying attention to universities, one of the things he did was to look for some consistency across the nation. As well as the funding issues, consistency in standards was a big part of it. But what do we get from this government? Deregulation, throwing money at private companies. With regard to the standards within our higher education sector what we will see and where it will lead to is deeply troubling.


Government regulation is cutting support to universities, particularly for the promotion of equality of opportunity and the support of diversity and open access to higher education. This is another aspect of the debate that concerns the Greens considerably. Under the coalition, we are seeing a push to create a higher education system where you would have to be pretty well off to shoulder the burden of the HELP debts imposed by this government. The government's regulation that we are debating here would cut funding for the support of research and training of research students for grants to foster collaboration. This comes at a time when research and innovation has never been more important. I believe it is very important for the development of individuals in terms of what they can offer Australia and, indeed, what Australia's economy can offer the world. More and more, we are becoming a global village and within that we need to share our innovation and knowledge that we develop through our research. But when you end up with a deregulated system, that is barely possible to achieve. 


The regulation that we are dealing with will cut funding for grants to support the development of systemic infrastructure and capital development projects at universities. I particularly know from my work in this sector how important that is, particularly in regional universities. It shocks me when I visit a number of universities to see how run down they are. Under what this government is bringing forward, regional universities are going to do it really tough. They are already finding it difficult and, if the budget measures go through—and there are certainly mounting efforts to ensure that does not happen—it will be an enormous setback.


At a time of debilitating funding cuts to our universities, it would further slash support to promote the productivity of higher education providers and grants for activities that would assure and enhance the quality of our higher education sector. These are some of the issues that we see as very important and that explain why we support this disallowance motion. 


I think it is also relevant that we are having this debate on a day when there has been another round of polling that shows how unpopular the government's higher education policies are that it wants to adopt. Extensive automative phone polling, undertaken by the National Tertiary Education Union—this was across 23 federal electorates and all states—found cuts in federal funding and changes to allow increased fees, higher loan charges and access to limited federal funding by non-university course providers are very unpopular.


The government would be wise to take that message on board. They would be wise in terms of the wellbeing of the nation and students who are looking to develop their career at our universities. And now we know that they would be wise in terms of the wellbeing of their own party, their own government and some of their own MPs, including the minister, because 69 per cent of those polled said that they oppose significant increases in fees and 65 per cent said that they oppose 20 per cent funding cuts to our universities. Just 28 per cent of voters said that they approved of deregulating the higher education sector to allow privately-owned institutions to have access to Commonwealth subsidies. 


This is a strong negative backlash from voters. The public are deeply troubled by the higher education moves of the government. The government, with this very cruel, brutal budget that they brought down in May, are certainly loading the burden in terms of how they are going to raise money and save money onto the backs of the disadvantaged—students, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick and Indigenous peopl 


They are all the people who are really copping it, who really will be hard hit by the budget measures. 


What we are seeing with higher education is pushing the reach of the damaging, destructive aspects of the budget out to the middle class of Australia. So often, when I am out doing my meetings on the weekend and meeting people socially, I meet people who are really worried about how their own children are going to gain an education. Just today I was told an example of a university lecturer who said, 'I suddenly thought: how are my children going to get the education that I have received?' I was at a barbecue recently—the dad is a lawyer and the mum runs a small business. Their kids were running around; they are quite young. These parents were saying the same thing: 'We look at our children and we wonder: how are they going to get the education that we were fortunate to achieve?' This is starting to trouble people—people from regional areas and working-class people who have not had the opportunity to go to university but, like so many working-class families, hope that their children will be able to. And now we are seeing middle-class families really troubled about what this government is doing to this country. And we know how important education is.


These are very, very important reasons that we need to ensure this disallowance goes through and look to the next stage to ensure that the other very damaging aspects of the coalition's policy do not become law, do not become regulations, in this country. We know there is a sneaky way this government is working—choosing regulations more and more to try and get through its agenda. So I suspect that we will be having more debates along these lines—very important debates—because this goes far beyond education; it goes to the very nature of the type of Australia that we are setting out laws for and setting out a healthy future for.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:54):  I would like to sum up this debate on the motion to disallow the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013. I thank Senator Rhiannon for her indication of support by the Greens. Far be it from me to criticise those that are voting for the proposition we have before us. I do enjoy listening to the Greens provide us with advice on being pure and more proper and more principled than any other political organisation in the country. I suppose that comes from having a party position that allows you to have the very best social conscience that money could buy, as we see within the Greens, who are only too happy to criticise Labor for our actions but do not ever acknowledge the simple facts of life here—that, under a Labor government, support for higher education doubled. When I was minister, the amount of support for science and research increased by 43 per cent, the biggest level of increase for science and research in this country's history. I say to you: 190,000 extra students is a record that any government could be proud of. 


Well may you criticise the decisions that were taken in the budget of last May, Senator Rhiannon—you are entitled to put that view—but I think you misrepresented me. I indicated at the very beginning of my contribution that Labor had changed its position. We put aside money, hypothecated money, last year to support the Gonski changes, to provide support for a six-year funding program for the schools system. We kept the budget savings within the education system. We said that, if you want to sustain a higher education system longer term, you have a look at the fundamental problems within the school system. I might also add that we provided additional support in the vocational system—more students in vocational education facilities across this country than ever we have seen in this nation's history. We never get any acknowledgement for that. I also say this—and I made this point in my remarks—that, when the government came in, they abandoned the position that they took to the election about supporting Gonski. They abandoned it and, as a consequence, the original funding that was earmarked for the Better Schools Plan was taken and put into consolidated revenue by this government.


So, Senator Ryan, I return to you, by drawing your attention to the fact that I also said that these are now decisions of this government, initiatives of this government, determinations by a Liberal Party minister. They have become your initiatives. I made that very, very clear. You have made the decision to cut university funding because of your bent ideological presumptions about what universities are about. We heard it from you again today. It was all about subsidising ski clubs. It may well be that your friends spend a lot of time in their Range Rovers at Mount Buller, but I say to you: I do not have that many friends that spend time there. Maybe they are just supporters of Melbourne Football Club; I do not know. But I just make this observation: you have a very distorted view about what actually goes on in universities. Liberal ministers, Liberal members of parliament, have demonstrated an extraordinary ignorance of the importance of universities, and they have a particularly perverse view about the role of education. They say money does not matter, yet they also say it is only reasonable that parents pay up to $30,000 a year to send their children to the most elite private schools in this country. So clearly money does matter to somebody. At Geelong Grammar, tell them money does not matter! Tell the parents that have to pay those fees that money does not matter! To suggest now that money does not really matter to the quality of education, I think, is to misunderstand how it really works.


The proposition we have before the chamber draws attention to the government's failure to fund the school system and the university system and the government's failed policy position when it comes to the question of the importance of education. The government do this under the pretext of a budget emergency, when in fact what they are doing is living out their ideological fantasies. We have had the Nobel prize-winning economist Mr Stiglitz tell us that, by international standards, this is a country to be proud of, that our budget performance is something to be envied, that there is no excuse for the cuts to higher education in this country and that they are wrong—and I think the word 'criminal' was used. That suggests to me just what a difference in mindset exists.


We have a government here that seems to want to mortgage the future. We have a government here that is not interested in ensuring the future. It wants to mortgage the future by suggesting that those with resources—those who are wealthy; those who are privileged—can enjoy and reinforce their privilege by ensuring that these educational institutions, which we all know unlock the door of inequality in Australia, are shut to the working people of this country. That is what this government's policy will mean. You withdraw the public resources and it is the private resources that take their place, so the people with money enjoy the benefits and the privileges of higher education.


We understand that there is a balance. We acknowledge the private benefit, but we also say that the overriding question is the public benefit of investment in education. That is why we say that the balance is about right at 60:40. Under the previous Liberal government, the balance shifted. The Howard government, despite the promises they made when in opposition, increased the level of private contribution by 100 per cent. That is where we get the 40 per cent from. When the HECs arrangements were first introduced they were about 20 per cent.


What we have seen over every successive Liberal government is a continuation of a policy theme of hostility to higher education, the culture of university and the importance of innovation, and a view that those with money should enjoy the benefits of having money and reinstate the privilege that they get from having that money. As a consequence, we are now seeing the Liberal policy under Howard being continued under Abbott. This policy will impose on the poorer people in this country, working people, particularly people in rural and regional areas a profound disadvantage—not freedom; an imposition of government to make the economic inequalities in this country greater. We know what a struggle it is to even up the score in our society. The Liberal's policy is to make that score even more uneven—to reinforce privilege and to reinforce inequality.


These measures that we are seeing today are not about spending money on education. I want to make senators very clear about this. This is about taking money out of education and putting it into consolidated revenue. That is the point of these changes the government has introduced. These are Liberal changes initiated by a Liberal government by a Liberal minister and—as we heard today in the defence from Senator Ryan—are all about Liberal philosophy. For those reasons, I call upon the Senate to reject these proposals and to support the disallowance motion.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013 be disallowed.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:08):  I move:


That the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013, made under sections 41-45(1A) and (1B) of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, be disallowed.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Perhaps I should explain this disallowance motion so that the Senate may find it easier to follow.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We would be most appreciative if you did, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  This regulation was made under sections 41-45(1A) and (1B) of the Higher Education Support Act 2003. This determination is part of a measure that would cut $2.3 billion from the higher education sector. It precedes the $5.8 billion in cuts to universities and student support which were announced in the budget. It precedes the government's damaging and alarming ideological agenda to change the very structural basis of the higher education system in this country and this government, in all its manifest hubris, likes to pretend that this is anything other than a Liberal-National policy determination. It is a determination of a Liberal minister. 


This Liberal-National party cut is brought about by the Minister for Education, Mr Pyne, who, we all appreciate, is now facing considerable difficulty in this portfolio. This minister has had three separate positions on Gonski. The minister said before the election that there would be no changes to university funding and, indeed, he repeated this promise prior to the budget. We all know what happened in that regard. The minister said before the election he would not raise HECS but now wants to raise HECS to such a level that $100,000 degrees could well become the norm. This is a determination by a minister who, like his Prime Minister, has one modus operandi when it comes to the operation of government policy—that is, the big lie. In no sector of the operation of the Commonwealth has this technique been demonstrated more clearly than in education. This is not surprising because the coalition has long been an enemy of education. The audacity of the minister to introduce these cuts on one hand while pretending the government has nothing to do with them on the other is, by all standards, truly shocking. It shows a contempt for the public, a contempt for the higher education sector. 


Labor does not support the cuts to university funding that this determination would enact and we do not support the further cuts to higher education planned by the coalition. Additional cuts are clearly on the way. Make no mistake: whatever the fate of this as yet unseen legislation, which we are now told may well be ready by October, there is no question about what the government intends to do—that is, to cut higher education still further. The government does not properly understand the value or the role of universities in a knowledge economy because it has a very narrow view about putting money into education.


 It is not, in their minds, an investment; rather it is a cost because they say there has to be some short-term return that can be measured purely in dollars and cents. Therefore, taking money out of education, according to this line of logic, makes economic sense. Universities, it is argued, produce and disseminate knowledge, they help us solve problems, they make new products and processes, they protect our environment and they help us understand ourselves. In doing all of these things, nations grow in stature, economically, culturally and even politically. Universities should not be treated just as mere degree factories because they enrich our lives. That is what we mean by the public benefit associated with investment in education.


Many of those opposite had the very great fortune to benefit from a free education system. Many of them benefited from engaging in university politics, in sports and in clubs. Some would say they benefited so much that they never actually got out of student politics, that they have never been able to step outside their experience of university politics where they faced considerable hostility and that they want to feed that back through the political system to the end of their days. For some reason, there remains a contempt within the Liberal Party about the university system, a contempt which, in itself, beggars belief. This is reflected in every policy they have brought to bear on the sector. It is astounding that they would point to the Howard government's record on this. 


Labor is very familiar with this record. We had to clean it up when were in government. When the coalition formed government in 1996, one of their very first acts was to plunder the higher education sector, without a word of warning. They delivered a massive five per cent budget cut to the higher education sector and none of that was announced before the election of the Howard government. Student fees skyrocketed, Commonwealth supported places slumped and billions of dollars were stripped out of the system in the decade of neglect which followed. They claimed that total government spending for universities increased by 13 per cent in real terms during their time in government. Even if that were true, it would still be a pretty ordinary record. To claim this kind of paltry figure shows the complete lack of understanding on the part of those opposite of the growing role of universities in our society.


Some figures are even more telling. From 1995 through to 2005, direct public payments to tertiary institutions showed no real growth—none whatsoever. It gets worse. Over the same period, total funding per capita of our universities fell by nine per cent. Funding fell due to two things: there were cuts and there was neglect. If we take indexation, the party of self-proclaimed market economists—with the exception of the agrarian socialists that act as their allies—left universities with a system of indexation which was totally and completely inadequate to meet the needs of contemporary Australia. It was a system of indexation so out of touch with the realities of running a modern university that, when Labor adjusted the formula to reflect real cost, it added billions of dollars over the forward estimates—money the coalition had been withholding from universities. With so many economic geniuses in their ranks, one can only assume that it was done deliberately because of hostility! Well, it surely couldn't be just a question of ineptitude! But others would suggest I am wrong on that.


They did not stop there. Not content with draining the budget, they also went after the culture of universities. Sporting clubs, legal services, child care, social events—they all had to go. Of course, that was all tied up with their approach to voluntary student unionism.




Senator Ryan:
  Hear, hear!




Senator KIM CARR:
  This decimated student services. I hear 'Hear, hear' from over there. You see—the policy has not lost its flavour for those on that side of the chamber. Only when Labor undid that wrong and brought in the student support and amenities fee did we begin to see essential services return to strength on campuses.


The coalition's meddling on campuses did not just affect student-run services. The long arm of this sort of neo-right ideology reached back into the staffrooms and the administration blocks, forcing universities to implement aspects of the coalition's industrial relations agenda or risk losing funding. Those were the higher education workplace relations requirements under the legislation at the time, and of course they very much became part of Work Choices. The party that claimed to hate regulation created a special branch of it just to tell universities what conditions they could and could not offer their staff.


Those opposite talk about their legacy in higher education—well, let me say to this chamber: it is a legacy that has not been forgotten. The legacy of the Howard era in higher education left the university system in crisis. It was a decade of neglect and much, much worse.


These actions of over a decade ago sound a warning, because it is the same coalition, with many of the same faces, using the same cabinet submissions to operate on the current policy position—as we see, for instance, with the cabinet submission which was leaked in 1999 which outlines chapter and verse what this government is doing today.


It was two months into their term when the government identified $1.43 billion in cuts to the education portfolio. This was on top of more than $3.7 billion in cuts in their first 100 days of government. Mr Abbott once claimed that universities would experience a period of 'masterly inactivity' under his government. Of course, that was wrong—there has been a great deal of activity. Either the Prime Minister was unaware of secret plans to gut higher education or that was, knowingly, totally untrue. So they started with the $3.7 billion worth of cuts and they continued this with an announced $5.8 billion. We saw it in the past under the Howard government and now it is flowing through to this current government.


Labor set about reducing the damage to the universities and, almost as soon as we formed government, we initiated the most significant review of higher education to date—the Bradley review. We also had the Cutler review, and initiated changes to the research program to ensure that we were able to meet the real costs of research. Under the Labor government, Commonwealth funding for universities rose from $8 billion to $14 billion between 2007 and 2013. And, if we were still in office, that amount, under Labor's forward estimates, would grow to $17 billion by 2017. We increased real funding per student by nearly $2,000 in real terms to $18,000 per year. Labor improved indexation and replaced the hopeless, out-of-date system. We increased funding for the science, research and innovation budget by well over 30 per cent, compared to the previous government. We delivered more capital and infrastructure in four years than the coalition managed to do in the whole decade that they were in office. Labor delivered more than $5 billion in higher education and research infrastructure while we were in office. We began one of the largest reforms ever undertaken in the university system, moving towards the demand-driven system which led to the additional 190,000 extra students in universities compared to 2007. The government talks today about 80,000. Well, that record is well and truly surpassed by actual places in universities—and not at a reduced rate; not the sort of proposition that the government is talking about at the sub-degree level. Because of our initiatives today there are an additional 36,000 students from disadvantaged backgrounds actually at university, and we set the goal of increasing the proportion of the population with a degree to 40 per cent of 25- to 35-year-olds by 2020. For women, that goal has already been achieved. And for the whole community, we were within cooee of reaching that goal already—well before the 2020 date. We provided significant funding for those universities with substantial numbers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 


But this is a government that actually gets rid of equity targets. This is a government that cuts equity programming. We argue that that approach is wrong. We believe that our university system should be for everyone with ability, regardless of how much money their parents have. That is why we also sought to ensure that the university experience itself was a rewarding one and supported the student services and amenities fee.


We made it easier for young people to study through reforms to youth allowance, so that more than 220,000 young people received the maximum rate—a much higher rate of payment—for the first time. So much of what we did was to repair the damage of the coalition's previous government. The reckless damage and wilful neglect wreaked by the government that is now back in office shows us a measure of how the coalition actually operates in government. We are very proud of our record. We take the view that the Commonwealth of Australia should respect the role of universities and, to this end, we want universities to play a leading role in our nation's future. We believe the economic argument for investment in universities is very, very clear; universities directly contribute about $22 billion to our GDP every year; they employ over 100,000 people; university graduates contribute more than $170 billion per year in wages to our economy; and university graduates comprise about one-quarter of the population that generates almost one-third of Australia' wages. There are about nine Australian companies listed on the Fortune Global 500, but there are 19 universities in the world's top 500—that is Australia making its mark internationally.


Universities play a fundamental role in building Australia's future. They are essential to innovation. They produce the knowledge and the ideas. They help build the new technologies. They help build the new industries and they create the new jobs. They play an essential role in local economies. We just need to look at what is happening at Wollongong or in Newcastle—I might add Deakin University in Geelong and the central role that it plays in rural and regional Australia. 


Universities help us to interpret our world and to adapt to change. They help us grow in stature as a nation, and we do not want to see them decimated by a government that has no respect for the work that they do and therefore their importance in our future and the future of a knowledge based economy. 


Those opposite have a long history of attacking not just the university budgets and university culture; they, unfortunately, have a well-ingrained process of denigrating their work. They have an indifference to the importance of intellectual work in this society. Their failure to even, for instance, appoint a minister for science highlights the negligence of the government. Of course, we see this replicated in their cruel cuts to jobs at the CSIRO. They have sustained attacks on the independence of the Australian Research Council where again the level of their indifference to the importance of the research highlights the sinister nature of the attacks that this government has launched on the intellectual work of this nation. 


MPs in the current government have more than once picked out or named a project run by an eminent researcher and mocked them without any understanding or insight into the project, which of course is clearly unfortunate. I say their attacks on climate change science are a disgrace. These projects and the way research funding is allocated are chosen by panels of peers on the basis of expert merit. They have been successful in an environment in which less than 22 per cent of projects are able to be successful and we see, for instance, that that is a measure of the deep competition that exists within the university system. Yet certain members of this government behave as ignoramuses when it comes to the issue of research projects in this country. 


As recently as December, the member for Hughes ridiculed no fewer than 23 recent grant recipients in the humanities, arts and sciences—projects that are amongst the best of the best. If you think I am being too harsh, just think of the member in another place in 2011 who provided us with the revelation that champagne contained carbon dioxide so we should stop global warming by 'drinking chardonnay instead of champagne'. Perhaps this is a measure of the intellectual depth of this government, but I am afraid it is all too serious to be funny. 


We have a government that has set upon a course of action of profound hostility to universities. They have used whatever imaginary budget emergency they can find to demonstrate their capacity for cruel and quite vicious cuts to the university system. Their walking away from the Gonski program highlights that they do not have any long-term commitment to education in this country, and the failure of this government to acknowledge their responsibilities to our society and our future speaks volumes. 


The original money was set aside under these changes when we were in government for the better skills program, the Gonski reforms, but the coalition has gutted Gonski. It is no longer a six-year commitment; it is four years. The fundamental point about the Gonski reforms is the bulk of the money was in years 5 and 6, the very years that this government has walked away from, despite what was said during the election campaign that there would be no cuts to education and that we could have exactly the same approach to schools funding between Liberal and Labor—it did not make any difference. In government we see this government repudiating what it actually said in opposition, and now of course we see that this is a government that clearly is in the business of saying one thing in opposition and another thing in government. Therefore I submit to the Senate that these measures should be disallowed and the government should not be able to proceed with these cuts to the university system.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (17:28):  Amongst all the bluster and all the noise we have just heard from Senator Carr, there is one fact that we did not hear: that these are Labor's own measures. On three occasions in three documents last year, the Labor Party proposed these very changes. All the fiction, the confected reasons and outrage by Senator Carr cannot hide this fact. 


These cuts were announced by Labor in April 2013. They were confirmed by Labor in the last budget they presented in May 2013 and they remained in Labor's documents in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook that was taken to the election campaign. Despite all of Senator Carr's mock outrage, these are the proposals that Labor took. 


All we are trying to do is to bring the budget back to a sustainable position and, in this case, the Labor Party is stopping us from implementing their own measures. The problem we have is that, as Senator Carr has said in this place on a number of occasions, it wasn't when he was minister. To be fair, that is because we all lost track of the concertina business cards and the constant replacement of departmental letterheads, because the previous government was so chaotic. In my old portfolio they went through half-a-dozen small business ministers in four years, and I lost track of how many in higher education, science, research and school education. 


The other words we do not hear from the Labor Party when they talk about alleged savings being directed in certain ways to future years—not in the budget estimates for school funding, even though these cuts were in the budget estimates—is a commitment that they will put the money back. This is all empty rhetoric from the Labor Party. It is all empty rhetoric now they are in opposition. It is all empty rhetoric from Senator Carr who is disregarded by his own colleagues whenever they sit on this side of the chamber. Whether it is about the car industry, the Green Car Innovation Fund being stripped, the uncertainty that even the then Managing Director of Holden Mike Devereux referred to under the previous Labor government or whether it is these changes, all we hear from Senator Carr is mock outrage when he is not in a position to actually change the circumstances.


In the confected outrage of his 20-minute address, I heard Senator Carr refer to the great expansion of university access. The truth is the greatest expansion of university access this country came when Robert Menzies expanded the university system. the single greatest expansion of universities from an elite group in our society was through Commonwealth scholarships and a dramatic increase in the number of universities. This side stands proudly by its record in higher education. The problem with Senator Carr is that he mistakes the NTEU position for something in favour of universities. He talks about how important universities are. He talks about how they can be important to creative thought and innovative thought. He talks about their importance as public institutions, being places to nurture our best and our brightest, giving an opportunity for all. Yet the one thing Senator Carr and the Labor Party will not do is set the universities free, because they still must be run, in that famous phrase, by 'Moscow on the Molonglo'. They still must be regulated in a way that no other sector of this economy is. They must all have bureaucrats overseeing each and everything they do, because they cannot be trusted. Senator Carr's position is entirely and utterly incoherent and inconsistent. I turn to a number of other points he raised.




Senator Birmingham:
  He is inconsistent.




Senator RYAN:
  Senator Birmingham, thank you very much. I have lost my train of thought. Senator Carr also referred to the allegation that somehow saving money over the four years of the forward estimates of the budget was going to magically fund Labor's mythical Gonski reforms that were never accounted for. If that was the case, Labor would not have stripped out $1.2 billion from the first four years of those reforms in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. According to the previous Labor government, the students of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory did not deserve to be funded on the same basis as other students. That was gutted by the Labor Party before the election. This government then had to find $1.2 billion to put back into schools education. That move alone demonstrates the hypocrisy and emptiness of what Senator Carr refers to and the fiction that Labor has tried to create that somehow these measures were going to be directed towards schools funding—they were not. 


Senator Carr says that we have a myopic view—I do not know that was the word he used—that this is about spending, not about investment. That betrays Senator Carr's factional home in the socialist left, because it is all spending. It must all be accounted for. There is no magical investment budget paper that says somehow we do not have to borrow that money or raise it through taxation. There are three ways to spend money. You get it from somewhere else within government, you increase taxes or you increase borrowings. Increasing borrowings is just deferring an increase in taxation. But Senator Carr tries to create this mythical separation between spending and investment, as if by somehow rebadging it with an NTEU bumper sticker it does not actually have to come out of the taxpayers' coffers—it all does. 


Given Senator Carr brought it up, I cannot resist mentioning the issue of student unionism. Senator Carr referred to how proud he was that the Labor Party and their Green allies had brought back in compulsory student unionism through the student services and amenities fee. I imagine that now in this ski season, and it is a good one I understand, Senator Carr is proud of those students working part-time jobs so that those select few can get into Melbourne University's and Monash University's subsidised ski lodge at Mt Buller. Of course, the great majority of students cannot get anywhere near it. You will not see those students who are actually working their way through university, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, in the Range Rovers up at Mt Buller this time of year. I am sure Senator Carr is proud of the fact that those students working part-time jobs, pushing trolleys around supermarkets or waiting tables in Carlton's Lygon Street or some other cafe near a university are subsidising the clubs' and societies' activities, the entertainment or indeed the legal services he referred to of the protestors who usually get themselves in trouble on the steps of the Victorian parliament. 


Mr Deputy President, I think I was involved in an inquiry with you on this matter once quite a long time ago. That issue itself portrays Senator Carr's lack of concern about equity. Consider the idea that there is this poll tax, explicitly unrelated to anything to do with your university education, that you pay regardless of your means that is used to subsidise the activities of those who do have leisure time at the expense of those who might have to work. It is used to build Taj Mahals like ski lodges and subsidise those on the basis that the great majority of students can never access them. I find this a profound challenge to any vision of equity in the university education system.


This measure is made necessary by the fiscal mess the previous government left us in. Senator Carr referred to a concocted or invented fiscal budget emergency. That betrays Senator Carr's true perspective that there is no problem with government debt. The Greens and other groups run around supporting the Labor Party, saying there is no problem with public debt. They compare Australia to other OECD nations, but they do not compare actual government debt in Australia. They take a very narrow measure of government bonds on issue. They do not take into account unfunded superannuation liabilities that are not yet accounted for by the entirety of the Future Fund. They do not take into account debt that is held at state government and local government levels. The taxpayer is on the hook for all of that. Over the period of the previous coalition government, the strong fiscal position of the Commonwealth is what made sure Australia's economy was resilient from the external shocks of the Asian financial crisis. It actually provided the capital that Senator Carr claimed credit for spending. The previous coalition government had money in the bank through the Future Fund, the Higher Education Endowment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. Indeed, having a positive balance sheet allowed the Labor government to undertake the most wasteful stimulus program in Australian history. 


Senator Carr cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim credit for spending the money that the previous government saved and then say it is not necessary to save money again. The fiscal situation inherited by this government is on a trajectory that is utterly unsustainable. As a country, we have a choice: we can make decisions now, when we are in a position to make them manageable; or we can push them off, as other countries have done, and then they will get much more difficult and much more intergenerationally unfair. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party in proposing this motion is betrayed by that and also by the fact that this was their measure. I will conclude on this point: this measure was announced by the Labor Party in April 2013, it was in the Labor Party's last budget in May 2013 and it was in the Labor Party's paperwork—the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—before the last election. All this government is trying to do is put in place a saving that the Labor Party themselves took to the Australian people, to actually save the money that the Labor Party announced they were going to save. They refused to do that, and the hypocrisy is on display for all to see.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-07-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:38):  It is fascinating to listen to how Senator Ryan and Senator Carr see higher education. Senator Carr gave Senator Ryan something pretty easy to come in on. Senator Ryan documented Labor's position in April and May 2013. Unfortunately Labor ditched that position when they went into opposition, which was certainly very shameful. Let's look at what Senator Ryan had to say. Senator Ryan did what so many Liberals do these days; he used Prime Minister Menzies as cover when he said, 'Yes, we care about universities, we care about people.'


Let's look at what Prime Minister Menzies did, which was far different from what the coalition is doing now. It is true that, in the 1950s, Prime Minister Menzies did start to take an interest in universities. He recommended that universities needed assistance and that it needed to be a federal issue and something that the then Liberal government should give attention to. That is certainly very much out of step with what we are seeing from this coalition government. The Liberal government back in the 1950s did commit to recurrent grant funding to our universities. And then there were the Commonwealth funds which were made available for capital expenditure. But the coalition policy now is to slash funding to our universities and push the burden onto students. The coalition is handing out free public money to private sector companies which can now make profits out of higher education. This is quite different from the standards that former Prime Minister Menzies brought to this sector.


It is also a reminder of the whole issue of Commonwealth scholarships and how dishonest this government is. One piece of spin that we regularly hear from the Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne, when he is trying to justify this very cruel approach, is that these new Commonwealth scholarships will benefit disadvantaged students. The Commonwealth scholarships we have now are nothing like those we had under the Menzies government. 'Commonwealth scholarships' is just a name. There is no federal government money going into them. The whole arrangement is worked out within universities, which is adding to the pressure that they are under and the difficulties that they face. It is very dishonest to use the term 'Commonwealth scholarships'. For older generations the term has a good ring to it. It comes from the Liberal era of the 1960s and the Whitlam era before they went to free higher education. The term 'Commonwealth scholarship' has a good ring to it. It comes from an era when public money was used to assist students who might have difficulty in being able to go to university to study. 


Again, we have total dishonesty from Senator Ryan—not surprising, because that is what he is getting from his minister—in terms of how the system works. It was interesting to listen to the banter that was going on. Senator Carr was correct in saying that what we saw from the coalition in opposition was quite different from what we are seeing from the coalition in government. Sadly, that is also something we see from Labor; they are a very different beast when in opposition. The challenge for community groups, unions and the Greens is to keep that pressure on so that they honour the decent policies that we hear more often from them when they are in opposition.


It is worth reminding ourselves just how differently the coalition have conducted themselves within the last year. This time last year we were all out campaigning. And what were we hearing from the then Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and Christopher Pyne? They were out spruiking that there would be no changes at all to higher education funding arrangements. That is what we heard from them, time and time again, prior to the election. But look what has happened now. We have seen the very ugly budget that they have brought down. We have seen the extreme measures in so many aspects of higher education funding—one of which we are dealing with right now in terms of the disallowance motion. In June this year, on the ABC's Insiders program, we heard Minister Pyne defending the cuts as 'fair and sustainable'. He pulls words out of the air which have no realism in terms of what is actually happening.


Minister Pyne actually said:


I think that the contribution that students make can be rebalanced …


At the moment the taxpayers are funding 60 per cent of the tuition fees of university students, and universities' students are making up 40 per cent. Under our changes, it will be 50-50.


What we know, though, is if you look at the trajectory of where the coalition's higher education policies are going, you will see that there will be an even greater burden on students.


With regard to the regulation that brings us to this debate, the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013, we do support the disallowance motion. We are very pleased that Senator Carr has brought it on. It seeks to cut over $435 million from the higher education and other grants program over four years. It is another example of where the coalition really are waging war on the funding of the higher education sector, pushing the costs more and more onto students, slashing money out of the universities themselves. 


An issue that has had little attention but which is certainly part of the package is the coalition government opening up, for the first time, the ability of private companies, for-profit companies, to access public funding that once went to our universities. Now they can make money out of it. This is deeply troubling. Many institutions that run them often have little experience of the higher education sector. Again, what do we hear from Senator Ryan about a deregulated system? He was bashing the opposition about the fact that they want some regulations. Surely, we need to have some regulations and some standards in how our system is run. Again, going back to the cover that he tried to pick up for himself and his party, in talking about the Menzies' era, there were regulations then. There were standards. When former Prime Minister Menzies started paying attention to universities, one of the things he did was to look for some consistency across the nation. As well as the funding issues, consistency in standards was a big part of it. But what do we get from this government? Deregulation, throwing money at private companies. With regard to the standards within our higher education sector what we will see and where it will lead to is deeply troubling.


Government regulation is cutting support to universities, particularly for the promotion of equality of opportunity and the support of diversity and open access to higher education. This is another aspect of the debate that concerns the Greens considerably. Under the coalition, we are seeing a push to create a higher education system where you would have to be pretty well off to shoulder the burden of the HELP debts imposed by this government. The government's regulation that we are debating here would cut funding for the support of research and training of research students for grants to foster collaboration. This comes at a time when research and innovation has never been more important. I believe it is very important for the development of individuals in terms of what they can offer Australia and, indeed, what Australia's economy can offer the world. More and more, we are becoming a global village and within that we need to share our innovation and knowledge that we develop through our research. But when you end up with a deregulated system, that is barely possible to achieve. 


The regulation that we are dealing with will cut funding for grants to support the development of systemic infrastructure and capital development projects at universities. I particularly know from my work in this sector how important that is, particularly in regional universities. It shocks me when I visit a number of universities to see how run down they are. Under what this government is bringing forward, regional universities are going to do it really tough. They are already finding it difficult and, if the budget measures go through—and there are certainly mounting efforts to ensure that does not happen—it will be an enormous setback.


At a time of debilitating funding cuts to our universities, it would further slash support to promote the productivity of higher education providers and grants for activities that would assure and enhance the quality of our higher education sector. These are some of the issues that we see as very important and that explain why we support this disallowance motion. 


I think it is also relevant that we are having this debate on a day when there has been another round of polling that shows how unpopular the government's higher education policies are that it wants to adopt. Extensive automative phone polling, undertaken by the National Tertiary Education Union—this was across 23 federal electorates and all states—found cuts in federal funding and changes to allow increased fees, higher loan charges and access to limited federal funding by non-university course providers are very unpopular.


The government would be wise to take that message on board. They would be wise in terms of the wellbeing of the nation and students who are looking to develop their career at our universities. And now we know that they would be wise in terms of the wellbeing of their own party, their own government and some of their own MPs, including the minister, because 69 per cent of those polled said that they oppose significant increases in fees and 65 per cent said that they oppose 20 per cent funding cuts to our universities. Just 28 per cent of voters said that they approved of deregulating the higher education sector to allow privately-owned institutions to have access to Commonwealth subsidies. 


This is a strong negative backlash from voters. The public are deeply troubled by the higher education moves of the government. The government, with this very cruel, brutal budget that they brought down in May, are certainly loading the burden in terms of how they are going to raise money and save money onto the backs of the disadvantaged—students, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick and Indigenous peopl 


They are all the people who are really copping it, who really will be hard hit by the budget measures. 


What we are seeing with higher education is pushing the reach of the damaging, destructive aspects of the budget out to the middle class of Australia. So often, when I am out doing my meetings on the weekend and meeting people socially, I meet people who are really worried about how their own children are going to gain an education. Just today I was told an example of a university lecturer who said, 'I suddenly thought: how are my children going to get the education that I have received?' I was at a barbecue recently—the dad is a lawyer and the mum runs a small business. Their kids were running around; they are quite young. These parents were saying the same thing: 'We look at our children and we wonder: how are they going to get the education that we were fortunate to achieve?' This is starting to trouble people—people from regional areas and working-class people who have not had the opportunity to go to university but, like so many working-class families, hope that their children will be able to. And now we are seeing middle-class families really troubled about what this government is doing to this country. And we know how important education is.


These are very, very important reasons that we need to ensure this disallowance goes through and look to the next stage to ensure that the other very damaging aspects of the coalition's policy do not become law, do not become regulations, in this country. We know there is a sneaky way this government is working—choosing regulations more and more to try and get through its agenda. So I suspect that we will be having more debates along these lines—very important debates—because this goes far beyond education; it goes to the very nature of the type of Australia that we are setting out laws for and setting out a healthy future for.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:54):  I would like to sum up this debate on the motion to disallow the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013. I thank Senator Rhiannon for her indication of support by the Greens. Far be it from me to criticise those that are voting for the proposition we have before us. I do enjoy listening to the Greens provide us with advice on being pure and more proper and more principled than any other political organisation in the country. I suppose that comes from having a party position that allows you to have the very best social conscience that money could buy, as we see within the Greens, who are only too happy to criticise Labor for our actions but do not ever acknowledge the simple facts of life here—that, under a Labor government, support for higher education doubled. When I was minister, the amount of support for science and research increased by 43 per cent, the biggest level of increase for science and research in this country's history. I say to you: 190,000 extra students is a record that any government could be proud of. 


Well may you criticise the decisions that were taken in the budget of last May, Senator Rhiannon—you are entitled to put that view—but I think you misrepresented me. I indicated at the very beginning of my contribution that Labor had changed its position. We put aside money, hypothecated money, last year to support the Gonski changes, to provide support for a six-year funding program for the schools system. We kept the budget savings within the education system. We said that, if you want to sustain a higher education system longer term, you have a look at the fundamental problems within the school system. I might also add that we provided additional support in the vocational system—more students in vocational education facilities across this country than ever we have seen in this nation's history. We never get any acknowledgement for that. I also say this—and I made this point in my remarks—that, when the government came in, they abandoned the position that they took to the election about supporting Gonski. They abandoned it and, as a consequence, the original funding that was earmarked for the Better Schools Plan was taken and put into consolidated revenue by this government.


So, Senator Ryan, I return to you, by drawing your attention to the fact that I also said that these are now decisions of this government, initiatives of this government, determinations by a Liberal Party minister. They have become your initiatives. I made that very, very clear. You have made the decision to cut university funding because of your bent ideological presumptions about what universities are about. We heard it from you again today. It was all about subsidising ski clubs. It may well be that your friends spend a lot of time in their Range Rovers at Mount Buller, but I say to you: I do not have that many friends that spend time there. Maybe they are just supporters of Melbourne Football Club; I do not know. But I just make this observation: you have a very distorted view about what actually goes on in universities. Liberal ministers, Liberal members of parliament, have demonstrated an extraordinary ignorance of the importance of universities, and they have a particularly perverse view about the role of education. They say money does not matter, yet they also say it is only reasonable that parents pay up to $30,000 a year to send their children to the most elite private schools in this country. So clearly money does matter to somebody. At Geelong Grammar, tell them money does not matter! Tell the parents that have to pay those fees that money does not matter! To suggest now that money does not really matter to the quality of education, I think, is to misunderstand how it really works.


The proposition we have before the chamber draws attention to the government's failure to fund the school system and the university system and the government's failed policy position when it comes to the question of the importance of education. The government do this under the pretext of a budget emergency, when in fact what they are doing is living out their ideological fantasies. We have had the Nobel prize-winning economist Mr Stiglitz tell us that, by international standards, this is a country to be proud of, that our budget performance is something to be envied, that there is no excuse for the cuts to higher education in this country and that they are wrong—and I think the word 'criminal' was used. That suggests to me just what a difference in mindset exists.


We have a government here that seems to want to mortgage the future. We have a government here that is not interested in ensuring the future. It wants to mortgage the future by suggesting that those with resources—those who are wealthy; those who are privileged—can enjoy and reinforce their privilege by ensuring that these educational institutions, which we all know unlock the door of inequality in Australia, are shut to the working people of this country. That is what this government's policy will mean. You withdraw the public resources and it is the private resources that take their place, so the people with money enjoy the benefits and the privileges of higher education.


We understand that there is a balance. We acknowledge the private benefit, but we also say that the overriding question is the public benefit of investment in education. That is why we say that the balance is about right at 60:40. Under the previous Liberal government, the balance shifted. The Howard government, despite the promises they made when in opposition, increased the level of private contribution by 100 per cent. That is where we get the 40 per cent from. When the HECs arrangements were first introduced they were about 20 per cent.


What we have seen over every successive Liberal government is a continuation of a policy theme of hostility to higher education, the culture of university and the importance of innovation, and a view that those with money should enjoy the benefits of having money and reinstate the privilege that they get from having that money. As a consequence, we are now seeing the Liberal policy under Howard being continued under Abbott. This policy will impose on the poorer people in this country, working people, particularly people in rural and regional areas a profound disadvantage—not freedom; an imposition of government to make the economic inequalities in this country greater. We know what a struggle it is to even up the score in our society. The Liberal's policy is to make that score even more uneven—to reinforce privilege and to reinforce inequality.


These measures that we are seeing today are not about spending money on education. I want to make senators very clear about this. This is about taking money out of education and putting it into consolidated revenue. That is the point of these changes the government has introduced. These are Liberal changes initiated by a Liberal government by a Liberal minister and—as we heard today in the defence from Senator Ryan—are all about Liberal philosophy. For those reasons, I call upon the Senate to reject these proposals and to support the disallowance motion.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the Higher Education (Maximum Amounts for Other Grants) Determination 2013 be disallowed.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (20:16):  I thank all senators who have participated in the second reading debate on this bill, the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 and related bill. It gives effect to the government's 2013 election commitment to better support Australian apprentices through the introduction of the Trade Support Loans program. This loans scheme will provide support for apprentices to complete their skills training through access to interest-free loans, of up to $20,000 over four years, to help with everyday costs during their apprenticeship.


The Trade Supports Loans initiative signals an approach of targeted investment in key trades where skills shortages exist. We need to ensure that we are achieving the best value for money in our skills expenditure, which is why this program will target trade occupations in priority areas such as plumbers, diesel mechanics, electricians and fitters. Loans will be available to Australian apprentices undertaking qualifications leading to these occupations. 


Currently, there are around 149,000 apprentices training in high-priority qualifications and a further 70,000 commencing each year. We know that about half of those who begin an apprenticeship in these qualifications drop out and most of these are within the first two years of training. More needs to be done to improve this outcome. The program will provide a stronger incentive for young Australians to take up the opportunity that an Australian apprenticeship offers and lift the number who finish their training and become productive members of the workforce. To increase completion rates, a further incentive will be provided through a 20 per cent discount on the amount of a trade support loan borrowed by apprentices who successfully complete their trade. For example, if an apprentice borrows $20,000 over the course of their apprenticeship, which they successfully complete, they will only need to repay $16,000.


We have heard from those in this chamber who are worried the trade support loans will not in fact be the better deal for apprentices. Yes, there are big changes but they are changes designed to give support where it is most needed and we are helping apprentices to transition to this new way of support. The program is being administered through a network of organisations that are already working with apprentices and employers and that understand the training system and what apprentices and employers need. We have also heard that some in this chamber are worried we are unnecessarily burdening young apprentices with debt and not restricting the apprentices in how they spend their loans. The trade support loans are not compulsory but are there to help with when an apprentice needs to make a decision on whether to spend some money now to enable them to succeed in the field of training they have chosen. This will enable them to do whatever they need to do, to help them in their apprenticeship, including finding a place to live that is closer to their workplace, buying a car or ute that can get them to work earlier or purchasing some tools or educational aids that will help them achieve the best they can in their training. 


Our apprentices are our future workforce and so we are supporting them through concessional loans when they need it most. They will start paying off their loans when they join that workforce as well-paid, qualified trades men and women. As well as concerns, we have also heard from senators on both sides of the chamber who have benefited themselves from taking on a trade and becoming qualified. This loans scheme will enable more kids from all backgrounds to choose an apprenticeship. We have also heard that lump sum payments would be more helpful. As you would understand, we need to ensure that the apprentice is sure they want to take on the debt and plan for the bigger purchases. This program has been designed to have front-loaded support, with bigger payments coming in the early years when they need them most. Several senators have suggested there is not enough protection of personal information. That is untrue. There are strong protections provided by the Privacy Act. In line with our promise to cut unnecessary and costly legislation and regulation, we are not going to replicate existing legislation and other privacy requirements in this bill.


The government is committed to ensuring that regulation is never adopted as the default solution. There has been a lot of commentary on the misuse of payments that occurred under the previous Tools For Your Trade scheme. Sarina Russo, an Australian apprenticeship centre contracted by the government, in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this very bill, said:


In our experience some apprentices did not use their $5,500 Tools For Your Trade funding to buy tools.


A person will think more carefully about what they spend a loan on, compared to how they might spend money that is just thrown at them. We believe in apprentices and their ability to choose when they wish to receive support to meet their individual circumstances. Members of the opposition have tried to insinuate that we are not looking after apprentices who are aged under 18 or who are still at school. This is also untrue. Great consideration has been given to the position of those under the age of 18. A range of additional materials, including specialised application forms, fax sheets and information for parents have already been developed. We concede that trade training is not a lesser avenue to that of studying at university and it should stop being treated as such. With the introduction of trade support loans, we recognise the barriers young apprentices face, and, in the same way the Higher Education Loan Program has assisted university students, trade support loans will assist apprentices in overcoming those barriers and transitioning into meaningful work as qualified tradespeople.


We are looking at ways we can strengthen industry investment and engagement and ensure that the skills delivered are of high quality and what industry requires. We are also looking at the inconsistencies across the system in qualifications and length of training and how training is defined within the system, and we will streamline our approach for a simpler, more efficient system that enables training solutions that fit employer needs. Improvements to Australian Apprenticeships will be underpinned by the introduction of new support service arrangements for apprenticeships from 1 July 2015 to provide better support for employers and apprentices throughout the period of training.


I commend the Trade Support Loans Bill to the house, but, before I close, I might just make a few comments on behalf of the government on the second reading amendment foreshadowed by Senator Lines. The government will not oppose the opposition amendment flagged by Senator Lines regarding parental consent for minors. The government has already given great consideration and put great care into designing the scheme to ensure that those under 18 are fully informed. A range of additional detailed materials, including specialised application forms, fact sheets and information for parents have been developed. Australian Apprenticeships Centres, who are contracted to deal with apprentices, must take due care in ensuring all apprentices who apply for trade support loans are aware of the obligations and implications of taking on an income contingent loan, in particular any apprentices under the age of 18. 


Additional information and references to assist apprentices will be provided to assist them to make a decision about taking on a loan and to make sure they understand the full implications of entering into a trade support loan, including the obligation to repay when they start earning more than $50,000 a year. There will be space on application forms for parents and/or guardians to acknowledge the commitment that their child is entering into, and supplementary information will also be available for parents and guardians to ensure they are aware of the requirements and obligations their child may take on. Additionally, the availability of trade support loans for under 18s is consistent with other income contingent loans, such as the HELP scheme. With those few comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr be agreed to.

As we are just coming back to this debate, it is worth, now we are in committee stage, reminding ourselves this is another attempt by the government to shift the costs, the funding needs of our public education sector onto students—in this case, onto apprentices. It is about the government saving itself a lot of money.


Abolishing the Tools for Your Trade scheme will save the coalition about $1 billion over the forward estimates. To put it in context, what we are talking about here is an ugly aspect of the policies that flow out of the budget where the government makes up the savings but they are savings at the cost of ordinary people and at the cost of quality education for our next generation of skilled workers.


Our amendments would lower the cap on the total loan available from $20,000 to $10,000. As senators would remember, the essence of this bill is that it turns the Tools for Your Trade $20,000 into a $20,000-loan. This is not the Green's preferred position but it is a way to deal with it that, I think, does bring forward a reasonable compromise. The loan would then be dropped from $20,000 to $10,000 and the difference would be made up by matching with direct government financial assistance dollar-for-dollar up to $10,000. Effectively, apprentices would get a $10,000-loan and they could also then get a grant. This is a simple measure and, we would argue, a very beneficial measure because it reduces the debt burden.


Let's reflect back on the debate because there were some interesting contributions. I very much congratulate senator Deborah O'Neill. She spoke with a real knowledge about the practical realities for apprentices and how important Tools for Your Trade is. She made the important point that we cannot trust the government and that is certainly the case. I hope that Labor, when they reflect on these amendments that the Greens are bringing forward, remember the words that many of their senators brought into this debate. The debt burden that the bill will place on apprentices, if it goes through in its current form, will really be an appalling way to start life. Very young people have not got a clear idea about how to manage their finances, what it means to go into debt and will be, all of a sudden, saddled with a huge debt. Let's remember some of Senator O'Neill's words: she talked about how it is 'miserly' and 'mean', and how it would deliver a debt-ridden future to apprentices. It would be provide a debt to hang around their necks. I very much endorse those comments and I think that it is a real reminder that we need to modify the scheme that is presented in this form that we have in the bill before us. 


I commend the Greens amendment. It is a responsible way to go forward. There is still a burden of debt there, which—I have said and I will say again—the Greens are not fully happy with it. We were hoping we could get a compromise so that would not be such a heavy debt burden but still with that element of a grant, so that young people going into the first stages of their careers as apprentices can manage their finances more successfully. I commend the Greens amendments to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (20:45):  I thank Senator Rhiannon for her contribution. The government will not be able to support these proposed Greens amendments. These amendments would have a significant impact on expenditure. The first amendment, in addition to amendment (3), reduces the amount of trade support loan payments that will be treated as an income contingent loan. This reduction is supplemented by the introduction of an additional payment equal in value to the loan payment and paid at the same time. It effectively turns trade support loans into 50 per cent loans and 50 per cent grant payments. Changing the payment structure in this way is contrary to the clear and stated public policy intention of the government. 


The second amendment clause 5, page 7, line 2, in relation to the definition of TSL debt indexation factor, can also not be supported. This amendment removes any indexation, CPI or otherwise, from being applied to a person's trade support loan debt. This substantially changes the treatment of trade support loans from other government income contingent loans and will also have significant impacts on expenditure. So do all of the other amendments in relation to lifetime limits and other indexation related amendments. On that basis, the government is not in a position to support those amendments. 




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Thank you, Senator Cormann. Before I go to Senator Xenophon, I want to return to Senator Rhiannon's request. Is it the wish of the committee that the statements of reasons accompanying the requests be incorporated in Hansard immediately after the request to which they relate? There being no objection, it is so ordered.

——————————




Amendment (3)



The amendment provides for an additional payment to be made to persons to whom trade support loan is paid.


On the basis that the additional payment will result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in clause 104 of the Bill, amendment (3) should be moved as a request.

Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant

—————————




Amendment (3)



The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would clearly, necessarily and directly result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation.


If, as stated, this amendment would result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in clause 104 of the Bill, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that this amendment be moved as a request.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:47):  I have a preliminary question. I did not get to my feet in time to ask a broader question about the bill and the legislation. My question, Senator Cormann, is this: in terms of what is being proposed with respect to apprenticeships, has the government done any modelling as to the likely impact on the number of apprentices? We have seen a dramatic decline of apprentices; in my home state over several years there has been a 35 to 40 per cent decline in the number of apprentices. What does the government say will happen to the number of apprentices and the take-up of apprenticeships? 


What does the government say will happen when the money for tools is taken away? It could be viewed as almost retrospective: you have started your course; you expect to get a certain amount of money; you went to your course in good faith, with respect to this money and your tools; and then it is taken away from you. But you have already committed to the apprenticeship. 


Firstly, does the government concede that there is an element of retrospectivity in terms of taking away money for Tools For Your Trade? Young people have made a commitment to undertake a trade; they have made a massive, life-changing commitment, expecting to get some support from Tools For Your Trade, and that has been snatched away from them. 


Secondly, has the government undertaken any modelling in respect of the impact these measures will have on the number of apprentices, and did that modelling or its assumptions rely in part on consultation with the TAFE sector and other interested stakeholders?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (20:49):  I thank Senator Xenophon for those questions. I advise the Senate of something the Senate probably already knows, which is that I am not usually the representative minister in this portfolio. It is usually Senator Ronaldson. I am relying heavily on the advice provided by officials here in the Senate with us. 'Has there been any modelling?' I am advised that, yes, there has been and that the modelling in relation to the measures that are part of this bill has indicated that those measures will drive an increase in completion rates of about five per cent. There are of course other support measures that the government continues to put in place, which will seek to boost that further. We do not accept that the changes that are part of this legislation are retrospective. The changes apply to existing apprentices, but they only apply prospectively as per the provisions in the legislation that is before the Senate.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:50):  I thank the minister. In relation to the issue of modelling, will the minister advise whether the modelling will be tabled here and now? It is pertinent to the very basis upon which the government says it is undertaking this course of action. Secondly, in relation to the issue of taking away the money from the Tools For Your Trade for apprentices, does the government concede that there are some apprentices who commence their apprenticeship on the understanding that they will be able to get funding for their tools; only to find in subsequent years that that money will no longer be there?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (20:51):  Apprentices currently in training will be able to switch to the new arrangements but they do not have to. It is just that they will not get any further payments in the future, which is transparently put forward as part of our budget measures. Obviously what we have put forward in our judgement is a superior scheme which is why we are recommending it to the Senate. In terms of whether I could table the modelling, obviously I am not here and now in a position to do so but I am happy to take that on notice. I will confer with my good friend and valued colleague Minister Macfarlane and check with him if there is anything else I can share in relation to that modelling.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:52):  If I may assist the minister, some time ago when Minister Cormann was in opposition, I learnt the value of his pushing for orders for the production of documents, so I have learnt from the master the importance of orders for the production of documents. I foreshadow that there will be an order for the production of documents in relation to the modelling and I hope my crossbench colleagues and the opposition could indeed support that, because we want to see the base for this process. Even though the government does not acknowledge that it is retrospective, the question has been answered and I thank the minister for his frankness. Effectively, you are saying that there will not be the money that was promised earlier. You have to take out a loan for it. I reckon that is a bit rough. It seems that the government is willing to tackle apprentices head-on for their budget savings but will not, for instance, tackle anyone who has $10 million or $20 million in their private super account.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (20:53):  Firstly, I am pleased that Senator Xenophon was a student of my practices in opposition. I can assure him that I will do my absolute best now in government to comply with all of the requirements of the Senate in complying with relevant orders or providing an explanation as to why relevant public interest immunities might apply, consistent with proper Senate procedure. Thank you for that, Senator Xenophon.


In terms of your other question, what we are putting forward provides access to more significant support, but it provides that access in a way where, once an apprentice earns more than $50,000 per year, they would be required to repay the support that they have received, which is entirely consistent with the way this sort of support is provided to university students. We think it is important to provide appropriate levels of support to apprentices. We also think it is appropriate that, once apprentices on the back of that support have been able to build a successful career, those funds are paid back so that the government can provide further support to future apprentices. There is no unlimited money pot out there. As Margaret Thatcher said some years ago, pennies do not fall from heaven; they have to be earned here on earth. There has never been a truer saying.


Senator Xenophon, what we are able to do with this bill is provide more significant support based on the proposition that, once apprentices are able to build successful careers, they repay that support so that the government is in a position to support future apprentices. Then we have a virtuous cycle where successful people in the future support other people who could be successful beyond that period.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (20:55):  Perhaps I could take this opportunity to indicate the opposition's position on this bill. At this point, I should explain that we think this bill is grossly inadequate. Mr Chairman, when you were speaking in the debate you were somewhat surprised at the approach that I took in highlighting the deep and very basic flaws that the government had taken with regard to this approach. I do not think the argument is a particularly difficult one to mount, simply because the government has made over $2 billion in cuts across the portfolio and, I am advised, $1 billion with regard to apprenticeship programs. There have been cuts to the Tools for Your Trade program, the government has capped the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, it has cut the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program, it has cut the Apprentice to Business Owner Program, and so it goes. The government has, in fact, misled the Australian public. It went to the election and told a pack of lies about what it was going to do with regard to apprenticeship training. Of course, when they got into government, they cut all these programs, having said they would do something entirely different.


What we see before us is the last remnant of support that the government is offering apprentices. It might be inadequate; it might not be able to meet the requirements. Alternative programs were there, which the government has removed. So the opposition is left with a simple proposition: what is left for us to support in terms of apprentices? That is why we are voting in favour of the bill. Others will take a different view. They will say that this is inadequate, and they are obviously entitled to that view.


Regarding the amendments moved by the Greens—and I understand that they are being dealt with in a cognate manner, so I might try to deal with them in that fashion—the opposition cannot support them because they do not improve what is a pretty ordinary bill. In some respects they make it worse. What has been presented to us are propositions which would be far more complex to put into practice. As senators would appreciate, there are much greater financial implications than have been intended in terms of the effect of these measures. They would open up possibilities for abuse of the system in circumstances which I think would lead to apprenticeship training in this country being discredited. It may well open up the possibility of rorting by employers, whereby apprentices would be sacked but loans would still be in place. We may find circumstances that, in truth, would be a bureaucratic nightmare. Because of that, there are unfair comparisons to the way in which the HECS system works for the higher education system. I do not think it is appropriate for these measures to be transferred in that matter.


I am not a particular fan of this whole arrangement. I do not think it is superior in any way to the carefully thought out measures which had real effect in terms of assisting young men and women secure a trade in this country. I certainly do not agree with the government's shocking abuse of apprentices that we have seen in terms of the slurs about the misuse of the Tools for Your Trade program to date. In that context, there is one particular matter that I would like to draw the Senate's attention to. I foreshadow that there is an amendment standing in my name concerning the issue of parental engagement. Remember, this is a scheme that the government is proposing which will apply to 15-year-olds—15-year-old kids, signing up for $20,000 loans. We could make a comment about the appropriateness of that, but what we have got before us on the amendments that the Greens are proposing in this area are not adequate to deal with the job. So I propose an alternative amendment—that I am foreshadowing now—which goes to the issue of parental engagement. It makes the point that parents or guardians of kids under the age of 18 at the time of making an application must acknowledge that the applicant is fully aware of the commitment in which they are entering. 


As a parent, I might say to you, I would be somewhat horrified to see my children at the age of 15 come home and find out that they have got a $20,000 loan signed up, which we knew nothing about in the household. But that is what the current arrangement allows for. I think, as a parent, I want to know whether or not the government was offering cash handouts to any of my children when they were 15 years of age. Actually, it is not a cash handout—I see the officers are looking a bit perplexed that I have used this term; but a $20,000 loan to a 15-year-old, with no restrictions with what they do with it, other than to say, 'Of course, it is for an apprenticeship.' I can suggest to you that there might be a few other things that they could do with $20,000. 


The suggestion that $650 per month be paid directly into accounts of loan recipients in the first year is one that I think most parents would want to know about and that the money can be spent on anything because it is not a receipts based system. I think parents want to know about it. That is a very substantive amount of money about which parents and guardians should know that their children are lining up for. Given the size of the debts, it is appropriate that parents do know about it. The onus is on the government to make sure that parents and guardians are aware that their children are entering into a debt arrangement with the government. As I understand it, the government is not going to oppose this amendment.




Senator Cormann:
  I have already flagged it in the second reading—




Senator KIM CARR:
  Yes, I understand that, but the truth of the matter is, we want to actually see this in black and white. I am a bit old-fashioned. I have learned a few things from you and the opposition as well, Senator Cormann, and I want to see these things in black and white. That is why I am proposing these amendments. I understand that the government is not opposing these amendments. I trust they find the favour of the Senate. We simply want to ensure that parents and guardians are informed about the debts their children are entering into with the government. It is a common-sense amendment, which I trust will find favour in the chamber.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-07-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (21:02):  The comments of Senator Carr are surprising because he has actually argued against some of his own policies when he was in government. Let us start off with the first point. He talks about how the Greens amendments could bring greater hardship to apprentices. That is clearly not the case. I would have thought that he could have seen his way that with Labor's amendment and the Greens amendment, we would have a tighter scheme. The Greens amendment actually lowers the cap on the total loan available from $20,000 to $10,000. But then more money can be accessed in the form of a grant, which is effectively the Tools For Your Trade system, which operated under Labor. That is where you have the combination. So that is not bringing greater hardship; it is actually reducing the loan and therefore reducing the debt. 


To hear Senator Carr talk about possible abuse of this scheme and possible rorting by employers. Rorting by employers I will leave aside. That can happen at any time but there are measures to stop that. But in terms of the abuse of the system, I sat through so many estimates, heard arguments in this chamber when the coalition were in opposition, abusing Labor about the Tools For Your Trade and when they came up with going off to tattoo parlours and buying mag wheels, and all the other insults that were hurled around. It is quite extraordinary to hear Senator Carr now talking about a system that we are proposing which is not dissimilar to what Labor had. Listening to the debate—and hearing how Labor will not support the Greens amendments that are trying to deal with a very problematic bill that we have before us—we are left concerned and wondering if Labor will wind back this policy when they are in government. Will we return to something similar, where direct support was given for apprentices, or are we heading down the path of these big debts going to the compound interest system that we have seen now introduced for university students? That is a worry that hangs over the debate. But for the moment, our amendments would bring a much better way of supporting young people who decide to start their careers with an apprenticeship.

   (b) for each qualifying apprenticeship to which the unindexed debt relates:


      (i) working out how much of the unindexed debt relates to that qualifying apprenticeship; and


      (ii) multiplying that much of the unindexed debt by the amount that applies under subsection (3); and

(12) Clause 100, page 61 (line 21), after ""this Act"", insert ""(other than subsection 13(3))"".


These are the set of amendments that bring forward a range of badly needed changes to the bill. Together, they strengthen support for apprenticeships in the very responsible way. The amendments increase the repayment income threshold and provide for lower repayment rates. This would allow apprentices to earn more before paying off the debt, again something which is very important because we know apprentices do not start off with much money. This debt is going to put them under considerable pressure and this is a way to bring a better regime into managing this matter. 


We have heard much debate about how the debt is an incentive. That is again why we are bringing this forward—to be able to moderate it to some extent. The changes set out reduce the negative impacts of the legislation with, as I said, links to the repayment rates of the HECS-HELP system, so that apprentices will begin to repay at a rate of four per cent of their income once they earn over $53,000. The amendment is needed because the loans scheme could well go the way of loans for university students, to a higher interest rate and a form of compound interest. As we know, that would mean that the debt burden would escalate considerably. I know that is not what is proposed but, when you look at the progress with the debt burden that university students have to handle—and the government is proposing to change that too—we need to be aware of this, wary of it and, the Greens would argue, bring in ways to modify it. 


We also have an amendment that would remove the CPI indexation. This would have the impact of reducing the real value of the loan over time. Every year an individual did not make a payment, the value of the loan would decrease at a cost to the government. The biggest beneficiaries of such a change would be low-income apprentices. Again, that brings in some protection for apprentices who start off on a very low wage, so that they do not end up with an extensive burden. This is another responsible amendment to manage what is, we would argue, not a good scheme. We are trying to put in some modifications that would allow the government to have the scheme it wishes. Labor wanted to support that but surely these modifications should be adopted.


There is also an amendment that would retain most of the current structure of the loans scheme but would ensure that, when an apprentice signs up to a loan with the current CPI interest rate, they will stick to that rate for the duration of their loan. This would prevent a situation we are now seeing where—




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. It would seem to me that, with Senator Rhiannon now talking about indexation, she is actually talking to the amendment she previously moved, which the Senate has already dealt with. She might want to consider that.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Thank you, Senator Cormann. We have been going across them a little bit. Senator Rhiannon, obviously there has been some wide-ranging debate but I would ask you to stick to the set of amendments currently before the committee.




Senator RHIANNON:
  Thank you, Temporary Chairman. I have done them in two lots in globo for the ease of the chamber and have explored those issues because there is some crossover with these amendments. I will move to requests (7) and (9) covering amendments which, upon completion, ensure the apprentice will get a 40 per cent discount on their loan, not the proposed 20 per cent. Then an amendment inserts a clause—and we see this as the most important amendment—that would waive the debt for any apprentice who is dismissed from their apprenticeship or traineeship as a result of any action taken by the employer. I give emphasis to that amendment because many situations could arise from this bill if it is put into law. One of those could be that a young person starting off on their career has an apprenticeship, the employer dismisses them and they end up with no qualification but with a large debt. We need to manage that in some way. Allowing that to happen would be a highly irresponsible way to be managing our apprenticeship schemes. That is why we have brought that amendment forward.


I commend the Greens amendments to the chamber. We have put a lot together for the ease of the committee at this late hour.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-07-14,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (21:12):  The government will not be able to support those Greens amendments. To raise the repayment threshold for the loans by 20 per cent would mean for 2014-15 that the repayment income threshold would be $64,014 instead of $53,345. The Trade Support Loans Program was aligned by the government with the Higher Education Loans Program to ensure consistency and to reduce confusion for individuals. The apprentice is not expected to repay their loan until they are receiving a sustainable income. The Trade Support Loans Program differs from HELP in that it is paid directly to the apprentice rather than to an education provider. This means the apprentice can spend loan payments at their discretion, to assist with everyday living costs during their apprenticeship with a view to them completing that apprenticeship and, of course, as indicated, if the apprentice successfully completes the apprenticeship, he or she would receive a 20 per cent discount in relation to the loan that is to be repaid. 


We are not able to support the proposition that this should be doubled to 40 per cent, the same as we are not able to support the proposition that the repayment threshold for loans be increased by 20 per cent because it actually adds complexity and also would have a significant impact on expenditure. Obviously, we have properly calibrated this program to ensure that it is able to provide this important support to apprentices in a fiscally sustainable fashion, which is why we cannot support those amendments.


In relation to the comments on indexation, I have previously dealt with those matters.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (20:16):  I thank all senators who have participated in the second reading debate on this bill, the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 and related bill. It gives effect to the government's 2013 election commitment to better support Australian apprentices through the introduction of the Trade Support Loans program. This loans scheme will provide support for apprentices to complete their skills training through access to interest-free loans, of up to $20,000 over four years, to help with everyday costs during their apprenticeship.


The Trade Supports Loans initiative signals an approach of targeted investment in key trades where skills shortages exist. We need to ensure that we are achieving the best value for money in our skills expenditure, which is why this program will target trade occupations in priority areas such as plumbers, diesel mechanics, electricians and fitters. Loans will be available to Australian apprentices undertaking qualifications leading to these occupations. 


Currently, there are around 149,000 apprentices training in high-priority qualifications and a further 70,000 commencing each year. We know that about half of those who begin an apprenticeship in these qualifications drop out and most of these are within the first two years of training. More needs to be done to improve this outcome. The program will provide a stronger incentive for young Australians to take up the opportunity that an Australian apprenticeship offers and lift the number who finish their training and become productive members of the workforce. To increase completion rates, a further incentive will be provided through a 20 per cent discount on the amount of a trade support loan borrowed by apprentices who successfully complete their trade. For example, if an apprentice borrows $20,000 over the course of their apprenticeship, which they successfully complete, they will only need to repay $16,000.


We have heard from those in this chamber who are worried the trade support loans will not in fact be the better deal for apprentices. Yes, there are big changes but they are changes designed to give support where it is most needed and we are helping apprentices to transition to this new way of support. The program is being administered through a network of organisations that are already working with apprentices and employers and that understand the training system and what apprentices and employers need. We have also heard that some in this chamber are worried we are unnecessarily burdening young apprentices with debt and not restricting the apprentices in how they spend their loans. The trade support loans are not compulsory but are there to help with when an apprentice needs to make a decision on whether to spend some money now to enable them to succeed in the field of training they have chosen. This will enable them to do whatever they need to do, to help them in their apprenticeship, including finding a place to live that is closer to their workplace, buying a car or ute that can get them to work earlier or purchasing some tools or educational aids that will help them achieve the best they can in their training. 


Our apprentices are our future workforce and so we are supporting them through concessional loans when they need it most. They will start paying off their loans when they join that workforce as well-paid, qualified trades men and women. As well as concerns, we have also heard from senators on both sides of the chamber who have benefited themselves from taking on a trade and becoming qualified. This loans scheme will enable more kids from all backgrounds to choose an apprenticeship. We have also heard that lump sum payments would be more helpful. As you would understand, we need to ensure that the apprentice is sure they want to take on the debt and plan for the bigger purchases. This program has been designed to have front-loaded support, with bigger payments coming in the early years when they need them most. Several senators have suggested there is not enough protection of personal information. That is untrue. There are strong protections provided by the Privacy Act. In line with our promise to cut unnecessary and costly legislation and regulation, we are not going to replicate existing legislation and other privacy requirements in this bill.


The government is committed to ensuring that regulation is never adopted as the default solution. There has been a lot of commentary on the misuse of payments that occurred under the previous Tools For Your Trade scheme. Sarina Russo, an Australian apprenticeship centre contracted by the government, in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this very bill, said:


In our experience some apprentices did not use their $5,500 Tools For Your Trade funding to buy tools.


A person will think more carefully about what they spend a loan on, compared to how they might spend money that is just thrown at them. We believe in apprentices and their ability to choose when they wish to receive support to meet their individual circumstances. Members of the opposition have tried to insinuate that we are not looking after apprentices who are aged under 18 or who are still at school. This is also untrue. Great consideration has been given to the position of those under the age of 18. A range of additional materials, including specialised application forms, fax sheets and information for parents have already been developed. We concede that trade training is not a lesser avenue to that of studying at university and it should stop being treated as such. With the introduction of trade support loans, we recognise the barriers young apprentices face, and, in the same way the Higher Education Loan Program has assisted university students, trade support loans will assist apprentices in overcoming those barriers and transitioning into meaningful work as qualified tradespeople.


We are looking at ways we can strengthen industry investment and engagement and ensure that the skills delivered are of high quality and what industry requires. We are also looking at the inconsistencies across the system in qualifications and length of training and how training is defined within the system, and we will streamline our approach for a simpler, more efficient system that enables training solutions that fit employer needs. Improvements to Australian Apprenticeships will be underpinned by the introduction of new support service arrangements for apprenticeships from 1 July 2015 to provide better support for employers and apprentices throughout the period of training.


I commend the Trade Support Loans Bill to the house, but, before I close, I might just make a few comments on behalf of the government on the second reading amendment foreshadowed by Senator Lines. The government will not oppose the opposition amendment flagged by Senator Lines regarding parental consent for minors. The government has already given great consideration and put great care into designing the scheme to ensure that those under 18 are fully informed. A range of additional detailed materials, including specialised application forms, fact sheets and information for parents have been developed. Australian Apprenticeships Centres, who are contracted to deal with apprentices, must take due care in ensuring all apprentices who apply for trade support loans are aware of the obligations and implications of taking on an income contingent loan, in particular any apprentices under the age of 18. 


Additional information and references to assist apprentices will be provided to assist them to make a decision about taking on a loan and to make sure they understand the full implications of entering into a trade support loan, including the obligation to repay when they start earning more than $50,000 a year. There will be space on application forms for parents and/or guardians to acknowledge the commitment that their child is entering into, and supplementary information will also be available for parents and guardians to ensure they are aware of the requirements and obligations their child may take on. Additionally, the availability of trade support loans for under 18s is consistent with other income contingent loans, such as the HELP scheme. With those few comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (21:50):  Tonight I rise to talk about the tragedy that is the Middle East, Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Israel. I do not think it matters what your position might be on any of these conflicts and who you side with. Any moral and compassionate person would say that the victims of any of these conflicts are children. We saw the tragedy of the three young Israeli men who were murdered a couple of weeks ago. We saw the absolute horrific death of the young Arab boy from East Jerusalem who was burnt alive and, obviously, the resultant escalation in hostilities in that particular part of the world. I do not think anybody could possibly say that those acts of pure violence against young people are anything but to be condemned.


Over 150 people have been killed in Gaza over the last few days of hostilities. I am sure many more would have been killed in Israel had it not been for the fact that they have the luxury of a very sophisticated defence Iron Dome mechanism, which intercepts the rockets that come into Israel. Once again, I just put on the record that it is the children who our hearts must really go out to. Notwithstanding the tragedies that are unfolding before our eyes and that have received a massive amount of media coverage over recent times, the tragedy that is Syria is probably even more so.


When you consider that Syria is a country of 22.4 million people and Australia has 23.5 million people, you get an idea of the size of the country. Ten thousand children have been killed in Syria since the civil war commenced there a couple of years ago. My home town of Renmark has 10,000 people, so it is like the entire population of my home town of Renmark, in children, have been killed in that conflict. More than 500,000 people have been injured in the conflict, many of whom, surprisingly—particularly on the border of Israel—are actually treated in Israeli hospitals.


A couple of months ago I visited the region. We went to Syria, Palestine and Israel. Probably one of the most memorable experiences on the trip was a visit to the Ziv Medical Centre, on the border of Syria. That hospital was treating victims of the civil war in Syria. We saw many young people. One case that probably hit home more for me than for anyone else was that of a 12-year-old boy. I have a 12-year-old son, so it was particularly pertinent to me. This little boy had lost both his legs and one of his arms in a home-made bomb attack. Only a matter of a few weeks before, nobody knew whether he was going to survive. By the time we got there, the critical danger from the injuries to his physical body had passed, but who would know the toll of the mental damage that had been done to this little 12-year-old boy? The even greater tragedy, I suppose, was his mother. All his mother wanted was for the medical centre to give him two prosthetic legs and a prosthetic arm so she could take him back home again so that he could get on with fighting the good fight in Syria. It just made your heart go out to this poor little boy who had been such a terrible victim of this war.


When you look at the numbers, you see that 170,000 people have been killed in this conflict. That equates to the population of Townsville. It just is quite mind-blowing. The UN has estimated that over nine million people have been driven from their homes by this conflict. That is the equivalent of the people of Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland being displaced from their homes. It gives you an extraordinary concept of what is going on in that place at the moment. The UN has made the statement that Syria is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child, and, when you consider what I have just said, then it is no wonder that UNICEF and other aid organisations are seeing Syria as a place so much in need. 


You can look at the whole area—look at Iraq, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Gaza and the events that have happened in Egypt in recent times. We so terribly take for granted the fact that we can be safe. I took back to my son's school, after I came back from that part of the world, pictures of a wonderful colourful playground with all this wonderful playground equipment in it. The kids in the class were all terribly excited to see this playground equipment—these big concrete wiggly worms and little houses that the children could run in and out of. The kids thought this was fabulous until they realised that this playground was actually a bomb shelter for the school. We just take it for granted in this country that we have the right to feel safe and for our children to be safe. It is a privilege that we must never underestimate, because the children of the Middle East, when they go to bed tonight, are probably sleeping with one ear open and the door of the bomb shelter open so that they can run into it. And that is for the lucky ones that live in places where they have bomb shelters. There are obviously a lot of children that live in places where they do not have the luxury of being able to go to a bomb shelter. 


It makes it even worse when you realise that so many of the children in these countries are being used as pawns of war. We saw little children, as young as five, in classrooms spitting vile venom about people that they did not like. To see a little five-year-old sitting there and being absolutely ruthlessly aggressive towards somebody that they had never seen, somebody they did not know anything about, was really quite tragic. To also see little boys at the age of five running around with machine guns strapped to them, shouting and yelling nasty things about, once again, people that they had never seen and did not know was really quite tragic. Once again, we in Australia need to make sure that we never take for granted the fact that we live in a country where we are safe and where we would never expose our children to the kind of devastating situation that these children in many overseas countries are in.


Tonight I would like to say, for all the children of the world who live in countries where there is war, that we as a society need to condemn the use of children in war. We need to make sure that we do everything we can to protect these children. We also need to do whatever we can to stop the hostilities, to try and help bring to an end the conflicts that are causing so many children to be killed, injured, maimed and displaced. In this world, I suppose, adults can make decisions for themselves. Adults are big enough to be able to fight for themselves. Adults know what they are doing. The children of this world are not so lucky. They just become victims of the postcode into which they were born. It is totally unacceptable that so many children are being put in this position in the world, and I would like to see that we would do more to ensure that the children of the world are taken out of this position of such great risk.
