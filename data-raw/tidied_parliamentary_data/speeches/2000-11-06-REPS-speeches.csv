"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the committee entitled Review of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority: who will guard the guardians? together with the minutes of the proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration reviews the performance of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority since it was established two years ago. It is based on the committee's public hearing with APRA's CEO, Mr Graeme Thompson, and other representatives, held on 4 September this year. APRA is a new regulator, created as a result of a change in the focus of financial regulation from sector based regulation to risk based regulation following the Wallis report. APRA has assumed the regulatory responsibilities of 11 separate agencies to form a single prudential regulator for the whole of the financial services sector.
In its report, the committee concludes that APRA has successfully navigated this transitional period, and work towards establishing the new regulatory framework for Australia's financial institutions is progressing well. In particular, APRA has made considerable progress in removing regulatory barriers to competition between similar deposit taking institutions through the development of harmonised prudential standards; developing a regulatory framework for new financial conglomerates; improving the prudential framework for general insurance companies, which is widely regarded as being out of date; and developing a regulatory approach to new financial products such as smart cards and credit derivatives. APRA has also put considerable resources into establishing effective working relationships with its fellow regulators. In addition, APRA plays a leading role in many international regulatory bodies such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
The committee's qualified tick of approval is generally supported by the industries being supervised which consider that the transition to the new regulatory framework has been smooth with a number of modest achievements. However, the committee found that there are still a number of major problem areas that need to be addressed and, accordingly, the committee has made recommendations on two of these. The first relates to making it easier for employees over the age of 65 to remain in a superannuation fund. Currently, regulations of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act require these people to inform their superannuation funds of their employment status on a monthly basis. The committee consider this to be excessive, so we have recommended that the regulations be relaxed.
The second recommendation relates to the collection of statistics on banking. APRA is now responsible for the collection of financial institutions statistics and is currently reviewing the statistics collections it has inherited from previous regulators. As the closure of bank branches remains a major concern for the community and parliament, the committee has taken the opportunity presented by APRA's statistics review to recommend that APRA provide yearly statistics on the location and level of face-to-face banking in Australia. The committee believes this will be critical to monitoring the community's access to banking services. 
In addition to these recommendations, the committee has indicated in the report that it will closely monitor APRA's performance in a range of other areas, including, first, overcoming the restrictions on capital raising that apply to mutual institutions, such as credit unions; secondly, improving the current system for levying financial institutions by measuring APRA's actual cost of supervising individual financial institutions and answering claims of overcharging on some levies; and, thirdly, increasing the acceptance and understanding of APRA's risk based approach to supervision of financial institutions.
The report notes that APRA has been fortunate to be established in a benign economic climate. Its performance is yet to be tested in a less benign economic situation. The House economics committee has a well-established commitment to ensuring that those who oversee Australia's financial system are properly accountable. This first report on APRA's performance should be seen in this context. The committee expects to deliver a similar report on APRA annually. This regular review will fit well with the committee's biannual review of the Reserve Bank. Together they will form a comprehensive accountability mechanism for those organisations that safeguard Australia's financial system.
Finally, I would like to thank the staff of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, especially the CEO, Mr Graeme Thompson, and the secretary, Ms Thea Rosenbaum, for their excellent assistance and cooperation in undertaking this review. I also thank all committee members, particularly the deputy chairman, the member for Chisholm, and the secretariat, in particular Mr Kevin Bodel and Ms Bev Forbes, for their contributions to this inquiry. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,1,1
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—I also rise today to welcome the first review of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The appearance of APRA before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is one of the major elements of the authority's accountability to the federal parliament. APRA commenced operation on 1 July 1998 as the single prudential regulator of all Australia's financial institutions. It was a major plank flowing from the Wallis review. Interestingly, APRA defined itself to the committee by what it is not:
We are not responsible for policing competition in financial markets, for standards of disclosure about products and services or for how banks and others handle customer complaints and disputes. We are not responsible for fees, charges or interest margins, or for the representation of financial institutions in particular regional areas.
This is most interesting as it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find who will accept responsibility for policing outrageous fees and charges imposed by banks and to protect what is left of face-to-face financial services. It seems no-one is going to accept responsibility for these issues of public importance. APRA's willingness to appear before the committee and to take further questions is to be commended and I thank them for their time and interest. To most, the prudential regulation of our deposit taking institutions would not appear fascinating stuff, but ask any Victorian who had money in Pyramid if they saw it as important and you would probably get a different answer. The bringing together of all ADIs—authorised deposit-taking institutions—under one umbrella has ensured that there are no longer first- or second-class ADIs. All have the same regulation and APRA has been working on harmonising regulations across all financial institutions. APRA acknowledged that it had not been easy establishing a new authority, especially the bringing together of two different institutions with widely different cultures.
Two issues which I wish to address have been raised as areas of concern by the financial industry—staffing and the new levy structure. A levy structure was imposed by the current government when APRA was established. Financial institutions were most concerned with the lack of input to this process and a subsequent inquiry was held to review the levy structure. The structure of the levies is meant to reflect the actual cost of supervision of particular entities based on a percentage of assets with a maximum cap of $1 million for any institution. Whilst the levies are based on the cost of supervision, a recent report by the ANAO found that APRA could not account for the administrative cost of the particular levies. 
In April 1999, the umbrella Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia estimated that superannuation funds were paying about 40 per cent of the running costs of APRA while ADIs were paying 16 per cent. In addition, based on asset value, large ADIs currently pay significantly less than any other institution towards the cost of running APRA. This difficulty, combined with the impact on conglomerates which pay a levy based on the number of licences they hold while they are supervised as one entity, makes the basis of the current levy structure difficult to justify. The impost of fees on small superannuation funds versus the four big banks and the net effect on individuals' retirement funds is something that needs to be further explored. The review of levies in 2003 is welcomed by the committee.
The issue of staff is something that has been raised not only by staff members at APRA but also, most notably, by clients of APRA. One senior individual in the super industry put it to me like this: by far the most frustrating and disappointing aspect has been its inability to retain decent staff who know anything about super; all the knowledgeable officers have left and this has a real and dramatic effect on service levels. It means that now you cannot get appropriate compliance advice out of it and its officers prefer to work on audit checklists rather than develop policy initiatives for Treasury. APRA policy has always been directed out of Treasury and recently this influence has been stronger than ever and we have been concerned that the policy direction has not been consistently applied. Generally, responses are prompt but, because of other problems, only to routine queries. For anything a little complex—super equalling complexity—you just do not get a response.
I will now quote from a statement by AMP's Kevin Casey at a recent Senate inquiry:
While the regulators understood the law and were very well intentioned ... they do not have a great feel for the financial system they are overseeing.
He went on to say:
The AMP was finding regulators applying more black letter law and less `feel' for practical issues.
Combined with reports from staff about the rock bottom-level of morale and the massive staff turnover, staffing is a serious issue that APRA needs to address. APRA's recent annual report talked about how it wanted to bring together numerous sets of terms and conditions. This is why it has gone for individual contracts—AWAs! For those who do not realise, I am being ironic. I do not see how you are going to get a uniform set of terms and conditions through individual contracts. I think that the impost of AWAs on staff has led to many leaving and to a lack of workplace democracy and rock-bottom morale in the workplace. Finally, I would like to thank all those involved in producing the report. It was difficult generating a lot of interest in APRA. I particularly thank Kevin Bodel.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—I would also like to speak to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Review of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority: who will guard the guardians? APRA came into effect on 1 July 1998 as a result of combining 11 separate regulatory organisations into one body. It was created as a result of a change in the focus of financial regulation from sector based regulation to risk based regulation. The establishment of a new regulatory entity to undertake prudential regulation of the financial system was a recommendation of the Wallis committee. At the time of inception, APRA was provided with comprehensive powers in its area of responsibility, including the licensing of financial institutions and making standards on prudential matters in relation to approved deposit taking institutions, superannuation funds and insurance companies. It is not responsible for policing competition in financial markets, standards of disclosure regarding products and services or how banks and other customer complaints and disputes are handled—as the member for Chisholm alluded to in her speech. 
In gauging the success of APRA as part of its annual review by the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, its performance, on the whole, has been very good. As per the first aim of the Wallis committee's recommendation for a new prudential regulator, APRA has reduced supervisory costs for regulated industries through administrative economies from $56 million in 1997-98 to an estimated $51 million in 2000-01. It was achieved at a time when financial institutions had increased in size by 35 per cent. In addressing the second and third aims of the Wallis committee's recommendations for a harmonised approach to supervising risk, and a flexible approach to dealing with structural change in the financial system, the committee found that APRA had encountered some difficulties. These included changes in the structure of the finance system, such as the growth in the number and complexity of conglomerate institutions, with different risk profiles; restrictions on the classes of debt and equity that may be issued by mutual institutions, such as credit unions; and changes in the supervision of the superannuation industry.
As a risk based prudential regulator, APRA's focus is how financial institutions control the risk in their activities in order to maximise the likelihood that they will be able to honour their obligations to their depositors and shareholders. Two areas of focus for APRA in the last year have been substantially completing a review of prudential standards for conglomerate entities and the harmonising of prudential standards for approved deposit taking institutions such as banks, building societies, credit unions and friendly societies. The principal problem for APRA is how to measure and manage risk across a diverse set of activities. It is currently in the second stage of a review of the regulatory framework for conglomerates. New prudential standards across ADIs came into effect on 1 October 2000 and APRA intends to undertake a second stage investigation to ensure that they address all significant risks facing ADIs. 
Prior to APRA becoming a supervisor for the superannuation industry, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission handled all regulatory activities in this area. Under the current situation, prudential supervision resides with APRA, disclosure and market conduct with ASIC, and the development of new legislation with the Department of the Treasury. Evidence provided during the review indicated that the separation of responsibilities with other financial regulatory bodies still requires a great deal of work. APRA recognises the need to work closely with other regulatory agencies to minimise duplication and inconsistency and to promote much greater cooperation. This is the key to the success of the current regulatory structure and the committee will monitor these relationships. 
From the perspective of superannuation funds, APRA's risk based approach is considered far too intrusive and the committee's recommendations and investigations into APRA's supervision of the superannuation industry found that there was a need for APRA to take on a more educative role and that far more resources should be allocated here. As part of its restructure, previous members had mentioned that a number of inexperienced staff have left the organisation and there appears to be a noticeable impact, particularly in the superannuation and insurance industries. In turn, a number of internal management and organisational issues have arisen. However, following some investment in learning and development activities, APRA now believes it has adequate staff numbers with professional people and that morale is high. The report demonstrates that APRA'S transition to a new regulatory framework has been smooth and its performance good. There is scope for improvement and APRA is pursuing measures to enact these. It is fortunate that APRA was born in a favourable economic environment. However, the committee will continue to review APRA's progress with regard to regulatory reform of the financial services sector.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—Market failure can have four sources: anticompetitive behaviour, and we have the ACCC responsible for that; market misconduct, and ASIC is responsible for that; asymmetric information, and APRA is responsible for that; and the broader financial system, for which the Reserve Bank is responsible. It is important that we do have good coordination between the four regulators. The United Kingdom and Japan have gone a different way. They have a separate regulator—for example, the Financial Services Authority in the UK. The United States is more like us, with different regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the SEC and so on. Examining other countries' prudential regulation is similar to examining their central bank arrangements. Every country has a different arrangement and every country believes it has the best. But for Australia's system good cooperation is essential between APRA, the Reserve bank, ASIC and ACCC, and the committee did mention that in its report.  
The functional separation of the consumer protection and prudential regulation role came from the Wallis inquiry of 1997. APRA was established on 1 July 1998, but this is the first time the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration has provided parliamentary oversight of APRA. The financial system inquiry recognised that the distinction between banks, building societies, insurers and superannuation funds is blurring and that a twin peaks model based on function would be an improvement. While overall the financial system was in good shape, reinsurers suffered a $3 billion loss and APRA took a close look at the reinsurance industry and monitored closely the emerging exposures. 
In the area of banks, banks continue to maintain a capital ratio of 10 per cent, which is what it has been for the last two years. It is above the standard minimum ratio of eight per cent and banks' asset growth has been 11 per cent. Building societies and credit unions again have growth of five per cent. In the area of insurance, solvency has been well above the statutory minimums and, as I mentioned, reinsurance recorded losses of $3 billion. In the area of capital adequacy, since 1988 capital adequacy has been based on the Basel accord. Last year the Basel committee released a new capital adequacy framework which is based on minimal capital requirements, supervisory review and effective market discipline. This seems a good improvement.

(1)	recognises that the restaurant and café industry makes a significant contribution to the Australian economy, having an estimated gross profit of $3.3 billion and employing over 188 000 Australians;
(2)	acknowledges the contribution the restaurant and café industry makes to Australia's tourism income, with visitors spending an average $328 on food during their stay in Australia; and
(3)	recognises the importance placed on the apprenticeship scheme by the Government, increasing the positions available in traineeships, and noting its beneficial impact for training in the restaurant industry.
I am very pleased to move this motion today. The restaurant and cafe industry makes a significant contribution to Australia's economy, having an estimated gross profit of $3.3 billion and employing over 188,000 Australians. This motion also recognises its significant impact on the Australian tourism industry. Visitors spend, on average, $328 on food during their stay in Australia. The restaurant and cafe industry is also an employer of young people. The restaurant industry makes a significant contribution to apprenticeships and traineeships.  
I speak to this motion today from many aspects, not the least being that my family business has been involved in the food preparation industry for some 50 years. I have a very high regard for the thousands of restaurateurs and cafe owners in the Petrie electorate and throughout Australia who have maintained the high levels of professionalism and service that have ensured that Australia has one of the best industries in the world. You have to be a certain type of person to be a restaurateur. You have to put in long hours, service and dedication. Many families also contribute to what makes a really great restaurant. There are no half measures in this business. You get only one chance to deliver a truly superb meal. From the time a reservation is made, the service given by the maitre d, the food waiter and the drink waiter, the excellence of the cuisine, the ambience of the restaurant and the level of attentiveness by the owners all determine what sort of a restaurant experience you will have.
There are approximately 20,000 restaurants, cafes and caterers providing this service. Australians, according to ABS figures in 1998, spend nearly $1,000 per head eating out each year. The industry is a major employer and over 188,000 people work in restaurants and cafes. Many of these are young people aged between 15 and 19 years of age. In fact, they make up 20 per cent of this work force. The industry, contrary to belief, is rather a skilled one and, according to ABS statistics, 70 per cent of employees fall within associated professional, intermediate clerical and tradesperson classifications. The restaurant industry has been growing since 1982 and the number of restaurants in Australia has grown by 150 per cent. The restaurant and cafe sector is predicted to grow at around 4.2 per cent annually until 2001, according to ABS figures. Because the industry is so labour intensive, it employs a large number of young people. It is a major contributor to the tourism industry and contributes billions of dollars in exports each year.
In 1985 and 1986, two decisions had an adverse effect on the industry. The first occurred on 19 September 1985 when the government under the stewardship of Treasurer Keating announced that income tax deductions would no longer be available for business related expenditure from that date onwards. This was followed by the introduction in 1986 of fringe benefits tax. All business related entertainment expenses were subject to FBT. At the time, I was closely involved and quite active with the Restaurant and Caterers Association Queensland, along with Nick Tsminas of The Ox restaurant in Redcliffe, Francis Dominech of Baguette restaurant and Geoff Harrower of Harrowers restaurant. At that time, the Restaurant and Caterers Association Queensland put up a great fight under the leadership of Paul Dever and its 374 members at the time. We lobbied and fundraised, we had delegations and I was part of a delegation that came to Canberra. I will never forget our slogan: `Don't let Keating stop you eating'. The white paper on tax reform advocated a major crackdown on fringe benefits claimed on entertainment expenses. It also advocated a tax on employers in respect of non-cash fringe benefits to employees. The paper said that the greatest difficulty arose in areas of entertainment expense where, it claimed, a good deal of business entertainment tended to be done on a reciprocal basis and was often undertaken for predominantly social reasons rather than business purposes. The only really effective way of counting deductions for private entertainment was to ban deductions of this kind. The white paper went on to say that it recognised that a measure of this kind would also mean that in a number of cases deductions would be denied for genuine business expenses. This disadvantage had to be weighed up against the need to maintain respect for the tax system and pursue overall tax equity in the face of practical impossibility of preventing abuse in the area.
There is no doubt that there were abuses of entertainment expenses, but I also experienced, in my restaurant life and when I went to work for a hotel chain, many legitimate business meetings and contracts that were signed over the restaurant table. To say that dining out with clients is a totally pleasurable experience and not worthy of a deduction is a total fallacy. Throughout my corporate life in sales and marketing, I frequently had to entertain large corporate clients. It was a necessary part of my job, but an area that was by no means a perk of the job. It was an important part of doing business, not a privilege. Small companies around Australia use restaurants as their boardrooms. These small to medium enterprises do not have the expensive boardrooms. They do not have the huge dollars to spend on promotions and promotional activities or huge marketing budgets. The introduction of FBT changed the face of the restaurant industry. I saw many good restaurants that had been trading for many years lose their very valuable clientele overnight. When you look at it on a wider basis, many industries were affected: the wine companies that sold to restaurants, the fruit and vegetable wholesalers, the meat wholesalers, the small bakery down the road that supplied the dinner rolls, the gelati seller, the chocolate supplier, the dessert manufacturers, the laundry supplier, the flower seller and the manufacturers of industrial cleaning products. The industry already operated on small margins and it was crushed even further. A survey covering 20 per cent of restaurants in Brisbane's CBD in March 1985 to March 1986 by Howarth and Howarth Services, commissioned by the Restaurant and Caterers Association Queensland, found that there had been a 23 per cent drop in the number of meals served, a 15 per cent drop in turnover and a 7.4 per cent drop in payroll. On the introduction of this Keating fringe benefits tax, BRW-KPMG Hungerfords surveyed 220 company chief executives and asked the following question: `How are you responding to the Keating tax package?' Of the respondents, 76 per cent indicated that they would reduce the value of spending on entertainment regardless of Keating's views on the business lunches at the time. The business lunch is an age-old tradition of settling disputations, cementing deals, gathering company information and extending business networks. It is not a time-wasting taxation rort. 
The restaurant industry today is just as valuable to youth employment as it was then. As a government, we need to look at FBT and review the current arrangements as they exist. The industry is a great generator of jobs—jobs that require traineeships and apprenticeships and provide entry level positions to a large number of young workers as well as providing greater skilled opportunities. Employment conditions are flexible and meet the demands of both women and students. I employed many young university students who are now practising professionals in medicine, engineering, teaching and marketing. Many valued the development of people skills they acquired when working in the industry, financing their way through university by waiting on tables. Modelling by the University of Newcastle estimated that 9,000 new jobs could be created by allowing a 50 per cent entertainment deduction, and this would generate a reduction in Austudy benefits and a multiplier effect in increasing revenue from increased restaurant turnover. FBT makes up only six per cent of fringe benefits payments. Lower unemployment, lower business costs and a more efficient economy would result. The industry is extremely labour intensive and requires workers with diverse skills and training. The highest percentage of young people aged 15 to 19 years and 20 to 24 years are employed in this industry and the work experience and training provided to these young people is very important.
I would like to acknowledge locally Nick Tsminas of The Ox restaurant and Sandy and Michael Smith of Mosaics restaurant for the fine work and guidance they provide to apprentices in the Petrie electorate. There are many fine establishments in the Petrie electorate: Morgans Restaurant at Scarborough; Mama's; The Ox at Margate and Mosaics, as I have mentioned; Tulio's; Carseldine Garden World Cafe; Top Nosh Cafe; Treasure House; Oriental Bangkok; and Rossinis—just to name a few of the rich and wonderful restaurants that weave a gourmet tapestry in my electorate.
This industry and its future depend on a workable business and leisure sector participation. It is time that the government had another look at FBT and allowed a 50 per cent deduction for business entertainment expenses, which are not currently deductible. I would be very interested to work with Treasury to look at some of the figures that would be involved. I believe that the multiplier effect in the generation of jobs and the effect on the economy would be far greater. The industry can continue to grow if 50 per cent deductibility is introduced. The Bell report Time for business found, after extensive consultation with the business community, `the majority of such meals are offered within genuine business context for the reasons of business benefit'. Taxing relaxing, a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, endorsed that. I commend the industry to the House. (Time expired)
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Restaurant and Cafe Industry</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—I second the motion. The member for Petrie is genuinely concerned about the restaurant and catering industry in Australia and it is true that her father and her family have been involved in that industry for some time. Michael Gambaro runs very famous restaurants in Brisbane, best recognised for their mud crabs. According to the industry itself, there are 20,000 restaurants and cafes in Australia, 4,887 caterers, 16,000 fast food and takeaway outlets, 6,637 hotels and 3,284 clubs. The industry employs 137,000 people. By any measure it is an important industry, so I was bemused that the member for Petrie would come into the House and say, `We need relief from fringe benefits tax.' This is an important industry and vital to the future of young people, who are often employed as apprentices in the industry. I checked the voting record of the member for Petrie when the goods and services tax was introduced into this place by the Treasurer. Lo and behold, the member for Petrie voted for it. The member for Petrie votes for a tax on the restaurant and catering industry in this country and then comes into the parliament and says, `Oh, we need tax relief. We need relief from fringe benefits tax.' I put it to the member for Petrie that she should have thought of that when she came in to vote for the goods and services tax, because it applied a 10 per cent impost on the restaurant and catering industry.
I have had the opportunity to look at some work by Professor Dixon and Maureen Rimmer of the Centre of Policy Studies regarding the economic impacts of the GST on various industries. Among the major losers from the imposition of the GST are entertainment and hotels. That is an early indication of the likely impact of the GST on those industries. I also point out that Professor Dixon and Ms Rimmer estimate that, as a result of the imposition of the GST in the form of the Howard-Democrat deal, the long-term change in living standards for Australia, when you include the very large compliance costs associated with the GST, is negative. The member for Petrie voted for a tax that will actually reduce Australian living standards. 
The member for Petrie and other members of the government might say, `That's that Professor Dixon and Maureen Rimmer, who don't seem to be very firm advocates of the GST.' I will now turn to some evidence from someone who is an advocate of the GST, and that is Chris Murphy from Econtech. He prepared a report on 24 August last year, after the GST had been legislated and after the deal with the Democrats. It was after the Ralph review had produced its report. This report from an advocate of the GST said:
Household spending on Accommodation, Cafes and Restaurants services will be subject to GST of 10 per cent. Furthermore, spending by foreign tourists will also be subject to GST, unlike other exports. Production in this industry will be lower because higher prices will reduce demand. 
Accommodation, Cafes and Restaurants suffers a greater fall in production from ANTS II than from ANTS I—
that is, from the Howard-Democrat deal compared with the original GST package. They really made a fine mess of it. They did a deal with the Democrats that imposed an even greater penalty on accommodation, cafes and restaurants. The report continued:
This is because the tax cuts are smaller under ANTS II, and lead to smaller reductions in costs. The production loss increases from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent.
The review went on to point out that the Ralph measures do nothing for the restaurant and cafe industry because they reduce the company tax rate but abolish accelerated depreciation. It said: 
Overall, more tax will be paid by the Accommodation, Cafes and Restaurants industry.
That was after it was legislated. But the government had fair warning. The same author, Mr Chris Murphy, in a report in September 1998, which was before the last election, produced his estimates of the production effects of the GST package. Among the biggest losers are accommodation, cafes and restaurants. And which of the states lose most under the GST? There is Queensland, right up there with the main losers from the GST package. 
As I say, I am quite bemused that the member for Petrie would come in pleading with the Treasurer for tax relief for the restaurant and cafe industry when in fact she was one of the people who voted to apply an impost in the form of the GST. Again the government had fair warning of this. I do not imagine that the member for Petrie was privy to this information, but not only did Chris Murphy of Econtech produce this analysis publicly just before the last election; he produced it quite a way before the last election, in the form of advice—modelling—to the Treasurer. You might remember the famous statement of the Treasurer to the National Press Club when he was asked a question about the employment effects. He said, `Look, we've done a lot of modelling.' In fact, Treasury had done no modelling at all, but it had commissioned someone to do some modelling, and his name was Chris Murphy. 
That modelling was very detailed. I refer to a table in which Chris Murphy looked at production effects and the employment effects of the GST package. Accommodation, cafés and restaurants were amongst the biggest losers, with a 1.1 per cent decline in production and a 2.2 per cent decline in employment. If we go to very detailed tables so we can have a precise look at meal preparation and presentation in restaurants—we are right on the money here—there was an employment decline of three per cent, a reduction of 1.8 per cent in production quantity and a 4.8 per cent reduction in the value of production from that particular industry. This is an industry that the member for Petrie is championing here, asking for special tax relief and relief from fringe benefits tax; but it is one of the biggest losers from the GST package.
Let us come forward to more recent developments. I refer here to a survey by Morgan and Banks. You might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that last week in the parliament the Treasurer was chortling about a Morgan and Banks survey indicating that more than 90 per cent of businesses did not favour GST roll-back. Of course, if the question had been, `Do you favour making the GST simpler?' I would think an overwhelming majority of businesses would support making the GST simpler. How many businesses say, `No, we like it just as it is. It is very complex and that is how we love it'? I do not think many businesses would have that view because there are very substantial compliance costs associated with the GST. So we had the Treasurer chortling about how the Morgan and Banks survey had vindicated his position. 
You may also recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Treasurer and Prime Minister said after the date of implementation of the GST, in the first few days after 1 July this year: `Hasn't it been terrific? Hasn't it really gone very smoothly? We are very proud of the GST.' Another Morgan and Banks survey was released over the weekend which has some incredibly telling results in it. The key question asked was: `How has the GST impacted upon your organisation's profitability?' Only 5.9 per cent said it had increased profitability, but 94.1 per cent of respondents to the Morgan and Banks survey said the GST had reduced their profitability. If we have a look at some of the industries relevant to this debate, in the food sector 93.4 per cent of respondents said that the GST had reduced their profitability and in tourism 96.1 per cent said it had reduced their profitability. If we look at how it has affected small business, businesses with fewer than 20 employees, 92.7 per cent said it had reduced their profitability. So we have compelling evidence of the actual impacts of the GST, and the actual impacts are very adverse. Remember the Treasurer's prophetic statement, `I don't think anyone will go to the wall as a consequence of the GST.' He said that in Perth on 18 May. Right at this moment, businesses are going to the wall as a result of the GST, and the reduction in profitability that has been reported by 94 per cent of businesses is a forerunner of further bankruptcies as a result of the GST.  
Today we have located a report from the restaurant and catering industry itself, and the results of that survey are that almost half of the surveyed businesses say that GST implementation has cost them more than $5,000. So that is a measure of the compliance costs. More than 30 per cent of them anticipate difficulties with the business activity statement. So much for a streamlined new tax system for a new century. The member for Petrie was one of the members on that side who voted for a new tax on the restaurant and catering industry and she has the temerity to come in here and say, `Look, we need tax relief for the restaurant and catering industry.' She should have thought of that when the legislation was going through, and she failed to do so.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—It is my pleasure to support the motion from the member for Petrie, an outstanding member of this House and someone who has shown real leadership in terms of tourism. She is one of the key members of the Friends of Tourism group and she takes an ongoing interest in the various tourism related matters in this House. The restaurant and catering sector of the tourism industry is one of its most significant, employing hundreds of thousands of people across Australia. It is quite a significant part of the tourism industry not only in terms of domestic tourism but also in attracting international visitors to our country. 
It was particularly interesting to hear the member for Rankin talk about the GST on restaurants. Is this part of the roll-back program in that we will have the two Rs, roll-back on restaurants? Unless he says that this industry will be part of the roll-back, on what grounds is he talking about it? You people come in here and take a stand on those things. You had 13 years to display your credentials, and what did you do for the restaurant industry? You put the whole FBT program on it. Look what happened to the industry after that. Have a look at how employment fell dramatically across the restaurant and catering industry, and they still have not fully recovered from the impact of your policies when you were in government for 13 years. There was no other relief, just a tax that went directly to their heart. So we hear the talk about the roll-back, but the fact is that when you were in government you were the ones who put a tax right on the restaurant industry.
I am very pleased to support the motion from the member for Petrie because we have in the restaurant industry in Australia professionalism, great competence and great skill as the restaurant industry has moved to a new level in terms of the special Australian brand, which is a fusion of culinary delights from various parts of the world, particularly Asia and Europe. That has worked very well. In fact, the editor of the American Express magazine which goes across the world said that Australia can now boast amongst the finest restaurants in the world. That is so when we look at some of the outstanding examples we have across the country, in every state. The most recent ABS figures show that in June 1999 there were 12,845 restaurants and cafes around Australia employing 152,000 people, which is very significant and is obviously one of the reasons why the member for Petrie has come into this House reflecting interest in that sector. They have a combined 1,057,000 seats available for the consumption of food on the premises and around 52 per cent of restaurants and cafes are licensed to sell alcohol. We also have the Australian innovation, the BYO, which has been well received. During 1998 and 1999 businesses in the restaurant sector generated nearly $7.2 billion in income. As the member for Petrie has outlined, gross profits represent $3.3 billion, which is very significant these days. It shows the importance of the restaurant and catering sector to the Australian economy.
There is no doubt that the restaurant and cafe sector is a vital part of Australia's overseas industries and that the employees of cafes and restaurants are in fact the very face of Australia to the international visitor. As part of that, the government has recognised this sector in terms of new apprenticeships—275,000 new apprenticeships in training around Australia, many of them involved in hospitality and many of them involved in the burgeoning restaurant and catering sector. The industry itself has played a very significant part in terms of the economy, the $7 billion of overall income and the jobs generated—150,000. In terms of the establishments, the overall impact on the economy is very significant. I agree with the member for Petrie that some areas of taxation need to be reviewed to look at the long-term future and viability of this most important sector in the Australian scene and a vital part of the growing international tourism, given we now have four million international visitors every year coming to Australia. One of the reasons for that is the vibrant restaurant sector. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Restaurant and Cafe Industry</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—I rise to speak on this motion, having had some eight years of experience in this very industry as an industrial officer, so I know it very well. As my colleague the member for Rankin has pointed out, restaurant and catering industry facts and figures show that there are 20,000 restaurants and cafes in Australia, 4,887 caterers, 16,000 fast food and takeaway outlets, 6,637 hotels and 3,284 clubs. As he also pointed out, employment-wise that means 137,000 people employed in restaurants and cafes and about $1.1 billion spent on wages and salaries by restaurants and cafes. The retail and commercial food services market is worth some $18 billion annually and the restaurant and cafe sector makes up $6 billion of the market. Australians spend just under $1,000 per head on eating out each year, so you can see it is a vitally important industry.
My region of Bendigo has some 91 hotels, 76 restaurants and 55 cafes. A town called Heathcote, about half an hour from Bendigo, is very important in this particular debate for reasons which I will outline in a minute. It offers some very fine tourist facilities. I refer to the Bank Cafe, which is a former National Bank building, one of the many banks that have closed in regional Australia. A very entrepreneurial couple have converted it into a very fine cafe, restaurant and conference centre, and it is well worth a visit. We also have a whole range of very fine wineries in Heathcote. The Emeu Inn Restaurant offers fine dining with international cuisine. It specialises in local wines, has won an award for its wine list and has been recommended in the AgeGood Food Guide. There is a whole range of other very interesting tourism attractions in Heathcote.
The reason I have chosen to mention Heathcote is that it happens to be geographically in the centre of Victoria. It is halfway between the bay and the river. That, in normal circumstances, would position it very well for tourism. There is one big problem: nobody can afford to put the petrol in the car to drive there because of the government's GST. That is having a major impact on tourism not only in Heathcote but all over Australia. I would like to know what research the minister for tourism has commissioned on the impact on regional tourism of the skyrocketing petrol prices and the GST. If she has not had any research undertaken, I would like to know why, and I would call on her to commission such research, research that she needs to have to advise the government on the effects of the GST and inflated petrol prices on regional tourism.
I am very concerned, as are most people in the industry all around Australia, about the impact of the GST, especially with the inflated petrol prices, on tourism in regional and country Australia. The steep price of petrol is a direct deterrent to motorists travelling into country areas to see a vast range of tourist attractions and venues that Australia has for people to see outside its capital cities. The John Howard GST on petrol is a dead hand on regional tourism. As I said in a speech in the House in August, the national tourism industry estimates that regional tourism is the backbone of the nation's $70 billion tourism industry. The Australian Tourist Commission's figures show that regional tourism provides 430,000 jobs and attracts 68 per cent of domestic travellers, not to mention 28 per cent of international travellers. Indeed, only in August the House was applauding the $12 million the Australian Tourist Commission was investing over four years to maximise—

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—I congratulate the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments on reaching agreement today on the issue of genetically modified organisms and the right of a state or territory to decide on the appropriate level of protection for its environment and its primary industries. Tasmania has always maintained that it should have the right to decide whether GMOs are released in the state and on what basis. Tasmania prides itself on its clean, green, quality image and believes that, with its geographical isolation, it can extensively market itself to the rest of the world as a premium producer of premium products, whether they contain GMOs or are GMO free. 
It is Tasmania's contention that, as a specialised food producing state, it is crucial that it be able to guarantee consumer confidence in the status of its produce, especially if the produce is marketed as GE free; that is, Tasmania's contention is that it should be able to maintain its comparative advantages. The Tasmanian government called for the option of opting out of the national regulatory framework outlined in the Gene Technology Bill 2000. However, as I argued earlier in the debate on the bill, it is crucial that there be a consistent, strong national regulatory regime. On the other hand, there is potential within the regime for the regulator to be compelled to accept state and territory viewpoints to prevent the release of GMOs within their jurisdictions and to establish GM-free zones. The Senate inquiry recommended the strengthening of this provision in the bill, and the agreement between Tasmania and the Commonwealth today on this very important point gives effect to this sensible course of action. It also preserves the integrity of the national regulatory system, it forms the basis for Tasmania signing the gene technology intergovernmental agreement, on which the scheme is to be based, and it maintains Tasmania's right to protect its environment, its markets and its marketing image.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—I move:
That this House encourages the Australian research and development community, both public and private, and the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to move as rapidly as possible to embrace the emerging hydrogen economy and to place Australia at the forefront of the development of hydrogen as an energy carrier to replace carbon and commends General Motors for its “HydroGen 1” hydrogen fuel electric car. 
For as long as we have had a developed civilisation, human beings have used carbon for energy in order to produce heat, light and power. Energy from carbon is derived from three sources: coal in a solid form which  produces both electrical energy and heat; carbon in its liquid form as petroleum products, such as gasoline to power motor vehicles and diesel for energy production; and carbon in its gaseous form, which is largely natural gas, or CH4, and has largely been used to produce energy but, increasingly, is being used in some large motor vehicles.
Our carbon reserves are finite—that is to say there is only so much carbon in the form of coal, oil and natural gas available in the world. It took thousands of years to develop those resources and reserves, and by burning them we are consuming them in literally hundreds of years. We cannot replace them easily because that carbon is deposited by a process of photosynthesis: sunlight converts the carbon dioxide within the leaves of trees and plants essentially into sugar, which then forms matter that ultimately decays and, through thousands of years of both overburden and pressure, ultimately forms what we know as coal, oil and gas. So we cannot get this resource easily, and we keep burning it up. It seems to me that we are going to have to find a better way to power the world than by using carbon. In future millenniums, carbon will be needed by those who follow for plastic, carbon fibre and a whole range of new materials that today we cannot even imagine. Scientists and engineers will dream up uses that we cannot imagine for this solid, liquid and gaseous carbon. But one thing I can tell you is that, if we burn it all up, we cannot get it back for thousands and thousands of years. So we do not do those who will follow us any favours if we continue to consume the lot. 
Gradually we will move to a hydrogen economy. Most thinking engineers and scientists or anyone involved in the energy field knows this to be a truism. We will not for very much longer continue with the carbon economy as an energy carrier; we will gradually move to hydrogen. We will do that with hydrogen either in gaseous or in liquid phase. Hydrogen accounts for more than 80 per cent of all the matter in the universe. Most of it is buoyant gas that occurs naturally and escapes through the earth's atmosphere into space. The rest is bound up in chemical compounds. Industry produces hydrogen for a variety of purposes, usually by obtaining it from fossil fuel—the source of more than 99 per cent of the hydrogen produced worldwide. Virtually all of this hydrogen is used in the chemical industry as a feedstock. A small proportion is used in hydrogen fuel cells that have helped power the US space program for a decade.  
There will be some in the broader community who are listening to this debate today who might ask: what is a fuel cell? My advice is that a fuel cell consists of two electrodes sandwiched between an electrolyte. Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other, generating electricity, water and heat. Hydrogen fuel is fed into the anode of the fuel cell. Oxygen, or air, enters the fuel cell through the cathode. Encouraged by a catalyst, the hydrogen atom splits into a proton and an electron, which take different paths to the cathode. The proton passes through the electrolyte. The electrons create a separate current that can be utilised before they return to the cathode, to be reunited with the hydrogen and the oxygen in a molecule of water. The fuel cell system, which includes a fuel reformer, can utilise the hydrogen in any hydrocarbon fuel from natural gas to methanol, and even gasoline. Since the fuel cell relies on chemistry and not combustion, emissions from this type of system would still be much smaller than emissions from the cleanest fuel combustion process.
The first fuel cell was built in 1839 by Sir William Grove, a Welsh judge and gentlemen scientist. Serious interest in the fuel cell as a practical generator did not begin until the 1960s when the US space program chose fuel cells over riskier nuclear power and more expensive solar energy. Fuel cells furnished power for the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft, and still provide electricity and water for the space shuttle.
On 19 June of this year, an article by Simon Mann in the Age talked about the HydroGen 1, which I mentioned in my motion to this House. In his article he says:
General Motors' “HydroGen 1”, the first road-going, hydrogen-fuelled electric car, is a long way from mass production. But it is the first test car of its type—combining fuel-cell technology with pure hydrogen—
not methanol or gasoline but pure hydrogen—
to prove itself on the road. Its vital statistics compare favourably with a 2.5 litre diesel engine: nought to 100kmh in 16 seconds, a top speed of 140 kmh, and a range of 400 kilometres per tank of fuel. The car drives like an automatic but without the sort of gear ratios that characterise conventional vehicles. It accelerates more smoothly. It's quieter. And it's pollution free.
So promising is its “green” car that GM now expects that by the end of the decade 10 per cent of new cars will be thriving on a combination of fuel-cell and hydrogen. By 2025, the figure could be a quarter of the world's car market, which is tipped to double to 1.6 billion vehicles by around the same time.
...			...			...			...
“This is the only energy carrier that will be able to satisfy the need for a lasting reduction in carbon dioxide emissions despite a steady increase in the number of motor vehicles on the roads,” says Erhard Schubert, co-director of GM-Opel's Global Alternative Propulsion Centre. “This is because it reacts electro-chemically in the fuel cell to yield water.”
Not pollutants—water. The article continues:
Dr Schubert says the great potential of fuel-cell cars is that it will one day be powered on hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources such as hydro-electric, wind or solar power.
The French writer Jules Verne once described water as “the coal of the future”. “Today we know just how right he was,” says Dr Schubert.

As a further demonstration of its growing confidence, GM will use the vehicle as the pace care for Sydney's Olympic marathon in September.
And it did do so. Fritz Vahrenholt, a board member of Deutsche Shell AG in Hamburg, said:
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group established the Shell Hydrogen Co. this year. “Hydrogen is going to be the most important energy carrier in the 21st century ... In the long term it is going to replace oil and gas. For an energy company like Shell, it is important to take part in the development effort early on, in order to establish a leading position in the hydrogen business. 
International companies in the vehicle business involved in fuel cell research and development are Chrysler, General Motors, Ford Motor Corporation, BMW, Daimler Benz, De Nora S.P.A., Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Volkswagen, Volvo, Xcellsis, Zevco, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Honda, Daewoo Motor, Hyundai and Mitsubishi. In Australia we have the company Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd which is aimed at the mid-size industrial fuel cell market to produce electrical power. It is aimed in the range of 25 to 200 kilowatt hours. It is expected to be available in 2003.
It is time for the research community in Australia to embrace the hydrogen economy, to get to work in serious time on how we release hydrogen from oxygen molecules in water, how we transport hydrogen and how we compress it, and to garner information about international efforts at realising fuel cell potential for transportation. It is critical to our further scientific development that we use clean power from tidal energy and from hot dry rocks to power our fuel cell car. (Time expired)

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—I support the member for La Trobe and congratulate him on bringing this matter to the attention of the House. Given the state of the United States economy and the recent comment attributed to the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, that the remarkable run of economic growth in his country appears to have its roots in advances in technology, in Australia right now, with the price of fuels as they are and the Australian dollar being in the doldrums, we should be demanding that our Treasurer in particular understand the importance of energy and its cost to the world of the future.
Before I address the real nature of this private member's motion before the House today, let me state that the world is being held to ransom by a ruthless cartel of oil producers and processors. We cannot blame them because they control the most widely used source of energy for vehicles and industry. They have a diminishing resource and an increasing demand. They do not even have to market their product. Would such a cartel be interested in developing an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines? The answer is no. Why? Because they would be creating a competitor to their existing product. But here in Australia we are different. Our currently productive oil fields have a life expectancy, based on current rates of extraction, of about four to five years. Known reserves extend that out to between 10 and 15 years. But after that we are thrown onto the list of countries totally dependent for liquid hydrocarbon fuels on imported product. As we approach that date, we cannot expect mercy. We will not get it. Fuel prices we are paying now are only an entree to what we will be paying unless we look for an alternative.
The amazing fact is that there are alternatives. Other forms of energy exist that are both feasible and sustainable. The member for La Trobe outlined just one. The problem is that they are not controlled by the energy cartel and, therefore, they are not promoted. Personally, I have been promoting ethanol as an alternative—an easy step for industry to take because it can be blended with existing fuels and used in existing internal combustion engines. We also have scientists that have developed the technology. The suggestion in the motion today—and I am proud to support it—is a little more radical in that it is encouraging a break from tradition. It is a quantum step forward using a new technology.
It is not that the hydrogen cell is new. I am sure that most of us can remember a science experiment when we were in junior high school where our science teacher passed an electric current through some water with a little acid and we got one gas that was two times the quantity of the other and he used this to tell us that water was H2O and you had two parts of hydrogen to one of oxygen. If he was a particularly brave science teacher, he might have held a lighted taper to the hydrogen and we would have seen that gas that had been produced from water burnt with a hot flame. 
That is the secret about what we are debating today and how to harness that energy. The amazing thing about this substance as a fuel is that no carbon is involved in the equation of burning hydrogen: no greenhouse gases are produced by burning hydrogen. The added beauty is that there are no carcinogens—just water. Too simple to believe? Why haven't we been using it, commercially at any rate? Once again, it is about energy. The production of hydrogen by electrolytic processes is an endothermic reaction and it requires the input of energy to liberate the hydrogen. Then there is the burning of the hydrogen, or the generation of electricity using the hydrogen—an exothermic reaction. It is a case of getting the balance right.
There are a couple of variations on this theme. You can have a completely enclosed cell—the sort that our colleague was talking about that was built way back in the 19th century but not developed until the 1960s. It was so successful that the United States used it in rocket technology and space exploration. It is still using it today. As a matter of fact, the United States government has 30 such cells still in use. I believe that the space shuttle that brings astronauts back to earth is currently employing one of these cells. That in itself is an indication of why Australia should be investing money in this sort of technology.
Australian scientists have shown for a long time that we can match it with the world, but they need encouragement. Last week, in a speech I made on legislation that went through this House—I was very happy to speak on it—one of the pieces of information I used was to show that in the past four years investment in technology in this country by private enterprise has dropped by 20 per cent. That is a tragedy. With high fuel prices, with the Australian dollar low and with our oil reserves dwindling, it is an ideal time for our government to show leadership and to encourage industry to invest. 
This is a government that has a self-admitted windfall profit from the current fuel taxing regime. I would suggest to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that they should immediately invest. I can understand the preoccupation with the fiscal surplus, but I have always argued, and will continue to argue, that if some of that surplus is spent in developing new technology or providing infrastructure it is not expenditure but investment and should be regarded as such. 
Continuing down the path of time, we know we are going to run out of liquid hydrocarbons, and we know we will have to replace those fuels. They are not simply going to fall off a shelf. The process of replacing them will take time, it will take investment, and it will take finetuning. That is why we need to start today. Tomorrow will be too late. We have to be competitive with the world. We know that. We have to be self-sufficient in energy. Energy is the name of the game. Whoever controls the energy of the world will eventually control the world—I have no doubt about that—because we are such major consumers of energy. 
I am very pleased to support this private member's motion. I hope that it leads on to something far more advanced, something far more constructive, by the government. As I indicated in my initial opening comments, it is up to the government to show leadership. Industry is pulling away from investing in new technology, but the amazing thing is that Australians are some of the greatest users of new technology in the world. We sit back and we allow the United States to develop new technology and then we step in and buy it. With an Australian dollar priced at US50c, it is costing us far more than it was 12 months ago. I hate to think what it might be costing us in years to come. I believe that Australia can do it. The member for La Trobe believes that Australia can do it. All we have to do is to convince Australian industry to get out there and do it. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hydrogen Economy</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise to support this motion of the member for La Trobe. It is a timely debate, following as it does on last week's visit to parliament by eminent scientists to highlight the need for ongoing research in all fields. Australia is well placed with fossil fuels by comparison with many other countries, but the use of these fossil fuels in every case contributes further to destructive greenhouse gases. Australia is well placed with many sites suitable for wind turbines and solar power generation. The northern coast of Western Australia experiences exceptional tidal movement—in the Kimberley region, some 11 metres. The problem to date with renewable energy, however, has been storage.  
Another problem we as Australians have is finding a solution to the problem of the two per cent renewables target set by the federal government as part of our response to the Kyoto agreements. A solution can now be achieved by conversion to and storage of hydrogen. The conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis using clean renewable energy is the most effective means of combating increasing world atmospheric pollution. As an energy source for motor vehicles using fuel cell technology, it offers a solution to the looming crisis of maintaining the transportation of people and products with an ever decreasing supply of comparatively dirty fossil fuel. 
Professor Peter Newman of the Institute for Sustainability and Technology Policy from Murdoch University states, `In the next decade global oil production will peak, as for each barrel of oil discovered four are now consumed.' As an energy carrier, hydrogen is as easily handled as natural gas. Any gas reticulation system could be utilised to take non-polluting energy to more populous centres. Mr Erhard Schubert, coordinator of General Motors' Global Alternative Propulsion Centre, said that fuel cell power was the only energy source able to satisfy the world's need for a lasting reduction in carbon dioxide emissions despite a steady increase in the number of motor vehicles on the road. He also warned that zero emissions mobility was possible only if large-scale hydrogen production was possible through renewable sources. Quite obviously, there is nothing to be gained by utilising liquid hydrocarbons to split water into hydrogen and oxygen to then use as a supposed clean energy source because we have already created the atmospheric pollution. 
I am pleased to report that the Western Australian Department of Transport, in cooperation with Daimler and BHP, are keen to introduce hydrogen fuel cell powered commuter buses. In line with this, the Western Australian government is considering a potential clean renewable energy source that is proposed in Derby, Western Australia. With the capacity of nearly 100 megawatts of output, it would provide ample power for the immediate and future needs of the West Kimberley. The outstanding significance of this project, however, is the opportunity to prove up the total process with a secure supply contract with Western Power.
Further north, along the Kimberley coast, geographic features provide perfect locations for similar installations with a design capacity for 500 megawatt plus. With this clean, renewable electricity and an ample supply of clean fresh water, the potential exists to produce hydrogen to feed into pipeline infrastructure to major population centres. The options for hydrogen use require a great deal of long-term forecasting of economic, environmental and energy constraints and opportunities. The potential exists to share distribution facilities across this nation. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hydrogen Economy</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"— Whilst I have great respect for the member for La Trobe, I wish to speak against the motion because the main problem in producing hydrogen is that it takes a very great deal of electrical energy to produce, and there are environmental consequences as a result of greenhouse emissions. If one could produce hydrogen without any adverse environmental effects, I would be supporting the motion. In a few weeks, the governments of the world will convene in The Hague to discuss the implications of the latest findings on global warming and climate change. In a leaked report, the respected UN sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that the effects of global warming caused by human activities are now starting to have significant effects on the world's weather. Over 70 million people living in low lying areas of Bangladesh and China are at risk of storm surges and flooding. Where will these people go if they are drowned out of their houses? Perhaps they will embark for Australia's somewhat drier shores. In the last two years, we have seen massive flooding and mudslides in Venezuela and Mozambique, devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean and Orissa, India and inextinguishable forest fires in Greece and the western United States. Climate scientists have repeatedly warned that the earth's climate is warming up due to increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, yet the Howard government argues that Australia is a special case and should be allowed to release even larger quantities of pollution. As I have stated before in this House, this government's policies are not based on evidence and the best advice but, rather, on opinion and prejudice together with the pleadings of uninformed special interests. 
The evidence that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has presented is virtually unassailable. I will detail some of the evidence here, since it seems that the government's advisers have not been allowed to present data that does not correspond to official prejudice. Firstly, there is no doubt that carbon dioxide gas present in the atmosphere traps outgoing infra-red radiation and directly heats the atmosphere. This is a measurable effect and has been understood for over 100 years. Secondly, large-scale burning of fossil fuels like coal or oil or natural gas is adding carbon dioxide to the existing concentration in the atmosphere. This concentration can be measured, and the ratio of different isotopes proves that a portion of the increase is coming from the burning of fossil fuels. Thirdly, the overall atmospheric temperature directly affects the intensity and frequency of weather processes such as cyclones and heatwaves. The increasing frequency of these destructive events can be correlated with the measurable increase in atmospheric temperature. The government continues to argue that any measures that may be required to reduce Australia's carbon dioxide emissions would either be too expensive or cause unnecessary disruption to our way of life. With this attitude, it is no wonder that the inhabitants of the small Pacific island nations who are at risk of being washed out of their homes by rising sea levels and devastating hurricanes have no time for Australia's position. I would like to refer members of the government to a recent statement by the British environment minister, Mr Michael Meacher MP. In a column in the Manchester Guardian on 31 October, Mr Meacher said:
Climate change is not some trendy intellectual scenario for the distant future. It is with us now.
This statement was made in the wake of disastrous storms and floods that killed at least seven people and caused unprecedented damage to railways in the West Country.
While the government may wish to forget about events on the other side of the planet, it still has to face the issue of fuel prices, a topic that is in fact directly linked to the problems created by carbon dioxide emissions. I say this because, as I have previously reported, the fuel consumption figures for Australian vehicles are at the bottom of the list of OECD countries, at 8.9 litres per 100 kilometres. In fact, the thermal efficiency of most Australian vehicles is no more than about 15 per cent. This means that 85 per cent of the energy in the fuel is wasted by these cars and for every dollar a motorist puts into the fuel tank only 15c is actually used to move the vehicle.
While the Prime Minister argues about fuel prices with the premiers and claims that there is nothing he can do, the best answer, which is getting the manufacturers to improve the designs of their engines, is put in the too-hard basket. The low fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet contributes directly to our increasing greenhouse gas emissions and gives the lie to the government's pleading of Australia as a special case. Put simply, the lower the fuel efficiency, the more fuel a vehicle has to burn and the greater the emission of greenhouse gas. Anybody who lives in our larger cities knows that the volume of traffic is an ever growing problem. People are crying out for a viable alternative to the pollution spewing cars and trucks that jam the streets, yet the only viable alternative, new railways, does not seem to have much federal public funding support. Despite the fact that electric railways are perhaps five times as energy efficient as road transport, the federal government has not provided one single cent for new railway construction. The government's position on greenhouse gases is completely untenable and Australia risks becoming a pariah state. 
 (Mr Nehl)—The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hydrogen Economy</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—Before I commence my speech, I have sought leave from the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to table a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions and its attachment. I seek leave to table the document and have it incorporated in Hansard.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Is there any objection to leave being granted? There being no objection, leave is granted for the tabling of the document.
—Despite the public's faith in politicians having been damaged recently—again by claims of extravagant allowances, rorts, improprieties and cover-ups—the truth, which is rarely portrayed by a media hungry for scandal and disgrace, is that most of our politicians, from all sides of politics, are hardworking, honest public servants. They do not abuse the privileges which come with their position, nor do they set out to improperly profit from their positions. It is the exception, not the norm, when a politician is identified as a blatant abuser of parliamentary allowances or entitlements. Yet it does happen.
Rarely, but sometimes, a politician is identified as being corrupt, self-serving or grotesquely greedy. Not stupid or foolish or negligent or incompetent—adjectives aptly describing Reith, the Prime Minister's fallen star—but occasionally a politician is criminally, fraudulently and unjustifiably greedy. And when this is alleged, justice demands that this person be brought to answer before a court of law, just as we would expect any other citizen charged with a crime would be. There is a perception in the community that, while the Howard government has zero tolerance for welfare recipients who fill in their forms incorrectly and for workers who misuse company entitlements, at the same time politicians are not called to account for the criminal misuse of parliamentary entitlements, defrauding the Commonwealth and defrauding the taxpayer.
The decision to allow former Senator Mal Colston to avoid facing his day in court, however conscientiously made at the time, has become a major contributor to this perception and must be reviewed. The legacy of the last two years of Mal Colston's political career is a blight on the Australian political landscape. He was a man out to get all he could from the system, a man who turned political office into a family money-spinning business and who left politics under a cloud of anger, vitriol and disrepute, a man whose first action on leaving parliament was to write to the Remuneration Tribunal to ask for a free lunch. It was not enough that he and his wife had gold pass travel for the rest of their lives; when they were on a train, the cost of their trip covered by the taxpayer, they wanted a free lunch, too—and dinner and breakfast—at the taxpayer's expense, of course.
The Mal Colston travel rorts affair embroiled the Prime Minister in allegations of political double standards and vote buying, the Senate in allegations of contempt and political interference and the Australian political system in perceptions of snouts in the trough. When Mal Colston's final Senate term expired, he had been charged and indicted with 28 counts of fraud under section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth. Each count carried with it a maximum jail term of 10 years. The charges were laid after more than seven months of allegations, scandals, cover-ups, lies, claims and counterclaims. The charges against Colston related to 44 occasions from 1990 to 1996 where it was alleged that he had claimed up to $300 travel allowance a night for overnight stays in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney when, in fact, he was at his home base in Brisbane; and they related to allegations that he, breaching government directives, gave his frequent flier points to his two sons for around the world trips. It might be arguable as to whether the latter matter constitutes an offence—the issue of who is the owner of frequent flier points, and the entitlement of the government to give binding directions on that issue, has yet to be authoritatively determined—but the other allegations, if true, are simple examples of corruption. 
Colston has always claimed his innocence. At law he is entitled to that presumption. But he has never produced any evidence that is consistent with that claim, apart from a letter from a former staff member claiming that she was responsible for false travel allowance claims—a letter which she later revealed was a complete fabrication on the part of Colston. Seen in that light, it was also a contempt of parliament and an attempt to cover up a crime. Despite having many opportunities, Colston has never—not to this parliament when he was a member, not to the court during his committal hearing and not to the media to whom he has given interviews—said anything to suggest that he is anything other than what he was charged as: a fraudster who knowingly and wilfully exploited his position to benefit illegitimately at the expense of the Australian people.
Today, more than three years after he was charged with fraud, he has still not had to face trial. Unless the DPP or the Attorney-General change their minds, he never will. On 5 July 1999, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to proceed with his prosecution on the grounds that Colston was not fit to stand trial and that there was no likelihood that he would become fit to stand trial. The decision was made on the basis of independent medical reports, which the Attorney will not release to the public, and medical reports submitted to the DPP by Colston's lawyers. It is now apparent that the DPP's decision to discontinue was based on a mistake of fact.
There is no denying that Colston has cancer. By his own account, he has a very rare form of pancreatic cancer on which very little research has been done and about which very little is known. But by his doctor's 1998 and 1999 accounts, he should be well and truly dead and buried. But he is not. In fact, it appears that he has been surprisingly well and is mentally and physically active. He was not supposed to see the end of 1998, but he is set to see out the first year of the new millennium. Colston lives at home with his family in Chapel Hill, Brisbane, and it is reported that he is building a pool in his front yard. He has been seen in the audience of The New Price is Right and has also been seen dining out, shopping and visiting Canberra. Media reports tell us that he spends most of his time at home, reading the papers and watching TV, in the company of his family—from all accounts, a lifestyle that many hardworking Australians aspire to.
And he is far from being a mental couch potato. He is capable of writing letters to the Senate in response to speeches made by Senator Ray. He is capable of writing letters to the editor of the Courier-Mail warning against the reintroduction of television licences. He is capable of giving interviews to the Australian claiming that he wished he could have had his day in court so that he could have cleared his name. He is capable of travelling to Canberra to thank the staff of the Senate travel department for all their help over the years—the irony of it! He did not write or phone to thank them; no, he travelled here at taxpayer's expense. And he is capable of sitting in the audience of a television program aptly named The New Price is Right.  
If Mal Colston is capable of all these things, then he is capable of standing trial for serious and multiple fraud against the Commonwealth. If he is found guilty of the charges, his illness would be an important mitigating factor in sentencing. However, it should not be a barrier to justice being done. The interests of justice require that Colston be made to answer the charges against him. If, as he continues to maintain to all those who will listen, he is in fact innocent, he should be given the chance that he claims he seeks to have his name cleared. 
The Australian government, correctly, has felt no compunction about exploring the possibility of seeking a review of Spanish court decisions not to prosecute, decisions apparently made on the basis of mistakes of fact regarding Skase's health status. The Australian Director of Public Prosecutions has not dropped the charges against Skase. This correctly reflects the sentiment of the Australian community that people charged with such matters should not be allowed to get away with evading the courts on what appear to be spurious health grounds.
The Commonwealth's prosecution policy allows the Director of Public Prosecutions to reverse a decision not to proceed to trial in circumstances where the decision was affected by a mistake of fact, and it is in the interests of justice that the decision be reversed. I have today written to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Damian Bugg QC, enclosing a detailed submission as to why the Colston case should, consistent with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth, be recommenced. That is the document that was tabled at the commencement of this grievance debate. I commend to this House and to the government the opportunity to reflect on this matter. It is one which has done the Australian community a disservice in terms of the perception it has given the members of the public of the work of parliamentarians, and it is an issue which I believe needs to be revisited by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! Before I call the honourable member for Blair, at the outset, the honourable member for Denison asked for certain documents to be tabled and incorporated. The incorporation in Hansard will depend on whether they are inside or outside the guidelines set by the Presiding Officers.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,"<title>Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings</title>",Grievance Debate,10,1
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—On Thursday, prior to the interruption of this debate, I raised an issue regarding taxpayers called Absolute Homecare, who had applied to the replyin5 service, which was supposed to give a written ruling regarding various issues within five days of a taxpayer actually raising them. I noted at the time that these particular taxpayers had raised an issue with the ATO on 23 July 2000 and had still not had a reply three months later, even though they were supposed to have something in five days. Well, the taxpayers have had a win. I am pleased to report today that I have had notification that the Absolute Homecare people have received their ruling. Well done to the ATO for getting that prompt reply to the Absolute Homecare people!
On Thursday I also touched on the impact of the GST on the housing sector. But the GST is also impacting on the commercial property market. We now have confirmation that projects in Western Australia have been put on hold or seriously jeopardised because of the impact of the GST. This means jobs in construction have been lost and investment in regional Australia has also been lost, all because of the GST. Again, this impact comes about specifically because of the GST: these projects—major projects in Kalgoorlie, one in Busselton and another in Bunbury—are all on hold because of a specific ruling on the GST. The ruling is that, where investors buy individual apartments and then lease them to hotel operators to be used as commercial accommodation—that is, as hotel rooms—these units will be treated as residences rather than as commercial properties. This is the case even though the properties cannot be used as a residence, either under the agreement with the operator or under the zoning laws of the areas concerned. This means that the GST associated with the purchase is not available as a credit to the purchaser, hence threatening the viability of the developments. 
This anomalous result has arisen because of the law introduced here by the Treasurer. The Taxation Office has made rulings consistent with the law, and it is appropriate that this matter be raised now while we are looking at the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 second reading amendment. I would like to quote from a letter that I have received from the Kareelya property group, who are involved in these sorts of developments in Western Australia. I will be making some comments as I go. It says:
GST—Commercial Residential Premises
Application of GSTR 2000/20 to Strata Titled Hotels
The issue by the Australian Taxation Office (the “ATO”) of GST Ruling GSTR 2000/20, firstly as a draft ruling in April 2000 and then as a final binding public Ruling on 21 June 2000, has created unprecedented concern for the developers of purpose built strata titled tourist hotels and resorts across Australia, particularly those located in regional areas.
This Group, like many others, is affected by the Ruling and it is therefore appropriate for me to outline the detrimental effect the Ruling will have on tourism based investment and job creation in regional areas generally, and the particular effect it is having on at least 4 development projects this Group has under way in Busselton, Bunbury, Kalgoorlie and Geraldton.
Currently we have under development the following projects in regional Western Australia:
an 88 strata titled unit/bungalow resort style hotel in Busselton;
a 76 strata titled apartment, business traveller oriented, resort style hotel in Kalgoorlie;
a mixed hotel, residential and commercial development involving the construction of in excess of 120 hotel suites in Bunbury; and
a 40 unit serviced apartment and 100 room hotel development in Geraldton.
All up, these developments represent capital expenditure exceeding $130,000,000—
that is right, $130 million—
in regional Western Australia. The projects under way are being developed either wholly, or substantially, as managed investment schemes regulated under the Managed Investments Act 1998. In essence, investors are invited to acquire strata titled units/apartments in the developments and by doing so they acquire interests in the relevant managed investment. In these hotel developments, the owners lease their strata titled units to a Responsible Entity licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (in this case, Kareelya Investments Limited) who appoints a separate hotel operator to manage all the units in the particular development as a complete hotel. Under this type of arrangement, the Responsible Entity/Operator pools the income, shares the expenses and distributes the net income back to the owners in predetermined proportions.
There is a restriction on residence, which is very important. The letter says:
It is a common feature of these hotels that the owners cannot reside in their units because of State Planning Commission and local council zoning and town planning conditions imposed on the developments. The units must be used only for short stay accommodation. It is therefore clear that an owner cannot `reside' in his unit, within the normally accepted common usage and meaning of that word. 
In every case the strata units are currently, or will be, marketed as investment properties and every owner purchases one in the clear knowledge that he can never use it as a place of residence. In addition, investors purchase their units on the basis that they may enter into a lease with the Responsible Entity of the managed investment scheme for up to 8 terms of 10 years, so that all the units in the development can be operated as a complete hotel. An owner cannot unilaterally withdraw his unit from the hotel income-pooling scheme and operate the unit independently from the Responsible Entity. 
Concerning the structure of the investment, the letter states:
When purchasing a strata title unit in one of the developments, the owner benefits from the terms of the various contractual documents that govern the ownership of his unit and its participation in the income-pooling scheme. These documents usually include a Constitution and Compliance Plan for the Scheme, as well as a form of income-pooling agreement or profit share lease. These documents, particularly the income-pooling agreement or profit share lease clearly, set out the terms under which the owner leases his unit to the Responsible Entity/Operator and to determine, to some extent, whether the supply by the owner of his unit will be a taxable supply for GST purposes, rather than an input taxed supply.
They had GST advice before they proceeded and the letter says:
Based on proper professional advice, this Group took the view that the types of strata units offered for sale in the developments were clearly commercial residential premises. This is a view that was adopted by virtually all, if not all, other developers offering similar type products. As a result, the Scheme documents we had prepared for our Schemes on this basis and did not seek to rely on very specific provisions in the GST law that may have reinforced the fact that the owners would make a taxable supply when they leased their units to the Responsible Entity of the Scheme. 
The units were then sold on that basis. The letter continues:
The release of the GSTR 2000/20 has now created considerable uncertainty with regard to our developments and, no doubt, with regard to many other developments as well.  
In GSTR 2000/20 the ATO has ruled that the units acquired by investors in these types of developments will be regarded as `residential premises' and not `commercial residential premises' for GST purposes. As such, the owners will not be entitled to GST input tax credits for any GST included in their purchase price. This will have a significant effect on the marketability of this type of investment, particularly those located in the regional areas of WA in which this Group is operating. 
It is important to note that an owner of residential premises (such as a house) who rents his premises direct to a tenant is not required to pay GST on the rent he receives. Correspondingly, the tenant does not pay GST on the rent that he pays to occupy those premises. In this situation, it is appropriate that the owner is not entitled to GST input tax credits for the GST included in his costs, including the purchase price of the house. 
This should be contrasted with the situation of the owner of a strata titled unit in a hotel. In this situation, the tenant of the owner's unit, being a guest in the hotel, must pay GST in his room charge yet the owner cannot obtain input tax credits for the GST included in his costs. This gives rise to a situation where GST is borne by both the supplier (the owner) and the recipient (the guest), rather than only by the end consumer which should be the result and which is the whole foundation—
apparently—
 of the GST.
The problem is basically one of legislation. The legislation does not adequately cater for this situation. If the legislation is not amended quickly, then clearly it will lead to an anomalous situation. The letter continues:
On the one hand, a hotel owner who owns all the units in a strata title hotel will be entitled to input tax credits for the GST included in all his costs, thereby ensuring that all GST associated with the supply of accommodation is borne by the hotel guests. This should be contrasted with the situation in a hotel comprised of strata titled units owned individually by different owners where only some of the GST associated with the supply of accommodation will be borne by guests. This is because the owners will also bear some of the GST cost which relates to the GST included in their costs including the purchase price.
It is interesting to note that the practical application of the ATO's Ruling will mean that a development which comprises the construction of a residential premises (strata titled units) because the units will be sold to individual investors, changes to commercial residential premises when those units, without any change in character, ownership and use, are aggregated together and operated collectively as a hotel. This surely is not a result that was intended in the drafting of the GST legislation.
In relation to the legislative solution, the letter goes on:
While we believe that the problem may be overcome through the use of long-term leases, this is not the best solution because some uncertainty will still remain. This will still be so even if a private ruling is sought from the ATO on the effectiveness of the 50-year lease approach. The tourism property development industry requires far more certainty than is currently available if it is to continue to make investment, create jobs, bring new projects on stream and sell strata titled units in those projects to investors.  
What is really needed is a legislative solution through amendment to the GST law to bring within the scope of commercial residential premises, the type of strata titled units that are sold to investors on the basis that they will form part of a purpose built hotel, motel, inn, hostel or boarding house.
I am informed that the changes necessary to amend this legislation in this respect are very simple. Of course, they would have to be very simple in order for the government to understand them and even to comprehend them. Unfortunately, the government has refused to act. To return to the letter, Brett Jackson, the Director of Kareelya, states in his conclusion:
This group has been a strong supporter of investment and commitment to the development of hotels in regional Western Australia. This commitment has already led to many millions of dollars of investment, as well as the future investment involved with our current projects. It is unquestionable that this investment will create significant economic activity and job creation in regional Australia at a time when there are widespread calls for greater commitment to regional Australia. 
In the absence of any change to the Ruling, which appears unlikely, based on the subsequent privately rulings issued by the ATO, or legislative amendment, the detrimental effect on our industry will be significant. It is most likely that the ATO's Ruling, if maintained, and in the absence of a legislative amendment to make the position of individual strata title of hotel property owners unequivocal, will inhibit investment in tourist infrastructure in regional Australia.
I am informed that the group contacted people at the `highest level of government'. When they contacted the highest level of government, they were told, `Yes, we believe you have a case and we are quite happy to follow this up for you. We believe that an amendment should be made to the legislation.' We are yet to see it. As far as I can see, absolutely no action has been taken whatsoever. I am also informed that this group and others approached the ATO and discussed the matter with one of the assistant commissioners. The advice given was that they also believed that the ruling was unfair and was based on legislation that needed to be changed but that it was not up to the ATO to change the legislation; it is a responsibility of government. However, it is affecting this particular group. What are the coalition members doing for the people in regional Western Australia? Look at Bunbury and Busselton: obviously both of those developments should be of interest to the member for Forrest. I have not heard the member for Forrest say anything whatsoever in relation to this matter, nor have I seen him do anything for these particular developments. And then we have Geraldton, which is in the electorate of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, the member for O'Connor. I suppose it would be very hard for the minister to get off his logging truck, to do anything except bulldoze old-growth forests and to achieve something worth while for his local community, but it is high time he did. As an ex-Geraldton resident, I know that Geraldton needs a development of this sort, and it is high time the minister supported those people.
Then we move on to the development in Kalgoorlie. I am informed that the group did see the member for Kalgoorlie—I am not sure if they have seen the members for Forrest and O'Connor. The member for Kalgoorlie promised them in all sincerity that he would act on their behalf and deal with their issue. But, to my knowledge and certainly to their knowledge, the member for Kalgoorlie has done nothing. It is not like we are talking about a small issue that involves a small number of people—which I believe would be equally important. We are dealing here with projects in regional Western Australia worth a staggering $130 million. To date the government and the members representing the areas where those developments are occurring have done nothing. I call on the government to act now: amend this legislation and remove this burden from this vitally important sector of our business community.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 is an important piece of legislation because it goes to the heart of the credibility of the Treasurer's attack on roll-back. The Treasurer is critical of Labor because, four months after the introduction of the new tax system, Labor have not yet produced a detailed breakdown of what we mean by the term `roll-back'. My response to that would be: if the Treasurer were interested in the substance of the issue and the logic of our position, rather than delivering simply another rendition of a third-rate piece of parliamentary melodrama as if he were still debating in the Carey Baptist Grammar School debating society, he would recognise the following points. The first is that it would be fiscally irresponsible for us to provide detail on this measure until we have some sense of the likely full-year effect on revenues occasioned by the introduction of the GST and by the taxation changes brought about as a consequence of that tax.  
The second concerns the adequacy of the compensation package afforded to low and fixed income earners. There is continuing uncertainty as to the full-year inflationary impact of the changes which have been brought about as a result of the GST package. Government members have already seen in their various electorates the debacle of the pensioner savings bonus. As for the government's completely premature triumphalism about the first round of inflationary numbers post July, I think it will be very interesting indeed to see the full flow-through effect of the fuel price hike on the cost of goods and services and the impact of the end of cost absorption by the small business sector in particular, given an emerging body of anecdotal evidence that at the moment a lot of small businesses are engaging in a post GST competitive shakeout. That is, there are a whole lot of small businesses out there in Australia currently absorbing costs, existing on the basis of extended lines of bank credit, hoping that their competitors fall over before they do, before engaging in cost clawback against consumers. My view on this question is that it is something on which the Treasurer had best `watch this space' rather than triumphantly proclaim that the inflation genie has been well contained within the bottle, because that is premature enthusiasm indeed—more on this a little later.
A third reason, going to the logic of why Labor has yet to enunciate its detailed elements of roll-back, concerns the precise long-term impact of the compliance burden on small business occasioned by the introduction of this package. When we talk about the compliance burden, we are not talking about simple questions such as registering for an ABN. We are not just talking about BAS compliance. We are not just talking about monthly and quarterly instalments, nor are we just talking about the calculation of input tax credits for refund purposes. We are talking about the entire burden which small businesses face in terms of the time and money they spend in complying with the new arrangements which have been imposed on them by government. 
Let us take just one piece of commentary on thatthe piece in today's Financial Review by Jason Clout titled `Refund claims could spark audits':
The Tax Office has been auditing monthly BAS lodgers if they claim a substantial refund. This is despite its repeated stance of taking a lenient approach with the GST in its early days. 
The small business sector is concerned that a major tax crackdown is looming as the Federal Government struggles with a Budget cost blowout. 
A spokesman for the Tax Office confirmed it was contacting businesses which claimed large refunds. But he said the contacts were part of the ATO's checking procedures rather than a full-blown audit. 
`We are calling and in some cases visiting the business if they claim a large refund,' the spokesman said. 
The checking program was necessary because credit claims were a major fraud risk, he said. The Tax Commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, has said countries that introduce a GST-style tax often have to deal with inflated input tax credit claims. Large claims for sales tax refunds would also be scrutinised. 
The ATO spokesman declined to nominate the audit threshold, although some accountants believe a claim of $5,000 will trigger an audit. 
Ms Anna Carabao, tax partner at William Buck, said any business which claimed a large refund could `expect a knock on the door'.  
 `It's hard to even get the ATO to hand over a refund. One of our clients has waited for more than a month to get their money back,' she said. 
Mr Clout's report in today's Financial Review provides nothing but cold charity and scarce comfort for small businesses as they look at how the ATO is going to be administering their refund claims against the first round of BAS declarations.
But it does not stop there. We have heard in this parliament the Treasurer scoffing at our comment made often in this place that what in fact the government will face on the GST's implementation is a slow burn. What we have had in contrast is, I think, a comprehensively stupid observation from the Treasurer that the GST has been one undiluted implementation triumph. The skies have not fallen in but neither did Labor predict that the skies would fall in. What we have detected, however—and small business are shouting this from the rooftops—is that across small business and across the country at the moment we have emerging a massive hole in the roof. And who has belled the cat on this issue most recently? We heard the Treasurer in the parliament last week trumpeting a recent report by Morgan and Banks on just how wonderfully the government's package had gone down. Obviously the Treasurer did so prior to examining closely the Morgan and Banks job index poll which was published in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph. It is a document which is worthy of some quotation of itself. The article is titled `Profits Dive' and is on the front page of yesterday's Sunday Telegraph. It says:
Nearly 95 per cent of Australian businesses say the GST has hurt their profits. A poll to be released today of almost 6000 small, medium and large employers has found overwhelming dissatisfaction with the GST on the four-month anniversary of its introduction.
The poll, conducted by the Morgan & Banks Job Index, is the first comprehensive report card on the GST from a business perspective.
The Morgan & Banks survey found 94 per cent of businesses nationwide believed their profits had suffered.
`It's costing people money,' Morgan & Banks director Ian Burns confirmed. `A lot of companies spent an absolute bomb implementing it.' `There's also the ongoing cost of administration.'
The hardest hit industries, according to the survey of 5877 employers nationally, are the utilities, chemical and oil, education and engineering sectors.
The overwhelming majority of businesses surveyed indicated they had experienced a downturn in profitability because of the GST,' Mr Burns said.
And 94.4 per cent of businesses with more than 20 but fewer than 200 employees said they had been badly affected.
That is not the Australian Labor Party speaking; that is Australian business speaking. That is 6,000 Australian firms speaking, firms which have had to cope with the first quarter of the implementation impact of the GST package, as polled professionally through Morgan and Banks—Morgan and Banks being precisely the authority which the Treasurer quoted with gay abandon in this place last week as providing him with some sort of collateral underpinning for the overall implementation effect of the package.
TLAB8 goes to the heart of this compliance issue. When you look at its detail, TLAB8 is itself roll-back incorporated. The Treasurer daily seeks here to amuse—I think unsuccessfully—his backbench with our position on roll-back. Yet at the same time he rolls into this parliament, in this single piece of legislation, another 188 items of roll-back, adding to the 1,462 items of roll-back already rolled through the parliament since the passage of the principal ANTS bills—a grand total of how many? One thousand, six hundred and fifty roll-back items. On this question the Treasurer is the roll-back kid. He is the author of roll-back incorporated—a roll-back executed with all the coherence, system and intellectual rigour, I have to say, of a very large bowl of spaghetti. 
What is the method in the 1,650 amendments so far before the House? Where is the method in the madness? Where is the rigour in the overall Costello schema of roll-back? It is very hard to find, really. If there is a central organising principle it seems to me to be something along these lines: get in the door to the Treasurer's office quick smart, particularly if you are from an organised lobby group, or get to the `Costello for Prime Minister' group as quickly as possible and, whacko, Bob's your uncle. That seems to be the only coherent and consistent principle that I can detect in the various elements of roll-back that we have seen rolled through this chamber in the last several months. 
This, of course, opens up the broader question of what sort of Treasurer we are dealing with in this parliament. We have a Treasurer who lampoons roll-back when enunciated by Labor but who himself is roll-back incorporated. We have a Treasurer who lampoons a 72c dollar under Labor as some sort of national disgrace, but he thinks a 52c dollar under his stewardship as Treasurer just requires a little bit of market tweaking—the odd after-dinner speech in New York and Washington is designed to fix that up, squeezed in between the rigours of a Hudson River cruise with, it seems, a failed Republican candidate. We have a Treasurer who says that gross debt under Labor was a recipe for hauling in the IMF to fix up the economy. Yet, under the Liberals, where we have gross debt vastly in excess of that, under his watch as Treasurer, it is, from his perspective, just a bit of extra loose change. 
We have a Treasurer who solemnly tells us now that he has a solemn policy never to comment on the currency. But I seem to recall that this same Treasurer set off a medium-level currency crisis a couple of years ago—in a fit of hubris after meeting the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan—when he revealed to the media contents of what was supposed to be a confidential briefing from the chairman of the Fed. International currency markets now buckle their seatbelts every time our Pete goes to New York or to Washington, because if there is a major central bank near, and a major currency under discussion, who knows what the impact is going to be. Someone from New York said to me recently that whenever our Treasurer Costello goes to New York, the dealing rooms have a Costello alert, which rings so that appropriate hedging can be undertaken and no-one finds themselves short as a result of any unauthorised briefing which the Treasurer might provide to the media or others after any confidential meetings. 
We see all these elements of what the Treasurer has been up to—saying one thing and doing another—right across the breadth of economic policy, yet we are supposed to take this Treasurer seriously. What sort of Treasurer are we dealing with these days? What does he stand for? The Treasury portfolio would have to be, after the prime ministership, the most important portfolio across the whole of government. There have been doubts cast on this score for quite some time, going right back to the Treasurer's days as shadow Treasurer—back in those halcyon days when we had the dream team of Downer and Costello. Do we all remember that, or is it just a bad part of our collective memory?
—It was a nightmare.
—It was in fact, as my colleague the member for Lalor said, more than a dream; it was a nightmare. I would like to read from a report from the Sydney Morning Herald—five years old but, I think, worthy of some recount this evening—by Karen Maley. It is all about the Treasurer's performance prior to taking his position on the Treasury bench. Karen Maley writes:
Economics is not a difficult subject. It does not require the sustained intellectual effort needed for, say, Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus or Hegel's Phenomenology of the Mind. In terms of conceptual difficulty, it is child's play compared with particle physics or molecular biology. 
And, although some argue that the arguments employed in economics are implausible, no-one claims that they are incomprehensible. 
Why, then, has Peter Costello been so mediocre as shadow Treasurer?
The article goes on:
Nor can Costello argue that it's the fate of shadow treasurers to be dismissed. After all, his immediate predecessor in the job, Alexander Downer, won widespread acclaim for his performance ...
That is an interesting reflection on history. I seem to recall contemporaneously that it was probably right. It goes on:
... Costello appears to believe that economics is merely another, slightly more sophisticated, form of name-calling, and that the main challenge in being shadow Treasurer is to come up with fresh forms of abuse for the Government. 
This insightful article goes on:
The trouble with this behaviour is that few believe that Costello has actually taken the time to sit down and work out any solutions for our economic problems. His sole purpose is to bag the Government—
the Keating government—
and his interest in the subject seems to evaporate as soon as he has delivered his tightly-scripted lines in front of the television cameras. He's the meretricious actor ... Indeed, Costello has given absolutely no indication that he has any deep-seated beliefs on the subject. Behind the glib lines there is a worrying lack of sincerity. He's very much the barrister from central casting who, having flicked through his brief, puts in a polished performance, boots the other side, and collects his fee. But, he'd happily do the same for the other side if they were paying his fee.
I seem to recall his earlier time in Young Labor and where he went from there. As I said, that was written some five years ago but, I think, it has an uncanny resemblance to the performance we see on the other side of this chamber on the part of the Treasurer today. In fact, when we see the Treasurer perform on economic and tax policy questions today, we usually see two types of delivery. We see type A, which I would describe as pre-rehearsed derision, for those of us on this side, but then we see the type B performance, which I would describe as mock sincerity and concern—a type I do not think the parliament has really seen, at full throttle at least, since Andrew Peacock's really serious look—making us all want to ask: one day would the real Peter Costello stand up and tell us what he actually believes in?
When talking about leadership politics on the other side of this chamber, it is interesting to look at the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. When it comes to the minister for workplace relations, we might not like what he stands for on industrial relations—the destruction of organised labour—but at least we know that is what he stands for. When the Treasurer stands up and gives us a rendition of tax policy or economic policy in the broad, it is, frankly, very hard to pick exactly what constitutes his overall policy framework. In fact, five years on, the article to which I just referred seems to resonate and ring true.
The core of TLAB 8, which we have before the parliament now, goes to a number of Costello's individual roll-backs. It goes to an increased capacity to cancel GST registrations, changes in the manner in which tax debts are offset against GST refunds, an increased capacity to revoke monthly tax period elections, and many more such changes. Let us look at just a couple of those. 
One of my Neighbourhood Watch groups recently approached me with concern about how they had become inadvertently caught up in the GST-BAS cycle. They had mistakenly applied for GST registration at the time that they had applied for their ABN. As a result, this particular Neighbourhood Watch, which does a very fine job on the south side of Brisbane, was recently required to submit a BAS. Its income for the first quarter was the princely sum of $94. After taking into account what the Neighbourhood Watch had concluded as an input tax credit, they concluded, based on advice from a part-time accountant who had given them some assistance, that they may be liable for a GST of $7. Why is it that Neighbourhood Watch groups have found themselves caught up in this mad system of taxation in the first place? Surely they are voluntary and charitable organisations. When this Neighbourhood Watch group approached my office and we, in turn, approached the Australian Taxation Office for some clarification on this issue—namely, are Neighbourhood Watch groups ITECs, that is, income tax exempt charities—we were told that it was far from clear and that they would be seeking guidance on the question. 
So much for a rolled gold, beaut, no problems, no questions asked implementation period four months down the track, when your average local Neighbourhood Watch, who do a fine job right across this country, cannot get clear guidance from their local tax office as to whether they are a tax exempt or a non-tax exempt charitable body. I would say to the Treasurer: if there is still doubt four months down the track about where Neighbourhood Watch groups stand, what hope have we for the rest of the system, particularly as it applies to small business? 
So much for the inadvertent registration for the GST! What about business activity statements—the world's simplest 148-page quarterly tax return? It all comes to a head on 11 November, Remembrance Day, when the first quarterly BAS is due. I predict that the small business sector will indeed be remembering the Howard government on 11 November. But I doubt that their remembrance will be of a particularly fond nature. The commentators on this question have been unified in their condemnation of the implementation by the tax office. There is commentary by Allesandra Fabro in the Financial Review. We have commentary from Kate Marshall, also in the Financial Review, and from Kathy Lipari from the Daily Telegraph. We also have a recent article by Christopher Jay, again from the Financial Review. Most recently, we have articles from Fiona Buffini and again Allesandra Fabro, all pointing to the enormous difficulties that small businesses face with the BAS system, and the management of refunds in particular.
What the Treasurer has forgotten in all of this is his responsibility as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia to properly administer the tax system. It is not just coming up with new policy; it is ensuring that the implementation of that policy is manageable through the tax office and through the accountancy profession for those who depend on that advice to make their businesses tick for the benefit of this country.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—In the minutes remaining before the dinner suspension, I will commence my remarks on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000. Those who observe this House routinely—hopefully, that is not too many in some senses—will know that, during question time, the Treasurer has a little party trick that he likes to use: he comes in and very theatrically rolls his `Rs' when talking about Labor's pledge to roll back the GST. It is very endearing in some senses.
—He is an endearing ham!
—He is an endearing ham. One wonders whether he has an Actors Equity card; although, I think they would probably have a quality control standard that would keep him out. Perhaps he still has his barrister's card and he got his skills in practice. One wonders why he bothers with all of this theatrical carry-on. I do not actually see too many members of his backbench laughing, and we have heard it so many times we are not laughing anymore. You wonder why someone would come in and so theatrically and so deliberately oppose a plan, which will be put forward by the Labor Party, to make the GST fairer and simpler. What could be wrong with that? Why would you come in and carry on in that fashion when you are up to your eyes yourself in roll-back? This Treasurer is constantly engaged in rolling back the GST, and this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 is just the most recent example of roll-back according to the Treasurer.
The bill contains 188 amendments, and seven more were circulated in the chamber last time we sat. That brings it to a grand total of more than 1,650 amendments to the GST. So the number just keeps on growing and sooner or later, no doubt, will crack the 2,000 figure. So, if the Treasurer wants to ridicule roll-back during question time, it is about time he woke up and realised that the joke is on him. Just so that people understand the nature of the roll-back with which we are dealing, I will briefly go to some of the details of this bill. I will not do it at too great a length because we would not want everybody to fall asleep. But you need to understand the mind-numbing complexity that this roll-back, induced by the Treasurer, is getting us into with our tax system. Schedule 1 deals with matters like changing input tax credits; changing the provisions that relate to child care; making the treatment of travel agents' fees for arranging overseas supplies such as accommodation, transport, car hire, sightseeing and what-have-you GST free; providing that a supply of a freehold interest or long-term lease made after a short-term lease is also GST free; providing that the sale of residential premises that have been used as residential premises for at least five years will be input taxed; and changing arrangements in relation to machines that take coins. 
But that is not all. We have schedule 2, which deals with such matters as ensuring that re-imported breeding livestock is subject to GST only on the increasing value. Schedule 3 deals with various FBT tax matters. Schedule 4 deals with adjustments and, significantly, schedule 5 deals with a very clear error that was made at the outset of this legislation which prevents an entity that had registered for the GST being able to cancel that GST registration if it was inappropriate. Currently, such an entity is stuck with being registered, and with all the onerous compliance burden that goes with that, for 12 months. So that very manifest problem is being rectified by this bill. So you can see from that very quick tour of the provisions of this bill that it is, once again, layer of complexity upon layer of complexity and that, of course, is the essence of the GST roll-back according to this Treasurer and this government. It is not making the system fairer and simpler; if anything, it is making it more opaque.
Of course, we know as we move around our electorates how business is reacting to this tax system—how it is reacting to its complexities, its amendments, its more bits of paper and its increased changes. We have had the Morgan and Banks survey, which has already been referred to today. But the details of that are truly extraordinary: that you can have, when you survey almost 6,000 employers in a survey form that has been viewed as very reliable over the years, so many of them come up and say they really believe that the GST has impacted negatively on their organisation's profitability. The Morgan and Banks survey shows us that a whopping 94.1 per cent of businesses fervently believe that—`fervently' being their term, not mine. Of course, there are some differences in the various sectors, but even the sectors that are least affected are in the order of 84.3 per cent for services, 88.6 per cent for resources and 89 per cent for non-profit organisations. So bad is this survey that figures like that are viewed as a good result.
When you have in the upper ranges above 80 per cent of businesses in any sector telling you that the GST will negatively impact upon their profitability, I do not think that it can be viewed by anyone as a good result. What it is showing us is that business in this country is really struggling and is fearful of this tax system. The survey goes on to tell us that 12.3 per cent of Australian employers have indicated that their first GST payment to the government, which is due on 11 November, will cause cash flow problems. That has to be a real worry too. When we look through the detail of that, we can see that more than one-fifth of those in retail, more than one-fifth of those in tourism and more than one-fifth of construction and property firms are saying that they will have a cash flow problem caused by the GST. One wonders, when that cash flow problem strikes, precisely what impact we are going to see on employment and on business bankruptcies. One can only presume from this survey that we will see a very negative impact on employment and on business profitability. So I do not think that theatrical gestures and a little question time play can really give anybody any reassurance about what is going to happen as we pass the 11 November deadline and businesses start for the first time to really struggle with the implementation of this GST. 
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—Before the suspension for dinner I had referred to the Morgan and Banks survey of small business attitudes in relation to the GST. That is not the only indicator we have of small business attitudes. The Victorian Parliament's Economic Development Committee has inquired into the issue of GST compliance. It found that Victorian small businesses are struggling to stay afloat as GST compliance costs balloon to more than $1.2 billion—that is its figure—and it put this down to a crippling cocktail of higher electricity, fuel and gas prices pushed up by the new tax. The committee said that this had already triggered a spate of closures of businesses in regional areas. The Herald Sun quotes from the committee's report:
GST can be seen as a contributing factor in accelerating the closure of some small businesses. 
The Herald Sun reported that the committee:
... found businesses faced a compliance nightmare with setting-up costs of $5,000 to $20,000, and administration costs expected to soar to $5,000 a year. 
The committee concluded that cash based businesses suffer the most, struggling to fund more sophisticated accounting systems. The committee also found that the GST was a threat to small business's competitive edge because larger companies found it easier to absorb the administration costs. And to give a lie to one of the government's claims about the GST and the new tax package that it would deal with the black economy question, this parliamentary committee found that the cash economy was tipped to flourish as service industry businesses dodged the system. The first report by Morgan and Banks and this second report by a Victorian parliamentary committee both tell us what we clearly know as we move around our electorates: business in general—and small business in particular—is desperately concerned about the compliance issues in relation to the GST, desperately concerned about the effect on profitability and desperately concerned about the cash flow problem as they come up to the first trigger date of 11 November. 
The reporting on this issue goes on and on. The Business Review Weekly has dealt with this matter in an article headed `Small business chokes on the big GST lie'. The article concludes—and I think this puts the point very clearly:
In 1996 small business owners were excited by Howard's promise to cut their paperwork. Four years later, they are disillusioned and angry about their increased administrative burden. They realise that a politician lied to them. Now there is a surprise.
The article says that small business is now dealing with a compliance burden that it has never had to bear before. The burden is termed as follows:
Instead of filling out one tax return a year, businesses are collecting paperwork for five returns—four business activity statements and their annual income tax return. Their role as a tax collector has expanded significantly. Not only are they required to collect GST and send it to the Australian Taxation Office, they must also police the system, sending 48.5 per cent of any invoice to the tax office if the correct procedures are not followed.
Those words capture exactly what is being said to us by small business. They are stumped by the business activity statement, they are worried about complying with it and they are worried about bearing that burden month after month, or quarter after quarter, as the GST rolls on.
We can now see in relation to the GST that the claims used to sell it to the Australian electorate were completely untrue. In particular, the claim made by the Treasurer, by the Prime Minister and by the government in general that the GST would be good for Australia can now be seen very clearly to be a lie. We know from voting patterns at the last general election that there were a number of Australians who actually acknowledged themselves that they would be worse off because of the GST but that they were prepared to accept the package because they thought it would be good for Australia. Now I think it is perfectly clear to say, as small businesses crumple under the paperwork burden and businesses generally live in fear of the consequences for profitability that this tax system imposes, that this tax system is bad for business. We can also say that, if it is bad for business, it has got to be bad for Australia because it is bad for the engine room that is generating jobs and wealth. I think that is a fairly simple proposition and one this government should understand.
Moving from the administrative complexity of the GST, the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 is expressed in very simple terms. It says:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House, noting the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households, calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001”.
When we deal with this amendment, I will be very interested to hear some of the government members opposite justify why they would not support such a second reading amendment. We all know that the Prime Minister promised that the GST would not increase the price of petrol, but we all know that it has. We know that the government is intending to worsen the situation by allowing the GST inflation spike to feed into the February indexation adjustment. This is a serious issue, and let me explain it in relation to an electorate like mine. My electorate is outer suburban. It is a growth corridor where infrastructure provision lacks behind population growth. This has been particularly true in relation to transport infrastructure during the period of the Kennett government with its agenda of privatisation of public transport.  
The sort of transport provided in the most outer suburban section of my electorate—the city of Wyndham—is truly poor. The city is geographically large. It covers 542 square kilometres and takes in some rural and agricultural areas. It is 30 kilometres away from the Melbourne GPO by road. It has one railway line and two stations. The stations are four kilometres apart. In 1996, the population—given this is a growth corridor, clearly these are old figures—per station was 38,100. So there is a very heavy demand on the railway line. When you get there you find that trains operate at 20-minute intervals during peak hour and at 40-minute intervals at other times. You can only get to the railway line by public transport—by bus. Those bus services were tendered out to the private sector by the former state government.
When we look at the details of those services we find very limited hours of operation. Services offered to residents commence between 5.50 a.m. and 6.25 a.m. on weekdays and finish by 7.46 p.m. Weekend services are fewer and hours are even further limited, commencing between 7.40 a.m. and 7.56 a.m. and finishing by 6.48 p.m. You can see from that pattern that, for a growing population, there is a very infrequent service which does not work at all outside daylight hours and works very infrequently on weekends. That is all a very long way of saying that the people in my electorate—the people who live in the city of Wyndham—have absolutely no alternative, if they want to get from place A to place B, but to get in the car. The price of petrol is not some academic issue for them. It is not a case of weighing up whether they are going to get into the car or jump on the nearest form of public transport, because there is not a nearest form of public transport. In a situation such as this, the government's failure to honour its promises in relation to petrol prices cuts in very sharply, and government members need to understand that. Government members are feeling some heat about this in their electorates. We know that the member for McEwen, the member for Makin and the member for Hume have come to parliament and have raised within the government ranks the question of petrol prices and, of course, they have been slapped down. It will be very interesting to see how they deal with the opposition's second reading amendment. If they were as good as their word and as good as the propaganda that they put out in their electorates, they would be voting for this second reading amendment.
On the question of petrol prices, I would like briefly to address the circumstances of the electors of Corangamite, which is a seat a little further down from mine. It is actually on the other side of the member for Corio's seat. We all share the same road, so we have something in common. Regarding petrol prices, the member for Corangamite said in this place on 27 June, when speaking in a discussion of a matter of public importance:
Let me put it to you quite clearly and categorically that those small business men and women and big businesses around Australia will in fact pay reduced costs for their fuel, petrol and diesel from Saturday, 1 July and thereon in. This is the biggest price reduction in fuel that any government has ever undertaken.
A little later he said:
So the motorists and the consumers in Australia are enjoying a cost reduction no matter which way you look at it.
I wonder whether the member for Corangamite wants to go out amongst his constituents, when he returns to them when parliament rises at the end of the week, stand in any of the main centres of his electorate and repeat those words. I wonder whether he wants to tell the passers-by that they are enjoying the biggest price reduction in fuel that any government has undertaken. Something tells me that he will not be repeating those words in his constituency because we all know those words are not right. The price of fuel has not fallen under the GST regime. The price of fuel has gone up. It is about time the constituents of Corangamite understood that this is the kind of thing that is said in this House when back in the electorate, as people move between their homes and work, their homes and school, their homes and the shopping centre, the simple reality of increased fuel prices that they experience every day is apparently denied by their federal member. The member for Corangamite needs to explain to his electors how he could possibly have made this statement. If he was mistaken then and now understands that he was mistaken then, that this is no longer a statement of truth—though how one could ever have believed it to be a statement of truth is another question, but today it is certainly no longer a statement of truth—he has to get honest with his electors and tell them what he is going to do about fuel prices. He could start by being prepared to come in here and vote for Labor's second reading amendment. If he does not do that, I think his constituents will know that his position on petrol prices is not an honest or a transparent one. They will be well aware by the end of this week that his position on petrol prices is not one that is meeting their needs. 
I invite the member for Corangamite, the member for Makin, the member for Hume, the member for McEwen and other members opposite who have talked about petrol prices to come in and vote for the second reading amendment. If that is unsuccessful, they should put some pressure on so that the government does what it should do, and that is immediately make a 2c difference in the price of petrol. It could do that by honouring the Prime Minister's election promise or it could do it by eliminating the GST inflation spike from the February indexation adjustment. It is not that hard. You keep your word or you at least stop the worst of the flow-on consequences. Clearly, the bill before the House adds complexity in relation to the GST, it deals with the Treasurer's roll-back of the GST, but it does not address any of the real problems. It does not address the problem with petrol, it does not address the problem with small business compliance and it does not address the issues that are worrying electors in electorates like mine, in electorates like Corio and certainly in electorates like Corangamite.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000, which we are debating tonight, continues the process of the Treasurer's roll-back of his own GST in what I believe history will judge to be one of the most flawed policy developments, as far as economic policy is concerned, that this country has ever seen. The bill before the House effectively contributes to a roll-back of the original GST legislation. These are significant amendments in terms of the key administrative issues that are addressed. Already in this debate the shadow Treasurer has indicated that the opposition will be supporting the amendments.
The government has described these amendments as `minor' and `technical', but they are certainly very important to small businesses already having difficulty with the implementation of the GST. There are three major issues addressed in this piece of legislation. Firstly, it allows for increased flexibility to cancel GST registrations; secondly, it proposes changes to the way debts are offset against business activity statements; and, thirdly, it provides increased flexibility to revoke monthly tax period elections. These are indeed important amendments that continue the correction of anomalies, unintended consequences, penalties and the sheer incompetencies of the legislation the government claimed would reduce compliance costs to small business and would be much simpler for them to administer.
The impact of the GST on Australian small business has been profound, but the Treasurer seems to be oblivious to the real harm that is being inflicted on those small businesses as they go about earning a living and providing employment for many Australians. The Treasurer's arrogance is really hurting the spirit of Australian small business, and they are really angry. Day after day, the Treasurer gets up in this House like a grinning hyena, telling us all how good the GST is. But out in the field, out in the day-to-day struggle to earn a living, Australian small businesses are bleeding, and they are bleeding as a result of the GST. 
Only today I had a call from a business in my electorate, which I first became acquainted with in one of my electorate visits in Corio. The proprietor of a small business employing some 10 people on a full-time basis, and his partner, had come to see me and expressed their concerns about the difficulty they were having and they could foresee they would have in dealing with the government's GST. I have to say they did not articulate a political preference for one party or the other. This was a cry from a small business that was really staggering under the burden of the GST. This company employs 10 people, drivers of one-tonne vans up to eight-tonne trucks. The company had a historical arrangement with its fuel distributor where it would pay on a one-monthly up to two-monthly basis for its fuel bills. There was good reason for this, because the company had to hold out over that period to receive payment from its customers before it could on-pay the distributor. The distributor rang the company in the previous week and indicated that he wanted payment in 21 days. The historical arrangement that existed between this small freight company and the fuel distributor had been upset as a direct result of the introduction of the GST. When the proprietors talked to the distributor about why this was so, they were told that the fuel companies were demanding COD from the distributors for their petrol. 
The simple facts are that no business can really operate on that 21-day turnaround period, let alone in the transport and fuel industry. The advice that the small company received from the distributor was that it should go to their bank and get an overdraft to cover the situation. It had already been to their bankers to canvass possibilities on the introduction of the GST because it was fearful of its cash flow position, but it was told by its bankers that they would not cover the situation because the company did not have a high enough level of profit. As we know, small businesses work on turnovers and many of them do not earn large profits, but they do earn a living for their proprietors and those who work for them.
That was not the only situation that was faced by this small company. They were having problems with the business activity statement. The problem that they have had with the business activity statement was simply that the information that has been provided by the government in booklet form does not provide answers to the sorts of questions people out on the ground are asking about the implementation of the GST. They had to visit their accountant, who was also tearing his hair out at the impact the GST was having on his clients. This small business had a pay-as-you-go arrangement; they chose an arrangement to make PAYE each month. They did not opt for a quarterly payment. But they were advised by the Australian Taxation Office that it did not want this arrangement because its computer could not handle the situation. This small company are asking the question about the $400 million or so that was spent on informing small business about the GST and its implementation, and they are perplexed as to why, when they choose a particular option that they believe is in their interest in assisting them to manage their affairs, they are advised by the ATO that it is not an arrangement that is satisfactory to it because its computers cannot take it.
There are three smaller businesses that are largely dependent on this particular business. They are owner-operators in the transport field. Their assessment is that one of those proprietors is thinking very seriously of folding the tent. This small business in my electorate of Corio is asking the question about where it goes to from here under the arrangements that are being imposed by fuel companies and their distributor. It fears very much for the futures of the 10 employees who, until the implementation of the GST, felt some degree of security in the growth of this small company. The proprietors of this company want me to pass this on to the Treasurer, because the Treasurer gets up here like a grinning hyena and says that this GST is easy to comply with. In his arrogance, he says, `Well, the administrative burden is much simpler.' This small business has this message for the Treasurer: `You might have a very simple business activity statement, but for most small businesses the number of hours that go into the preparation of that statement far outweigh any claimed advantage.' This small business is putting in eight hours of background work just to fill out the simple statement. The problem is that out there in small business today everyone wants seven-day accounts. That is a direct result of the GST. If you are in business, you understand that it is not a situation that can be practically realised in the day-to-day activities and relationships of most small businesses.  
On Saturday I was at the Colac show in the Corangamite electorate. I have a few things to say about the statement on fuel of the honourable member for Corangamite. I was sought out by an organic fertiliser business that is based in Geelong. This is a small business that earns a steady income for the proprietor. The proprietor relayed to me his concerns about the impact of the GST on his business and the other businesses that he deals with. In discussions with his accountant, his accountant made known to him his concerns, with the statement that many small businesses simply will not make it to Christmas. 
I had a call from another angry small business person from Beech Forest, a small town in the Corangamite electorate where jobs are hard to come by. The proprietor employed several full-time people, and, when demand permitted, some part-time employees, providing much needed employment in that local area. Already that business has folded its tent as a direct result of the GST. The Treasurer gets up here talking about the great employment impact of this great taxation reform, yet out on the ground in regional areas small businesses are bleeding and folding. I had another call from a small business proprietor from Port Campbell, the proprietor of another microbusiness, that provided employment for the proprietor and a couple of part-time people as demand permitted. It was the same story. The business has gone out of business as a result of the GST. 
It was very interesting while I was at the Colac show on Saturday in the electorate of Corangamite that many people came up to me to express their concerns about the impact of fuel prices and the impact of the GST. The issue of fuel is relevant to the second reading amendment to this legislation that we will be moving. I remind the honourable member for Corangamite about his words on the impact of fuel on regional businesses and farmers. This is what the honourable member for Corangamite said to his electors on the floor of this parliament:
Let me put it to you quite clearly and categorically that those small business men and women and big businesses around Australia will in fact pay reduced costs for their fuel, petrol and diesel from Saturday, 1 July and thereon in. This is the biggest price reduction in fuel that any government has ever undertaken.
I find this an extraordinary claim by the honourable member for Corangamite. In the short time I was at the Colac show, in his electorate, we took 500 signatures on a fuel petition. I would have to say that the Colac show society did not exactly put us in a strategic position to be collecting signatures on a fuel petition, but 500 signatures were received. I do not want to dishearten the honourable member for Corangamite in his remaining days in this parliament, but some of the things his constituents had to say about this government give me grave fears for the honourable member's re-election prospects. Indeed, it is going to be the pleasure of the Labor Party to take the so-called jewel in the Liberal crown, the seat of Corangamite. You need to pour a lot of money into it, my good friend, because we are coming after you. Let me tell you your electors are lying in the grass with baseball bats. There is f-u-e-l written all over it and p-e-t-r-o-l. You told them that your GST would lower the price of their fuel.
The Automobile Association of Australia, the National Farmers Federation of Australia and many other consumer groups have indicated publicly that the government is ripping off over $1 billion in extra revenue from the GST. Indeed, as a result of the GST, once you take out the impact of higher import fuel prices, there is a discrete impact of the GST on petrol prices in rural areas. That is a fact. You have your hand deep into the pockets of the electors of Corangamite. Indeed, you have your hand deep into the pockets of farmers all over this country.  
In the short time available to me, let me indicate what farming organisations around this country think of the government's current position on fuel. The South Australian Farmers Federation in a media release on Tuesday, 3 October had this to say: 
SAFF President, Dale Perkins, said that it is time the Federal Government stopped hiding behind the world oil price and finally did something positive about regulating the price of fuel in Australia.
He went on to say:
It may be a struggle for the Government to do anything that affects the world price, but they can do something that affects the level of taxation on fuel.
He went on to say further that the government was already raising more revenue than budgeted for from the high fuel price and that it would be disappointing for that take to increase again through the jump in CPI caused by the GST. That is a call reiterated by the National Farmers Federation, which on 3 October launched a campaign to convince the federal government to freeze the excise on fuel. The National Farmers Federation had this to say:
The Government will claim it needs the revenue. I have got to say here that the government has already indicated it has blown the extra billion dollars it has raised through these measures. But the fact is the Government will be getting a windfall in excise revenue, just from the additional GST on the higher petrol prices, which amounts to almost $72 million. We all know that that is probably a very low estimate of the windfall from that particular measure. 
In the Weekly Times on 19 August, under a headline `Farmers claim diesel fuel “rip-off”', the article had this to say:
“The Federal Government's backflip on farm diesel rebates has cut $25 million in off-road rebates to the nation's farmers,” VFF treasurer Geoff Crick told the annual conference. “This is far from what the government indicated would happen as a result of the GST,” Mr Crick said. Benalla farmer Laurie Horne said farmers had been let down. “The cornerstone of the VFF's support for the GST was a reduction in fuel prices. We are being ripped off by government,” he said.
Yes, they are. Time does not allow me to really outline the National Party's complicity in this Liberal Party rip-off by the city lawyers—the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the recent rorter, the honourable member for Flinders. But let me say this to honourable members opposite: you cannot come into this place and say one thing and then go into your electorates and say another. You have betrayed rural Australia.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-11-06,"—It will not come as a surprise to the House and honourable members to hear that the government is not prepared to support the pious amendment to the motion for the second reading of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This government has successfully implemented what is probably the largest structural change to the Australian economy since the Second World War. No longer is our economy being held back by an outdated and inefficient tax system. To say that Australian households have felt a serious impact under the new tax system is a complete fallacy. Households are benefiting from income tax cuts worth $12 billion annually and increased family assistance of $2.4 billion annually. 
I know that the opposition were considerably disappointed with the recent results of the September quarter consumer price index. They would have been as devastated as the Australian Council of Trade Unions was by the result. The index showed that the effect of the new tax system was actually lower than was forecast by the government. This means that the government's income tax cuts and increases in family allowances have actually resulted in families receiving more generous benefits than even the government had forecast. The opposition deny these clear facts and clearly in this matter, as in so many others, they are totally out of touch with reality.
—What about petrol?
—I will come to that. The opposition suggest that the government remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001. That is a fascinating proposition, because when the Labor Party were in government not once did they advocate a freeze in indexation on petrol. They are absolute hypocrites. Indeed, indexation was introduced by the Hawke Labor government in 1983. 
—Get your facts right.
—The member opposite really ought to take notice of history. It is a longstanding practice that governments have maintained indexation when making policy changes that impact on the consumer price index. For example, indexation was maintained when Labor's wholesale sales tax rates were increased in the 1993-94 budget. From 1983 to 1996, the Labor Party increased the rate of excise of unleaded petrol by over 28c per litre, and around half of this increase was attributable to indexation. The assertion that the government will receive a windfall gain from indexation is misleading. There is a much larger increase in government payments linked to the CPI. For every dollar gained through indexation of excisable products like petrol, the government increases by over $2 outlays linked to the CPI. These outlays include pensions, Newstart allowance, parenting payments and rent assistance. Are the opposition seriously suggesting that we should cut pensions?
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission did not find that the GST increased petrol prices. On the contrary, it found that, when the tax changes came in between 30 June and 1 July this year, petrol prices actually fell. That is right: in the major metropolitan areas, petrol prices actually fell  with the introduction of the new tax system. The government reduced excise and introduced the GST and still the petrol prices fell. Labor may want to deny it but the cause of the high price of petrol today is the huge price increase in world crude. Any change in the indexation arrangements would be completely irresponsible. Indeed, the Labor Party's favourite Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Tony Blair, has said that blowing his budget to cut fuel prices would result in his being able to do nothing for pensioners and it could place upward pressure on interest rates. The opposition is suggesting a change that would hit pensioners and place upward pressure on interest rates. Quite frankly, the government does not apologise for not supporting such a slug on all Australians.
I now wish to address some of the claims made by the opposition in the course of this debate. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Assistant Treasurer both foreshadowed an amendment to the bill to allow businesses to deregister from the GST, effective 1 July 2000. This government will not be supporting this change—
—Why not?
—as it will increase complexity for business—and you should listen, my friend. I will have more to say on this during debate on the amendment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggested that the business activity statement refunds would not be paid to businesses in some circumstances, despite the measure that the government has introduced in this bill. This is simply not the case. The Commissioner of Taxation will now have the discretion to be able to refund a net business activity statement credit rather than apply it to another tax debt that is due and not yet payable. This means that, apart from when there is a business activity statement debit to be offset, the commissioner will be able to refund a business activity statement credit. Businesses will not have money withheld to cover other tax debts that are not yet payable.
—You mean give them back their own money? It's their own money. That's decent of you.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought not bleat. He and others opposite also claim that the business activity statement is complex and that businesses will not be able to submit on time. The government is committed to a continuing program of assistance for those required to complete business activity statements. This assistance is being provided by both the Australian Taxation Office and the GST Start-Up Assistance Office. Over 4,000 workshops, as well as field advisory visits and signpost offices, are being made available to assist businesses in completing a business activity statement. In addition, we are currently in Business Activity Statement Help Week, which will run until November in over 200 locations. 
—What about the e-record? What about the e-record?
—Order! If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wishes to contribute to subsequent debate, he may wait for his turn.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—During this week the tax office is offering free practical advice and assistance to smaller businesses who are trying to fill in their first business activity statement but still have questions that need to be answered. There are 50,000 places available by appointment. The tax office has already announced concessional business activity statement lodgment and payment dates which have extended the due date for the first quarter from 21 October 2000 to 11 November 2000. Also, businesses will not be subject to any late lodgment penalties where they have made a genuine attempt to comply.
—Oh, yes!
—We will not victimise businesses the way the Labor Party wants to. Businesses will be given the benefit of any doubt. In addition, the tax office has advised tax agents that no general interest charge or late lodgment penalty will apply to clients of agents who lodge by 30 November, as long as the agents lodge in the vicinity of 50 per cent of their activity statements by 11 November. In terms of reporting GST on the business activity statement, businesses can choose one of two methods: the GST calculation sheet method and the GST derived from accounts options. The accounts method may be an easier and quicker alternative for those businesses who separately record the GST amounts for supplies and acquisitions they make. These businesses do not need to complete all of the calculation boxes on the business activity statement.
Already over 213,000 businesses have lodged their first quarterly BAS. But the opposition says that, despite all of this, the National Tax and Accountants Association still thinks that businesses will struggle with the BAS. Ray Regan of the National Tax and Accountants Association has been a persistent critic of the government's tax reform plans. He has constantly made negative statements against the government and Australia's new tax system voted for by the Australian electorate in the October 1998 election. These have been part of a dedicated campaign of scaremongering amongst the business community and they are absolutely disgraceful. For the opposition to use his statements as being indicative of the concerns of the business community is both misleading and dishonest. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also criticised the tax office for its e-record software. Thousands of businesses have been using e-record without any problems at all. Only a handful of businesses have problems and these were caused by their use of an old version of a virus detection software package that incorrectly reported a problem in e-record.
The shadow minister for small business attacked the wine equalisation tax and its effect on the wine industry. The government introduced the WET to replace the difference between Labor's old wholesale sales tax rate on wine and the GST. It is designed to ensure that the price of a four-litre cask of wine need increase by only 1.9 per cent. Both the wine equalisation tax and the GST do not apply to exports of wines, and exporters have the benefit of the removal of the embedded taxes built into the price of exports. For the opposition to say that the wine industry is adversely affected is absolutely ludicrous, and it ought to be ashamed of itself. There is also a cellar door rebate which effectively removes the wine equalisation tax from the sales of small wineries. This places wineries in a much better position than they were in under the wholesale sales tax system presided over by Labor. The shadow minister also quotes from a survey about the impact of the GST on business. Is this an independent, reliable survey? It is a survey conducted by the shadow minister himself—could you believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker? We all know the opposition's record on surveys. We have come across the Lindsay Tanner price survey, haven't we? Which would you trust—the Yellow Pages small business survey or the Joel Fitzgibbon Labor Party survey? The people of Australia would certainly know the answer to that. 
The honourable member for Grayndler argued that under the bill people living on boats moored at marinas will be slugged a 5½ per cent GST on their rents. The fact is that these people are currently subject to the full 10 per cent GST and this bill ensures that they may be provided with the same concession rate as residents of caravans parks. Of course, the honourable member for Grayndler then continued his long-running campaign of misrepresentation against the goods and services tax and caravan park residents. The government has ensured that long-term residents of caravan parks and other forms of commercial accommodation are treated fairly compared with the residents of other forms of rental accommodation.
Under the GST legislation, residents of long-term commercial accommodation may be either input taxed, meaning that they are not charged GST, or they may be charged the 5½ per cent concessional rate of GST. That is designed to result in the lowest possible rent increase to residents. Independent modelling by Econtech shows that, in the long term, the concessional rate of GST is actually better for residents than the input taxing option. In the short term, both options produce similar price changes. So for the honourable member for Grayndler to say that caravan park residents are worse off under the goods and services tax is a complete nonsense. 
—They are: another broken promise.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to apologise to the House for making such an outrageous accusation. In addition, the member for Grayndler claims that the $33 million increase in rent assistance from the government is worthless. The maximum rate of rental assistance has been increased by 10 per cent. This extra assistance will provide an additional buffer for all low income earners regardless of what type of accommodation they live in. People who do not pay enough rent to get the maximum rent assistance will generally receive an increase in rent assistance equal to 75 per cent of any increase in their rent. The honourable member for the Northern Territory criticised the pay-as-you-go arrangements applying to remote indigenous artists. Until July 2001, indigenous artists carrying on an enterprise will not need to quote an Australian business number. This recognises the particular issues faced by indigenous Australians living in remote areas becoming part of our new tax system. The tax office will develop further information and education programs for these artists in partnership with the indigenous art representative bodies.
The honourable member for Swan criticised the tax office's replyin5 initiative. With the implementation of the new tax system, the tax office has predictably received a large number of queries. Many of these, however, were from tax professionals with complex queries. These queries were never intended to be answered as part of the replyin5 service. Therefore, the tax office set up a tax professionals liaison group to provide advice—
—I see.
—I am pleased you see, at last—to alleviate the strain on the service. There is currently no backlog at all in the provision of general advice to the community, with dedicated staff responding to written queries in shorter time frames than ever before—often within five days. The honourable member also argued that the goods and services tax is having an adverse effect on the building and construction industry. He cites a decline in housing approval numbers. The housing industry has just come off a huge boom in activity leading up to the introduction of the goods and services tax. Business was booming for the industry. The current readjustment to normal levels of activity from such a high level will appear on the surface as a significant decline but is certainly not indicative of the housing industry struggling under the GST.
The honourable members for Griffith and Lalor referred to the Morgan and Banks survey and claimed that that indicated that businesses are suffering. The Morgan and Banks survey, reported in the Sunday Telegraph, was in fact released on Tuesday, embargoed for Wednesday's papers and reported at that time. Accompanying the release on profitability were three other press releases. They were as follows: Australia wins gold again, finding that a record number of businesses will be hiring permanent staff in the next quarter; no worries for November GST payments, indicating only 12 per cent of employers were worrying about cash flow in meeting GST payments; and GST roll-back not appropriate, showing a resounding 90.5 per cent of businesses oppose Labor's roll-back policy—they have not been talking about that for some months. These surveys show that, overwhelmingly, businesses are coping with the introduction of the GST, that they are not worried about cash flow and that employment is booming. They also confirm that businesses may well have absorbed profit margins to keep prices down for consumers. This is good news for consumers and consistent with the lower than expected September quarter consumer price index result. Since overall company profits are at record highs, businesses may have taken the opportunity to preserve market share and consumer goodwill. 
Labor's claim that business viability is threatened is completely false. As the survey itself shows, employment intentions are booming. The most revealing part of the survey was the near total opposition to Labor's roll-back—a massive 90.5 per cent—making Labor's roll-back one of the most unpopular policies in federal political history. No wonder Labor keep it hidden. If Labor have any intention of rolling back GST, they should announce it now so that people can assess it and in particular assess Labor's plans for higher tax and interest rates to pay for it. Labor's shame and embarrassment over roll-back is proven by the fact that they are going to such extreme lengths to cover up their policies. I am indebted to the Treasurer's media release of 5 November for those useful facts which very effectively rebut some of the false arguments put forward by members of the opposition. It has also been suggested by the honourable members for Griffith and Lalor that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 is roll-back by the Treasurer.
—It is!
—It is not. These bills are simply technical changes. They are completely different from roll-back, which is a wholesale structural change to the tax system. It is an indication of how embarrassed Labor are about roll-back that they try to label our technical changes with the term, trying to drag us down to their level. That is very sad. Labor's whole strategy on tax reform has been a massive fraud—a bit like the allegations of Labor's conduct in the 1987 Fisher poll. Kim Beazley supported a GST when Keating opposed it for populist reasons. Labor's doom and gloom report was shameless and has shown them to be scaremongers. Labor said there would be a nightmare and a deluge on 1 July. It said that everything was going up by 10 per cent. It said the inflation estimates were too low. It put out sham surveys with doctored results. Labor ended up with egg on their faces. Life went on, the sun came up on 1 July and Labor's scaremongering on inflation has proved to be baseless now that the inflation figures have been released.
The honourable member for Swan referred to what he claimed was the severe impact of the GST on the commercial property sector, especially strata title hotels, and he wanted a change in the legislation. I am pleased to reassure the honourable member that the government's new tax system is good for business. Cuts to the company tax rate and the largest income tax cuts in Australia's history will provide significant long-term benefits to all business. Single strata title apartments or units are classed as residential premises. Sales of new residential premises are subject to GST. The supply of rented residential premises is input taxed. This means that no GST is charged and business cannot claim back the GST included in the price of acquisitions relating to the supply. This treatment ensures that apartments and units are treated in the same way as other residential premises, including housing. This bill is good for business. It contains finetuning measures which will increase administrative simplicity and compliance while ensuring protection of revenue. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to monitoring the implementation of Australia's new tax system and listening to any concerns in the community. The bill contains minor and technical changes, and I am very pleased on behalf of the government to commend this bill to the chamber.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—This debate has been a long time coming. The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 is an important bill from the point of view both of citizens' rights and of the development of future economic activity and, importantly, economic activity through electronic means and, in this day and age, over the Internet. I suppose we are seeing two different philosophies here before the House: that advocated by the government, which is essentially one of trying to develop a culture of privacy in the private sector, and one which the opposition will be advocating. That is one where there is some enforcement, some actual grunt, in the legislation to enforce citizens' rights and indeed to give the business community generally confidence that privacy is actually an enforceable right and protected in transactions. Our criticism of the government's approach is that, while they have provided a car by setting out some national privacy principles with which we essentially agree and indeed which in many ways have been utilised in the public sector through the Privacy Act, they have not provided an engine, so these principles are not really being driven anywhere. They exist and, yes, people can point to them as being aspirations, but we are getting into virtually non-existent or at best extremely weak enforcement regimes. The Attorney-General himself says that this is  light touch legislation. We say it is worse than that: it is feather touch. I will point to the Attorney's statement on 18 October this year when he referred to a survey of business practices that intruded into privacy. Speaking of this government's intention, he put it this way:
It is clear that a cultural change is required to ensure that the protection of privacy is part of ... business practice. To help encourage this change, the Government has adopted a light touch, co-regulatory approach to privacy in the private sector.
The Attorney refers to encouraging a cultural change through a light touch coregulatory approach. But again we say that much more grunt is needed in the legislation to give it some purpose, and our amendments will be intended, in goodwill, to achieve that. I might add that there have been two excellent inquiries in this area, by the House and by the Senate, and I understand a further Senate report will be handed down on Wednesday, which may well have some additional contribution to make to the debate.
As all Australians would be aware, the growth of electronic commerce over the Internet has been astounding. Even if people are not buying products through the Internet, they are perhaps using it to do their banking or at least inquire as to what their banking records show. We have seen recently a tremendous boom in dot.com companies on the stock market both in Australia and overseas. There was a tremendous increase in the value of their stocks. Equally, however, we saw a rapid decline as confidence in those dot.com companies burst. One of the reasons why the value of those shares toppled so dramatically was that these dot.com companies were developing value on the basis of the number of hits on a particular ad or a particular web site. Those hits were being represented by the dotcom companies as anticipated marketing potential. But it has been revealed that the marketing potential from those hits has not eventuated: the hits have not coincided with people purchasing goods through the advertisements as displayed on the web sites or on the particular screens that come up. All of the evidence indicates that a significant, if not the most significant, reason why purchases have not followed from the hits is the concerns that people—not only Australians but those around the world—have about their privacy. 
An increasing number of members would know what happens when you enter into a transaction on the Internet. A dialogue box will come up and it will ask you your name and address, which is of course required if you are purchasing a product and it is being mailed to you. But more often than not there will be some sort of incentive plan attached to it, so it will ask you about other issues, such as areas of interest and perhaps even community groups that you may belong to or chat clubs or news groups that you may be interested in, which clearly goes beyond the purpose, the particular purchase or transaction. So we are seeing not only information directly being obtained for the purchase but also a whole range of ancillary information which will go into building a profile of the particular customer.
Not only is that occurring with respect to specific transactions but through the use of the Internet—the mechanisms are substantially beyond my expertise—we have seen the use of cookies and even Internet bugs, as I understand it, which feed back information to companies which have placed these cookies regarding your particular browsing over the Internet. Someone has described the use of these bugs, depending on the nature of the cookie, as branding a bar code—such as the one you see when you buy goods from a shopping centre—on your forehead, if you like, so that every time you browse a particular web site it is like walking through the door of a shop and the bar code activates that this particular person has been in the shop and at least had a look around. Then the person will move on, look at another site and walk into another shop, and that will be identified. Perhaps a person's name, address and other details will not be included, but when the person makes a transaction that trail is then recorded and linked to that person. So, very quickly, this information can come together and develop a profile on the person.
This is not future technology; this is happening now. Many people are apprehensive regarding their privacy rights on the Internet without knowing why they have these apprehensions—they just have them. What is needed is legislation not only to address rights but also to assure Australians that their rights are being protected. Not only is this information used for marketing purposes where companies figure from someone's profile the sort of things they have looked at—whether it is boats, surfing products, whatever it might be—and fire particular ads directed at that sort of area, but increasingly evidence is being shown that businesses are using the information to downgrade the ranking of a customer so that they are identified as someone who is not particularly desirable and, indeed, it would probably be better for the overall profitability of the business if they were to go elsewhere—actually putting them on a lower key priority in terms of a response time or what products or services are offered to them. The use of this information not only can be constructive but also can be very destructive. These are not potential concerns but very real concerns in the community. Indeed, here are some figures to substantiate it from Roy Morgan Research:
The majority of Australians (56%) are worried about invasion of privacy issues created by new information technologies ... More than one-in-six Australians (18%) said they `strongly agree' notwithstanding the statement, `I'm worried about the invasion of privacy through new technology', with a further 38% saying they `agree' with the statement. 
That is certainly a significant figure. Recently, the Attorney-General released figures regarding concerns voiced by Australians and raised with the Privacy Commissioner. The Attorney-General noted:
The Commissioner's web site averaged 4000 hits a month last financial year—up from previous year's average of 25000 per month.
During 1999/2000, the Hotline received 9454 calls, 474 more than the previous year.
Interestingly, the Attorney notes that most of those complaints related to the private sector, not to government. This is an increasing trend now. Previously, it was governments that had the capacity to be so intrusive into the lives of ordinary Australians with the information they recovered but, with outsourcing and with these new technologies, that power is very much shifting to the private sector. The private sector, as the Attorney has indicated, just has not had that culture of privacy protection. That is shown very much by a recent survey by Arthur Andersen. There are five points that are certainly worth noting to realise the significance of the invasion of privacy and how Australians' concerns are justified. The summary of the survey showed:
Although 72% of the sites surveyed—
that is, involved in electronic commerce—
collected personal information, only 51% had a published privacy policy and only 28% of those sites notify their users about the specific personal information that is collected.
The second point is:
71% of the web sites with a stated privacy policy say that personal identifying information may be disclosed to third parties but one in three of those sites do not offer users a choice with respect to that disclosure.
That is a significant finding. The third point is:
43% of the sites that collected personal information did so without the user actively providing that information.
This is through cookies and bugs and the like. The fourth point is:
15% of web sites without a statement about third party disclosures attempted to place third parties cookies (sent from ad servers).
This is placing, if you like, the spies or fifth columnists on your particular computer system. The final point is:
Only 14% of the sites surveyed say that they give users the opportunity to have at least some personal information about them deleted from web site records.
These figures indicate what is happening in industry today, and they are significant figures because it is very likely that those businesses, if they are of substance in their marketing, will be a party to a voluntary privacy code. These figures are being revealed in an atmosphere where there is, in many areas, self-regulation. We have to ask, `Is self-regulation good enough?' I think those figures give sufficient concern to say, `Self-regulation is not good enough and something more needs to be done about it.
To see the government's reluctance to move a step further, you have only to look at the history of this legislation in the parliament. While it is customary for a member of the opposition to stand here and criticise backflips of the government, I do so on this occasion to demonstrate the reason behind the weakness in the government's approach. The Liberal Party had as its policy before the 1996 election the development of privacy legislation. But, in March 1997, the government announced a withdrawal from that position and said that it favoured self-regulation rather than legislation in the area. There is no doubt that that was primarily as a result of pressure from the Prime Minister. The government was quite happy to go along with that except for the fact that the states—conservative and Labor states—said, `This is going to cause us real problems because, if we don't have privacy legislation, there is a significant risk of trade with other countries being impeded.' In particular, the European Union said, `Unless you have an acceptable privacy framework, we aren't going to trade with you, because the information which we convey in the course of that trade could be released through your system. In other words, before we embark on trade in the electronic environment with you, we need to be satisfied that your privacy standards are acceptable.' 
The various state governments—indeed, Victoria was quite advanced in the development of its regime—put forward their own legislation. Industry then said, `Hold on, we're in one nation but we're looking at the prospect of having six or seven different privacy systems.' That would have been totally unacceptable to a national economy, the activity in which goes beyond state boundaries and indeed beyond national boundaries. It was only then that the government came in and said, `Yes, there is a need for national privacy regulation.' But all the way we can see in their reasoning a throwback to the March 1997 withdrawal from the need for legislation. Hence, what we are looking at today is very weak—not light touch legislation but feather touch legislation, as advocated by the government. We in the opposition say that the fundamental reasoning with which the government has come into this area has been too timid and, for that reason, is flawed.
However, on the other side, we acknowledge that some regulation is better than no regulation, so our approach is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater but to make some constructive suggestions. One of our primary concerns about the legislation is that important privacy principles relating to access and correction, and the use and disclosure of information, do not apply to existing databases. So, in many ways, the horse has already bolted, and the horse has bolted with the private information of Australian citizens riding on it. We saw recently the giant Axiom database—Axiom being a business subsidiary of a larger American company—with the information of some 15 million Australians apparently on it, information which had been obtained from merging information from all types of sources—from the ninemsn web site, from Ticketek and from other sources. They already exist in Australia. If this legislation goes through unamended, Australians have absolutely no prospect of accessing and correcting that information. That is the second point—there is not only the misuse of the information but the consumer's access to it.
The second area we have concerns about is that the Privacy Commissioner has effectively been left out in the cold in terms of regulating these industry codes. That is unacceptable because it is going to result in a whole range of diverse interpretations being made throughout Australia according to the particular privacy adjudicator under separate and discrete privacy codes. They will exist as silos all around the country, and the Privacy Commissioner will not have the right to step into the shoes of those adjudicators and set a common framework. The Privacy Commissioner's powers in respect of those private sector codes will be minimal indeed. The Privacy Commissioner at best will have the power to review their annual reports and, if he considers anything awry, to determine whether not they will be reregistered. But he will not have, for instance, the power to inspect documents, the power to interview witnesses or the power to conduct a privacy audit of these private sector codes, and we say that that is inadequate.
We say that the Privacy Commissioner's powers are inadequate not only in terms of investigation but also in terms of his inability to impose a penalty. This is significant. While the Privacy Commissioner does have the power to recommend compensation in respect of a privacy breach, he does not have the power to order a penalty. By way of an example, if it were disclosed that I subscribe to Tracks Surfing Magazine, that may or may not affect my reputation in the eyes of some citizens. If I complained about it, the Privacy Commissioner might say, `It shouldn't have been disclosed; I'm prepared to order some compensation. I'll give you a token monetary amount.' But the disclosure of my subscription may have been part of an overall scheme, an overall assault, to tap into a particular publisher's web site, and the intrusion into the privacy of citizens generally may have been so extensive that a penalty is warranted. However, the legislation does not provide that sort of opportunity.
Generally, I think Australians see that, if there is going to be any teeth in the law covering consumer protection, you need to have an active regulator. Look at the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in the area of consumer protection. That is very much an example of you needing teeth before a culture of consumer protection can develop. The point I am making is that, to be fair dinkum about protecting Australians' rights, you need effective regulation.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2000-11-06,"—The question of Reserve recruitment in this country has certainly been in the forefront of concerns of people in support committees around the country. Recently, the crisis in recruitment levels forced the government to actually look at employer subsidies. But that, of course, will not solve the fundamental problem. 
Tonight I want to talk about the Department of Defence annual report for 1999-2000. It was tabled last week, and it revealed that Defence had spent a massive $34.8 million of taxpayers' money last financial year on advertising and market research. Of that figure, $32.8 million was spent by the Defence Personnel Executive mainly on recruitment campaigns and $9.7 million was allocated solely towards the recruitment of officers for ADFA. One has to question whether this sort of expenditure is really being well spent under the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. You would expect a pretty impressive recruitment outcome with the devotion of this kind of money from taxpayers. Instead, we read elsewhere in the report that Defence met only 74 per cent of its recruitment targets for the permanent forces and an embarrassing 31 per cent for the reserves—and that is not going to be fixed up by employer subsidies, quite frankly. By service, the Army and RAAF met 83 per cent of their recruitment targets for full-time personnel, while the Navy managed a mere 57 per cent of its positions. As the annual report notes on page 79:
Failure to meet recruiting targets, combined with separations, is creating increasing workforce gaps within the Services. Navy is most affected with vacancies of almost 2,000 against requirements, resulting in higher workloads to be shared among its people.
This is at a time when this government rabbits on every second day of the week about the way in which we are going to become more and more dependent on the reserves. They say that personnel costs mean that we essentially cannot afford full-time personnel to undertake these roles and we are going to depend more on reserves. While that is happening we have this atrocious performance managed by the minister, who just does not understand that there is more to this task than a bit of backslapping at RSL conferences and wearing a few uniforms around the place. He has to actually get down and do something about the recruitment levels.
The report reveals that the government's procrastination over the measures to rebuild the Army Reserve exacerbated the so-called hollowness that clearly afflicts most Reserve units. In the 12 months from June 1999, the number of active Army reservists actually shrank by a massive 18 per cent from just under 22,000 to a little under 18,000—and the government continues to insist that the Army Reserve will be required to shoulder a great share of our national defence effort. In a massive understatement the Defence annual report—the government's own document—comments that:
Of concern was poor Army General Reserve enlistments, which achieved only 33% of the target. 
To appreciate the seriousness of the recruitment position of the Army Reserve, I would like to refer to data I have obtained for the eight years commencing in July 1992. These figures come from my analysis of previous Defence annual reports. In the six years to June 1998, the Army Reserve recruited an average of 4,800 new personnel a year. During that period the year-by-year variation was fairly small—ranging from about 4,300 to just fewer than 5,800. In contrast, under the current administration of this country, over the last two years we have seen the worst recruiting outcomes in living memory. In 1998-99, the number of recruits plummeted to 2,281 and in 1999-2000 it fell even further to 1,566. 
This worrying outcome would be bad enough if it was the first indication of any sort of problem with the reserves. Typical of what is going on with the $32 million they are spending around the place, the 11th/28th Battalion recently conducted an exercise in Western Australia. They had 100 people turn up and express interest. The exercise was called `Try before you buy' and people could see what the reserves was like. They obtained the interest of 100 people, but these people were not told beforehand that only five people were able to go on the course. So they actually spent this taxpayer money on having this day and seeing people's interest—actually, for once, managing to get a few people there; it is very rare these days—and then none of those people were told until afterwards that there were only five possible training positions interstate. 
As I say, the annual report—the government's own wording—indicates an alarming decline in recruitment in this country at a time when Timor has indicated, more than ever, the need to depend upon reserves. We just cannot financially afford to do it any other way, and the continued downturn in reserve recruitment is quite alarming.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Recruitment</title>,Adjournment,16,1
