"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Clerk, I would like to propose the honourable member for Wakefield as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I move:
That the honourable member for Wakefield do take the chair of this House as Speaker.
—Is the motion seconded?
—Mr Clerk, I have the great honour and privilege to second that motion.
—Does the honourable member for Wakefield accept the nomination?
—Mr Clerk, I do.
—Is there any further proposal? There being no further proposal, the time for proposals has expired. I declare that the honourable member proposed, the member for Wakefield, has been elected as Speaker.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!
(Hon. Neil Andrew)—I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to the House for the high honour that has been conferred upon me.
The Speaker having seated himself in the chair—",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, I would like, on my own behalf and I know on behalf of all honourable members, to congratulate you on your re-election as Speaker, and may I remark on the courtesy of the opposition in ensuring that your election as Speaker was unanimous. It is an important office. It is a difficult office. It is an office that, from time to time, carries with it controversy. Can I say on a personal basis that you and I have been close colleagues for a long time. I have always had an immense personal regard for you as an individual. You have been a great representative of the people of Wakefield.  
Can I say on behalf of those who sit behind me in this chamber that we will, within the traditions of this House, extend to you every respect and every courtesy. I think all of us want at the beginning of a parliamentary term to aspire to a parliamentary decorum and a character of debate that is better than the one that went before. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we as a government are prepared to have a constructive dialogue with the opposition about ways of changing matters for the better, and I have asked the Leader of the House to talk to the Manager of Opposition Business on those matters. I do not think any of us should have unreal expectations, but equally I think the Australian public would want us to try.
In saying that we should bear in mind that this is the parliament of Australia and there are characteristics of the Australian people that are exhibited in this chamber, and I would not wish it to be otherwise. We should not try and be a mirror image of a parliament and of a people that we are not. We inherit some of the Westminster traditions—and long may that be the case because they are good traditions—but there are also Australian characteristics of this place that I would not want to see constrained. We are a direct, robust people, and necessarily the debate must represent and characterise the robustness and the directness of the Australian people. But if we can do it in a way that is more likely to produce better outcomes and a greater understanding of our responsibilities in the Australian community, then we should endeavour to do so.
There is a strange and almost eerie peace upon the chamber, Mr Speaker. It is nice, and I savour the moment. It is not that one would be unprepared to respond to a different climate, but I say very genuinely, Mr Speaker, that it is great to see you there. It is great to be in this position to congratulate you, and I look forward to it being a constructive parliament and a parliament that above all else serves all of the people of Australia, because that is our responsibility and that is our solemn charge, whatever our political vantage points may be.
I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his assumption of that position. It is a tough position, I know; there are none tougher in politics than leading an opposition. I congratulate him, the member for Jagajaga and all of the others who have been promoted on the opposition front bench. We look forward to a constructive, vigorous debate and a proper examination of things that are important. I also say how delighted I am to have my colleague and friend the Leader of the National Party, my colleague and friend Peter Costello, the Leader of the Liberal Party, and all of my colleagues back in their respective positions. To all of them, I extend my congratulations. I look forward to a very entertaining parliament.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, can I, too, offer my congratulations to you, and indicate that we did not oppose your election; we welcome the fact that you are back as Speaker. I would have preferred the circumstances to have been those of me seconding you in a prime ministerial nomination in accordance with a proposal that I put forward in the spirit of getting order back into the place.
Government members interjecting—
—Who are the ones who are not genuine? My proposal would see the Speaker alternate, by nomination from either side, for two terms. Those on the other side of the House laugh at that, but I remind the Prime Minister of his words on 2 April 1996, when he said:
You will never have a completely independent Speaker in this country unless the Opposition is prepared to come halfway and commit itself to not opposing the Speaker at a subsequent election.
We have come halfway but the Prime Minister could not engage his own proposal. I have not heard the prime ministerial response to that proposal but the opportunity will present itself later today when the Deputy Speaker is nominated. We will be putting forward for that position, in the spirit of this proposal, Harry Jenkins. My proposal is that the Speaker be nominated by the Prime Minister for two terms. The position will then rotate. The Deputy Speaker will be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, likewise for two terms, and the position will then rotate. We will have the opportunity to consider this proposal this afternoon, when the position of Deputy Speaker is filled. 
I look forward to the coming three years in this chamber. I believe we have to improve the standards in this place, and I admit that I have been part of the problem in the past. I am prepared to turn over a new leaf—
Government members—Oh!
—but are those on the other side? I note the mirth, but I also note the proposal by the Prime Minister—and I welcome it—that the Manager of Government Business meet with the Manager of Opposition Business to talk these issues through. The Prime Minister says that he does not hold out too much hope on that. What I would like, Prime Minister, is for you and me to sit down and talk these issues through. What is wrong with that? In the spirit of trying to improve the standards of the House, why shouldn't the two leaders of both major parties sit down and work that proposal through?
It is all very well to delegate the detail to others, but unless this proposal has prime ministerial authority it is not going to advance terribly far, I suspect. My point is that not only is the opportunity there in terms of our bona fides in respect of your position to take that a step further this afternoon but also importantly the opportunity is there to improve the standing orders to give substance to the ability for greater independence on your part and greater order in the chamber. I have put forward a package of proposals that will assist you, Mr Speaker, if they are adopted. And I think the opportunity is there, because I have seen attributed to you comments whereby you support the proposal for an independent Speaker and the notion that I have put forward—that the election of Speaker not be challenged.
We would also like to see the standing orders altered such that answers to questions are limited to four minutes, so that we do not have the endless drivel that ministers go on with; questions are limited to one minute; and there again be opportunity for supplementary questions. The important thing, though, is this: we are also asking that ministers fully answer questions. This place breaks down into disorder when this government, by avoiding questions, will not be held accountable. I believe that, if it is appropriate to have a standing order on relevance, there has to be an obligation that questions be fully answered and the answer be relevant to the questions asked. It is a simple proposition which gives effect to what I believe is your intent; an intent that we know, from your earlier rulings, you have great difficulty in enforcing.
We also believe that there should in this place be an opportunity for returns to order; not in addition to matters of public importance but in place of them where we consider it appropriate. It is a practice in the Senate. I think it is something that could usefully be brought into this place so that we can debate issues that arise in question time and that may not have been anticipated by us in the framing of our matter of public importance. We also want to see introduced a circumstance where ministers do not abuse question time by making lengthy policy announcements. There are other forms of the House for that; ministerial statements, for example, where the opportunity is afforded opposition spokespeople to debate them. This is what a house of parliament should be about. There should not just be an opportunity for the government side to put a proposition in terms of a policy announcement; there should be an opportunity also for the opposition to put its views.
The other issue that has been in constant abuse in this place is the length of time ministers take to answer questions on notice. Questions on notice are an important part of the parliamentary process, but time after time we have seen members on this side get up and talk about the inordinate length of time by which ministers have failed to answer. We are proposing that the 60-day rule be reduced to 30 days and that you, Mr Speaker, be given the opportunity to indicate that ministers are in breach of the standing orders. We also think that petitions should be given greater significance in this chamber. People who have taken time to sign a petition deserve to know that it is going to be followed up. What we are looking for is the opportunity for petitions to be properly considered in this chamber. 
Mr Speaker, all of those initiatives have been put forward in the spirit of making your task easier. We want to have a chamber that is orderly but, if we are going to be subjected to the circumstances in which our questions are not answered and ministers abuse the form of question time, we have to resort to other alternatives to try to make them accountable. I say to the Prime Minister in the spirit of goodwill at the outset—not by any means as a threat but as a genuine offer—not to delegate this but to take charge of it himself. He has argued on previous occasions, time and time again, that he wants to improve the standards. He has argued for an independent Speaker. I am giving him an opportunity to implement that in his third term. In the spirit of cooperation, I hope he responds positively. I look forward to him setting up a meeting with me, not just delegating it to someone else.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating you on your return to that high office. I was reflecting a moment ago on what a great country it is that, just a few days ago, you and I were in your home area in Renmark enjoying the friendship of, dare I say it, constituents of yours who seemed to be glad that this side of the House was to be returned and would be in a position to put you back in that place. How fortunate we are in this country—you with your office, me with mine—to be able to move around freely as we do amongst our constituents in an atmosphere of goodwill and of security.
I certainly congratulate the Prime Minister on his return to his office and again record my appreciation of his leadership through what was for all of us a difficult year last year. I look forward to continuing to work with him, the Treasurer and the rest of the team. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on attaining their positions. I was talking to the deputy this morning. She will experience some of those things that are common to all deputies of being a clearing house for some of the problems that will come across the desk. I personally wish her well with it.
Mr Speaker, in relation to our role as members of the House and the way we are perceived by the broader community, as has been touched on, I am often struck by the way people in the community say, including at times when you are on talkback radio and so forth, `We do not like the standards that sometimes we see parliamentarians apply in the House of Representatives.' My response is always to say—and I am echoing a point that the Prime Minister made—that no Australian should be squeamish about a full-blooded debate. It would be a sad thing indeed if in this place there were an inadequate exploration of issues, if there were not strongly held positions and if those positions were not from time to time expressed with great passion. Australia would be the poorer for that. Indeed at times perhaps we would do well to see a wider diversity of views more strongly expressed. I do think that it is part of the Australian way of life that, having expressed your views, you ensure that personal animosity is not allowed then to taint relationships, and I think people expect us to apply that rule in this place.
From that, I just make the observation that you can talk about standing orders, agreements and a whole range of frameworks for the way that we might behave, but in the end it is up to each of us to reflect upon how we interact in this place, how we present our ideas, how we take them forward and how we argue the case without becoming personal and without seeking to abuse others. I think that is what is expected of us. In that sense I was reflecting this morning that we are all privileged—all of us—to have been sworn in in here this morning. There was a very interesting article in today's Australian about Pat Farmer. It reflected, amongst other things, on the reality that I was not aware of that fewer than 1,000 people since Federation have been sworn in as members of this House. I was unaware of that, but it is quite remarkable when you stop to think about it. We are privileged. It is a great honour to serve the Australian people. In the spirit of those remarks that have been made about our behaviour, they do expect us to take forward different perspectives with vigour and passion but to do so in a way that reflects the fact that each one of us has been duly elected by people who want their point of view presented and respected. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you. ",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"— Mr Speaker, I join with my colleagues in adding my congratulations to you on your re-election. Undoubtedly we will continue to at times test your patience, but in the spirit of today we do welcome you back here as the Speaker of this great House. I also want to thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party for their kind words. I am sure that the Leader of the National Party could give me advice about how to conduct many of the challenges that will come forward, so I appreciate his kind words.
Just to follow up in one respect the initiatives that have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. We are all aware in this House, particularly those who have just been elected—and I extend my congratulations to all the new members on all sides of the House, including those on the crossbenches—of the message that we all get in our electorates that, for many reasons, we are not held in as high an honour as we would like, given the responsibilities that we have. I think that that in the end is the reason for the initiatives that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward.
The public wants to know that this will be a place not only of feisty debate, as the Prime Minister said, but also where the public—not just the opposition—will get answers to critical questions, whether they are about the accountability of the government and the executive in particular or on policy issues and policy differences. The public does not want to see this place, in the sense of it being a clearing house for ideas and different points of political view, being brought into disrepute by those critical issues not being pursued in a vigorous way. That is the underlying reason for the initiatives that we have put forward and we hope that they will be taken in that light.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, I believe that you have been a gracious and courteous occupant of the chair of this House and I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others in congratulating you on your re-election.
I will respond to a couple of points made by the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, this is not Westminster. As the Prime Minister has said, this parliament inherits many of the Westminster traditions but not all of them. One of the key differences between this parliament and Westminster is that at Westminster speakers are not opposed at election time. It is highly unrealistic for the Leader of the Opposition to expect a Speaker seeking re-election not to be opposed in his election.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Those desperate to reform the parliament might like to consider the fact that the minister has the call.
—The other point I would make is that, as this chamber has evolved, opposition members can ask, more or less, the questions that they like and ministers can give the answers that they think most appropriate under the standing orders. That is the way it should be. What we cannot expect— certainly what the opposition cannot and have no right to expect—is that ministers will give the answer that the opposition wants. Ministers will give the answers that they believe are appropriate; ministers will defend the government's position in the way that they think is appropriate. The opposition has put forward an interesting and, I think, constructive set of proposals. The Manager of Opposition Business and I are more than capable of sitting down and talking them through. I trust the Manager of Opposition Business to speak with authority on these matters. The government will look at those proposals constructively. 
The government is concerned not just with a better question time; we are concerned with having a better parliament. We would like the parliament as a whole to work better. We believe that all members of this parliament— not simply members of the executive—have an honoured role and an important place in the national debate. The proposals that we will be putting forward in the next few weeks will be designed to enhance the dignity of the parliament as a whole.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, I follow my leaders in offering our sincere congratulations. I think yours has been a formidable achievement in securing a second term in the face of a concerted campaign elsewhere. I am delighted with the comments that you have been reported as making this morning, expressing interest in the proposals that we have put forward because, in addition to this being something for discussion between the government and the opposition, I think it is something that should also involve your good self.
We really have a once in a century opportunity here to reform the parliament. One hundred years ago this people's house had a record of parliamentary and democratic reform unsurpassed anywhere in the world: the extension of the franchise, the secret ballot, votes for women—you can go on. One hundred years ago the world looked to this parliament for parliamentary reform. This is the people's house. If the people are unhappy with the way in which this House has operated in recent years then that is our problem; it is not the people's problem. The proposals that we have put forward go to the very heart of the quality of our democracy. If there is so much alienation in the community with the way in which this House operates then we have a duty to change.
We have put forward our proposals in a bipartisan way. We are not absolutely fixed with the proposals we put forward; we are happy to sit down and talk with the government. But I think the point that the Leader of the Opposition made is an important one: it has to go to the top. The member for Warringah and I can sit down and have a friendly chat—and I am sure we will—but that will not be enough.
—He's buying is he? The point is that the primary objective is to make the House function more effectively and with dignity. Of course we have to put our views in a forthright manner—that is all the more reason why we need an independent Speaker. No set of rewritten rules in the standing orders is going to provide the reform that is required unless we have a Speaker who is more independent and has authority. That is the point.
We think that the two reforms are linked. What repels so many Australians about this House is the sense of barnyard politics—a House of yelling monkeys, collective jeering. It all looks ugly on TV and it is an ugly reality. There is no point trying to make TV the scapegoat. We have to change ourselves to fit into the new century, and that is what we need to do. We will be coming to our talks with the government with a genuine desire for change. But all of us must change; all of us have to change. All of the proposals we put forward are linked in one way or another. 
Congratulations, Mr Speaker. I think we will have an interesting parliament. Congratulations to all of those opposite who have been elected and to all of those on this side and on the crossbenches. We look forward to the challenge of reforming this parliament, the first parliament of the 21st century.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, may I take the opportunity as a colleague and longstanding friend to congratulate you upon your elevation to the speakership in this your second term. You bring to your new position the experience of three years in the job, a maturity of 19 years in this parliament, honour and integrity and an understanding of the standing orders. We would hope that there is no confusion about the one-minute and four-minute bells, which almost brought about the demise of the chief whip and me.
The electors of Wakefield have been well served by you and the first Speaker of this parliament, Sir Frederick Holder, who held the position from 1901 to 1909. You made reference to that in our celebrations of the Centenary of Federation in Melbourne on 9 May. You have brought the representative of Wakefield to the speakership in 1998 and 2002. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have alluded, the performance of Speaker is evaluated in this place on a daily basis by members opposite and by members of the government. It is also evaluated by those many people who look at question time on television at 2 o'clock and later in the evening. People often comment to me about the performance of members, of the Speaker and of the parliament generally. You get a lot of gratuitous advice by telephone after question time as to your performance, as to the very good performance of the Prime Minister and as to the performance of other ministers. The Speaker's role is always under scrutiny, and I do wish you well in your new term. 
The use of standing order 304A will be used with much more discretion on future occasions, because the member for Hotham is now reformed! The member for Hotham allowed you, Mr Speaker, to use that standing order on a number of occasions, but I note from his own words on this occasion that you will no longer need to use 304A in a similar manner. Likewise, the member for Prospect has been elevated—she has two positions now. She is in a more responsible position and she is further away from you, so neither you nor she should be able to engage in ongoing conversation.
Mr Speaker, I wish you well in your role of administering this parliament. Sometimes members of the House and others overlook this important administrative function that you, as Speaker, have in meeting representatives from other countries and in being our spokesman on behalf of the parliament and the Australian people. There is also your role in foreign delegations to other countries. I know you undertake that role with considerable expertise and understanding. Along with other colleagues, your wife, Carolyn, and your family, I hope that you enjoy the responsibilities and privileges of the great honour that has been bestowed upon you by this House in this the 40th Parliament.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-02-12,"— May I add my congratulations to your renomination and success. Had there been another nomination, I may have taken a different course of action, because it is a source of disappointment that, as the Constitution requires, we do not nominate people for that position formally from the floor of the House except where a predetermined decision has been made and debated in the press long before the House assembles, as required, to nominate candidates and have a proper election if need be. I had toyed with the idea of nominating the member for Kennedy—
Government members—Where is he?
—but he, unfortunately, is not here—
Government members interjecting—
—`And they may well have voted for him,' I hear on my left. A very interesting House it perhaps would have been. The point I would have made about that nomination is that I think it is healthy that the members of the House, particularly from the crossbench, have an opportunity to nominate their own candidates. If we are talking about reform of this process, it might not be such a bad idea to go through that process of nomination on the floor and go through the voting procedure, rather than stitch it up beforehand.
I have listened with interest to the words of the Leader of the Opposition, and I congratulate him on his elevation to the position. I agree wholeheartedly with some of the reforms he is suggesting. I think it was the member for Chifley—correct me if I am wrong—who in one of the former parliaments had a longstanding motion on the Notice Paper alluding to the length of questions and, indeed, the length of answers. I think the one-minute, four-minute suggestion is absolutely ideal.
While we are talking about processes, I must say that this House risks becoming an irrelevant backwater in the democratic process if we continue to refer legislation to Senate committees without it being referred to a House committee and if we do not move substantial amendments in this House and debate them. If they are lost or whatever happens, they can be reintroduced in the Senate, as should be the process. But we are capitulating to the Senate and it is becoming the de facto House of Representatives. The real danger that we face in this democracy is that this House runs the risk of being overrun by the executive—by the truncation of debate. I know that we cannot go on forever with debates, but it is absolutely essential that we, as the people's representatives, have an opportunity to put forward amendments and to properly debate legislation when it appears before the House. 
Having said that, I congratulate you again, Sir, on your re-election. I know you will continue to show your evenhandedness by occasionally ejecting the member for Warringah from the chamber. I know what sort of pressure that you and your predecessors have been under, particularly from your own side of politics. I would ask you to stay strong. You certainly will have all the support necessary from the crossbenches. I am sure I can speak on behalf of the member for New England, who I also welcome to the chamber, and who, along with me and the member for Kennedy, will probably ask the only true questions without notice that this parliament will hear.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2002-02-12,"— Mr Speaker, I join briefly in the congratulatory remarks to you from other members, and make a comment about how much, in the eight years I have been a member of this chamber—having arrived here in 1993—I have appreciated being mentored by you because we are from adjoining electorates with similar interests to do with horticulture and the River Murray. More than that, we have shared interests in what has been discussed here today—that is, in reform and in ensuring that the activities of this place remain relevant to the Australian public. I know it is a shared expectation that we both have, so I offer you my best wishes in the difficult task that is ahead of you. I was delighted to second your nomination. You have my confidence. 
I might say to other members, particularly members of the opposition, how refreshing it is to know that the member for Hotham has been down the road to Damascus. It will take more than fine speeches in here to convince members on this side that that is true. I say to the Manager of Opposition Business that I will be willing to test the strength of your new experience because it is appalling to have to justify—particularly to youngsters and schoolchildren that visit us here and sit in a glass gallery—the behaviour that goes on here. I know that you, Mr Speaker, have reminded us on many occasions that the students of the nation—even our own children—watch us. With those remarks, it is hoped that the Leader of the Opposition lives up to his expectations to improve the behaviour and the functioning of this chamber so that the Australian people will be the ultimate beneficiaries.
I conclude with my best wishes to you, to Carolyn and to your family. I give an undertaking to do everything I can to enhance the standing of this chamber.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2002-02-12,"—Can I respond to the many good wishes extended to me this morning by thanking you all for your support and your consideration. It has been a great honour to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives through the past three years, and a particular honour to occupy this office in the year of the Centenary of Federation. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity, and I thank the House for the confidence it has shown in me in re-electing me to this post today.
Can I reassure the member for Calare and, in defence of the Clerk, make the point that there was absolutely nothing preventing anyone in this process from nominating any other member of the chamber who would have been exposed to a secret ballot as the standing orders provide had that been the wish of any member of the chamber.
I want particularly to thank the Prime Minister and the former Leader of the Opposition for the courtesy they showed to me while I had this post through the last parliament. I extend my congratulations to the Leader of the Opposition on his election and to the Prime Minister on his re-election and my optimistic good hope that the relationship that I shared with the leaders of the coalition and the Labor Party in the last parliament I will share with the leaders of the coalition and the Labor Party in this parliament.  
I want to thank the member for Corangamite and the member for Forrest for their preparedness to nominate and second me. I appreciate the friendship of the member for Corangamite and the frank way in which he deals with issues and with each of us as individuals and with me as the Speaker. Let me also add my appreciation to the member for Cunningham who, unknown to most, when all else is falling apart around the Speaker, will come around to my office or even to this chair and, in his own quiet way and from his own experience in this office, offer a word of reassurance and support.
On that note can I reassure you all, particularly the new members of the chamber, that the office door is always open and that I am alert to any concerns that you may have that will ensure that everyone feels that they are being adequately arbitered in this place by the occupier of the Speaker's chair. I give my particular thanks in this instance to the former member for Cowper, Mr Nehl, as Deputy Speaker, and to the member for Scullin, Mr Jenkins, as Deputy Speaker. They both gave me all the support a Speaker could wish for, as you would all be well aware, and offered it from a bipartisan point of view. I thank them for their approach to the office. For the way in which both of them—although in this case I may say particularly the member for Scullin—sought conciliation rather than confrontation I am grateful. I do not want to prejudice in any way what may happen later today, but I do want to indicate my appreciation of the roles that they played.
In common with most of you, I stand indebted most of all to my family. To Carolyn, to Matthew and Kate, to Kate and Matthew—and someone can make something of that—and to John and the grandchildren I say thank you very much. They are the rock of my life. As you know, things are tough in political life and tough on political families, but to have some sort of refuge where you can go and where criticism rarely emerges and all that emerges is support is a great privilege. Thank you to all of you for the support you offer. I know that is a sentiment that will be echoed by most of those in this chamber to their families as well.
It is true to say, as we have said often, that the things that unite us are far greater than the things that divide us. Much has been made this morning of the need for parliamentary reform. Sentiments expressed by both sides have been widely endorsed. Can I offer a word of caution. As parliamentarians we run the risk of focusing so much on parliamentary reform that we imply that this chamber is some sort of disaster in legislative terms. Let us hesitate with our reform— not that it is not necessary; of course it is— just long enough to acknowledge that this chamber has served the people of Australia well over the last 100 years and, if I may say from my own experience, particularly over the last 20 years. Compared to 20 years ago we have a nation that is socially more cohesive than it was, we have a nation that is economically more stable than it was, and we have a nation that, to use modern terms, punches above its weight in world forums— thanks to people who have served in the parliament over the last 20 years while I have been in this chamber. 
Let us reform the chamber, but let us ensure as well that Australians recognise that they have been well served by parliamentarians present here and their predecessors. Of course there is real concern—justifiable—as echoed by the Deputy Prime Minister, about the level of personal abuse. Of course we all want to do something about it and I believe we mutually will, but these are things that will happen gradually. We do well to remember what history has shown us and that is, sadly, as we learned in the Centenary of Federation, that the first occupier of this chair 100 years ago collapsed in the then federal chamber and died uttering the words, `Dreadful, dreadful,' as he reflected on the behaviour of the chamber 100 years ago.
We ought not to do ourselves the disservice of pretending that nothing worth while has happened. This chamber has, as the result of decisions in earlier parliaments, brought in reforms that are now picked up by other chambers around the world, such reforms as the Main Committee, and we ought to celebrate that. This chamber can serve the people better, but it already serves them well and we ought to be proud of, not apologetic for, its performance. It will, of course, continue to be confrontational; that is why we are part of the great Westminster tradition. Australians expect their chambers to be robust and, frankly, by the standards of most of other chambers around Australia we are, in any case, a relatively well-behaved place to be. 
I look forward to a greater level of personal interaction and, in the interests of the people of Australia, a greater understanding of the standing orders, but let me reinforce to you all that the occupier of the Speaker's office is here not to make the rules but to enforce those determined by the parliament. I am your servant and I hope in that form to serve you well in the next three years. Thank you for your support.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2002-02-12,"—I have pleasure in nominating Ian Raymond Causley, the member for Page, for the position of Deputy Speaker. Before entering this place in 1996, the honourable member had been the member for Clarence in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since 1984. So he brings to this place a richness of experience in the parliamentary process and a knowledge of its Westminster traditions, nurtured in the mother of the Australian parliaments.
Ian Causley is a man steeped in life's experience—a husband, a father, a grandfather, a fourth generation cane farmer, a mill director, a publican, an MLA, a member of parliament, a bowler, a cricketer, a youth leader and a coach. His parliamentary experience shows a similar depth and diversity. He has been chief secretary of New South Wales. Also, in that state, he was Minister for Natural Resources on three occasions, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Mines. Since arriving here he has played an active role—at times in a leadership role—on important committees. He has chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage and the government's policy committee on Aboriginal affairs. He has also served on the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund and on a wide range of other policy committees. In short, he has been keenly involved in the affairs of this place at many responsible levels.
The thing I like about the member for Page is that he comes to grips with the detail of his brief, whatever that might be. He looks for outcomes, not theories, and he is workmanlike in achieving those ends. I well remember his analysis of the dairy industry deregulation—its processes, its probable unfolding, what the states would do and then its financial impacts. The eventual outcome was chillingly similar in its mirrored detail. This capacity for analysis and his workmanlike approach spill into other areas of his parliamentary activities, not the least of which is his appreciation of the standing orders. I for one have noted how easily he fitted into his role on the Speaker's Panel when he was appointed to that position three years ago. His ease with the forms of the House and his application of the standing orders were quite noticeable. Unmistakably, both he and the member for Menzies shone in that respect in the last parliament. I might add that the member for Page does not suffer fools gladly.
—The member for Maribyrnong!
—So I expect that those who abuse the processes of the House during his tenure in the chair will have an uncomfortable time. That said, as I predicted three years ago, I believe he will mirror the previous Deputy Speaker, the former member for Cowper, in being forceful, deliberate and fair on the one hand and urbane, counselling and witty on the other.
—The member for Maribyrnong! This is the first sitting day; I do not wish to have to discipline the House.
—His attributes and his 18 years of parliamentary service should equip him for this, the most responsible of offices. I commend him to the House as a worthy deputy to you, Mr Speaker, in the discharge of good order and equanimity in this place.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—I have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of the member for Page for the role of Deputy Speaker. The member for Page entered New South Wales politics at the same time as I did. In 1988, as the member for Clarence, he became the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries—or Natural Resources, as it was called then. To that he later added mining.
During the seven years that he was a minister he had a distinguished career. He was noted for his strong interest in rural issues, forestry issues, fisheries and mining. He was always approachable. Within the party room he was always known for his strong advocacy of regional matters and matters related to the bush. No matter what the issue was, he would always bring in that dimension. He brings to this House his own dimension on the same issues—a strong interest in regional issues and those matters that affect rural Australia. In terms of his personal credentials, he is a person of great integrity and honesty. In the times he has been in the chair he has carried out that role with great diligence. I have great pleasure in seconding his nomination. I believe he will carry out the role of Deputy Speaker in a very professional way, and I wish him well in his future role.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—I moved a motion earlier today that Mr Harry Jenkins be the Deputy Speaker, because I am serious about modernising this parliament. My proposal— which I hope the Leader of Government Business gets to fully understand before he has his discussions tonight and which he misrepresented earlier today—is quite simple: the government nominates the Speaker for two terms and I second it; and the opposition nominates the Deputy Speaker, also for two terms, with the Prime Minister seconding it. Those positions would rotate at the conclusion of the terms.
Members still have to face elections in their electorates, so this is not a Westminster model. This is an Australian response to Australian circumstances in an Australian parliament. The position is not determined by one's party room; it is determined by the whole of the parliament. It ensures that they do not owe their position to their party but to the parliament as a whole. It is about modernising the parliament. It is not to argue that this place should become less robust; rather, more relevant and with a better framework in which to operate.
Apart from the principle, there is no question about the quality of the candidate that we are nominating. Mr Harry Jenkins is a candidate who is respected on all sides of the parliament. He has as good an understanding of the procedures and standing orders as anyone in this place and, I would suggest, better than almost all. He has been in the parliament since 1986. He has been schooled in its procedures. From 1993 to 1996 he was the Deputy Speaker, and from 1996 to now he has been the Second Deputy Speaker.
Mr Speaker, you yourself praised his role and supported him. You supported the fact that he had a conciliatory role in that job. You said you did not want to prejudice the outcome, and I accept that. But, clearly, if Harry Jenkins is elected by the parliament, we would have a team that could work together to restore public faith in this institution. I think that is terribly important. Parliament should grasp this opportunity. It is an opportunity that presents itself uniquely to this parliament, and that is why it should be grabbed. It reflects the stated desires of the Prime Minister. In 1996, Mr Howard, as the newly elected Prime Minister, said:
You will never have a completely independent Speaker in this country unless the Opposition is prepared to come halfway and commit itself to not opposing the Speaker at a subsequent election.
That is the commitment that the opposition is making, Prime Minister.
—What? In the election?
—No, we are saying that we will not oppose him in terms of his role in this place. We are not proposing the Westminster model.
—But you would still run a Labor candidate against him.
—No, we would not.
—If you want to have a discussion about this then respond to the invitation, Prime Minister, but do not misrepresent our position. Here is a unique opportunity. It is an opportunity to implement your policy. It would seem that we are now in the ridiculous position whereby I am putting forward the Prime Minister's policy and he is rejecting it. I am proposing it, and you are rejecting it. This is absurd. 
Instead of starting the third term, Prime Minister, breaking yet another promise, seize the moment. Let us agree in the best interests of the parliament and the people to try to regain the public's respect. I urge the parliament to support Harry Jenkins so that we can commence the road to an independent Speaker and underpin a more modern Australian parliament. If my motion fails today and if Labor wins the next election, I will ensure that the Speaker is fully independent by implementing the policy that I have spelt out. I urge the parliament to get behind this motion and set the parliament on a modern path.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your re-election and say that I know that you will preside over this parliament with great dignity and fairness. It is an honour to be elected to this 40th Parliament, and it is an even greater honour to be asked to second this motion that Harry Jenkins be appointed Deputy Speaker. I endorse the words of the Leader of the Opposition, because without cooperation this parliament will not grow and flourish. What he has proposed is the first step toward this, and electing Harry Jenkins is also a step towards a better parliament.
There is no better candidate for the position of Deputy Speaker than Harry Jenkins. He has previously been the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker. I have served with him on committees, in caucus and in this parliament. Many of you have also served with him on committees and in this parliament and you know his great ability to resolve issues without creating conflict. He has compassion, humour and wit. He is a person that you can share confidences with and know that those confidences will stay with him. He is a man of substance, a very special person.
I just refer to what the member for Hinkler said. Unlike the member for Page, Harry Jenkins, whilst not suffering fools gladly, is prepared to suffer fools, and I think that that makes him very special and very suitable for the position of Deputy Speaker. In performing the role of Deputy Speaker, that is quite often what he is asked to do. As I was saying, no person in this parliament is better suited to that role. There is no person with a better knowledge of the standing orders and the operation of this parliament than Harry Jenkins.
Mr Speaker, I refer to your words of this morning when you thanked Harry Jenkins for the role that he played in the last parliament—and it was a very substantial role— and said that he was always there in a conciliatory role, with a non-confrontationist approach to resolving problems. That is what is needed in the role of Deputy Speaker. No person is more worthy or better qualified to fill that position. I urge members to support the motion and embrace the change, a change that will bring about parliamentary reform and a better future.
—In accordance with standing order 13, the bells will be rung and a ballot will be taken.
The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken—
—Order! The result of the ballot is: Mr Causley, 81 votes; Mr Jenkins, 66 votes. Mr Causley is appointed Deputy Speaker and Mr Jenkins shall be Second Deputy Speaker.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—On behalf of the government, I would like to congratulate the member for Page on being elected as Deputy Speaker. I know, particularly in the circumstances of the last parliament, when serving on the Speaker's Panel the newly appointed Deputy Speaker impressed many members with his grasp of the standing orders and his capacity to fairly adjudicate disputes and preside over debates in this chamber. He brings to the national parliament previous experience in the New South Wales parliament and as a minister in one of the coalition governments of that state. I wish him well and congratulate him.  
Whilst I am on my feet, may I extend my congratulations to the member for Scullin, who has been appointed the Second Deputy Speaker. He is a person we like and respect. We wish him well and we are sure that he will carry out his duties with considerable fairness and distinction. I think the House has made two very good choices in relation to the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, and we extend great goodwill to the member for Scullin. Many of us remember with affection his father, who was a Speaker of this House and a thoroughgoing gentleman. We wish the member for Scullin well, and I congratulate both him and the member for Page on their appointments. I know they will have the goodwill and the support of everybody in the chamber.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—I also congratulate the member for Page on becoming the Deputy Speaker of the House. I have had experience working with the member for Page in a previous role in ministerial councils, and we look forward to working with him. I also congratulate Harry Jenkins. I think that he will continue to perform the function of Second Deputy Speaker well, but we look forward to the opportunity, after the next election, of him perhaps becoming the first independent Speaker of this parliament.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2002-02-12,"—I too congratulate both gentlemen, particularly the member for Page, a colleague of mine who has had a very real commitment to rural and regional issues. I think he will bring a very deep understanding of parliamentary practice to this role, as well as his own unique and forceful style. I think he will be extremely adept and discharge his duties with very great distinction. I extend too my goodwill and congratulations to the member for Scullin and have no doubt that he will also add dignity to his position when he occupies it.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2002-02-12,"— Thank you, Mr Speaker, Prime Minister and colleagues. I thank the House for the great honour you have bestowed upon me. I feel privileged to have served in both the New South Wales parliament and the Australian parliament. It is one of those privileges, I suppose, that we enjoy because of the support of our electorates. I did learn quite a lot in the New South Wales parliament. The honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Cook both went into the New South Wales parliament on the same day as I did. I was educated well under Neville Wran and Speaker Kelly and I am sure that I learned very quickly the procedures of the house. 
I am sure that I will enjoy this position and I say to honourable members that I will give as fair a hearing to all members as possible and will uphold the standing orders of this place. I also congratulate the honourable member for Scullin. The honourable member for Scullin and I have served on several committees together and we have got on very well. I am sure we will continue to do that as the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker of this House. Thank you.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—Mr Speaker, can I first congratulate you on your re-election. I look forward to continuing to work with you in your role as Speaker. One of the things that we perhaps ask of presiding officers is consistency. This being the third ballot in which I have stood for Deputy Speaker, the third occasion I have run second and the third occasion I have been elected Second Deputy Speaker, I hope that that is not the only consistency that I display.
In all seriousness, I thank the House for the honour it has bestowed upon me. I am a little flattered and overwhelmed by some of the comments that have been made about me, but I can only hope that I can do the duties that will be asked of me, with the greatest impartiality I can muster. It is very important that those who relieve you in the chair do so, because it does make your task a lot easier. I look forward to working with the honourable member for Page in this new capacity. It is true that I have experience working with him on parliamentary committees. I believe that we have had a very good working relationship in those situations, and I look forward to that continuing.
—At the conclusion of this ballot, I congratulate the member for Page and the member for Scullin and say how much I look forward to working with them as part of the presiding officers' team in this parliament. ",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-02-12,"—I move:
That:
An address to Her Majesty The Queen in the following terms be agreed to:
YOUR MAJESTY:
We, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, have received with profound sorrow the news of the death of Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. On behalf of the Australian people, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other members of The Royal Family, especially Lord Linley and The Lady Sarah Chatto.
Australians will be aware of the death at the weekend of the person we knew as Princess Margaret, the Queen's younger sister. After a very long illness, she died at the age of 71. I know that the House will want to express its sympathy particularly to her sister and her 101-year-old mother. Whatever views people may have about the constitutional arrangements in this country, it cannot be denied that the Queen and the Queen Mother are two people who as individuals are held in great esteem and indeed in great affection by Australians in all walks of life and of all political persuasions. Older Australians in particular will have vivid memories of the young Queen and the young Princess Margaret during the World War II years, when, with their parents, the late King George VI and the Queen Mother, to many people not only in Britain but also throughout the British Commonwealth and throughout the free world, diminished as it was for so long by the apparent success of the Nazis and the Japanese, they represented a centre and focal point of many of the hopes of ordinary people.
By any measure, Princess Margaret, who was born on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle, the Scottish seat of her mother's forebears, lived a life of material and economic privilege. But, as is so often the case, people who are born into those circumstances do not always experience uninterrupted personal happiness and personal contentment and fulfilment. As I mentioned a moment ago, Australians of older generations will remember the two young princesses and the contribution that both of them made to the various charitable activities associated with the war effort in the United Kingdom and subsequently. Many Australians of that generation will also remember that, for a person whose proximity to the throne was naturally more distant than that of others, Princess Margaret made an exemplary sacrifice for duty in 1955 when, quite plainly out of deference to the wishes of her family and the teachings of the then Church of England, she renounced any intention of marrying Group Captain Townsend. It is instructing to read the words that were contained in her statement of October 1955. They may seem in today's age rather quaint and old-fashioned, but they indicate a degree of commitment to a values system that she was willing to uphold. She said:
... mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.
As we know, she was to go on and marry Antony Armstrong-Jones in Westminster Abbey in 1960, and that was a marriage that regrettably was dissolved in 1978. 
She was described as a person who was able to move in a circle of younger people whose way of life reflected the changes through which postwar society in Britain was gradually passing in a way that was denied to her sister the Queen. It was very plain throughout her life that she remained very close to her sister. The royal family is very much public property. When a marriage is dissolved in the royal family it is a matter which is splashed across the headlines of the tabloids and there is a privacy denied to people in that kind of position which is available to many other citizens. Her life was not without its areas of criticism, it was not without its behaviour that attracted disapproval from many people, but are there any of us who can argue that we do not live lives that might not from time to time, if they were fully known, attract the disapproval and criticism of others? I thought that Prince Charles spoke very movingly of his aunt's death when, in paying his tribute, he said: 
... it was hard, let alone for her to bear it, but for all of us as well, particularly as she had such a wonderfully free spirit. She loved life and lived it to the full.
He was speaking of the considerable pain and discomfort she suffered in the final years of her life, and that was apparent in her several appearances associated with the 100th birthday celebration for her mother and also on her mother's 101st birthday.
It ought to be recorded that, although certain other aspects of her life attracted a lot of publicity, she was a patron or the president of more than 80 organisations. She was very involved in the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Royal College of Nursing, Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, the Migraine Trust and Barnardo's, where she was president from 1948 until 1984.
At the height of her public activities in the late 1970s and early 1980s Princess Margaret was carrying out more than 300 engagements a year. She had an immense and very genuine interest in the arts, which at a young age included a talent for the piano as well as a fine singing voice. In 1957 she was made an honorary Doctor of Music of London University, and in that same year she became the first president of the Royal Ballet. She was a member of the royal family who had a very close identification with the world of entertainment and the film industry and many of the great stars of not only the United Kingdom but Hollywood as well.
Her death is a particular blow to her mother, made all the more poignant by the fact that the burial will take place on the 50th anniversary of the burial of the late King George VI, the Queen's father, a person whose sudden and unpredicted accession to the throne in 1936, on the abdication of King Edward VIII, changed the life of the then infant Princess Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth.
Many Australians met Princess Margaret on her two visits to Australia, in 1972 and 1975. She carried out those duties in a warm and friendly fashion. She was a vivacious person who enjoyed life to the full. In a privileged environment, against a background of being born into particularly atypical circumstances, her life contained its moments of happiness and its moments of sorrow. On behalf of the government, and I know on behalf of all members of the House, I extend particular condolences to her sister, Her Majesty the Queen, and to her mother. It is pleasing that the Queen's attendance at CHOGM and her visit to South Australia and Queensland will go ahead notwithstanding the death of her sister. On behalf of all members of the parliament, I extend to the Queen, to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and to Princess Margaret's two children our condolences and our sympathy, and we record our respect for the contribution she made to public life in the fulfilment of her duties as a member of the royal family.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon</title>",Condolences,16,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-02-12,"—I second the motion moved by the Prime Minister. It is a terrible tragedy when a mother loses a daughter, and members of the Labor Party express our deepest sympathies to the Queen Mother on the loss of her daughter, Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. Our thoughts and sympathies also go out to the Queen, who lost her only sister, and to Princess Margaret's children, Lord Linley and Lady Sarah, at this very sad time for all of them.
Princess Margaret visited Australia twice. In 1972 she toured Western Australia with her husband, Lord Snowdon, undertaking many formal duties, and she met many people, including indigenous Australians. On that trip she unveiled a commemorative plaque for the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, which was named in her honour. In 1975 she visited again to help commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps. She held a number of honorary commands in the British Armed Forces.
Princess Margaret did use her office for good public duties. She served a number of charities and public organisations that promoted the welfare of children. There was Barnardo's—the Prime Minister mentioned that for 36 years she was involved with that organisation—and also the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She also had very strong connections with nurses and the nursing profession, including the Royal College of Nursing and the National Council of Nurses of the United Kingdom. She had a long-term association with English and Scottish culture, including the Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet and the Sadler's Wells Foundation. 
But she will mostly be remembered for the way she lived her life, in particular her inability to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend. She was ahead of her times but she was also a victim of her times. Princess Margaret had much popular support over the marriage plans but not institutional or political support. Looking back at the history of that episode reminds us of how things have changed. The then cabinet, under Sir Winston Churchill, actually made it known that they would not approve the marriage because Captain Townsend had been divorced.
Thankfully, today we live in more enlightened times and it is hard to see today politicians involving themselves so directly in the private affairs of women in that way. Princess Margaret was a modern and defiant royal. Although it often made life difficult for her, by courting controversy and creating precedence, she helped gain sympathy for the difficulties faced by women in prominent public roles. Our sympathies go out to the family. She is a very sad loss for all of us.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon</title>",Condolences,16,1,speech
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2002-02-12,"—In joining in this condolence motion I know that I speak not only for my own party but for all members of the House and, I am sure, the overwhelming majority of Australians. Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret was born in 1930, as the Prime Minister referred to. It was a royal birth in the old style. There was the lighting of a huge beacon and there were 41 gun salutes all over the place. Church bells rang out all over England. Princess Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth seemed destined for a sheltered and comfortable life until their future changed dramatically in 1936, the year that began with the death of the old King George V and ended with the abdication of Edward VIII.
Elizabeth was suddenly the heir presumptive and the pomp of royal ritual closed in on the family. In her 20s, as has been alluded to here, Princess Margaret chose duty over her heart, a decision that unquestionably echoed through the rest of her life. Despite that, she carried out a very busy schedule of royal engagements, which included two visits to Australia, in 1972 and 1975. As has been mentioned here, at the height of her public engagements she carried out more than 300 functions and commitments a year.
It sometimes seems that our fascination with the glamour, the colour and sometimes the controversy—and certainly, when it exists, the tragedy—that attend the lives of those who are in that public eye allows us to too readily overlook important things like a sense of duty, a commitment to others and a willingness to put in many hours, often in self-sacrificial activities. Last year we celebrated the International Year of the Volunteer, a good thing to celebrate. Frankly, I was one Australian who was somewhat unaware, until I started to prepare for this motion, of the extent to which Princess Margaret really was prepared to make sacrifices in the interests of doing things for other people well beyond that which she might reasonably have been expected to make, notwithstanding her very high position.
Princess Margaret will be remembered not only for those charitable activities and her strong interest in them but also for her youth activities and her interest in the arts. As has been mentioned, she was also very prominent in the British National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children—of course, a work that all of us in this place would very strongly recognise and support. Princess Margaret had a long association with the Girl Guide movement which began in 1937 when she became a Brownie in the first Buckingham Palace Girl Guide troop. In later life, she was Chief Ranger of the Commonwealth and President of the Girl Guides Association. She had a close interest in the arts. She was first President of the Royal Ballet and patron of the Scottish Ballet. 
Princess Margaret is survived by two children from her marriage to the Earl of Snowdon—Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto. She emphasised that her children were not members of the royal family and that they were therefore able to develop their own talents in their own ways. Lord Linley became an accomplished cabinet-maker and his sister worked in the film industry before becoming a painter. As I said earlier, I know that all of us would join in expressing our sympathies to her children, to her family and to her many friends and admirers everywhere.
