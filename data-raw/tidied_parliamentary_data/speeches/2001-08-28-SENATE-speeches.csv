"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2001-08-28,"—Senator Allison asked me a question on 23 August concerning the management of radioactive waste from oil sludge. I seek leave to incorporate a response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
SENATOR ALLISON asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 23 August 2001:
My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources.  Is the minister aware that naturally occurring radioactive oil sludge from the Esso oil rig is proposed to be dumped in a municipal waste site just outside Sale, Victoria?  Does the minister have a view about the appropriateness of land based disposal of this radioactive material?  Has the government considered requiring this material to be reinjected into spent oil fields, as is done in parts of the UK and the US? 
Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, this is not a waste repository; this is a municipal dump where this radioactive material is proposed to be put. Would the minister also look at the question of oil rig workers in Western Australia who are being exposed to high levels of radioactive scale from oil rigs?  Is it not time for a national approach to properly dealing with this naturally occurring radioactive waste from oil drilling? 
SENATOR MINCHIN - The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
The Honourable Senator is not correct if she is suggesting that oil sludge waste from Gippsland oil rigs are a danger to the public, or that it is proposed to dump the sludge in a municipal dump. She is also not correct in asserting that this material would be disposed of down-well in the UK and the US. Finally she is not correct in asserting that workers in Western Australia are in danger from contact with radioactive materials produced with petroleum production.
There is a level of background radioactivity in all substances. The radioactivity level of the oily waste produced in Gippsland is comparable to that of granite used in, for instance, kitchen bench-tops. The Australian Nuclear Safety and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in 1986 assessed and surveyed the oily waste going to the Dutson Downs waste management facility. ANSTO found minimal levels of radioactivity and as a result the Victorian Department of Health advised Esso in 1987 they had no interest in regulating the waste. In 1999, Esso Australia Pty Ltd (Esso), in cooperation with the Victorian Department of Human Services, the Victorian Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) conducted comprehensive assessments of risk from naturally occurring radioactive materials. The Victorian Radiation Advisory Committee (RAC) concluded that the activities of Esso do not present a radiological hazard to workers, the general public, or the environment.  In fact, it represents less than 1% of Australian and internationally accepted limits for such exposure.
The Dutson Downs waste management facility employs landfill disposal of the sludge produced by petroleum operations. The landfill disposal method has been assessed by ARPANSA. On the basis of a review of this report by the RAC, the Victorian Department of Human Services accepted in November 2000 that the level of naturally occurring radioactive materials from Esso operations is very low in concentration and that landfill disposal will eliminate any hazard to human health or the environment. They have issued a notice of exemption to Esso for the disposal by landfill of solid waste. 
The Dutson Downs waste facility is not a municipal dump. Dutson Downs is licensed by the EPA as a prescribed waste facility. It is licensed to take oily waste, not radioactive materials. Nor is it intended to become a nuclear waste repository. To further improve the integrity of the waste, the operator of Dutson Downs, Gippsland Water Authority, proposes to establish a waste stabilisation plant for the treatment of oily residue wastes. Treatment of the waste in this plant is needed to reduce the hazard associated with oil contamination (not radiation) prior to disposal. Further, the treated waste will only be disposed of in a dedicated specially lined cell to further reduce any potential hazard from oily contamination. In other words, this upgrade has nothing to do with the level of radioactivity.
NORM waste of the same level as that produced in Gippsland would not be reinjected in the UK or US. Only much higher radiation level material is reinjected. 
The safety of Western Australian workers is not at risk. Australian petroleum safety legislation for offshore exploration and production requires that potential hazards are identified, assessed and adequately managed. Geological conditions in the main Western Australian petroleum producing regions do not present major management problems. The risk potential from naturally occurring radioactive materials accumulating to dangerous levels in petroleum operations in Western Australia is considered to be very low. Where radioactive scale is known to accumulate, routine measuring is carried out to monitor and assess the risk. This material usually has a very low level of radiation, less than that of a sport or diver's fluorescent wristwatch. There have been no reported safety incidents related to management of radiation in the petroleum industry in Western Australia.
Finally, with respect to a national approach to dealing with the regulation of naturally occurring radioactive materials from the mining and mineral processing industries, this is a matter for the Minister for Health and Aged Care. However, I am advised that ARPANSA is currently working with states and territories to revise relevant Codes of Practice. 
The new Code of Practice and Safety Guide “Radiation Protection and Radioactive Waste Management in Mining and Mineral Processing 2002”, currently being drafted, deals with the mining and processing of ores for the production of uranium and thorium, but may also be applied to other mining and mineral processing operations, such as those in oil and gas operations.
In addition, a fundamental principle of the regulation of oil and gas operations is that they not present a hazard to workers, the general public, or to the environment. Regulatory processes in place ensure that all risks are identified, assessed and adequately managed.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Environment: Management of Radioactive Waste from Oil Sludge</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-28,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001,
Health and Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001,
Industry, Science and Resources Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001,
Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001,
States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, and the
Wool International Amendment Bill 2001.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGIS-LATION AMENDMENT (APPLIC-ATION OF CRIM-INAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Criminal Code has general principles that will apply to all Commonwealth offences from 15 December 2001. Some offences will require adjustment to ensure that after that date they operate in the way they were originally intended.
The Bill will make the relevant adjustments to Family and Community Services portfolio legislation.
Reasons for Urgency
It is critical that the Bill receive passage in the 2001 Spring Sittings so that the adjustments are made prior to the commencement of the Criminal Code in December 2001.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Family and Community Services)
—————
HEALTH AND AGED CARE LEGISLATION AMEND--MENT (APPLICATION OF CRIM-INAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will adjust offence provisions in legislation in the Health and Aged Care portfolio to ensure they operate as intended when the Criminal Code applies to them from 15 December 2001.
Reasons for Urgency
When the Criminal Code commences on 15 December 2001, the provisions contained in the Code will govern the interpretation of all Commonwealth offence provisions. It is therefore essential for offence provisions in the Health and Aged Care portfolio to be updated by that time, so that they are in line with the Code.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Health and Aged Care)
—————
INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND RESOURCES LEGIS-LATION AMENDMENT (APPLIC-ATION OF CRIM-INAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The purpose of the Bill is to amend portfolio legislation containing criminal offences to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The Criminal Code contains general principles of criminal responsibility which will apply to all Commonwealth offences.
Reason for Urgency
The Criminal Code is scheduled to apply to all Commonwealth offences on 15 December 2001. It is critical that all necessary harmonisation adjustments to portfolio legislation be made by that date.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources)
—————
INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGIS-LATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will:
·	implement the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) as announced in Backing Australia's Ability;
·	give the Minister discretion to impose a cap on the aggregate level of student debt under the Higher Education Contributions Scheme, the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme and PELS;
·	allow higher education institutions more flexibility in using electronic communications;
·	and make technical adjustments to funding levels in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 (HEFA).
Reasons for Urgency
Passage is required as early as possible in the Spring sittings to ensure that the legislative framework for PELS is in place in time for the scheme to commence at the beginning of the 2002 academic year.
Advice from universities indicates that implementation of PELS will require a sizeable investment in administrative systems. These investments require a reasonable lead time. The Scheme also needs to be marketed early enough for potential students to be aware of the availability of loans for postgraduate coursework fees under the Scheme beginning in 2002.
In relation to HEFA funding adjustments, passage is required in the Spring sittings to enable payments for workplace reform to be made to all eligible higher education institutions in 2001 and early 2002 and payments for superannuation contributions to be made in early 2002.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs)
—————
STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECON-DARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMEN-DMENT BILL (No. 2) 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will amend the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 to increase funding in Schedule 7, column 2, by $9.534 million over the program years 2001-2004, for establishment assistance for new schools.
Reasons for Urgency
The measures contained in the Bill were originally included as Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 (IELAB), introduced in the House of Representatives on 5 April 2001. Because IELAB was not passed by the Parliament in the Winter sittings, some schools will not be paid their 50% establishment grant entitlement. If the Bill is not passed early in the 2001 Spring sittings, the scheduled October 2001 payments will not be made, further delaying the payment of the 50% entitlement to affected schools. If the Bill is not passed at all the implications are more severe, as the affected schools would receive no payments in 2001. In addition, failure to pass the Bill will lead to difficulties with payments in future years.
It is highly desirable that funding for the programme continue with minimal delay or disruption.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs)
—————
WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will allow the final cash distribution to shareholders and winding up of WoolStock Australia Ltd (formerly the statutory authority, Wool International) as soon as practicable after the last stockpile wool is disposed of, rather than after the end of the financial year in which the last stockpile of wool is disposed of, as is currently required.
Reasons for Urgency
The wool stockpile is projected to be sold down during the first quarter of the new financial year (ie between July and September 2001). There is currently a requirement under paragraph 22P(2)(b) of the Wool International Act 1993 for the final cash distribution to WoolStock Australia Ltd shareholders to take place “as soon as practicable after the end of the financial year in which the last stockpile of wool is disposed of”. This would mean that the earliest the final distribution could take place, given the current selling projections, would be after July 2002. The intention was to ensure that the final distribution to shareholders would be based on the final set of audited financial accounts for WoolStock Australia Ltd, following the end of the financial year in which the last wool was sold. Given the expected timing of the last sale, WoolStock Australia Ltd has now advised that this provision would delay the final distribution and winding up considerably (between 8 and 10 months, depending on the exact timing of the final sale).
The Bill will allow the final cash distribution to shareholders of WoolStock Australia Ltd to proceed as soon as the final accounts are prepared, audited, approved by the Board, and shareholders notified of the intended distributions. This will also avoid an unnecessary delay to the end of WoolStock Australia Ltd's role as stockpile liquidator. WoolStock Australia Ltd's shareholders are largely the woolgrowers that contributed to repaying the significant debt associated with the accumulation of the wool stockpile.

That the Senate calls on the Government, by 5 pm on 29 August 2001, to inform the Senate of the exact map coordinates of the site at which the Norwegian ship, the Tampa, rescued more than 400 people from a sinking boat between Christmas Island and Indonesia in the week beginning 26 August 2001.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,3,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-28,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The Government's decision to refuse entry to the Norwegian vessel The Tampa carrying asylum seekers, and the need for the Government to honour its international obligations concerning the rights of refugees, and allow the asylum seekers into Australia to receive medical attention and be assessed for refugee status.
This is indeed an urgent matter, and I think it is quite appropriate for the Senate to be debating it. This is an unprecedented situation and I think one that is a very dangerous step in what is undoubtedly a very contentious area of public policy. It is worth noting commentary from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson that has just come through on the wire stating that this is the first time that Australia has refused accommodation to people rescued at sea. Whilst we certainly hope that indications and reports that are coming through that Indonesia may accept these people do bear some fruit, I think the damage has already been done, firstly, regarding the precedent in relation to rescuing people at sea and refusing them entry into a nearby port where they quite clearly could be dropped off, and, secondly, I think because of the obvious situation that if this was any group of people other than asylum seekers there is no doubt that this issue would not be arising. Quite clearly, this government is acting purely because of the nature of these people. Again I think that sends a very dangerous signal and sets a very dangerous precedent in terms of where Australia is going in relation to refugee issues. 
Of course, we have the added situation of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs this afternoon—probably around about now—tabling new legislation in the House of Representatives which seeks to further restrict the definition of a refugee. I think that again sends a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world about how we address and deal with refugees and asylum seekers. It generates great concern on the part of the Democrats and many other people in the Australian community who believe that there is not just an obligation but indeed a real necessity to ensure that public policy measures are informed by morality and humanity and that we do not adopt the policy approach, the political approach, that involves a race to the bottom with other countries around the globe to see who can be the most hard-hearted, who can treat asylum seekers the harshest, as some sort of suggested way to stop them from arriving here.
This minister has done any number of things in the last few years—many of them, although not all, supported by the opposition—to make life very difficult for refugees and asylum seekers, and he continues to try to make it harder and harder for them. He has said repeatedly that our unique approach of mandatory detention is in part a disincentive to people, that it is trying to send a message to them that they should not come here. Yet obviously that is not working. The whole policy approach of this government in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees is clearly not working. It is not reducing the number of people coming here; it is increasing antagonism within the community, it is increasing the suffering involved for the people and it is increasing the cost to the taxpayer. We now have this latest situation where we are sending an increasingly dangerous message to seafarers about how they should react to boats in distress. It does evoke some concerning analogies. A few years ago, I recall, there was a barge loaded with toxic waste sailing around the United States trying to find a port that would take that cargo, but no port would take it. I think we have reached the unfortunate situation where that is the way we are now treating asylum seekers—as though they are just human garbage that nobody wants to take and that everybody wants to have dumped somewhere else. That is not going to solve what is a global problem and what is a difficult issue. We need to have a better approach.
It is also sending a very dangerous signal in terms of the calls that repeatedly come from the community—and all of us here get them—about boat arrivals, that is, we should tow them back out to sea, that we should send them back where they came from, that we should sink their boats, that we should send out F111s against them, and all sorts of other extremist responses. Here we have a situation where the government has stopped them coming in and is sending them back. We are now going to be in the situation where those people in the community who hold such views will be saying, `Well, if you can do it with this boatload of people, why can't you do it with the other boats that arrive? They also have Indonesian crews; they also come from Indonesia; what is the difference? Why don't you stop them? Refuse them entry and send them back.' Again it sets a very dangerous precedent, as the UNHCR itself has noted.
I think we should have much more empathy for these people. The absence of empathy was famously entitled `the genesis of evil' in the Nuremberg trials. We really do need to examine where we are going before we go further down what is a very dangerous path. I do not think we want to have an election played on the race card. We have had debate about people putting One Nation last on their how-to-vote cards. There is not much point putting them last on how-to-vote cards if we are going to adopt their policies at the same time. We do need to heed calls from church leaders and from other community organisations around the country to ensure that we do have a more humane approach to this issue and that we do not simply approach it from the point of view of seeing how hardline and how hard-hearted we can be, and how miserable we can make life for people who have already suffered enormously.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-28,"—It is very strange to hear Senator Bartlett talking about people going down a dangerous line. Having read his motion, I think it is possible that Senator Bartlett and the Democrats are going down a dangerous line when they use such inflammatory language as `hard-hearted' and `Nuremberg trials' and all of the other things that only serve to inflame and incite the wrong attitude amongst opinion in Australia. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, although you would already know it, that Australia has a record in relation to caring for refugees which I think everybody in this Australian parliament should be proud of. There is no nation in the last 50 years that has been more generous or more decent towards refugees than Australia. We need not look at just recent times; we ought to look back 50 years, which was before Senator Bartlett was born and about 20-odd years before his leader was born. Many of our Australian citizens today came here through the refugee program, and they came through the proper process.
Senator Bartlett talks about us being `hard-hearted'. I wonder what he means when he says that we `further restrict the definition of refugee'. In fact, in recent times the definition of `refugee' has expanded in Australia—it has become much softer. Whereas some 20-odd years ago the department of immigration were the final arbiters in determining whether or not a person was a refugee, now they can appeal to the courts and there is a far wider definition of `refugee' than there was some 20-odd years ago. To talk about further restricting the definition of `refugee' is just nonsense. 
Senator Bartlett talks about boats at sea. He talks about this boat as though everybody on board it is a genuine asylum seeker. We do not know who is on this boat. All we know is that it has come from Indonesia, it was heading towards Australia, but it got into some serious difficulties. Senator Bartlett's motion says that the boat is carrying asylum seekers—he is assuming that, to start with. He says:
... the need for the Government to honour its international obligations concerning the rights of refugees, and allow the asylum seekers—
again, he is presuming that everybody on board that boat is an asylum seeker—
into Australia to receive medical attention and be assessed for refugee status.
Senator Bartlett should really stick to the facts so that we really know what has happened in this situation. In fact, in most of the elements that he is talking about, the Australian government is already doing many of these things. I understand that there is going to be an amendment to this motion which probably sets things down in a much more orderly fashion. Hopefully, the Australian government will achieve all the things that will be proposed.
The real point is that this Norwegian freighter rescued 434 unauthorised arrivals from their disabled vessel on Sunday, 26 August—that is a fact. Having rescued the individuals, the freighter was proceeding to the Indonesian port of Merak at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authority—that is a fact; that is where it was proceeding. We understand that the freighter subsequently turned back to Christmas Island at the insistence and the threatening of the rescued individuals. So people are rescued on the high seas on their way to Indonesia—to where the boat was travelling—but, at the insistence of those individuals, the boat turns around and heads for Christmas Island. 
The government has requested that the Tampa, the Norwegian freighter, not enter Australian territorial waters and continue on its way to Indonesia. Australia is continuing to seek the assistance of the Norwegian and Indonesian governments to secure an acceptable solution for all concerned. That is the way it should be treated, not like the motion that Senator Bartlett puts up or that the Democrats support.
The Democrats would let everybody into Australia, regardless of who they were. Anybody who wants to come to Australia should not be mandatorily detained, according to the Democrats. We should let them all in and see what happens after they get here. Whether they are processed after they get here or whether there is some form of process, we simply do not know, but they would let anybody in. In fact, both the government and the opposition have a policy of mandatory detention so that these people can be processed, so that we can sort out, from amongst those people who are coming into Australia, who are genuine refugees and who are not. That is where the Democrats fall down. They take it on face value that everybody who applies for asylum in Australia is a genuine refugee. In fact, we know that simply is not the case because, if it were the case, we would not have the numbers of applications rejected that have been rejected over the past few years.
When he talks about applications for refugee status, it is interesting to note that the UNHCR, in their own assessment of Afghanis who are attempting to seek refugee status in Australia or anywhere else, assessed that only about 14 per cent of the people who apply for refugee status from Afghanistan are actually refugees. Compare that with Australia's record with regard to people from Afghanistan who come to Australia under the guise of asylum seekers and who apply here for refugee status. Australia accepts some 84 per cent of people from Afghanistan as refugees, as against the assessment of the UNHCR that only 14 per cent of those who apply are genuine refugees. So anybody who suggests that Australia is not meeting its human rights obligations in relation to people who are attempting to seek refugee status as asylum seekers in Australia certainly has a lot to answer for.
Amongst other things, the urgency motion talks about asylum seekers receiving medical attention. Australian personnel are already being flown to Christmas Island by Hercules aircraft to provide humanitarian assistance—such as food, water, medical supplies and safety equipment or any of the things that may be required. There is a doctor on Christmas Island who is available to provide medical assistance. What more do they expect us to do for these people? The government is currently trying to source a helicopter with winching capacity to transfer any necessary supplies or other assistance from Christmas Island to the Tampa if necessary and, as well as that, the HMAS Arunta has been directed to proceed there with all possible speed to render any further assistance that might be necessary.
We have a container ship—the Tampa is a container ship—that is berthed in international waters off Christmas Island and it is suggested that this container ship should go into Christmas Island. It simply cannot. There is no provision on Christmas Island for receiving container ships. People would have to be transferred from the high seas in barges—that is the only way that anybody could get on there—and the nearest place that can accept the container ship is the Indonesian port. That is the nearest point of possible disembarkation, and they can get there within 12 hours. It is only because the captain was forced that they came back towards Christmas Island. I have been advised that Christmas Island does not lend itself to receiving a container vessel. Vessels cannot come close to the island or any of the points at which food or other material for sustenance could be received. People could only be carried off in barges and it is quite an unsuitable destination.
We heard Senator Bartlett talking about the terrible conditions that people are living in in our detention centres. As a member of a committee that has visited each of our detention centres, I would describe the conditions as spartan—and so they should be. He says that we are sending out a disincentive for people to come. I think we should be sending out a disincentive for people to come through illegal channels. All they are doing is taking the place of genuine refugees who do not have $US5,000 or $US10,000 to pay a people smuggler to get here. There are people in camps overseas who are going through the proper process. At some stage last year, that processing was suspended because of the numbers of people coming here. We hope that that does not happen again, because there are people going through the proper processes who should receive some priority—not people who have the money to pay criminals to get on boats and come to Australia. It is important that we remember that when we are thinking about the whole situation of arrivals coming into Australia.
It is most important that there is a disincentive for people to try to come to Australia this way. There are proper channels. We need to bear in mind that, among those seeking asylum, we have people with criminal records, people who are security risks and people who are simply circumventing the normal migration channels in order to come to Australia. It is not fair that people who should go through the normal processes are short-cutting, coming to Australia by unauthorised means and seeking to receive proper attention and due care from the Australian people. I want refugees that come to this country to be genuine refugees and to come through the proper process so that we can show them the compassion we have always shown over the last 50 years as an Australian parliament.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-28,"—by leave—I move:
Omit all words after “the Tampa,”, substitute:
carrying asylum seekers, and the need for the Government to:
	(a)	coordinate a process with the United Nations, Norway and Indonesia to manage a resolution to the current impasse in accordance with inter-national law;
	(b)	provide interim assistance for the humanitarian needs and safety of asylum seekers and the crew on board; and
	(c)	acknowledge the humanitarian acts of the Norwegian Master and his crew,
and for the international community to follow their compassionate lead.
The opposition cannot support the Australian Democrats' position, which is a simplistic response to an enormous problem. We cannot do what they want. We say to them and to the government that we do not walk away from this issue. We acknowledge that—just as the government says that Indonesia and Norway have to sort it out—Australia also has a responsibility in this area. I speak with a degree of bemusement that this issue has been raised by the Australian Democrats. Following on from what Senator Ferguson said, for quite some time, particularly under John Coulter, the Democrats were a single issue migration policy party. They did not have—and probably still do not have—a balanced immigration policy. Essentially, their view was that they would defend asylum seekers who came by boat, but under former Senator Coulter they had a view that a wider migration program was contrary to the interests of Australia because of the environmental impacts. 
Our view is that you have to have a balanced migration program. It is important for our social and economic development. It needs to be balanced and needs to accommodate all elements—family, economic, refugee and humanitarian—not just asylum seekers. To be fair and balanced, it has to be fair for all. It has to provide access for all and acknowledge that different driving forces mean that a country like Australia needs migrants and that migrants can find a future in this country.
This matter of urgency is not the simple issue that the Australian Democrats would like us to believe; it is riddled with a diverse range of issues confronting this country. It goes to national sovereignty, it confronts our legal system, it raises issues of international relations—regional and in a wider sense—and it goes to our international reputation. An issue like this needs to be debated in the community and not just on talkback radio programs. The debate needs to be informed, otherwise we will go down the wrong road and find ourselves in policy turmoil with situations that we will not be able to handle. Driven by talkback radio and the talk jocks, we will find ourselves in an impasse and not able to get out. That is why there needs to be a better understanding of the issues in the community than we have had so far.
I indicate to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, that taking cheap passing shots at the opposition and at parliament because some of the government's legislation has not been passed by this parliament is not the way to handle this issue. It is a complex issue. We need to send the right messages out to the rest of the world. By bagging the opposition and by bagging parliament, not only does the Prime Minister demean his position but also he blurs the messages that he sends to the rest of the world.
I speak on this issue with a degree of experience, having had to confront similar problems in the past as minister for immigration. We handle them somewhat differently. I had an influx of boat people before Christmas one year in numbers that we had not seen in Australia before then—apart from the Vietnamese influx in the mid-1970s—numbers which have been surpassed by recent events. I was able to draw on the experience of people like Chris Conybeare, Dennis Richardson—currently head of ASIO—Mark Sullivan and experienced staff, and we were able to handle the issue differently. I suggest to the minister that he needs to look at that experience and handle this issue differently. Yesterday, Kim Beazley backed the government. The Labor Party takes that position because, as Kim Beazley says, it is legally and technically correct. But we are also concerned about Australia having a responsibility for the health and safety of those on board—not just the potential asylum seekers but also the crew. There are issues in this debate that have been ignored. In recent months, watching the debate continue and watching the minister handle the issue, I have become more frustrated by the way he has handled this problem. The problem now facing Australia is greater than it needed to be because the minister has botched the broader issue of asylum seekers.
Our most recent influx has come predominantly from the Middle East, but Middle East asylum seekers and refugees in this country are not a new problem. I can remember going to places like Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Israel and being confronted by migration officers with story after story about the sorts of abuse that people were being subjected to in surrounding countries. There were people from Iraq, Iran and Sudan who were seeking access to Australia. From Muslims to Coptics, there were people wanting to come here. What was our response then? Our response then was to do two things: to increase the number of people who could come through an orderly process from the Middle East and to ensure that there was quick access. I was confronted with stories of young, professional medical women who were dragged overnight out of the countries in which they were—occasioning risk to our migration officers—because they were going to be raped. I heard the story of a leading boxer in one country who was going to have his hands cut off. But our people went in, our people made themselves available and our people helped him get out.
There is a legitimate need for people to come from the Middle East, and I think there is a legitimate demand on government to ensure access to our offshore orderly processes. I have a painting in my office which was given to me at the end of 1995 by a refugee from Iraq. I will not give it away—it was important to him and it is important to me as a token which continues to remind me of those days—but I cannot bear to look at it and I turn it the other way, because it is this painter's depiction of life in the community from which he came. It is a pretty ugly, dastardly depiction of what this person had to go through and what his family and friends had to go through. You are looking at a painting with disembowelment and with all sorts of acts of torture perpetrated on people. He was just one person who came to Australia and has made a life for himself here. That person and that painting are continual reminders to me that we really have to ensure that when we deal with people in these circumstances we acknowledge there is a human element.
Philip Ruddock has not met that challenge. What has he done? He has cut down the actual numbers available and he has cut down regional access. He has presented a biased picture of the people who are actually coming here. As a former minister, I say to him: don't raise the bar too high for yourself. You have raised the bar too high already. There are individual stories that the Australian public needs to be told, individual stories that people carry with them which have driven them to come and seek refuge in this country. As the minister says, 85 per cent are genuine refugees. But don't let the debate be hijacked by your rhetoric about the 15 per cent that are not. Let the public know about some of the real stories about the 85 per cent that are. Educate the public. Let them feel as if they are part of the humanitarian response to the savagery in some parts of the Middle East. How can we go to war, for instance, against Saddam Hussein and call him a tyrant but not acknowledge that there are victims of his tyranny and that those victims are seeking assistance from Australia? Provide the resources. Try and stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals in Australia by accommodating this in the way we used to accommodate it offshore in the Middle East, and don't make the access so difficult. Immediate access is so important for some of these people. You cannot have an 85 per cent approval rate under our government's `hands off from ministerial intervention' system without having some genuine cases come to Australia.
We need to have a much more balanced debate. If we were to have a much more balanced debate, we would be able to better handle the situation we have now. In the current situation, we have to keep in mind that relations with Indonesia are important. From my experience, we used to have ongoing, almost weekly, contact. We had mechanisms and structures in place. We had early notice. We had assistance from the Indonesians. We worked cooperatively. The relationship with Indonesia is important, and the way we have confronted them over the last 48 hours does not help. In fact, you could say that we are provoking a collapse in that relationship by shunting the problem off to the Indonesians.
John Howard went to Indonesia a few weeks ago. A fickle gallery decided that, because he delivered a block of King Island brie to President Megawati Sukarno, relations were back on a footing. It is going to take more than a block of King Island brie to get them back on a footing after the last 48 hours. We cannot underestimate the importance of those relationships, relationships which are critical generally and critical when it comes to boat arrivals. The foreign policy implications are also critical. We need to have ongoing good relations with the UNHCR. We need to be able to select people abroad. They have offered assistance in the last 12 hours or so. We do not want that organisation to feel as if they have been set up or doublecrossed by the Australian government. In that context, relations with Europe are important. Norway may feel offended at the moment, and they have an impact that ripples through the Scandinavian countries and through the rest of Europe. We must acknowledge that we need to ensure that our relationships with them are an important plank of our status and credibility in Europe. As I said, there are foreign policy implications, but the international image is also affected.
At the end of the day, we have a problem in this country, and it cannot be treated in the way the Australian Democrats are asking us to, not just in respect of these people but in respect of the people who have come over recent months. Do we send the failed asylum seekers back to tyrants like Saddam Hussein? That is question No. 1. Do we send the 12-year-old kid who was on the Four Corners program the other week back to Saddam Hussein and his tyranny? We must ask not only, `Do we send them back?' but `Can we send them back?' Iraq will not take them back, and if they did would we be satisfied that they would be safe? The government has tried other countries in the region as staging posts. Can we send them there and then work out where they go thereafter? Those countries have quite rightly said that is not on. Airlines, of course, do not take people without adequate documentation, especially if no country will receive them. I think it is important for the immigration minister to keep that end game in mind. What does he do with failed asylum seekers?
It is okay to go on talkback programs—as he and the Prime Minister would like to do—and respond to that feeling in the community which basically says, `They've got no right to be here, let's shunt them off pretty quickly,' but this is a problem that Phillip Ruddock may not be around to handle in a few months time. However, it is a problem that the Australian people have to face. Where will we send those people who are left in detention—those 15 out of 100 asylum seekers—who do not pass? Will John Howard send this 12-year-old back to Iraq, back to Saddam Hussein? That is a real live issue that we will have to confront. Will he send the parents? What do we do? When do we stop passing the parcel with these people? This is not a theoretical question and it is not a rhetorical question. This is a real live question that immigration ministers in this country have been facing for quite some time, but now we have it on a much bigger magnitude. It is a real live issue that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Prime Minister have to confront in the interests of Australia.
The government needs, as I suggested, to have those resources offshore to stem the tide and draw the line clearly between those who are bona fide and those who are not. But, at the end of the day, let us acknowledge in all our rhetoric that, on the basis of 15 per cent, we will be left with some thousand or so people who will not have a place to go to or an airline to take them; we will be basically caught with them. How do we educate our public? How do we make them more aware of the fact that those real live situations will be here for us to handle? We should not do it in the way the Australian Democrats suggest; we should do it internationally in cooperation with UNHCR and countries like Norway and Indonesia. I commend the opposition amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Refugees: Norwegian Ship</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-28,"—I agree with Senator Bolkus that the issue of people coming out of the Middle East is very important. We all have to think very carefully about the issue and consider its implications as well as the fate of the people involved. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Philip Ruddock, has done an excellent job in perhaps one of the most difficult of government portfolios. I have nothing but praise for the way in which he and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs have handled the avalanche of people who are coming to Australia from the Middle East in particular.
Australia has an outstanding record with respect to refugees. From back in the 1930s to the post World War II era, Australia has accepted large numbers of refugees. At the present time, I am told, there is somewhere around 23 million people in the world who have left their home countries. That is an enormous number of people. Australia can proudly say that it has played its role in looking after its share of the refugees of the world. But Australia is a quite a small country with limited resources. We have a population of only 19 million, and there is only so much we can do.
Australia has an intake quota of 10,000 refugees per year who come through the assessment processes of the United Nations, the Red Cross and other such agencies. When people come through those assessment processes, they are screened for health, criminal records and political associations. Some of the people who claim to be refugees of course are not refugees. Some of them are criminals, some of them are spies, some of them are political agents of repressive regimes, some of them have health problems that we would not want to have in Australia and some of them are not who they claim to be. Sometimes they claim to be citizens of a country but they bring no documents to Australia, although they obviously needed them to get onto an aircraft or a vessel to come to Australia. In fact, they come from a country other than the country they claim to be from, and they claim refugee status because of persecution in the country they falsely claim to come from. So there is much to be said for the process of assessing refugees in an orderly way. 
The extra people who are coming in via the back door, through Indonesia and on the boats, are not going through that process. This group of people on the Norwegian boat off Christmas Island are an example of that. These people were on a boat in the Indonesian search and rescue zone. They were six hours from Merak, an Indonesian port on the south side of Java, when they were picked up. It would have been very easy for the master of the vessel to take them back to Indonesia but, under duress, he was asked to take them to Christmas Island, which he did. The point has to be made that these people have never entered Australia. There is no question, therefore, that Australia has any legal obligation to them. There is no question of our having an international law requirement to admit them to this country or to assess their claims of being refugees. These people have come from Indonesia and, under international law, they should go back to Indonesia. Nevertheless, Australia does recognise that the 430-odd people on this boat do need food and medical attention. Arrangements have been made for food and medical attention to be provided to the people on the boat for as long as they remain in the waters around Christmas Island.
We have to ask ourselves why these people come to Australia in this way. They come to Australia because our assessment system for refugee status is easier than that in the camps run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross. In Indonesia, only 14 per cent of Afghanis are assessed as refugees against United Nations criteria. When these same people come to Australia and they have gone through a process of assessment in the detention centres, and then into a series of legal appeals that are available to them under the Australian legal system, the percentage that are assessed as refugees rises to 85 per cent. Australia is a country where it is pretty easy to get refugee status compared with many other countries in the world, because our legal system has extended the criteria of the United Nations.
People also come here because Australia is a country with a good social security system and a good education system and it is an ideal place to live. But, as I said at the beginning, Australia is a country with limited resources. We have a fine record in terms of looking after refugees. We have done our bit. We have a quota of 10,000 a year, and we simply cannot have an open-ended policy of admitting people who come through the back door, through Ashmore Reef or through Christmas Island, and letting them be assessed with the expectation of remaining here as refugees. Australia, as we know, with the influx in recent weeks has just about reached the end of its resources. It is time we gave consideration to how we are going to deal with this. 
I understand the Indonesians have acknowledged that they have certain responsibilities to the people who are entering their country and claiming to be refugees on their way to Australia. I endorse Senator Bolkus's view that more should be done to assess these people offshore and a different methodology should be used. I believe the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a bigger role to play and I would urge the United Nations to do that. Australia is doing its bit. The minister has done a great job, and I think that in this case these people should be returned to Indonesia after they have received appropriate medical care and attention, if that is needed.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Refugees: Norwegian Ship</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-08-28,"—I am pleased to be joining in this urgency debate this afternoon. I am sorry we are having an urgency debate. I agree it is a debate we have to have and it is indeed urgent. It is urgent because there is a ship anchored off Christmas Island, an Australian territory. But it is also urgent because the detention centres in Australia are in a state of crisis and it is urgent because of the large numbers of people who are seeking to enter this country illegally, particularly over the last week or so. I would like to have seen Senator Bartlett in the chamber because I want to respond to a few of the matters that Senator Bartlett addressed in moving the urgency motion.
Before I do that, can I give the chamber a bit of good news. While I have been sitting here listening to the debate, I have had some good news about a family that I and my office have been working desperately hard to get into Australia. I am talking about the wife and children of Salah—I will not use the surname of the person because he is already in this country—who, as the debate went on here, have been issued with tickets out of Syria to enter Australia and join their husband and father. Salah entered Australia in March of last year as a refugee after 2½ years of trying. It took 2½ years to get him in, and when we finally got him into Australia as a refugee, to be reunited with his sister who had previously entered into this country as a refugee—they are of Iraqi nationality; they are Kurds—he did not know at that time if his wife and children were alive or not or, if they were alive, where they were. Through the good offices of the International Red Cross, his family were found in Syria and after his residency was sorted out he returned and joined them briefly to ensure that they were okay when he found out they were alive. Now they have been issued with tickets. 
Although in Australian law there is a right for refugees to be joined by their family members if they were indeed family members at the time of the grant of refugee status, the wife and the five children aged six to 16 were not going to be granted refugee status in this country because there was no room for them. Why was there no room for them? Because others who have got the resources and got the funds to pay people smugglers got here and jumped in front of the queue. For those who say there is no queue, I direct their attention to that particular constituent of mine with whom we have been working for four years to get him and his family into this country. I would ask them to join me when Veyan, the sister—again I am not using the surname—sits in my office with tears flowing out of her eyes, not only for this brother and sister-in-law and her nieces and nephews but for her other brothers in other parts of Europe, having fled in desperate straits and with no ability to work. I would ask them to join me with them and tell them that there is no queue and that those who have the resources to pay the people smugglers can jump to the head of it and have their cases put first.
We have an urgent situation on our hands at the moment. It is a situation that I do not believe is of Australia's making. I am only going on news reports because I have no entree into either the minister's office or the offices of the UNHCR or of the two other governments that are involved in the issue we are dealing with at the moment. As I understand it, there was a boat making its way to Australia which got into trouble. There was a ship in the vicinity, the master of which exercised his responsibilities under the international Law of the Sea and went and rescued those 400-odd people. He rescued them; he took them from the water and gave them temporary sanctuary on board his vessel. Then what happened? As the ship's master—as I understood what he said on radio yesterday—steamed to a safe port, his ship was diverted. Who was it diverted by? By the very people he had rescued, whose lives he had just saved, who determined, `Uh, oh, we don't want to go where you want to take us or where the international Law of the Sea directs us to. We want to go where we want to go.' I am not saying that that is an act of piracy, but I do know that when a ship is apprehended on the high seas and control is taken away from its master it does verge on piracy. The master, as he was reported on radio yesterday and today, was fearful for his vessel and for members of his crew. I think, as is in the amendment to this motion moved by the Australian Labor Party, he is indeed to be commended for his humanitarian act.
This debate is urgent for a number of other reasons as well, none the least being that there are a number of human beings on the high seas who are, it would seem, in need of care and protection. But what are they? Are they refugees, asylum seekers or migrants? A number of senators who have entered into this debate, including the mover of the motion, Senator Bartlett, need to understand what we are talking about. They also need to address the definitions we are talking about in this matter. In recent times I have been very pleased to talk with the Reverend Professor James Haire from the National Assembly of the Uniting Church of Australia. He provided me with a policy paper entitled `Asylum Seeker and Refugee Policy Paper'. On page 2 of that policy paper Reverend Haire gives a definition of a refugee and an asylum seeker and explains the difference between migrants and asylum seekers. I am grateful that a church group has done this, because all too often in the debate that has raged on this subject—certainly during my service in this parliament—there have been great mix-ups and misunderstandings, including by church groups, about the various terms that are used. If an individual such as Sadiq Elmi, who featured very prominently in an inquiry of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee last year, puts his hand up and says, `I am a refugee,' there are many in our community, including church groups, who say, `That person is a refugee because he says he is a refugee.' There are laws that determine whether a person is a refugee or not a refugee and there are also conventions of the international world that go to these determinations as well. I would commend to honourable senators this policy paper from the National Assembly of the Uniting Church of Australia on asylum seekers and refugees and, in particular, to the definitions that are contained within it.
Reference has been made in this strange urgency motion debate to some of the comments that have emanated from the Prime Minister and indeed from Minister Ruddock. In particular, Senator Bolkus talked of the minister trying to divert attention to legislation that is before the chamber and his getting the Australian Labor Party to debate it. I think he is referring to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2001], which was adjourned in this very chamber on 2 December 1998. It still has not been brought on for debate. The minister has the gall and the audacity to seek to divert public attention away from this urgent matter which is confronting Australia, Norway, Indonesia and, indeed, the UNHCR on to the Australian Labor Party, yet it is the Australian Labor Party who have moved an amendment that actually puts some sense into the urgency motion that has been moved by my colleague Senator Bartlett.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-08-28,"—At the moment, there are over 400 men, women and children just like us, with warm hearts and hope for the future of their lives, being tossed on very rough seas and in extraordinary circumstances. They have come from frightful circumstances and are seeking asylum in this country, but they are being turned away. They are being turned away under the glare of international publicity which will do nothing but bring discredit to this wonderful nation of ours. The Prime Minister and Mr Beazley, who stood at his side, washed their hands of their responsibilities and said, `This is a matter for Indonesia or Norway, not us,' even though the boat is moored nearest to our territorial waters at the moment and it was our authorities who asked the Norwegian ship to go to the assistance of these people.
Senator McKiernan has just spoken about piracy. I thought that pirates were people who made others walk the gangplank. Here we have desperate people who felt like jumping overboard if they were not able to proceed to Australia—and they are being labelled pirates. What an extraordinary vilification of good-hearted people who would become good citizens of this great country of ours if given a go. We are in a country which has a very tiny number of asylum seekers compared with comparable countries in Europe and North America, but by the big parties fuelling the fear and the vilification of these human beings, who are no different from us, a great deal of unnecessary fear in the community has arisen. I think that Australia has turned its back on a whole suite of good values for which we have in the past been rightly famous.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-08-28,"—Senator Bartlett's urgency motion before the Senate this afternoon addresses four major issues: (1) his claim that the government has refused entry to the Norwegian vessel the Tampa; (2) his claim that the government is failing to honour its international obligations regarding refugees; (3) a claim that asylum seekers should be able to come to Australia to receive medical attention; and (4) that they should be assessed as refugees. Senator Bartlett is grossly misinformed in the intent of his motion. Let us have a look at the facts. The Tampa rescued 434 passengers and crew from their disabled vessel north-west of Christmas Island last Sunday. It was then proceeding to the Indonesian port of Marek but was allegedly turned back to Christmas Island at the insistence of the people it had just rescued. The government has requested that the Tampa not enter Australian territorial waters and for it to continue on its planned route to Indonesia. Australia is continuing to seek the assistance of the Norwegian and Indonesian governments to secure an acceptable solution for everybody, including the Indonesian crew.
In his second point Senator Bartlett claimed that Australia does not accept its international obligations. What we do not accept is that our immigration policy should be run by people smugglers. We have never denied entry to genuine refugees. We are trying to ensure protection for those who are genuine refugees over those who are not. This government's action today will protect the integrity of our immigration laws and the sovereignty of our country. The third point that Senator Bartlett's motion raises is the need for asylum seekers to have access to Australia to receive medical attention. Let Senator Bartlett be assured that all humanitarian assistance has been offered to Captain Rinnan, including the services of the doctor at Christmas Island. The master of the ship has not asked for any particular security at this stage; however, Australia has despatched HMAS Arunta to the area and is seeking a helicopter with a winching capacity to transfer any necessary supplies or offer other assistance from Christmas Island to the Tampa if it is found to be necessary.
Senator Bartlett's final point relates to whether Australia is meeting its obligations in relation to assessments for refugee status. It is important to understand that in this year alone almost 3,700 people have arrived in Australia illegally by boat, compared with 2,939 for the whole of last year. So we have already exceeded the number for the whole of last year. An extra $22 million has already been allocated to provide 3,100 extra places in three new emergency detention centres around the country. As well, more than $15 million has already been spent on judicial action, and there are another 200 people awaiting the outcome of refugee appeals processes.
Senator Bartlett appears to think that our processes are not efficient enough. Does he realise that 80 per cent of applicants for refugee status are given their primary decision within 15 weeks? But, Senator Brown, the workload is growing, it is overwhelming and the backlog is also increasing, and today we have another potential 438 illegal migrants with as many as 900 more likely to come here in the next few weeks. Senator Bartlett might also like to spare a thought for the 1,500 residents of Christmas Island, who in the past month alone have had to cope with an extra 850 people arriving on boats. Their community has grown by 50 per cent in four weeks with no increase in community facilities.
Let us get the facts about this latest immigration issue on the table. The boat carrying these people was only 90 kilometres from the coast of Java when those people were rescued from their sinking vessel—75 nautical miles from Christmas Island and well outside Australia's territorial waters, which extend over 12 nautical miles out to sea from Christmas Island.
The resolution of this very difficult humanitarian problem will come about as a result of careful and sensitive negotiation primarily between Norway and Indonesia, from where these people and their crew sailed, and not from an emotionally charged debate in this chamber. Unfortunate suggestions by Senator Bartlett contained within this motion that we have failed to honour our international obligations or that we would refuse to provide medical attention are particularly unhelpful when they reflect neither truth nor substance. I note that the opposition has moved an amendment to this motion which suggests that the government:
... co-ordinate a process with the United Nations, Norway and Indonesia to manage a resolution to the current impasse in accordance with international law.
I am not quite sure where Senator Bolkus has been during the last few days. If there is any doubt that Minister Ruddock has worked day and night on this issue to do exactly that, then I wonder what Senator Bolkus thinks he has been doing. The suggestion that we should `provide interim assistance for the humanitarian needs and safety of asylum seekers and crew on board' is very clearly under way. My speech and the contributions of others today in this place and in the other place have outlined the humanitarian offers that we have on the table: HMAS Arunta on its way, a helicopter on its way, supplies available for the ship and a doctor at Christmas Island. Senator Bolkus's amendment that we `acknowledge the humanitarian acts of the Norwegian Master and his crew' leaves me breathless. What have we been doing for the last couple of days if we have not been acknowledging the work of the crew? We have stood by to assist the captain at every opportunity.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-08-28,"—First of all, how can this not be an emotional debate? We are talking about sparing a thought for the lives of more than 438 people on a ship that may be in grave danger, of which there are at least 26 women, two who are actually pregnant, and at least 43 children? I do not begrudge any senator or member of the community who gets emotional in this debate. But, when we are talking about sparing a thought, let us spare a thought for the captain of that Norwegian freighter, let us spare a thought for the fact that we do not have a national strategic, compassionate, tolerant approach to some of these issues, particularly in relation to asylum seekers and refugee cases in this country, and let us spare a thought for the precedent that we may be setting today in relation to international law, our obligations under various treaties and maritime law as well.
As for Senator Ferris's claim that Senator Bartlett is claiming that the government has turned this ship away, the truth is that the Prime Minister has declared that Australia will not allow the Tampa, that Norwegian freighter that has rescued more than 400 boat people stranded off Christmas Island—
—How can we turn it away when it is not even in Australian waters? Stick to the facts, Natasha. It is in international waters.
—I will talk about international waters, quite happily. But he has actually said that the Tampa is not docking. They are not even allowed to apply for asylum seeker status on Christmas Island. The government can mount as many technical and legal arguments—a range of other arguments—that it likes in order to justify this unprecedented response. But we have been seeking advice from international experts in maritime law and, as Senator Bartlett said in his opening remarks, this government has mounted a technical, dubious subterfuge in an attempt to avoid dealing not only at best with this issue but also at worst its international obligations.

CANBERRA  ACT  2600
Dear Senator O'Brien
Margaret J— Opinion by Mr R Orr
The answer to your question on notice No. 3695, relating to the search for the Margaret J, includes an opinion by Mr Robert Orr, QC, Deputy General Counsel of the Australian Government Solicitor's Office.
This opinion contains a bizarre misinterpretation of an advice which I provided, and I would like to put a correction on the record.
The principal significance of Mr Orr's opinion is that it refutes the claim by Mr K H Bell, QC, that if documents were placed before the Senate committee they could not then be examined before the coroner. This strange notion was also the subject of the advice of 3 July 2001 which I provided to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee and which was released by the committee. In this connection, Mr Orr's conclusion is correct and Mr Bell's, as I pointed out, is incorrect.
Mr Orr, however, refers to an advice which I provided to the Economics Legislation Committee, and which was published by that committee in June 1998, relating to the sub judice convention as it applies in the Senate. Mr Orr refers to my advice in the following terms:
He suggested that it could not operate in relation to civil proceedings; previously it had been accepted that whilst the convention operated most strongly in relation to criminal proceedings, it could operate in relation to civil proceedings.
As I have indicated, this is a bizarre misinterpretation of my advice. Nowhere in that advice is it stated that the sub judice convention does not operate in relation to civil proceedings, and there is nothing in the advice which even remotely suggests such a proposition. Perhaps Mr Orr has confused my advice with something else he has read, but I do not know of anybody who has advanced such a proposition.
Mr Orr also makes a general allegation that my advice in some way sought to change the interpretation of the sub judice convention. This allegation is also without foundation. My advice is based on rulings and authoritative statements in the Senate going back over many years.
As Mr Orr's opinion will be included in the Senate's Hansard by virtue of its inclusion in the answer to your question on notice, I request that you seek some suitable opportunity to incorporate this response in Hansard.
Yours sincerely

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-08-28,"—I present the final report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the government's information technology outsourcing initiative, entitled Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 29 November 2000, the Senate referred the matter of the government's information technology outsourcing initiative to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. The committee has tabled two interim reports, in April and June this year, that detail a number of instances where it has experienced difficulties in obtaining relevant documents to assist it in conducting its inquiry. In the early stages of this inquiry, it became clear to the committee that public accountability would be a major theme in its examination of the initiative.
This final report, Re-booting the IT Agenda in the Australian Public Service, provides a necessary chronology of events, a serious critique and a series of practical, forward looking and necessary recommendations. While examining the immense detail of the whole-of-government outsourcing of IT, above all the committee's focus has been directed to an examination of the efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources.
This report reflects not only upon the Commonwealth's use of Australian taxpayers' money to achieve certain outcomes—the policy objectives of the initiative—but also upon Commonwealth departments' and agencies' accountability to the parliament for those outcomes. This includes public accountability for the management of IT contracts designed to deliver quality IT outcomes, as well as the transparency of those contracts and all other processes involved.
The implementation of whole-of-government IT outsourcing was an ambitious undertaking and the initiative introduced substantial risks in its own right. While the committee's report to the Senate reveals a series of problems and shortcomings and is critical of many aspects of the initiative, it also acknowledges the positive outcomes. The committee has endeavoured to produce a forward looking report with practical recommendations to improve all aspects of future IT outsourcing.
Outsourcing, competitive tendering and contracting are not new concepts. Government administrations in Australia and overseas have built up a wealth of experience as they adapt to the dynamic IT marketplace and look for more effective and efficient ways of procuring the goods and services they require. With the government's IT outsourcing initiative, however, the committee found that planning—the most fundamental axiom of procurement on this scale—was inadequate for the task. Lack of planning influenced all levels of the initiative's administration. The lack of early research, analysis and adequate consultation meant that, from the beginning, cracks appeared in the process. No records were retained to record a benchmark against, to evaluate whether and, if so, to what extent, the policy objectives were achieved.
The whole-of-government initiative is a matter of the greatest public interest. It has attracted favourable and unfavourable submissions and some valuable evidence. When the cracks began to appear, the government and the responsible agencies in the Finance and Administration portfolio, DOFA and OASITO, did not take heed. It required the Auditor-General's report No. 9 of 2000-01 to draw out and make public the deficiencies in the implementation of the initiative. It required an independent review conducted by Richard Humphry AO to pull the government back and to instil better order into the process. It recommended that agencies take back control of their own IT destinies, in accordance with the responsibility they hold under legislation. 
The committee makes 22 recommendations, and I will summarise some of them here. The committee has recommended that recommendation 10 of the Humphry review regarding agencies with distinctive data security needs, such as the science agencies, and agencies with high security needs, such as the Australian Federal Police, be extended to apply to the evaluation of the implementation risks of all other agencies. Another recommendation is that, for future IT outsourcing contracts valued over $10 million, agencies contract the services of both a probity auditor and a probity adviser and that their roles involve separate and distinct tasks. The probity auditors are to keep accurate records and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the audit process and for probity auditors' reports to be made public.
The committee recommends that the Commonwealth adopt an open and transparent methodology for estimating cost savings for IT outsourcing. In developing this methodology, all relevant Commonwealth agencies, including ANAO and DOFA, are to be consulted, and a common methodology adopted. It also recommends that any future requests for tenders and contracts entered into by a Commonwealth agency include provisions that require contractors to keep and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny, including before parliamentary committees, of the contract and its arrangements. 
There are recommendations that the government act immediately to remove barriers, such as onerous requirements, including financial guarantees, that hamper the participation of SMEs in the initiative; that agencies consider releasing an invitation to register interest as part of a pre-qualification phase of the tender process with follow-up public information seminars and briefs; and that tender documentation should clearly identify, at the very least, the relative importance of the separate evaluation components of IT outsourcing—technical, corporate, financial and industry development. They should also indicate the evaluation criteria given top priority within each of these components. Further recommendations were that all RFTs for IT outsourcing which contain clauses allowing the Commonwealth broad discretionary rights—for example, to exclude a tenderer from the process—also include a clause which places a clear and definite obligation on the Commonwealth to provide in writing the reasons for such decisions, and that for any future tender process for IT outsourcing, the evaluation plan be finalised and approved before the RFT is issued. 
Other recommendations are that DOCITA investigate the feasibility of publicising and marketing intellectual property rights registers in current contracts under the initiative, as well as details of intellectual property held by agencies that are not outsourced, with a view to maximising returns on Commonwealth intellectual property, and that the government review the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines with a view to making them more explicit and detailed for agency heads operating on behalf of one Commonwealth in a devolved environment and less likely to broad and uncertain interpretation. Further, it recommends that officers performing duties in relation to the procurement of property or services be required to `act in accordance with' rather than simply `have regard to' the core policies and principles and must make written records of their actions and reasons, that the government re-introduce mandatory competency standards for all officers undertaking procurement functions, and that, consistent with the Department of Finance and Administration's policy responsibility for Commonwealth contracting and procurement, competency standards and training be developed by that department. This is to be done in consultation with the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission to ensure consistency with the Australian Public Service values. Another recommendation is that the government consider establishing a centre of IT outsourcing expertise in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, concerned with the technological and industry development side of IT outsourcing but not necessarily the tendering and contracting process. 
The committee proposes that the role of a service unit in DOCITA would be far different from the OASITO model and be more consultative and helpful than the service unit now established in DOFA. It would have broader horizons on IT and would establish and form the hub of a network between IT outsourcing units in Commonwealth agencies. Further, it would assume an education and training role in IT outsourcing, with its focus on IT planning for the future. Finally, the committee recommends that the government give serious consideration to introducing legislation that will provide a greater degree of transparency in Commonwealth contracts by making them publicly available. 
The committee heard from the public and private sectors, from agencies—involved and not involved—and from industry. In the light of their evidence, the committee has focused its recommendations, some of which I have just mentioned, on strategic improvements to the many facets of outsourcing, including probity and contract management, data security, intellectual property, and succession planning—the next major challenge. It focuses on privacy issues, on savings or value for money IT services, on transparent and measurable industry development, and on assistance to the Australian Public Service to more productively and successfully outsource their IT requirements in a truly devolved environment. 
The committee reminds the Senate that $1.2 billion of public money has already been committed under the initiative and that the process of outsourcing the Commonwealth's IT is yet to be completed. The committee reminds all parties to this initiative that, in all processes, public accountability—accountability to the parliament—is paramount. The committee calls on the government to move IT outsourcing forward in the Australian Public Service and to assist agencies and private industry to reboot the initiative by implementing these recommendations.
May I, on behalf of the committee, express our appreciation to the committee secretariat for its role and commitment in producing this report under very difficult circumstances, and in many circumstances lacking cooperation from many of the departments directly involved in it. Despite all of that, it has been able to put together a comprehensive report which, if followed by the government, should improve considerably our IT outsourcing agenda.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-28,"—The Howard government's IT outsourcing initiative has been an outstandingly imaginative and groundbreaking step in public policy with respect to government IT services. The Humphry review signalled a change in direction for the government's IT outsourcing policy. For example, responsibility for the policy's implementation has been devolved to agency heads, who are responsible for choosing the most appropriate outsourcing model and also determining if they want to group together in a cluster. This has meant that Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee we are discussing tonight, has, to a significant extent, been looking at the initiative as it once was and not as it currently is. 
The reflections on the role of the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing, OASITO, are no longer relevant, because the initiative is no longer a centrally managed process and OASITO no longer has a role to play. Additionally, many of the criticisms made by the majority members of the committee have been made in both the Humphry review and the Auditor-General's report No. 9, The implementation of whole-of-government information technology infrastructure consolidation and outsourcing initiative. Given all of this, the necessity for the committee to conduct this inquiry must be questioned.
The Minister for Finance and Administration, the Department of Finance and Administration and OASITO are all criticised in the majority report for failing to cooperate with the committee, including failing to provide the committee with various documents that it requested. The minister, OASITO and DOFA have not been motivated by a desire to deliberately frustrate the committee in the course of its inquiries, but, while recognising their accountability to the parliament, have been motivated by a legitimate desire to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. The minister, OASITO and the department have provided the committee with voluminous amounts of material, and there were good reasons, including public interest immunity, commercial in confidence grounds and a risk of litigation, why the committee was not given access to certain documents or was given documents with parts blanked out.
In a broad sense, the IT outsourcing initiative has benefited the Commonwealth government through cost savings and facilitation of access to improved technologies, thus enabling the delivery of services more efficiently and effectively to the Australian people. The initiative also played a key and a positive and constructive role in promoting industry development in the IT sector. The initiative has resulted in six significant achievements. The first is cost savings. The Humphry review found:
... there is broad agreement that, in the aggregate, the Initiative has delivered significant savings, however there is a divergence of opinion as to the precise quantum. 
The Auditor-General found that the initiative had delivered cost savings to the government. Whilst there has been controversy over the methodology in calculating the savings and the overall quantum of savings, what is not in doubt is that in the aggregate the initiative has delivered considerable cost savings to the Commonwealth.
The second benefit is industry development. The industry development component of the initiative has been a tremendous success. It has created opportunities for companies which simply would not have existed but for the initiative and provided a valuable stimulus to the development of the IT sector in Australia. In general, the contractors have not only met their ID targets but exceeded them by a significant margin. The ID component of the initiative has created opportunities for small to medium business enterprises and has created jobs in regional Australia. The government has listened to the concerns that have been expressed about inhibitors to SME involvement and is currently working on a relevant action plan.
Third, the initiative has freed agencies to concentrate on their core function. IT is not a core function of government agencies, and the initiative has freed up agency resources to concentrate on what they do best. Fourth, contractually defined and improved service levels are another outcome and benefit of this initiative. The service agreements that have been concluded with the contractors contain specified service levels that the contractors are required to meet as well as allowing the levying of service credits or financial penalties where contractors fail to meet these minimum levels of service. The contractors have a direct incentive to meet these service levels, because if they do not it will have a direct impact on their profitability. Under the in-house arrangements, IT staff were paid irrespective of service levels, so there was not the same incentive, or even imperative, to improve service levels.
The fifth benefit was access to specialised skills and knowledge. Agencies have been able to access skills and knowledge which had not been available to them in house. In addition, there have been improved opportunities for former public sector IT employees. A substantial number of former agency IT employees have been employed by either the prime contractors or one of their subcontractors. This has opened up opportunities previously unavailable to these employees, including working for a company whose core business is IT.
The minority report puts on the record an alternative view of the government's IT outsourcing initiative. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2001-08-28,"—It is not surprising that the government is trying to characterise Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, as a political report. This is very unfortunate, because this report has the character of an analysis. Whilst the findings are justifiably scathing of the coalition, the recommendations are constructive and work towards an improvement in what has been—I think there is a general consensus outside Minister Fahey's office—an absolute debacle.
It is not a new issue. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it has been going on now for many years. We have evidence in this report showing that the government were told five years ago that they were embarking upon a path that would eventually come undone, that the experiences overseas at that time—five years ago—showed the government that they were not going to achieve the savings and they were not going to be able to effectively administer this in accordance with their promises.
This report does not attempt to provide an alternative approach to IT outsourcing. Rather, it addresses the coalition's initiative and its operation under the current government. What it identifies is that there are still many potentially fatal flaws, or further fatal flaws, in the coalition's initiative that will continue to damage both the growth prospects of Australian SMEs seeking to participate in government tenders and the ability of government agencies to strategically control and use information technology to improve their operations' efficiencies and service delivery to the citizens of this country. There is a need for further action and I join with my colleague Senator Campbell in commending the recommendations in this report for their immediate consideration.
I recognise that, for example, the government are still consulting on the best type of industry development model to be associated with IT outsourcing, but I note that they have been doing this since the Humphry review came down in January and still have no answers. They have been leading industry along by the nose, waving a carrot in front of their face, saying, `We have got a better way. We have got a better way.' But they still have not put any cards on the table and we still do not know what the government have in mind as far as industry development is concerned. I encourage the IT industry to assert itself and make demands of this government to get their act together and to provide at least some certainty in what is a very difficult period around elections, with a potential slowdown in IT procurement anyway. That does have a devastating and immediate impact on IT businesses that are trying to do business with government.
This report recommends a strengthening of the role of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in its coordinating role for IT policy. That is absolutely necessary. At the moment, there is some policy guidance in the National Office for the Information Economy and there is a little bit in the department and there is a little bit over there in Industry. In fact, there is no cohesive approach from the coalition about what drives ICT industry development. What is needed very specifically is a high level of coordination and some political leadership to get the focus on that industry development right and actually use procurement as an active and meaningful tool to boost and support local industry. 
Perhaps the most telling evidence of this government's failing with respect to IT outsourcing is their pitiful response to this long-term inquiry. Their minority report reads like a cut-and-paste of Minister Fahey's media release web site. He is unrepentant. Despite volumes of evidence, the government's opening line describes the initiative—as we heard from Senator Eggleston—as `outstanding, imaginative and groundbreaking'. I say it is outstandingly ideological, imaginatively incompetent and groundbreakingly short-sighted in its approach and continuation. 
There are several important themes that are drawn out in this report. One, as Senator Campbell mentioned, is the issue of transparency and probity. Not only this report but the previous interim reports into accountability in a commercial environment, emerging issues and case studies demonstrate that this whole IT outsourcing has exposed a shroud of secrecy around the way this government does business with the private sector. Time and time again, the committee made formal requests for information relating to the contracts and the service levels required and the way those contracts were evaluated. Yet there were barriers and fences put up at every step, dating right back to last year—in fact, dating back to before this inquiry, through the estimates process, when information about the contracts, the evaluation methodologies and the supporting documentation was not forthcoming. 
We had to work through the Senate officers and rely on our rights under parliamentary privilege to gain access to information which should have been available to the committee in a timely fashion. It is very surprising that the government representatives stand up and say, `Everything is out there on the public record.' It took months. This report could have been tabled back in May when it was initially flagged. It was not, because we have had to fight tooth and nail for information that should have been available to the committee, if not on the public record then at least available to the committee in confidence to assist our deliberations on this matter.
It is only reasonable that the conclusion we draw from this is that the government has something to hide. So the issue of transparency and accountability has provided lessons not just for the procurement of ICT—information and communication technologies—but in fact for procurement generally and the way that government does business with the private sector. The findings of both this report and the interim reports and related investigations by the Australian National Audit Office point to a new paradigm, a new environment, where government accountability must be improved.
Another significant area of focus of this report is the issue of industry development. One aspect of that is that the committee has exposed the sham of regional jobs. Again, Senator Eggleston, in speaking to the government's minority report, talked about regional jobs—pressing that hot button out there about what is so good about this. They have been completely discredited about the merits of their outsourcing program and regional jobs because, as this report says, if you take away Canberra and Adelaide and Newcastle from qualifying as regional—as they do in the government's current calculations—you are left with barely 100 jobs that have been created outside major cities. If you take the Gold Coast out of that, you are down to about 24 jobs. The whole concept, the whole sell of this government about the regional aspects of their industry development associated with this is so weak, and it has been exposed.
Another important element of this is in-house expertise. I turn to the report and mention, particularly, the evidence of an international expert in IT outsourcing, Dr Wilcox. His researchers found that there is a massive lack of innovation as a result of IT outsourcing. He suggested that knowledge of the business is needed to spur innovation but that suppliers often do not have the required level of knowledge and that, in his opinion, they get so buried in the business at hand that they forget to innovate. More than anything else, this report highlights the need for strategic control by agencies and departments to make sure that they extract the most out of innovation and work on building strategic partnerships with the private sector to extract the best possible value for taxpayers' money. Again, this is in defiance of the government's approach to IT outsourcing. 
There are also critical issues in relation to the cultural change required in agencies and departments that tend to be risk averse. They tend to go with the big contractors rather than take a risk with a smaller supplier who might be more innovative. There is also a need to remove barriers for participation for SMEs. Finally, this report demonstrates that this government has an inability to administer its own departments. The attempt to centralise IT outsourcing had the wheels completely fall off it, and this pile of reports is testimony to that failure. It has been a challenge because of the level of obstruction, and I think that the lessons learnt from that will go on to guide—certainly—Labor's policy development in the area of strategic sourcing of information and communication technologies. We will certainly put the findings of this report to good use in that regard. I commend the report to the Senate and I very sincerely thank those in the secretariat who put in very long and difficult hours trying to collate and prepare the information for inclusion in this report.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-08-28,"—I present the final report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the government's information technology outsourcing initiative, entitled Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.

That the Senate take note of the report.
On 29 November 2000, the Senate referred the matter of the government's information technology outsourcing initiative to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. The committee has tabled two interim reports, in April and June this year, that detail a number of instances where it has experienced difficulties in obtaining relevant documents to assist it in conducting its inquiry. In the early stages of this inquiry, it became clear to the committee that public accountability would be a major theme in its examination of the initiative.
This final report, Re-booting the IT Agenda in the Australian Public Service, provides a necessary chronology of events, a serious critique and a series of practical, forward looking and necessary recommendations.

This report reflects not only upon the Commonwealth's use of Australian taxpayers' money to achieve certain outcomes—the policy objectives of the initiative—but also upon Commonwealth departments' and agencies' accountability to the parliament for those outcomes. This includes public accountability for the management of IT contracts designed to deliver quality IT outcomes, as well as the transparency of those contracts and all other processes involved.
The implementation of whole-of-government IT outsourcing was an ambitious undertaking and the initiative introduced substantial risks in its own right. While the committee's report to the Senate reveals a series of problems and shortcomings and is critical of many aspects of the initiative, it also acknowledges the positive outcomes. The committee has endeavoured to produce a forward looking report with practical recommendations to improve all aspects of future IT outsourcing.
Outsourcing, competitive tendering and contracting are not new concepts. Government administrations in Australia and overseas have built up a wealth of experience as they adapt to the dynamic IT marketplace and look for more effective and efficient ways of procuring the goods and services they require. With the government's IT outsourcing initiative, however, the committee found that planning—the most fundamental axiom of procurement on this scale—was inadequate for the task. Lack of planning influenced all levels of the initiative's administration. The lack of early research, analysis and adequate consultation meant that, from the beginning, cracks appeared in the process. No records were retained to record a benchmark against, to evaluate whether and, if so, to what extent, the policy objectives were achieved.
The whole-of-government initiative is a matter of the greatest public interest. It has attracted favourable and unfavourable submissions and some valuable evidence. When the cracks began to appear, the government and the responsible agencies in the Finance and Administration portfolio, DOFA and OASITO, did not take heed. It required the Auditor-General's report No. 9 of 2000-01 to draw out and make public the deficiencies in the implementation of the initiative. It required an independent review conducted by Richard Humphry AO to pull the government back and to instil better order into the process. It recommended that agencies take back control of their own IT destinies, in accordance with the responsibility they hold under legislation. 
The committee makes 22 recommendations, and I will summarise some of them here. The committee has recommended that recommendation 10 of the Humphry review regarding agencies with distinctive data security needs, such as the science agencies, and agencies with high security needs, such as the Australian Federal Police, be extended to apply to the evaluation of the implementation risks of all other agencies. Another recommendation is that, for future IT outsourcing contracts valued over $10 million, agencies contract the services of both a probity auditor and a probity adviser and that their roles involve separate and distinct tasks. The probity auditors are to keep accurate records and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the audit process and for probity auditors' reports to be made public.
The committee recommends that the Commonwealth adopt an open and transparent methodology for estimating cost savings for IT outsourcing. In developing this methodology, all relevant Commonwealth agencies, including ANAO and DOFA, are to be consulted, and a common methodology adopted. It also recommends that any future requests for tenders and contracts entered into by a Commonwealth agency include provisions that require contractors to keep and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny, including before parliamentary committees, of the contract and its arrangements.

This is to be done in consultation with the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission to ensure consistency with the Australian Public Service values. Another recommendation is that the government consider establishing a centre of IT outsourcing expertise in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, concerned with the technological and industry development side of IT outsourcing but not necessarily the tendering and contracting process. 
The committee proposes that the role of a service unit in DOCITA would be far different from the OASITO model and be more consultative and helpful than the service unit now established in DOFA. It would have broader horizons on IT and would establish and form the hub of a network between IT outsourcing units in Commonwealth agencies. Further, it would assume an education and training role in IT outsourcing, with its focus on IT planning for the future. Finally, the committee recommends that the government give serious consideration to introducing legislation that will provide a greater degree of transparency in Commonwealth contracts by making them publicly available.

In the light of their evidence, the committee has focused its recommendations, some of which I have just mentioned, on strategic improvements to the many facets of outsourcing, including probity and contract management, data security, intellectual property, and succession planning—the next major challenge. It focuses on privacy issues, on savings or value for money IT services, on transparent and measurable industry development, and on assistance to the Australian Public Service to more productively and successfully outsource their IT requirements in a truly devolved environment.

The committee reminds all parties to this initiative that, in all processes, public accountability—accountability to the parliament—is paramount. The committee calls on the government to move IT outsourcing forward in the Australian Public Service and to assist agencies and private industry to reboot the initiative by implementing these recommendations.
May I, on behalf of the committee, express our appreciation to the committee secretariat for its role and commitment in producing this report under very difficult circumstances, and in many circumstances lacking cooperation from many of the departments directly involved in it. Despite all of that, it has been able to put together a comprehensive report which, if followed by the government, should improve considerably our IT outsourcing agenda.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-28,"—The Howard government's IT outsourcing initiative has been an outstandingly imaginative and groundbreaking step in public policy with respect to government IT services. The Humphry review signalled a change in direction for the government's IT outsourcing policy. For example, responsibility for the policy's implementation has been devolved to agency heads, who are responsible for choosing the most appropriate outsourcing model and also determining if they want to group together in a cluster. This has meant that Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee we are discussing tonight, has, to a significant extent, been looking at the initiative as it once was and not as it currently is. 
The reflections on the role of the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing, OASITO, are no longer relevant, because the initiative is no longer a centrally managed process and OASITO no longer has a role to play. Additionally, many of the criticisms made by the majority members of the committee have been made in both the Humphry review and the Auditor-General's report No. 9, The implementation of whole-of-government information technology infrastructure consolidation and outsourcing initiative. Given all of this, the necessity for the committee to conduct this inquiry must be questioned.
The Minister for Finance and Administration, the Department of Finance and Administration and OASITO are all criticised in the majority report for failing to cooperate with the committee, including failing to provide the committee with various documents that it requested. The minister, OASITO and DOFA have not been motivated by a desire to deliberately frustrate the committee in the course of its inquiries, but, while recognising their accountability to the parliament, have been motivated by a legitimate desire to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. The minister, OASITO and the department have provided the committee with voluminous amounts of material, and there were good reasons, including public interest immunity, commercial in confidence grounds and a risk of litigation, why the committee was not given access to certain documents or was given documents with parts blanked out.
In a broad sense, the IT outsourcing initiative has benefited the Commonwealth government through cost savings and facilitation of access to improved technologies, thus enabling the delivery of services more efficiently and effectively to the Australian people. The initiative also played a key and a positive and constructive role in promoting industry development in the IT sector. The initiative has resulted in six significant achievements. The first is cost savings. The Humphry review found:
... there is broad agreement that, in the aggregate, the Initiative has delivered significant savings, however there is a divergence of opinion as to the precise quantum. 
The Auditor-General found that the initiative had delivered cost savings to the government. Whilst there has been controversy over the methodology in calculating the savings and the overall quantum of savings, what is not in doubt is that in the aggregate the initiative has delivered considerable cost savings to the Commonwealth.
The second benefit is industry development. The industry development component of the initiative has been a tremendous success. It has created opportunities for companies which simply would not have existed but for the initiative and provided a valuable stimulus to the development of the IT sector in Australia. In general, the contractors have not only met their ID targets but exceeded them by a significant margin. The ID component of the initiative has created opportunities for small to medium business enterprises and has created jobs in regional Australia. The government has listened to the concerns that have been expressed about inhibitors to SME involvement and is currently working on a relevant action plan.
Third, the initiative has freed agencies to concentrate on their core function. IT is not a core function of government agencies, and the initiative has freed up agency resources to concentrate on what they do best. Fourth, contractually defined and improved service levels are another outcome and benefit of this initiative. The service agreements that have been concluded with the contractors contain specified service levels that the contractors are required to meet as well as allowing the levying of service credits or financial penalties where contractors fail to meet these minimum levels of service. The contractors have a direct incentive to meet these service levels, because if they do not it will have a direct impact on their profitability. Under the in-house arrangements, IT staff were paid irrespective of service levels, so there was not the same incentive, or even imperative, to improve service levels.
The fifth benefit was access to specialised skills and knowledge. Agencies have been able to access skills and knowledge which had not been available to them in house. In addition, there have been improved opportunities for former public sector IT employees. A substantial number of former agency IT employees have been employed by either the prime contractors or one of their subcontractors. This has opened up opportunities previously unavailable to these employees, including working for a company whose core business is IT.
The minority report puts on the record an alternative view of the government's IT outsourcing initiative. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2001-08-28,"—It is not surprising that the government is trying to characterise Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, as a political report. This is very unfortunate, because this report has the character of an analysis. Whilst the findings are justifiably scathing of the coalition, the recommendations are constructive and work towards an improvement in what has been—I think there is a general consensus outside Minister Fahey's office—an absolute debacle.
It is not a new issue. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it has been going on now for many years. We have evidence in this report showing that the government were told five years ago that they were embarking upon a path that would eventually come undone, that the experiences overseas at that time—five years ago—showed the government that they were not going to achieve the savings and they were not going to be able to effectively administer this in accordance with their promises.
This report does not attempt to provide an alternative approach to IT outsourcing. Rather, it addresses the coalition's initiative and its operation under the current government. What it identifies is that there are still many potentially fatal flaws, or further fatal flaws, in the coalition's initiative that will continue to damage both the growth prospects of Australian SMEs seeking to participate in government tenders and the ability of government agencies to strategically control and use information technology to improve their operations' efficiencies and service delivery to the citizens of this country. There is a need for further action and I join with my colleague Senator Campbell in commending the recommendations in this report for their immediate consideration.
I recognise that, for example, the government are still consulting on the best type of industry development model to be associated with IT outsourcing, but I note that they have been doing this since the Humphry review came down in January and still have no answers. They have been leading industry along by the nose, waving a carrot in front of their face, saying, `We have got a better way. We have got a better way.' But they still have not put any cards on the table and we still do not know what the government have in mind as far as industry development is concerned. I encourage the IT industry to assert itself and make demands of this government to get their act together and to provide at least some certainty in what is a very difficult period around elections, with a potential slowdown in IT procurement anyway. That does have a devastating and immediate impact on IT businesses that are trying to do business with government.
This report recommends a strengthening of the role of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in its coordinating role for IT policy. That is absolutely necessary. At the moment, there is some policy guidance in the National Office for the Information Economy and there is a little bit in the department and there is a little bit over there in Industry. In fact, there is no cohesive approach from the coalition about what drives ICT industry development. What is needed very specifically is a high level of coordination and some political leadership to get the focus on that industry development right and actually use procurement as an active and meaningful tool to boost and support local industry. 
Perhaps the most telling evidence of this government's failing with respect to IT outsourcing is their pitiful response to this long-term inquiry. Their minority report reads like a cut-and-paste of Minister Fahey's media release web site. He is unrepentant. Despite volumes of evidence, the government's opening line describes the initiative—as we heard from Senator Eggleston—as `outstanding, imaginative and groundbreaking'. I say it is outstandingly ideological, imaginatively incompetent and groundbreakingly short-sighted in its approach and continuation. 
There are several important themes that are drawn out in this report. One, as Senator Campbell mentioned, is the issue of transparency and probity. Not only this report but the previous interim reports into accountability in a commercial environment, emerging issues and case studies demonstrate that this whole IT outsourcing has exposed a shroud of secrecy around the way this government does business with the private sector. Time and time again, the committee made formal requests for information relating to the contracts and the service levels required and the way those contracts were evaluated. Yet there were barriers and fences put up at every step, dating right back to last year—in fact, dating back to before this inquiry, through the estimates process, when information about the contracts, the evaluation methodologies and the supporting documentation was not forthcoming. 
We had to work through the Senate officers and rely on our rights under parliamentary privilege to gain access to information which should have been available to the committee in a timely fashion. It is very surprising that the government representatives stand up and say, `Everything is out there on the public record.' It took months. This report could have been tabled back in May when it was initially flagged. It was not, because we have had to fight tooth and nail for information that should have been available to the committee, if not on the public record then at least available to the committee in confidence to assist our deliberations on this matter.
It is only reasonable that the conclusion we draw from this is that the government has something to hide. So the issue of transparency and accountability has provided lessons not just for the procurement of ICT—information and communication technologies—but in fact for procurement generally and the way that government does business with the private sector. The findings of both this report and the interim reports and related investigations by the Australian National Audit Office point to a new paradigm, a new environment, where government accountability must be improved.
Another significant area of focus of this report is the issue of industry development. One aspect of that is that the committee has exposed the sham of regional jobs. Again, Senator Eggleston, in speaking to the government's minority report, talked about regional jobs—pressing that hot button out there about what is so good about this. They have been completely discredited about the merits of their outsourcing program and regional jobs because, as this report says, if you take away Canberra and Adelaide and Newcastle from qualifying as regional—as they do in the government's current calculations—you are left with barely 100 jobs that have been created outside major cities. If you take the Gold Coast out of that, you are down to about 24 jobs. The whole concept, the whole sell of this government about the regional aspects of their industry development associated with this is so weak, and it has been exposed.
Another important element of this is in-house expertise. I turn to the report and mention, particularly, the evidence of an international expert in IT outsourcing, Dr Wilcox. His researchers found that there is a massive lack of innovation as a result of IT outsourcing. He suggested that knowledge of the business is needed to spur innovation but that suppliers often do not have the required level of knowledge and that, in his opinion, they get so buried in the business at hand that they forget to innovate. More than anything else, this report highlights the need for strategic control by agencies and departments to make sure that they extract the most out of innovation and work on building strategic partnerships with the private sector to extract the best possible value for taxpayers' money. Again, this is in defiance of the government's approach to IT outsourcing. 
There are also critical issues in relation to the cultural change required in agencies and departments that tend to be risk averse. They tend to go with the big contractors rather than take a risk with a smaller supplier who might be more innovative. There is also a need to remove barriers for participation for SMEs. Finally, this report demonstrates that this government has an inability to administer its own departments. The attempt to centralise IT outsourcing had the wheels completely fall off it, and this pile of reports is testimony to that failure. It has been a challenge because of the level of obstruction, and I think that the lessons learnt from that will go on to guide—certainly—Labor's policy development in the area of strategic sourcing of information and communication technologies. We will certainly put the findings of this report to good use in that regard. I commend the report to the Senate and I very sincerely thank those in the secretariat who put in very long and difficult hours trying to collate and prepare the information for inclusion in this report.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I am pleased to table the report of the committee into the Management arrangements and adequacy of funding of the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority. The inquiry was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in October 2000. It was considered necessary because of the need to examine more closely the management and funding of Commonwealth law enforcement. The inquiry was prompted in part by the refusal of the government to provide information by Mr Tony Ayers AO that assessed the issues of the management in the Australian Federal Police in 1998.
Essentially, the committee was asked to determine the current capability of both agencies in terms of: the management of resources, including staff and information technology; the resourcing of the AFP and the NCA; the relationship between the new AFP certified agreement and the AFP budget management; the appropriateness of any performance indicators used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the AFP and the NCA as agencies and of their individual operations; any mechanisms for long-term strategic law enforcement policy decision making and oversight of Commonwealth law enforcement priorities, operations and budgets; the recommendations of, and the government's response to, the Ayers report; and whether the requirement the government placed upon the AFP after the Ayers report to find $50 million in internal savings has in fact been achieved and, if it has, if this was at the expense of operational capacity.
The focus of the inquiry on determining the capacity of the AFP and NCA to meet their specific objectives meant that the committee relied on a small number of witnesses. With their great assistance, the committee has been able to put forward a detailed response on most of the terms of reference.
As mentioned above, one of the terms of reference the committee was charged with by the Senate was to examine the recommendations of, and the government's response to, the Ayers report. Unfortunately, the committee was hampered by the attitude taken by the government. The then Minister for Justice and Customs indicated that, because the Ayers report was a cabinet document, it could not be made available for purposes other than cabinet deliberations. The minister did release to the committee the summary of findings, the milestones section and some appendices. However, it would have been more helpful if the committee had been allowed to see the full report—if necessary, with any classified material deleted.
In evidence to the committee, both agencies recognised that the government's budgeting climate dictated a limitation in resources and a trend towards inflexible tied funding. The challenge for law enforcement agencies is prioritising resources in an environment that sees new types of crime emerging. The committee found that the AFP's experience with funding over the last few years has been very different from that of the NCA. The AFP was not required to make the same savings in running costs as the NCA during the 1996-97 period. The AFP received funds to enable it to increase and reprofile its work force and to purchase new equipment. The AFP had more flexibility in moving tied funds and in borrowing against future years. Funding of the AFP's reform program will now be part of its base funding instead of being tied, as it had been up until this year. It also appears that the AFP has received funding towards its certified agreement on a more generous basis than that of other agencies. It is encouraging to see from the NCA's forward estimates that its general funding situation will improve and that one of the financial problems presented by the secondment of large numbers of police to the NCA is being addressed.
It is commonly argued that, because of its nature, police work is difficult to measure and cost. It is against this backdrop that the committee considered any performance indicators for the AFP and the NCA. Overall, the committee was impressed by the ongoing effort of the AFP `to develop and enhance its performance measurement tools'. In respect of the NCA, the committee suggests that the performance indicators of the NCA have really been only quantitative measures that do not provide real information on the effectiveness and efficiency of the agency. In this sense, there are no actual performance indicators for the NCA other than statistics. The committee recommends, to address this problem, that the NCA implement its proposed integrated performance measurement framework as a matter of urgency.
The committee also examined other resourcing issues such as staff numbers and information technology in relation to operational needs. Generally speaking, these arrangements improved over more recent years. The committee does note concern with the current internal and external complaints system of the AFP. The committee found that this system was complex and could work unfairly against employees. For this reason, the committee recommended that the procedures for dealing with complaints and allegations be examined with a view to their being simplified and made more transparent and to ensuring that employees are not disadvantaged by the use of administrative instead of disciplinary processes.
The committee also examined the certified agreement for the period 1999-2002, a period that marks a transitional period for the AFP. The essential feature of this agreement is a more flexible use of both people and time to achieve better outcomes. Overall, it would seem that sworn officers have received considerable benefits in training, opportunities and payments.
From the onset of the inquiry, the material given to the committee indicated that there are no adequate mechanisms for long-term strategic law enforcement policy and oversight of Commonwealth law enforcement priorities, operations and budgets. This was also supported by one of the findings from the Ayers inquiry which identified `a need for a separate review of the Commonwealth's criminal intelligence effort'. This review has not been undertaken. Different mechanisms for making long-term policy decisions and oversighting priorities, operations and budgets were suggested to the committee. The National Crime Authority emphasised its belief that a whole of government response was needed:
The real question in Australia is whether or not this country, at federal or state level, has a whole-of-government approach to what is an increasing area of interest to all of us, and that is the rise of organised crime ... commentary [on organised crime] will, to some extent, touch on that in the sense of what might be described as a convergence of interests. That is what is lacking in the Australian context. At the federal level and elsewhere, there probably is not the sophistication in bringing together the law enforcement and aligned interests that have an interest in the issues, like organised crime, that affect our lives.
After deliberations, the committee has made the following recommendations:
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that the Government examine the best means of providing a point or body for the effective peak management and coordination of the Commonwealth law enforcement effort, and work to its expeditious implementation.
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that, in light of recommendation 3, the party responsible for the effective coordination and oversight of the Commonwealth law enforcement effort develop, and regularly update, a quantified estimate of the `criminal environment', into which law enforcement bodies provide input.
Finally, I want to thank my colleagues who served on the committee during the inquiry—particularly my deputy, Senator Marise Payne, who particularly assisted by attending every one of the hearings of the committee. I must also mention the staff of the secretariat of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, and I refer to Saxon Patience, Sonia Hailes, Yvonne Marsh, Mr Noel Gregory and Dr Pauline Moore. We had some difficulties in dealing with the inquiry because of pressures from our sister committee, the legislation committee, and other work that the Senate gave to us. I tried to ensure that, on this occasion, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee would stick to its deadlines. I know I made some not-so-good friends within the secretariat by the imposition of very stringent timetables—
—An understatement.
—But we did deliver on this occasion. Thank you, Senator Ludwig, for your assistance, as well.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2001-08-28,"—As a former university lecturer, I retain a passionate interest in education and now, through involvement in public life, I hope to ensure a productive and prosperous future for our young people. That is why I accepted with great pleasure an opportunity a few weeks ago to address some 170 Brisbane business and community leaders gathered at the Go Career—Enterprise and Career Education Business seminar. The purpose of the seminar was to publicise a recent federal government initiative designed to assist high school students in making a successful transition into the world of employment.
In March this year, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp, launched the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation. The foundation is designed to build on the important work of the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation. The main objective of all these projects is to more effectively link business, schools and the community and thus encourage and support effective partnerships between schools and industry. To that end the Commonwealth government has allocated nearly $100 million over the next four years.
On that same occasion earlier this year, Dr Kemp launched a campaign known as Go Career—Enterprise and Career Education. Go Career is a brand logo directed to businesses, schools, parents and the wider community, to help them easily identify which programs and activities are available for young people in developing their career and enterprise skills.
We are living in what we all call today a global economy. Australia has no choice but to move forward and embrace the rest of the world. But to reap the future benefits of open markets and free movement in goods, services and information, we have to lay the necessary groundwork today. Educating and training the next generation of Australians to take full advantage of future opportunities is an essential part of that long-term project.
More than at any other point in her history, the Australia of the future will need a well-educated, highly skilled and flexible work force. The next generation of workers will have to be enterprising and innovative—responsive to the changing world. We need to help our young people today acquire the key skills, but in a globalised world this of itself will not be enough. We also need to help them acquire enterprising attributes that will take them all through their future work life. We need to ensure that they embrace the concept of lifelong learning and that they acquire the capacity to develop and manage their own lives and careers in a world where the only constant is change. 
As we expect our young people in the future to be innovative, so do we in the government need to be innovative today in finding the ever different and fresh ways of preparing young people for their adult life. This is where initiatives like Go Career come in. By getting out to schools and local communities, by sharing the good news stories about young people who have made successful careers through enterprise and career education activities, the participants in and supporters of Go Career can encourage and inspire young people and their parents. When people see the Go Career brand they will know that it is associated with a quality enterprise and career education activity, whether it is vocational education programs in school, career advice, employability skills, work placement or school based New Apprenticeships.
Go Career obviously benefits our young people, but it also benefits Australian businesses. By getting involved in the training of young people who are still at school, businesses will enhance their skills base, and this in turn will help them to become more productive and will improve their bottom line. As well, of course, businesses will be putting something back into the community. There are already well over 50,000 businesses participating in enterprise and career education activities nationally. But the initiative could do with another 50,000. There are over 153,000 young people engaged in these programs plus nearly 6,000 young people in school based New Apprenticeships, an option that was virtually non-existent three years ago. But there is still scope for further progress and expansion.
Schools too have a very important role to play in this initiative by encouraging students to participate in various programs. It is a firm belief of the Howard government which I strongly share that in this and other educational initiatives school authorities should play a crucial role in cooperation with community organisations and businesses in building partnerships and social networks that help students make the transition from school to the wider world.
Education and training have been two areas of public policy which, for all its rhetoric, the Labor Party has much neglected while in government. This is the state of affairs the Howard government made a strong commitment to remedying. Mr Beazley speaks of his Knowledge Nation, but it is the Howard government that has put in place real programs that help our children and young people to obtain decent education and therefore a good start in life. While Mr Beazley cooks up his meatballs and spaghetti diagrams, the Howard government has delivered and served the main course.
Labor's sorry legacy in education was schools where one-third of children could not read and write properly. Labor's legacy was the neglect of apprenticeships and vocational education, and that meant ignoring the needs of 70 per cent of young people who do not go on to tertiary education. In opposition, Labor's tune has not changed—the Australian people are still waiting for realistic, workable policy alternatives from Labor. Instead, Mr Beazley serves out some warmed up class warfare rhetoric and the politics of envy against non-government schools and offers meaningless stunts such as his Knowledge Nation fiasco. Meanwhile, under the Howard government, the total Commonwealth education budget has reached and passed $11 billion a year. This represents a 15 per cent real increase in Commonwealth expenditure between 1994-95 and 2000-01.
—You normally do not read. Dr Kemp wrote that for you.
—Government schools are estimated to have received an additional $1.9 billion from 1997 through to 2000 above what they would have received if funding had been held at Labor's 1996 levels, Senator Ludwig. In 2000 there were 42,000 more students in higher education than in Labor's last year in office. To help children in our primary schools, the Howard government has set up the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, which will assess children's literacy and numeracy skills at the end of years 3 and 5 and, if necessary, take early remedial action, which I am sure, Senator Ludwig, you agree with. To that end, the Howard government will spend almost $869 million over the next four years.
In the area of vocational training the Howard government too has shown great initiative. The government will spend $2 billion over four years for New Apprenticeships initiatives, including $1.5 billion in incentives for employers to take on new apprentices. Over the next three years it is expected that 425,000 young people will become apprentices as a result of the completion of a new round for contracts for New Apprenticeships centres. These are the sorts of practical programs that are bringing tangible benefits to young Australians. No empty rhetoric, just real outcomes. The Go Career initiative is a perfect example of this down to earth, commonsense approach to education and training. The best legacy that any government can leave is to ensure the future wellbeing of its people. I am proud to be a part of a government that understands this challenge and acts on it for the good of our young people and therefore for the future good and prosperity of Australia.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Go Career—Enterprise and Career Education</title>,Adjournment,22,1
