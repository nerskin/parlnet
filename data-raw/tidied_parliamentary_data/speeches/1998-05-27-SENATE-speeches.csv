"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—I would like to ask Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, how large remitters currently make their payments. Do they all do so by electronic transfer? Or do some use other means such as a cheque? If so, what proportion and/or numbers pay other than by electronic transfer? Are some large remitters paying other than by electronic transfer and, if they are, why did the government amend the original clause to eliminate the option for a large remitter to make other arrangements for payment with the commissioner? What is the rationale for the penalty, particularly if the payments are made on time?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-05-27,"—You may notice that Senator Kemp, the Assistant 
 Treasurer, is absent. I am sure he is rushing down here, eagerly anxious to answer your question, but I am certainly not capable of answering it. I regret to say that, until Senator Kemp arrives, I am at some disadvantage.
I do have here some advice from the advisers on withholding arrangements rationalisation and I will put to you the rationalisation.
—This is a filler!
—That is right. I am advised that remittances made by cash or cheques increase ATO handling costs. Cheques, in particular, have a minimum clearing time affecting delays in collection. In recent years the commercial trend has shifted significantly towards conducting business by electronic means. In fact, financial institutions are actively encouraging the use of EFT because of the benefits it provides: better security, reduced paper flows, certainty of delivery, improved cash management, and reduced processing and reconciliation costs compared to cheques. It has been estimated that 95 per cent of large remitters are already connected to or have access to EFT.
—Sorry, was that 95?
—Ninety-five per cent of large remitters are already connected to or have access to EFT. I am advised that there are 5,500 large remitters, therefore we are only talking about five per cent of large remitters incurring the cost of setting up an EFT facility—five per cent of 5,500. In most cases, it is merely a matter of extending the use of the EFT package to handle payments to the ATO. It is not envisaged that this new arrangement will place any unrealistic burden on this group of taxpayers as the approximate cost of the necessary software is between $75 and $400.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—I thank Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer. I think the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer has read from advice that puts the finger on exactly what I was saying yesterday, that it is 95 per cent of large remitters, so five per cent do not. But there is no indication that there was actually a problem. The only indication of a problem in the advice that has 
 just been read out was that that was what financial institutions would prefer. That is what they are pushing everybody to do. Here we have, in my opinion, legislation being used as a kind of corporate fascism.
The corporations would like to reduce their profits, so it is not actually to do with choice but rather it is about the fact that the banking corporations do not want to process other people's cheques. They are starting with some bits of legislation, obviously chewing the ear of the government successfully and saying, `We would like you to legislate to reduce our costs by taking away choice.' In this particular case it is choice that affects companies.
We have examples of the choices to occur in relation to analogue and digital televisions, and analogue and digital telecommunications, but I believe we are going to see a raft of legislation to take away the choice of businesses and to take away the choice of consumers, penalising people not because it is late but because they have paid by cheque, even if they are on time or early, to reduce the costs of corporations. In the end, I believe that leaves less choice for the rest of us because we will get legislation saying, `To go in line with the rest of corporate practice, we are going to legislate that everybody has to do their banking and everybody has to make their payments at some stage by electronic transfer on the basis that we assume that, eventually, everybody will have access to the Internet.' I am not using the slippery-slope thing as my major argument; what I am suggesting is that you have not given any argument, other than that the banks and the financial institutions want it, to suggest why we are actually imposing penalties on companies for not paying in the manner that banks want them to pay.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-27,"—I have to say that I think that you have completely missed the point here. You said, `I'm not using the slippery slope argument,' but the reality is that I think the Hansard  will show that some 60 per cent of your comments related to the so-called slippery slope argument. The truth of the matter is that, where governments want to bring in changes, these bills will have to 
 come through the Senate, and everyone will have a chance to comment.
The next point I would make is that these are very large remitters. This is not an individual. Under the new withholding arrangements, large remitters are those with deductions exceeding $1 million. These are the larger remitters. This is not Joe Blow in the street. As my colleague, Senator Minchin, pointed out when I was delayed outside the chamber, some 95 per cent of large remitters are already connected or have access to the EFT, and there are 5,500 of them. So the first point is that we are not talking about the small shopkeeper; we are talking about the large remitters, of which there are 5,500. There is no merit in the slippery slope argument because the truth of the matter is that, in each case where we wish to impose particular rules, the bills will have to come through the Senate, and the Senate would presumably have a view on it.
The final 40 per cent of your argument is that this is being driven by the banks. It is not being driven by the banks. We believe this is the most efficient way to do it. It is more efficient from the Tax Office's point of view and, frankly, we believe it is more efficient from the corporations' point of view. But it is not being driven by the banks—it is being driven by us. It is better for the Tax Office and better for efficiency to do it this way, and 95 per cent of the people believe it. So you are wrong on the slipper slope, wrong that it may attack small individuals, and wrong that it was driven by the banks. It is driven by us.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—I would suggest that the minister look at the actual notes. Basically, the only positive reason that was given was that the financial institutions would prefer it. I was simply echoing the very statements that were made. I wrote down the words that were mentioned by the minister. I did not say that I was not using the slippery slope argument; I said I was not using it as the mainstay of my speech. However, I can give you any number of examples—for example, tax file numbers. What did we hear the first time that tax file numbers were proposed? We were told, `Oh, it's only about this. It's only for 
 ease.' Eventually, tax file numbers will be used for just about every element that is involved with people's personal, financial and other information.
The reality is that, with this so-called easy way of slipping information—whether it is financial information; whatever the real security issues are, whatever the choices are, for whatever reason—those five per cent of large remitters have chosen to continue their bank remission. They are choosing that themselves. What you are saying is, `You may not choose it any longer and, what's more, if you do choose it, we are going to slap a fine on you. We are going to say you are breaking the law.'",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-27,"—Last night, when this debate was drawing to the witching hour, there was some ambiguity in the position of the opposition in the sense that I said I was disposed. Let me clarify the ambiguity: I support the proposal of the government and I do not support the proposal of the Greens. I have great admiration for the tenacity and fighting spirit of Senator Margetts. It is on display again this morning, and one should admire and respect that. However, from the opposition's point of view, large remitters are not downtrodden people and are, by definition, large organisations remitting big licks of money to the Australian tax system.
The time value of that money that is remitted is important and cannot be swept aside in this argument. If it comes by way of cheque, the Tax Office does not actually receive the money until it is cleared, which may be several days or a week or more after the cheque has been signed. That might seem to be a small point. Given the volume and amount of money concerned, it is actually quite an important point. To transfer these funds in an efficient way is what the amendment is about.
I do not think that anyone will argue that large remitters lack the capacity to do this. In fact, the government has just announced that 98 per cent of them do have the capacity to do this, and I do not think we are imposing an unfair imposition on the other two per cent 
 by doing it this way. In any case, it is with the approval of the Tax Commissioner. Therefore, one imagines an interactive process between the larger remitter and the Tax Commissioner so that the efficiency elements are best dealt with having in mind the capability of the company concerned. But on what side of the argument do you fall—for it or agin it? We fall on the side for the government's position because we do not see the particular imposition. We do think the time value of money is important. This guarantees that that issue is best addressed here.
We are moving forward, too, in terms of electronic commerce. This is an element of electronic commerce that is being implemented through the tax system. If anything, one praises the tax system for being aware of modern technological and business practice and in moving with the times in this amendment, not against it. We therefore support it.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—I can read the numbers quite clearly. That was one of the reasons for continuing to clarify the reason this morning; giving the ALP time to make that clarification. I thank Senator Cook for making that clarification, even if I am rather concerned about the outcomes. I want to ask one final question. I know Senator Kemp has been involved with the discussions in relation to the multilateral agreement on investment. Because it is to the corporate benefit in terms of banking, if there is overseas investment in the banking corporations, I wonder whether by making this choice it is now illegal to pay by cheque. If there is any problem with this particular change in legislation, under the multilateral agreement on investment we would never be able to change our mind because it would be imposing an extra cost on the large corporations as opposed to some of those other remitters who may not necessarily be international corporations.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-27,"—I have to say that this debate is ranging very far and wide. Last night we got into trust losses and franking credit trading. Now we are into the multilateral agreement on investment. I want to 
 make a general plea that we try to keep this debate as tight and as succinct as possible.
—You should have done that last night.
—Yes, terrific!
—What I was seeking to do was to respond to a very wide range of questions which I received last night, Senator Murray.
—Minister, please address your remarks through the chair.
—I am making a general point. I am not trying to score a political point. All I am saying is that this debate is ranging very far and wide.
Senator Margetts has raised the multilateral agreement on investment. There are huge divisions between countries in relation to the multilateral agreement on investment, and it is unlikely that they will be resolved in the foreseeable future. The second point I would make on the multilateral agreement on investment is that Australia has some particular problems with it. We will not be signing any treaty which is not in line with our national interest. I know there is a desperate desire amongst some groups to belt this up. The truth is that there is no imminent signing of any multilateral agreement on investment. There are a lot of issues which remain to be resolved.
Australia will always protect its national interest, as it does in relation to all treaties—environment treaties, trade treaties and multilateral agreements on investment. Australia's position will always be protected. I can assure you that Australia, above all, will retain the right to make sure its laws can be appropriately and fairly applied.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—If anyone was ranging far and wide, it was the minister in that particular case. I asked a specific question. I was not ranging far and wide. In this particular example, we are being asked to change legislation which will be to the benefit of and will reduce the costs of the large corporate banks. If we make this change under the MAI, which Australia was prepared to sign this month—
—What?
—There was never any statement made that Australia was not prepared to sign in May. All the public statements said that Australia was ready to negotiate this in May—that is, this month. It was other countries who Australia stood behind, saying it was their problems not ours. All those statements said that. Given that that is the case, and at some stage we are going to go back to the table, I simply asked in this measure in this legislation whether it meant that we were taking a one-way step.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-27,"—This legislation will not be overruled by the MAI.
—Not now, it won't.
—The Australian government will insist that it has the capacity to make its own laws in relation to this issue. This government will protect its national interest, as it always has. There has been no statement by anyone that we were ready to sign in May. To be quite frank, I have said quite the contrary. That is quite wrong, and I want to put that on the record.
Amendment (by Senator Margetts) not agreed to.
Amendment (by Senator Kemp) agreed to.
—The question is that section 220AAW stand as printed. Senator Margetts, you are opposing section 220AAW?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-27,"—To give Senator Margetts some time, I think her first motion deals with whether people had to make the transfer by electronic transmission. This one seeks to remove the penalty for those who do not. I think that is the purpose of the amendment moved by Senator Margetts.
We are opposing this motion. A lot of the arguments were canvassed in the earlier debate. The penalty of $500 is set at a level above the cost of acquiring an EFT facility. Frankly, the cost of the facility is, as we have said, in the order of $75 to $400 and is 
 designed to influence a large remitter—again, we are talking about very large remitters, those of $1 million and over—into acquiring the necessary EFT facilities. Each time a payment is made by non-electronic means, it raises the costs to the tax office. So, for the reasons which we stated in the earlier debate and for the particular reasons I have stated now, we will be opposing the motion.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—I thank the Senate for its patience. Yes, I suppose, in a way, this is our preferred position. The first amendment to the government's amendment was on the basis that the government's amendment was likely to be dealt with first. Our first amendment was to remove the penalties. In reality, having penalties and having something which is not being allowed are one and the same thing.
Basically, our next step is to oppose the section and get the government to go back to the drawing board and work out why they are having trouble with late remitters and, if they are, deal with it. But I really think this is the wrong way to go about it. We have had the debate and I will not be holding the Senate up any longer. But I guess we would need a bolt of lightning to change the way things have been debated so far. So I simply put that we oppose the section.
—The question is that section 220AAW be agreed to.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-27,"—The opposition will be supporting this amendment by the government. We note that the government is amend 
 ing its own bill in bringing forward this amendment. We note as well that it has done so after this chamber insisted on this legislation going to a Senate committee for public inquiry. One imagines that this amendment has been generated by the response to this legislation at the inquiry and because of the interest in this legislation prompted by the inquiry and other people who have been alarmed at this section.
But it is worthwhile to note that, since the parliament has insisted on that process of open disclosure and a chance for the community to respond to its measures, the government is now moving, albeit in a minor way. We support the amendment.

Before I move into the motivation for my amendment, I should comment on remarks I made in my speech during the second reading debate concerning our intention to move amendments about employee share ownership. We had discussions with the government, which we appreciated. As a result of those discussions, we decided that our intention was probably not appropriate.
We still believe that this is an area where there are problems. We are aware that tax acts come before us regularly. We give notice to the Senate that we will still consider measures in this area which we hope to be able to 
 discuss with the other parties of the Senate. We would make sure that those principles we are pursuing would not allow the rorts that the government has rightly sought to stop with this legislation, an action we support it in. The amendments we would seek would not unduly penalise and discourage more flexible employee share ownership arrangements. So we will be looking at that further, but we thank the government for its advice and assistance in the matter.
If I can now turn to the savings rebate amendments we are putting, I would remind you that in our remarks during the second reading debate we indicated our support for measures to increase Australian private savings. That is almost a motherhood statement; I cannot imagine any politician or political party or organisation which would not say such a thing. But the objectives of savings are obviously to reduce overseas borrowing requirements, increase the financing of Australian business and infrastructure development and, indeed, improve our entire national economic health.
We must, however, now move to criticism. We, and I think other parties in the Senate, believe that the savings rebate intended by the government will not achieve the aim of increasing savings. Treasury considers that the rebate would actually reduce net national savings, because high income earners will be rewarded for doing what they are already doing and low income earners will generally be unable to save money anyway.
Savings initiatives we think should be directed towards increasing medium-term and long-term savings. With this in mind, ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service, did suggest four principles for making the rebate more effective and equitable. I will repeat these to the Senate because we thought they were particularly helpful.
ACOSS thought the rebate should be restricted to long-term financial savings, such as through superannuation and financial institution accounts that are maintained for at least five years. ACOSS thought that the rebate should be linked to contributions and deposits rather than interest so as to make savings of smaller amounts worthwhile. It 
 thought that the rebate should be added to the account rather than paid to the taxpayer directly. They thought that the rebate should extend to compulsory superannuation so that low and middle income wage earners can significantly benefit or, at the very least, be restricted to long-term financial savings, other than superannuation, and be strictly income tested.
We take the view that those principles should be borne in mind by the two major parties competing for who will be in government next time and, hopefully, they will have regard to them when they review the very important issue of trying to improve our Australian savings.
The tax rebate we are considering is a very expensive measure. The 1997 budget projected losses in revenue of $350 million, $1.4 billion and a massive $2 billion over the next three financial years, which is a great deal of money. We thought, frankly, that the government should have conceded that they got this policy wrong, but they have not. Therefore, we believe that the rebates must be means tested and that is what this amendment is about.
The Australian Democrats said before the 1996 election that a savings rebate should be targeted towards longer term savings and be means tested. The coalition's 1996 pre-election commitment means tested the savings initiative, phasing out between net taxable incomes of $35,000 and $39,000.
Our amendment, in fact, presents the coalition's pre-1996 policy of means testing and, in so doing, it would head off a tax windfall for those on higher incomes—who are going to be doing what they are doing anyway—and would save $1 billion a year which hopefully the government might like to put into education, health, legal aid, rail infrastructure or industry policy. I am sure senators could all give a long list of matters in that regard.
We are also attempting to introduce what we thought was Labor Party policy. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, in Hansard on 14 May 1997 in a question to the Prime Minister said:
Since the Prime Minister has said that he will not accept the $450 savings rebate, will he then join me in supporting an amendment that I will move to his legislation to ensure that all people at our level are income tested out of this?
In other words, this is means testing. On 17 May 1997, Ian Davis of the Canberra Times  reported:
Mr Beazley repeated his warning that the opposition would attempt to amend the government's savings rebate announced in the budget so as to means test it, while Mr Howard continued to defend the government's failure to test it.
However, we were a bit dismayed—and quite often it seems there is conflict—to discover that the shadow Treasurer said on 1 April 1998 in Hansard :
. . . Labor's general position that governments are entitled to their major budget measures, however wrong-headed those measures might be. Accordingly I do indicate now that the opposition does not propose to oppose this measure. We think it is very bad policy. We think it is a disgrace, certainly, compared with the company-contribution regime that it replaced.
So, Labor continued to have the view that it is a terrible thing, but the shadow Treasurer seemed to be saying he would not do anything about it. I would have thought from the minister's perspective that he would prefer a consistent approach from the opposition, even where he did not agree with it. Certainly, we would prefer that.
I make a plea to the Senate to support this amendment. We think it implements the policy of the coalition, which we thought was a good policy; we think it implements the intention of Leader of the Opposition, with which we agree; and most importantly of all, it will save about $1 billion, which could be far better used than giving it to the wealthy and better off in our society.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—The Greens (WA) will be supporting Democrat amendments nos. 1 and 2 on sheet 973. We support putting a savings rebate cap on this measure. It is still generous, being on savings and investment incomes of between $35,000 and $39,000. It is an issue of basic equity and I am looking very carefully to see whether the ALP will support this issue of equity on this occasion.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-27,"—Since the Greens (WA) are looking very carefully to see whether the opposition will support this measure, let me help them not to have to stare fixedly for too long and declare the position of the ALP.
We will not be supporting the amendments of the Australian Democrats and we are not supporting them for the reason that this was a budget measure announced in the 1997-98 budget. I know it is odd and strange that the government has not given prominence to its own budgetary centrepiece from that budget—not of this year, but of last year—by not bringing this legislation into this chamber earlier and fiddling around with it, but it is nonetheless a budget measure and we do not wish to play an obstructionist role in opposing central measures from a budget such as this.
However, it is an uneasy decision for us to make because there are two competing principles. They are principles that were enunciated by the Democrats in explaining their legislation, and supported by the Greens (WA), and the principle about budget measures. We opt to take the principle of budget measures as a superior reason in this circumstances. That is not to say that we out of sympathy at all with what the Democrats have put and, indeed, the arguments that they have made for the very good reason that the arguments they have made are sound.
While a centrepiece of 1997-98 budget, this is nonetheless a measure which has received considerable justifiable criticism by economic commentators and political parties, not the least of which is the Australian Labor Party, as an ill-targeted and unfair measure and one that will not do anything—or, if it does, very little indeed—to improve the level of national savings in Australia.
The budget that has just been brought down this month by the government deals with national savings and in the debate about national savings the government trumpets all of the time the measures it believes it has taken to bring public savings into credit. It has done that, and one acknowledges that.
In making that acknowledgment, I do not for one whit acknowledge the very specious 
 arguments that the government puts about the budgetary position created under Labor. That is the most specious, big lie approach to political posturing that I have encountered in recent years, and I do not accept that. But, having drawn a line around that qualification, nonetheless the budget is back in surplus and public savings are therefore returned to surplus.
If you look at the budget papers you will see that aggregate national savings are falling, and that is a serious economic problem for Australia. Private citizens in this country do not save and their propensity to save is declining, which means that we do not generate the level of national savings necessary to make Australian owned investments in our development as a country. We borrow from abroad, from foreigners, to help develop our nation. We invite foreign investment to make up the shortfall that we ourselves are unable to meet because we do not generate a sufficient level of national savings.
This measure was trumpeted as a means of lifting national savings. The problem with it is that no-one believes it will. Even those generous economic commentators who speak on this point—generous to the government's point of view—say that, if it does lift savings, it will be only very little.
The costs, which have been pointed out to the chamber by the Democrats, are set out in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill explanatory memorandum. As to the financial impact, the measure will cost revenue $350 million in the financial year 1998-99, $1.37 billion in the financial year 1999-2000 and over $2 billion in the financial year 2000-01. So at the cost of $350 million, $1.3 billion—nearly $1.4 billion—and $2 billion to the taxpayer the government under this measure will be trying to provide an incentive for people to save money by giving them a tax rebate, in effect. The conditions for that tax rebate are such that really only the wealthy will qualify. So I have considerable sympathy for and have argued the equity point of view myself strongly. That is the overriding position of the Australian Labor Party.
It has to be said that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has recognised the 
 unfairness of this measure by admitting on the day after the 1997-98 budget that he would not be claiming the rebate. We were a bit surprised and taken aback when he said that. He was made to look a bit of a goose when the Australian Taxation Office advised that such a change to the legislation to allow the Prime Minister to opt out of claiming the rebate would cost about $1 million, and that he could not opt out. So even the government is uncomfortable with this measure.
The most telling and damning part of the equity argument is that high wealth individuals will be the beneficiaries. People like Senator Parer, who has profited from tax minimisation, will be the beneficiaries. This is a spectacle of a government making the rich wealthier at the cost of ordinary taxpayers. That is, in summary, what the equity argument is about. I wish I could vote for this amendment. It is a central budgetary measure. On that basis, we recognise that the government has some rights in this field and that its basic budgetary measures should be supported. So we will vote for the amending bill and not for the Democrats' amendments.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-27,"—I must say, I am a little surprised. Senator Cook knows that I hold both him and his arguments in high regard. I have had a great deal of experience with him and as a consequence I have developed that regard. But in this instance I am surprised because the Labor Party has had a position where it has voted against a wide range of major budget items. I recall the debate after the 1996 budget.
I supported you when you voted against the R&D tax concession, the superannuation high income earners surcharge and changes to HECS, all of which were major budget items. I would think that the Treasurer (Mr Reith) is absolutely joyful listening to you over there because I think you have just given him the GST. Surely if the GST comes through as a budget measure you will then be obliged on your principle to support it. I am starting to get into an intellectual and political morass here which I cannot find my way out of. I would have thought it was the job of an 
 opposition to oppose bad policy and to support good policy.
If I can offer you a lifeline, Senator Cook, one of the things which perhaps you as the Deputy Opposition Leader could do would be to assure the Senate and the people of Australia that if you return to government you will introduce means testing of this measure and change the law as soon as you can to restore equity—and not give away a billion dollars in what may be loosely described as a rort for the wealthy and better off, who do not really need it and who do not deserve it in this instance.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—Perhaps while Senator Cook is thinking of his well rounded response, which will set us in train for knowing what the opposition is likely to do in the future, let alone now, I would like to give a broad picture of what we are dealing with when we are looking for extra national savings. Keep in mind that we have a large number of unemployed people. The government is not making it any easier for unemployed people. The indications are that the government wants to remove the disincentive to be employed. So basically it is going to be tighter and tighter for the unemployed, especially when we have a higher percentage of working poor.
Obviously, the classic economic theory is that if we want to look throughout society to see what is available for national savings, we need to have an idea what people are earning, how many people are earning what, and what their costs of living are compared with what they are earning—and see whether they have the capacity to save. We have just had the debate on the social security youth allowance and the government and the opposition got together and said that people on social security measures who are on student assistance cannot actually save $3,000 at the beginning of their year in order to be able to survive the year. We are talking about a wide range of people who are not able to—in fact are legislated against—actually have any savings. It is an irony, isn't it, to be legislated against having any savings backup even to the point of $3,000 at the beginning of the university year. 
In that particular instance, you can see a pattern; a higher and higher percentage of people in Australian society in dissavings, in debt: bankcard debt, debt to their parents, debt to their friends. What are the options when the debt lines close up if impositions occur and people are in desperate straits? There is the old adage, if you have to eat, if you have to pay the rent and so on, you have three options: beg, borrow or steal. Then we are going to have a law and order election, of course.
The issues are about how Australians are saving and what proportion of Australians are saving what. When we have a situation where more and more Australians are either on the margin or in dissavings—that is, they are in debt—we are going to see, with that blind or very tunnel vision, more and more goodies, benefits or kickbacks being given to the rich in our society to get more of their money into savings. I do not know whether that is internationally competitive savings, I would have thought that is internationally uncompetitive savings.
The reason we have got to this position is we have concentrated so much on being internationally competitive and have forgotten about what is happening with the rest of our economy, with the rest of our society. The ability of people to purchase goods and services from local markets has been forgotten altogether. We have concentrated so much on being internationally competitive but it is only the rich that are getting rich enough to be able to put any substantial amount of money into savings. I think we have got to address that instead of continuing down this path of continually throwing the rest of taxpayers' money at the very richest in Australia to try to get them to save their money.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I have been asked to explain the Labor Party's position on two things, given my earlier remarks. The first is the GST and the second is what we will do—should the election that everyone is speculating now will be in August result in a Labor victory and we are in government—about 
 amending this measure to provide greater equity. Let me answer both those questions.
The issue of the GST has been raised by the Australian Democrats because, on the amendment now put by them to the savings rebate, we are saying that was a centrepiece of the budget by the present government in 1997-98 and, as a centrepiece of a budget measure, we are not going to oppose it. The GST, however, is in a different category: it is quite distinct, it is clear and reasonable that it is a different category.
This government is fond of saying the Australian tax system is broken down and needs wholesale review. We say the Australian tax system from time to time needs routine maintenance to keep itself focused on the principal issues of simplicity, equity and transparency and, because there is a major industry out there about tax avoidance, which constantly tries to find loopholes through any system, a prudent government maintains scrutiny to find where those loopholes have been opened up and close them down as quickly as possible.
We do not think the wholesale change to the taxation system is necessary. We do think maintenance is necessary and, at some points of the system, renovation of the system is necessary. Kim Beazley said on the weekend in broad outline that the structure of what we are looking at is a form of negative income tax to overcome positions in which people are caught in poverty traps—if they earn more money they lose a level of entitlements and, therefore, there is an in-built disincentive in the system to actually find work for a category of Australians. That is something that ought to be changed.
We have a very firm position on this tax debate. The government, however—and it is a matter now of notorious record—has got a secret tax committee in the Department of the Treasury which keeps no minutes, publishes no reports, makes no explanation to this parliament through the normal forms of estimates and is operating in secret. The chairman of it said to an estimates committee that there are no records, he keeps them all in his head. We asked the reasonable question, `In a complex issue like tax, how do you 
 know what all of those issues are?' and so forth. He is confident of his memory, he said. This is cloak and dagger stuff. This is something that Australian taxpayers are paying for but they are not told about and it is operating on the instruction that the only option it can look at is a GST option. It is the only one. It cannot look at a non-GST tax structure; it can look only at GST options.
In 1985 when we were in government we undertook reform of the taxation system. We published a major report which we put out there for public debate. It had a number of options in it. The debate raged far and wide in this nation evaluating the options and it culminated in the national tax summit in which all of the interest groups in Australia came forward, put a viewpoint and, on the basis of that viewpoint, we exercised tax reform. That is what we think is the appropriate course for a government to take on an issue as fundamental to Australia's well-being as taxation.
Contrast that with this secretive manoeuvre by the government in which nothing is in the public domain for scrutiny or evaluation. The inspired reports are now saying that the Treasurer may bring down his tax package around 28 June. The newsletter Inside Canberra reports that major accounting houses have been cued by the government to be ready for a tax lockup—that is, to have confidential access to the tax papers in advance of a government announcement on or around 28 June this year.
Everyone says that there is very likely to be an election in August. What we are looking at is an ambush of Australia by the government with a complex series of tax changes. It will tell everyone it is for their benefit but not give them the chance to read the fine print and come to an understanding about what the options are for them. It will present a singular option—the GST option, in whatever form—which is not an option at all. It will not canvass any other alternatives, so people will not be able to compare that option with a non-GST tax structure or some other version of the tax structure. It will be a singular option. We do not think that is democratic government; that is electoral ambush. We do 
 not think this is giving the taxpayer of Australia a fair shake or a chance to understand what is being proposed.
This will be sold with all the glitter and PR publicity that the government can muster. The reports today are that the government has put out a contract for public relations companies to bid for to market its tax package. This is going to be bells, whistles and Hollywood glitter to get into your minds a few headline points without knowing what the fine print is about. Our position is that if we are not successful at the election we will oppose a GST in the Senate, and I said that in this place on the Thursday after the budget came down, in response to the budget. That is bottom-line clear. There is no doubt where the Labor Party stands. That is where we stand.
If the government is not prepared to take the Australian people into its confidence, give them a chance to look at the details of the fine print and understand what it means to them and then run an election; and if we are not successful in the election, we will oppose a GST in the Senate. I think the better option is that we win the election so that it does not arise in the first place. That is far and away the better option.
To those pundits who have said that this is a defeatist approach by the Australian Labor Party, I say this: when we said earlier that we would support it because the government would have a mandate, we assumed the government would do the right thing and disclose what its intentions were. That was not defeatist. When we say we oppose it, that becomes defeatist. The only constant thing is that we are defeated in both propositions. Of course the intention of the Labor Party is win the next election, and I think we have a very good chance of doing that.
So, to the first question put to me in this debate—where do we stand on the GST?—that is where we stand and that is why we stand there. There has to be a process of scrutiny, democratic evaluation and real choice by electors, not tax change by ambush and, I might say, change which will introduce a regressive tax—a tax that imposes on the rich and the poor the same charge.
The second question put to me is: what will we do about this particular item of legislation, and will we amend it to introduce greater equity? That question invites me to say what our policy will be in the whole area of taxation. I know it is not put as some subtle way of creeping into the Labor Party policy machine and invoking an answer about an important detail of policy ahead of time. I know it is put in the context of, `You have said this today. What will you do when you come to government?' That is an honest question.
I have to say that we will announce our policies in detail at the opportune time. We have started to unveil some of those tax policies now, and I refer to what the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Kim Beazley, said on the weekend about a negative income tax. It is no disrespect to the Australian Democrats that I will not answer that question in technicolour cinemascope on the wide screen right now. But what I will say is that we think this measure is inequitable. It will cost taxpayers in the year 2000 over $2 billion and it will benefit the wealthy, not the poor. We do not think that is equity and whether we amend this law or repeal it in its entirety is a matter for our policy.
I cannot go into exactly what we will do, but I cannot emphasise strongly enough that we consider that this does not, firstly, do what it says it will do and improve national savings overall for the nation. We are bolstered in that point of view because it is one that economic commentators, independent of our party, also hold with considerable unanimity across the board. It is not us making a political point; it is objectively true. This scheme will not significantly, if at all, increase national savings. Secondly, there is a consensus of view that it does benefit the wealthy at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. Those two policy principles are foremost in our mind, but I cannot go into the detail of what we will do. I trust that is an explanation in the circumstances that is understood and appreciated by the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-27,"—I just wish to briefly 
 respond. Quite a wide ranging debate has ensued and I do not want to tackle the large range of issues that Senator Cook has just put on the table. They are debates for another day and let me assure you that we will join those with great vigour.
The truth of the matter is that the bulk of the savings rebate will flow to lower and middle income people. We have had a very extensive discussion on that, and it seems to me that no matter how often we put the figures out it does not make any impact on the other side. These are the estimates that we have received, and others may not accept them, but no alternatives have been put out to show where we are wrong. As I said, this is a fair and equitable measure and it provides an incentive to save. I think it will inevitably have the effect of encouraging private saving and that is what the government has stated. We will, therefore, not be supporting the amendments moved by the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-27,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, we are reaching the stage where you will be putting the question, and that is a reasonable and appropriate course. But I wonder if, through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, I can ask the Democrats a question, since they asked me a question relating to the amendments that they moved to the government's bill. Their question to me was: will you amend the government amendment should you become the government after the next election? My question to them is: will you support us if we were to? Since the Democrats asked where Labor stands on the GST, and I answered that, I ask the Democrats: where do you stand on the GST? Will you support one if we are not successful at the next election and if there is such a proposal before the Senate?
—Senator Cook, I know that that question was asked by the Democrats and that you answered it, but we are straying a long way—and I have been very tolerate—from the topic of the amendments under debate. I draw to your attention, Senator 
 Murray, in responding, that we now have moved a long way from your amendments.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-27,"—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. I appreciate your direction. I will go to the first question first. It directly relates to our amendments. We would, indeed, support any attempt to means test the savings rebate made by you if you enter government. Even if you decide not to raise the issue again, we might well raise it when we have the opportunity because we think it will give you another billion dollars which you can put into legal aid, health, education and some of the jobs employment policies which you had and which were sacrificed by government—wrongly so, we believe.
—Can you direct your comments through the chair, Senator Murray?
—Sorry, Madam Temporary Chairman. My apologies. Through the chair, we would respond on that basis. We think the government's savings rebate intention is right, but we think the government's savings intention practice is mistaken. So, yes, we will support you in that and we would indeed move it of our own account.
The second question—as you would expect from a seasoned political practitioner—perverted my question. When I asked Labor the question about a GST, I was in fact responding to their reason for not supporting our amendments despite philosophically being in tune with them. The reason they gave is that it is a substantial budget policy measure. It is perfectly possible—in fact, I think it would be automatic—that, if the coalition get back into government, they will introduce the GST as a budget policy measure. Therefore, logically, what you said would require you to support it.
You have given the reasons that you would take a different view. Our approach throughout the tax reform package discussion has been that, until a tax reform package as a whole is presented to us, we are inclined to view everything with an open mind, and that is how we will view it.
—The question is that amendment Nos. 1 and 2 moved by Senator Murray be agreed to.
	 Question put.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-27,"—On behalf of the opposition I rise to speak on the national transmission network legislation and to outline our very strong opposition to this legislation, which is the privatisation of the national transmission network in Australia. We have had a reasonable opportunity through the Senate legislative committee process to hear the evidence from the government to justify why this agency should be privatised. In the time given there was a lot of evidence received. Some of it, you might say, was from the usual suspects in favour of privatisation, as you would expect, while others expressed concern about it. The main concern that a lot of people raised was the lack of information provided by the government as to why the agency should be privatised and what the advantage was to the national interest in its privatisation.
The government itself could not answer those concerns other than, in our view, by stating an ideological position that it was a good idea to privatise for the sake of privatising. The government mentioned that when the agency was sold, the money would go to pay off public debt. When we asked for any idea of what the agency would bring when it was privatised, the government's Office of Asset Sales said, `Those are estimates we do not want to divulge because it could effect the price we receive.' But, even when asked for a broad range of figures, they still would not give them to us. We even offered to have in camera briefings of the committee to find out that information. Again, that was not forthcoming.
Other people have speculated that the agency may bring $200 million, $180 million or $250 million. That is not a large amount of money, and its contribution to paying off public debt will be minuscule indeed. The savings on the interest at the present bond rate of about six per cent would be only a few million dollars at the very most. Compare that 
 to maintaining in public ownership what is a national asset. The community, through various governments of the day, including previous coalition governments and Labor governments, has invested many hundreds of millions of dollars to build a national network right across Australia with something like 1,500 transmitters and translators available for our national broadcasters—the ABC and the SBS—and, where appropriate, for commercial broadcasting services and community broadcasting services.
This is a national infrastructure. The government should be assisting in the provision of services to all the community on an equitable basis. A commercial sector would never have built a national transmission agency with a national infrastructure, providing a service to all Australians wherever they live. You would have got them building transmitters in each of the capital cities, but you would not have got them building transmitters and translators out in the rural and regional areas of Australia. Both governments—Labor and Liberal—have, in the past, made that contribution.
Yet, for some reason, out of the blue, this government, without justification, has decided to privatise. There is no demand in the community that this agency should be sold off. It is not being sold off because it was not performing or there was a deficiency in its performance, or because the Australian public said, `The National Transmission Agency is useless; let's get rid of it.' No arguments like that came from anywhere. One might say, `Well, a lot of people in Australia may not be aware that there even is a National Transmission Agency in existence.' I think many people probably believe that the transmitters and translators that the ABC and SBS use are actually owned by the ABC and SBS and do not understand that there is a separate, dedicated, corporatised agency providing that service.
But, nevertheless, even if they did believe that the ABC and SBS owned the transmitters and they were not performing properly, there would still be issues raised at the political level, at the parliamentary level, that this service was not up to scratch and ought to be 
 changed—that something should be done about it. There was no justification given in the hearings by the government that the National Transmission Agency was inefficient and not performing. In fact, the evidence was to the contrary. Even Mr Hutchinson from the Office of Asset Sales agreed—and the government, DoCA and the finance department agreed—that there had been a substantial improvement in efficiency in the National Transmission Agency since the early 1990s, since it was given a new structure and administrative arrangements under legislation introduced by the previous Labor government. 	Those estimates are in the report. It is not disputed that there was a 40 per cent improvement in the efficiency and the productivity of this agency in public ownership.
If any organisation, public or private, had a 40 per cent improvement in half a decade in the delivery of service, you would give it a big tick. But why would you want to sell it? The only reason is that this government sees it as an ideological position that they want to support. I think it is also part of their view that selling the National Transmission Agency also justifies the ideological position that they took over the major privatisation issue of Telstra.
It is no surprise that the Labor members of the committee—Senator Lundy and I—have put in a minority report which opposes privatisation. I also note that the minority report of Senator Lyn Allison of the Democrats is along similar lines to the Labor Party's submission in that it opposes the privatisation. Again, we and the Democrats have a similar view.
I want deal with three or four of the major issues from our minority report that did come forward in the hearing, even though the hearing was short. Quite rightly, we did not object to this matter going to a legislative committee. First of all, I want to deal with the community service obligation. It is clear from this legislation that it is a big ask for the Australian people to believe that the community service obligations in this proposal are going to be substantive enough to guarantee that in the future the National Transmission Agency, or whoever buys it, will provide 
 services, particularly to non-metropolitan Australia. Service may be provided for five years while the ABC and SBS have to continue to use the privatised National Transmission Agency. But after that five years is up, it is really buying a very big pig in the poke in terms of what is going to happen to the provision of these services in regional Australia.
What has been occurring in the administration of the National Transmission Agency is a natural and proper cross-subsidisation. The administration costs of the provision of services to the regional areas of Australia has in effect been subsidised by having a national agency. There is no doubt that a private operator will start getting into full cost recovery, and that means that in the bush, after the five years are up, operators, whether it is the ABC or the SBS, will start being charged differently. The ABC and the SBS could then say, `Well, we are off. We are not going to have a contract with you mob. We will go and maybe provide our own transmitter or do a deal with somebody else.' What that then means is that a national infrastructure is shredded or broken up into different parts, which means a different level of service to different parts of Australia. That is the logical conclusion of selling the National Transmission Agency.
We do not believe the legislation in any way guarantees appropriate community service obligations. We do not believe that there is a mechanism in this legislation to ensure that the higher cost of providing a transmission facility in the rural and regional areas of Australia is adequately dealt with. The minister will get up and proclaim that it is and will say, `Trust us. It will be okay in the future.' People in regional Australia no longer take those promises about the provision of services—the promise of `Trust us. The service will stay the same'—from any government. They have seen too many examples, both in the public and the private sector, that services to regional and rural Australia are the first to suffer when you put in full cost recovery.
I also want to point out some other issues of national interest. In our report we comment 
 on the submission from the Friends of the ABC. I know this government thinks that the Friends of the ABC is a bunch of left-wing radicals whose aim is to carry out a political campaign against this government. The Friends of the ABC is actually one of the most moderate organisations of people I have met. They are overwhelmingly Liberal voters. When you meet the Friends of the ABC you are not meeting a left-wing branch of the Labor Party; you are meeting upper middle-class, middle-aged woman and men—overwhelmingly women—who are concerned about maintaining the ABC. The Friends of the ABC are not what this government might choose to call left-wing suspects, et cetera. They are overwhelmingly supporters of the coalition and have been historically for a long time.
They raised their concern on the national interest that in the long run these facilities may well be fully controlled by some foreign interest. Having your national transmission facilities run by somebody from another country is an issue. You do not want to be xenophobic about it, but it is an issue that in the national interest this ought to be controlled by Australians, because it is a national structure of communication across the nation. It is the fabric which keeps the nation together. Providing this communication, we can ensure that a government announcement in a time of emergency is distributed right across Australia. Again, the government might say, `Under the Defence Act we can in times of emergency call on those powers to get our message across,' and so on. But I think this goes wider on a day-to-day basis. This is an instrumentality which does provide, under Australian ownership, an infrastructure that is important to all Australians.
I now come to an area where I think the government is really asking us to buy the very biggest pig in a poke. It is the so-called compact between the government and the ABC and SBS regarding future funding for transmission. When this bill was being discussed before the committee, we asked the government, `Have you reached agreement with the ABC and SBS on how much money you will provide to them over the next five 
 years to pay for the transmission costs when you are forcing the ABC and SBS to buy those services from a privatised national transmission agency?' The government could not give us any information that an agreement had been reached. When we asked the ABC and SBS, when they turned up, still all we could get was, `Well, discussions are proceeding.' If the government cannot, here in the second reading debate or in the committee stage, outline to the Senate what is the actual financial commitment that the government has given for the next five years to the ABC and SBS to cover the costs of transmission, it really will be an awful outcome. Once the agency is sold and the ABC and SBS have not got a contractual arrangement locked away that the money will be made available, the government can do what it likes to the ABC and SBS and can cut the transmission funding.
Normally you might not be too worried that a government in good faith and goodwill will reach an agreement, but you would not trust the this government as far as you could throw it in its dealings with the ABC. This very morning the minister for communications, Senator Alston, is not here debating this bill. Guess where he is? He has gone up to the ABC board meeting in Sydney to beat them around the head over allegations of bias against the coalition and to demand changes within the ABC on programming to overcome the minister's so-called concern on bias. The minister is there abusing the ABC this morning, not down here explaining to us how much money has been committed by the government to the ABC and SBS to pay for the transmission costs.
At the very least, the government should have the ethics and the morality to come in here and say, `Yes, we have reached agreement with the ABC and SBS. We are going to provide them with $120 million per annum for X number of years,' or whatever the figure is; and the same for the SBS. It has now been several months since this bill was before the committee. As far as I am aware—I stand to be corrected—no agreement has been reached. I trust Senator Brownhill, the parliamentary secretary at the table, and I ask 
 his advisers from the department, `Have we reached agreement with the ABC and SBS? Has there been an announcement made? If there has been agreement reached, why has it not been made public before the second reading stage of this bill has taken place?' If it has been made public and I have missed it, I apologise, but I do not think it has been reached.
Perhaps I am being too harsh on Senator Alston. Perhaps he has gone to the ABC board this morning to say, `By the way, I can tell you that this is what we have reached agreement on and I'm signing off with you here today. We are going to provide you with an appropriate amount of money for the transmission costs of the ABC and SBS.' I have to say, in view of this minister's track record, that that is a very big ask indeed.
The next issue, about why this agency should not be privatised, is: irrespective of the running costs of the National Transmission Agency that the ABC and SBS have to pay, what money is available for the digitisation program? We in the opposition believe you cannot divorce the cost of the digitisation program now that it has been put on the table by the government in another bill on the digital program for introducing digital television and digital radio to Australia. In the budget, this mean-spirited, mealy-mouthed government promised the ABC $20 million and then said, `If you are good and if we like what you do in your programming, we may give you some more.'
It is blatant blackmail by this government to intimidate the ABC as we lead up to the next election. Never before has a coalition government acted in such a disgraceful way as this minister has, egged on by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It is blackmail of the ABC to say, `We will give you $20 million now. Sell all your other property and introduce full outsourcing of programming, and then we may give you some more money for the digitalisation of the ABC for its equipment.' We all know that, early next century, if the ABC's equipment is not digitalised it will go out of existence as a national broadcaster. That is exactly what this minister and this 
 Prime Minister want to happen to the ABC—to destroy it as a broad based national broadcaster, independent of government, providing factual and broad ranging views to the Australian people.
It is ironic that, today, this bill for the privatisation of the National Transmission Agency and its major impact on the ABC are being debated when the minister himself is at the ABC board, up there abusing them, accusing them of bias—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. To make accusations about people doing things when the opposition do not even have a clue what is happening up there at the moment is absolutely out of order.
—There is no point of order.
—I say to the parliamentary secretary, Senator Brownhill, that we know the minister is up there accusing them of bias because that is what he said on the public record. He said it in this place in the last two weeks. He said himself, on the public record, that the ABC is biased in the covering of a number of national issues and, `We don't like your coverage.' He accused the ABC of bias first, then wrote a letter to the chief executive of the ABC demanding a response to his allegations of bias. He should have at least written first if he had concerns and, before he made the allegations and charges and public abuse, then made some comment. He did it round the other way.
We know what he is there for. He said it himself. He is going to raise these issues of what he sees as bias. It is intimidation and this sale of the National Transmission Agency is another way in which this government is aiming to destroy the ABC as a national broadcaster in this country. That is why, above all else, we will never vote for the sale of the National Transmission Agency. We believe it is a very important national infrastructure that all Australians would support. I commend to the Senate the opposition's minority report and hope that the Senate has the good sense to defeat this bill in the second reading. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-05-27,"—As we have heard, the purpose of the legislation that is now before us is to provide for the sale of the national transmission network. The Democrats do not support the sale of essential government infrastructure unless it is proved to be in the public interest. We are not convinced that this is the case with the national transmission network, especially as it stands at the moment.
I am sure government members will remember—certainly I remember and I know Senator Schacht will remember—what was announced in the Better Communications policy document, which came out just before the last election. It stated that the coalition would increase the national broadcaster's responsibility for the transmission of their programs. On page 7 of the document, the government states:
. . . the Coalition sees no valid reason why the national broadcasters should not have control over their transmission facilities. After all it is the national broadcasters who are criticised whenever their sub-standard transmission quality or breakdowns occur. . . Accordingly, and in line with an increasing trend around the world, the Coalition will fund the ABC directly for its transmission costs on the strict condition that national coverage and existing service commitments to rural and remote areas are continued.
How on earth the ABC is able to keep up proper transmission to rural and remote areas with no money to do it, I do not know. Of course, that is what is happening at the moment. Senator Boswell will tell you—Senator Boswell has—that there is a real problem with the ABC's transmission in the bush. That is an absolute, direct result of a lack of funding to the ABC. I hope everybody listening in rural and remote areas realises that. I am sure they do. The coalition's policy also commits to the same outcome for SBS. That is on page 9 of their policy. Unfortunately, though, that is where the good policy stops.
The national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, have sought control over their transmission facilities for a very long time. But the Democrats do not believe that the way to achieve that outcome is for the government to sell off the transmission facility, the national 
 transmission network. We would much rather see the national broadcasters properly funded for the costs of their transmission facilities, not as a separate line item in the budget but directly and as part of their total funding appropriation. That way, the ABC and SBS would be able to enter into direct commercial relationships with a number of transmission service providers, including the NTN, commercial providers and others. That may even have the effect of challenging the way the National Transmission Agency, which operates that network, operates.
The national broadcasters and the National Transmission Agency have not always had a very convivial relationship. That is not the fault of either of those organisations but the effect has been that, over a considerable period of time, neither the ABC nor SBS has developed a particularly sound working relationship with the NTA, and that has negatively affected all of them.
But that problem should not be resolved by selling off one arm of the government's business to the private sector. Time and time again, successive governments have laid claim to the fact that transferring the operational capacity of a government agency to the private sector will produce the scope for greater client focus and responsiveness which flows from commercial practice, and of course that is just not the case. The Democrats reject the notion—and this is something that we hear all the time from this government—that everything in the public sector is inherently bad and inefficient and everything in the private sector is inherently efficient and cost effective. It is Animal Farm: four legs are good and two legs are bad.
Selling the transmission facilities does not necessarily set the scene, as the government claims, for a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market. The national transmission network currently operates as a sort of monopoly, with the national broadcasters the only guaranteed customers. Competition is only likely to take place between the National Transmission Agency and a commercial provider, and then only on the eastern seaboard or other coastal regions of Australia. That is where the population is.
At the very least the Democrats believe that, if the bill passes the second reading stage in the Senate and the sale proceeds, the government should use the funds to pay for the digitisation of the ABC, SBS and some community broadcasters. And if they cannot find the $1.6 million elsewhere, then they can use some of the funds to immediately reopen the Cox Peninsula shortwave transmission facility.
In the latest budget, the government has costed the proceeds of the national transmission network into forward estimates. That is a courageous move on their part. In its submission to the inquiry into this sale bill, the Department of Communications and the Arts stated that the proceeds would pay for the cost of the ABC and SBS contracts for transmission; the cost of funding providers of Radio for the Print Handicapped services and commercial broadcasting licensees in declared remote areas for increase in transmission costs resulting from commercial charging—
very noble; discretionary funding to the ABC and SBS for minor transmission enhancements; and the costs of planning and administering transmission services by ABC and SBS. Since the government would have had to fund these programs regardless of the sale of the NTN, why is the department apparently double counting those proceeds?
The sale does not result in the government suddenly receiving the money it requires to fund these transmission services. The government simply wants to eliminate, as far as possible, its activities in the direct provision of telecommunications infrastructure, and it is slowly going about doing just that. That is why we recommend that any proceeds be used to fund national broadcasters in their transition to digital technology, and our amendments reflect this. We also make provision for a proportion of the funds to be used by the community broadcasting sector's transition into the digital environment.
As Senator Schacht told us just a moment ago, the ABC is being given $20.8 million. That sounds like a lot of money, but it is minuscule. If you talk to the commercial broadcasters, they believe they needs hundreds of millions of dollars to change over 
 into digital processes—hundreds of millions. This government is `generously' allowing the ABC $20.8 million to try to change over with. I have spoken to the minister about this and he tells me that it is really only part one and, depending what happens, then maybe they will get part two as well, and goodness knows what part two will be—$½ million, $1 million. It will not be anything like the hundreds of millions of dollars that they need—or that the commercial broadcasters tell us that they need.
The national transmission network's 550 transmission facilities are used to carry television and radio signals for the national broadcasters. Some commercial and community stations access the national transmission network, which also provides the transmission for emergency broadcasters and for Radio for the Print Handicapped. Telstra, Optus, Vodaphone and paging and data services also use the NTN.
In his second reading speech, the minister stated that the government recognised the importance of safeguarding important broadcasting policy objectives, including the maintenance of existing ABC and SBS coverage and service quality. We were pleased to hear this. But we do not think that the community service obligations contained in the bill provide adequate access to certain broadcasters. We have the community sector in mind here particularly.
The emergence of digital broadcasting will pose special and significant broadcasting challenges, some of which cannot yet be determined, and we believe the bill should at least try to take some of these into consideration. Naturally, emergency service operators, Radio for the Print Handicapped and government and non-profit self-help re-transmission broadcasters deserve special attention, and we are pleased that the bill recognises that. Commercial broadcasting licensees in declared remote areas are also defined as nominated customers in the bill, and they should receive guaranteed access to sites and transmission towers. But the bill cannot guarantee that these services will continue to receive special treatment after the initial five-year contract period of transition from the public 
 to the private sector. Too much remains unclear and undetermined, particularly after that five years.
The national broadcasters are of the view that the sale should proceed. That is not because they are of the view that the privatisation of the network is a good idea—they have no view on that—but because the contracts and the compacts have enabled the national broadcasters to negotiate a more suitable arrangement for the transmission of their television and radio services to Australians than is currently the case. The government, in line with their election commitment, should have enabled the national broadcasters to undertake contractual arrangements with service providers regardless of the sale of the network. If the government were truly serious about competition, it would have found other ways to introduce it, not merely by selling a monopoly provider to the private sector. This in itself does not guarantee a competitive outcome.
The compact with the government and the contracts with the future owner or owners, the ABC and SBS believe, will provide adequate protection for both broadcasters and the viewing and listening public. In particular, the contract with the future owner will ensure that coverage and service levels for the current services are maintained. While the national broadcasters should not be doubted—as I am sure they have been really cautious in their approach to this whole situation and, of course, they can be trusted—I sincerely hope their predicted outcome is right.
The contracts and the compacts will be signed by all parties for an initial five-year period and will be subject to renegotiation for a period of up to 14 years in total. Those measures are designed to protect the broadcasters against higher possible costs from the post-sale arrangements. We hope that is the case, but being subject to the funding whims of this government in particular, nothing can be certain.
The Democrats also have concerns about the sale process itself. During the committee process, the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing was not able to provide details of the anticipated sale price 
 or details about the intended purchasers. The Democrats are concerned about a possible conflict of interest if the owner of the network is a commercial broadcaster. We believe that the new owners ought to be specialist transmission providers, not broadcasters.
Channels 7, 9 and 10 are all part of the consortiums who have bid for the network. With all the uncertainty underpinning the future of broadcasting as one of the reasons the government wants to back out of transmission service provision, it appears that commercial broadcasters understand the importance of owning national broadcasting transmission infrastructure at this crucial time much more than the government does.
We would certainly hope that, in the event of transmission failure, the commercial interests would not override the public interest and that all broadcasting services would be afforded equal importance. Transmission cannot be left to the market to decide when the national broadcasters are dependent on a concept of the public good. The Democrats note that the access regime for the national transmission network is similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry but only for certain nominated customers. The access regime is designed to guard against any imbalance in power which might lead to an essential transmission service or facility being available.
In dealing with the latest Telstra bill, the Democrats have become aware that some provisions in the access regime do not benefit all the players in the marketplace. Those provisions are also designed to ensure that not all services are available at monopoly prices. To invoke the cliche, there is no level playing field in the telecommunications industry, particularly with the strength that Telstra has in the marketplace, and it does not look to us as though there will be in the near future. How can we expect the provision of transmission facilities to guarantee equal access to all broadcasters, particularly the smaller ones?
The Democrats have drafted amendments to safeguard access and to provide for a better community service obligation scheme, assuming that the bill gets past the second reading stage. We would prefer that the national 
 broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS, achieve control of their transmission facilities from means other than the sale of a government asset, especially one which provides an essential service. We also reject the government's notion that everything in the private sector is efficient and the public sector is inherently inefficient and uncompetitive. The government could have made a number of policy decisions which would have given the national broadcasters control of their transmission facilities, it would have given them secured funding for broadcasting and for their digital conversion, but that is not what they have done.
In response, the Democrats have formulated a key amendment to the bill which will see the proceeds of the sale given to the national broadcasters in order that some of the infrastructure development funding they require can be secured. Securing funding for the national broadcasters is far more important than the government's argument about debt retirement or their ideologically position, straight out of Animal Farm, of four legs good, two legs bad.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1998-05-27,"—(11.17 a.m.)—The national transmission network carries television and radio signals for the ABC, SBS, some commercial radio and TV stations and vital community services, such as Radio for the Print Handicapped. It includes 1,197 radio and television transmitters used to broadcast ABC and SBS radio and television services from 547 owned and leased sites and 520 transmitters belonging to 167 licensed broadcasters. There is also a large number of other transmitters housed for radio communications, police and emergency services and other services.
Due to expansion over the last few years, the agency has the potential to reach 18 million Australians, which significantly includes rural and regional Australia. The national transmission network is part of the National Transmission Agency, a separate cost centre operating on a commercial basis outside the department of communications. From all accounts, the NTA is an efficient operation. Over the last few years the NTA 
 has undergone extensive changes in its operations. Telstra held a monopoly over this outsourced operation and maintenance role of the network, but under competitive tendering it now shares the work with Broadcast Communications Ltd, a division of Television New Zealand Australia Pty Ltd. BCL is the forerunner to acquire the NTN. A company from the United States, Castle Group, has also emerged as another frontrunner in the bid to acquire the national transmission network.
Tendering resulted in savings of $20 million in 1995-96. Once again, we see an Australian owned enterprise, which is efficient, about to pass into foreign ownership. It is also worth noting that there was a scoping study done for the sale of the NTN by the government, the results of which have not been released. The sale is not in our national interest and will not lead to any economic or social efficiencies. As Stewart Fist pointed out in his article in the Australian earlier this year, the fee and budget estimates match, meaning little real long-term gain, only short term, which is a way of borrowing against budgets of future governments who will have to bear the cost.
At the public hearing on 5 February 1998, the Office of Assets Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing and the Department of Communications and the Arts were unable to provide specific examples of any efficiencies that would occur as a result of the sale of the NTN. The bill outlines that transmission coverage for the ABC and the SBS will be funded by the government for the next five years for the purchasers of the national transmission network. The onus, therefore, is on the broadcasters to ensure quality of coverage. There will be a direct commercial relationship between the ABC and the SBS and the transmission carriers, where previously the link was mediated through the government. The government is ridding itself of responsibility to all Australians, particularly those in rural and regional areas.
On Monday of this week, representatives of the ABC and the SBS came to my office to speak to me about this bill, to tell me that they support it. I listened to them as they outlined the reasons for their support. The Senate legislation committee which examined 
 this bill heard from representatives of the SBS, witnesses who stressed that the sale of the NTN facilities provided them with the more flexible delivery opportunity that they had been seeking for a number of years. It is okay for our national broadcasters to support this sale. Access to transmission services for them is guaranteed in the bill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our community and self-help broadcasters. The question arises that, once the NTA is privatised, will the ABC and the SBS have to have an additional sum of money to pay the new privatised owner the recurrent cost of running the services? There may also need to be an additional fee to cover the capital cost, the amount that these companies will tender to purchase the network. Has any research been done into this issue? Does the minister responsible have any comment or response? I eagerly await his reply.
What guarantees are there for the maintenance of existing services and service quality, particularly after the five-year contractual agreements have run out? There is an option for the bodies involved to renew for two terms of five years on terms and conditions to be negotiated. How much will our national broadcasters have to pay for transmission services? Will they be priced out of the market? Perhaps this is a long-term objective of the Howard government: a great way to save money, to starve the ABC of funding by then starving the ABC and the SBS of ready access to government controlled transmission of services and then forcing them to close, saving even more money.
The ALP dissenting report points out that there is also the problem of a conflict of interest should a commercial broadcaster purchase the NTA. Commercial programming and services could be prioritised by the potential commercial broadcaster to the detriment of ABC and SBS services. Also there are no guarantees that the ABC and the SBS will continue to receive sufficient funds to maintain and improve their services.
Following on from this, the national transmission network sale has particular importance for rural and regional communities, where often the ABC and SBS are the main 
 media and information links with the rest of the world. The NTA annual report for 1995-96 states that almost 90 per cent of the value of transmission assets has been provided to serve regional Australia. That clearly is a big investment on the part of federal governments over the last six years.
In its submission to the Senate legislation committee, the Department of Communications and the Arts said that the access regime provisions in the legislation would ensure that residents of remote areas would continue to receive the same level of broadcasting service after the sale of NTN as being received currently. Yet the bill itself contains no guarantees regarding maintenance of service in regional and rural areas. Also, there is uncertainty over the role that the future owner of the NTA will have in the planning of transmitting facilities in rural and regional Australia.
A great deal of the argument being used against the full privatisation of Telstra and the potential flogging off of Australia Post can be used for this sale. Many Australians in rural and regional areas now rely on new technologies, such as the Internet and e-mail, to keep in touch with the rest of the world. An article which was published in the Bulletin earlier this month outlines the problems that may arise with the full privatisation of Telstra. Even though only partly privatised now, many claim that maintenance services have been reduced already. This serves as a dangerous example for the transmission of radio and television under a privatised national transmission network.
The real fear, of course, is that there will not be any expansions or upgrades in our rural and regional areas, as a private sector transmission company will be more interested in metropolitan areas as they will be more profitable. This will lead to a decline of services over time with the possibility that, if something goes wrong, if there is an outrage when broadcasting goes down, it will take a long time to be fixed or it will not be fixed at all.
The last few years have seen an expansion of the network into regional Australia. In 1996-97 the ABC's youth radio network, 
 Triple J, was extended into an another eight regional centres. This extended the audience by 3.7 million, and makes Triple J accessible to 80 per cent of the Australian population, or 14.5 million people. The expansion program of Triple J has been an ongoing one. Announced in the 1993-94 federal budget, the then Labor government said that it would bring the youth service to 44 regional communities via the NTA transmission network. Prior to this, Triple J was heard only in the six state capitals and Darwin, Newcastle and Canberra. Now people in Geraldton and Kalgoorlie, Mackay and Mt Isa, and Broken Hill can listen to Triple J, bringing young people and the young at heart in these rural areas into contact with the pre-eminent youth radio station in the nation.
But it is not only our younger generation that have benefited from the NTA's expansion of services and transmission. ABC TV, Radio National and local radio were brought to new audiences by way of 33 transmitters in 1996-97, and SBS was extended to two major regions. Radio National now has 235 transmitters compared with the nine it had in 1981. Even up until January of this year, the network was expanding due to transmission being extended in Queensland, with further expansions expected into rural New South Wales and Victoria.
Further, another two NTA translator facilities were installed in Tasmania under the Tasmania broadcasting development program; the ABC's Classic FM was extended to Warrnambool; and agreement was reached with a pay TV operator to share NTA facilities in Tamworth. While on the subject of expansion of the network, the NTA also has a role to play in testing, development and improvements in the quality of service and transmission, more recently running trials using the latest technology, digital radio broadcasting, in conjunction with the Department of Communications and the Arts.
The future roll-out of digital terrestrial television has been delayed due to the prospect of the sale of the network. Trials were to begin last September but have been pushed back to June 1998. This is one of the major challenges that will face whatever is left of 
 the NTA after the sale. Up until now the network has had the opportunity to provide the best transmission services for rural and regional Australians. Now it will be dependent on the profit motive and money saving, rather than on providing services. That must be a major disappointment for all Australians but particularly for those who live in regional and rural areas. Community organisations, such as community television and radio, need the current services to be maintained, or they will be unable to keep on operating if fees for transmission are increased. This is a real threat.
From the 1995-96 annual report of the NTA, about one-third of the broadcasting transmitters on NTA sites are used to broadcast services other than the ABC or SBS. These are not all community self-help or emergency services; there are some commercial broadcasters involved. They utilise 522 of the 1,719 transmitters across the network. Commercial services utilise 418 transmitters; community services, 24 transmitters; and self-help systems, 61 transmitters. What this indicates is that there are a number of transmissions, other than those of ABC and SBS, that will be seriously affected by the sale of the network.
The Minister for Family Services, the Honourable Warwick Smith, assured the parliament that self-help groups, emergency service operators and remote commercial satellite service providers will be protected by the access regime. Capped charges and contracts or supplementary funding will ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged. This is lucky for them, but not for all the other community providers and broadcasters. Community broadcasters will be the hardest hit. They will be the first ones to feel the pinch when access and transmission fees are increased, and the least able to afford to continue broadcasting.
The ALP dissenting report indicated the grave concern that the community service obligations contained in the bill are more limited than those currently in existence. There are no guarantees on charging and access issues and community broadcasters are concerned that they will be forced to close 
 down if they are charged market rates. Also, the legislation has ignored the needs of the hearing impaired.
While the member for Bass talked about capping, there is no guarantee on how long it will last. Senators can rest assured that the capping or supplementary funding will expire and these other broadcasters—and I am particularly concerned about the community broadcasters—will be left in the lurch. They will be abandoned and unable to serve their communities because of the Howard government which is intent on selling off everything to the detriment of our rural and regional communities.
The sale of the national transmission network could only have a detrimental impact on broadcasting, particularly in rural and regional Australia. Again, the Australian people are faced with another sell-off of a national asset that may not be as well-known as another of our communications facilitators, Telstra, but is just as important to those in our rural and regional areas.
This government appears oblivious to community and social concerns about the importance of the provision and quality of these services; services that will no doubt be downgraded or lost when the NTA is sold. The sell-off of the national transmission network is just another sign of the mantra of the Howard government. It has major implications for regional and rural Australia, which again, despite the rhetoric of the Howard government, suffer the worst effects of its policies.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-05-27,"—As my colleague Senator George Campbell has outlined, the Labor Party will be opposing the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 and the associated consequential amendments bill.
There is a very good reason for us opposing these bills, because these measures seek to sell off what is an essential and crucial part of Australia's telecommunications and communications infrastructure; infrastructure that provides metropolitan and regional Australia alike with their broadcasting services. These bills seek to sell off the assets of the National Transmission Agency, assets which are 
 currently owned by all Australians and managed for the good of all Australians.
The National Transmission Agency can be held up as an impressive organisation and is in fact one of the world's largest broadcasting facilities. The assets of the NTA include 1,197 transmitters used to broadcasting the ABC and SBS radio and television services right around the Australian continent. Perhaps that gives us an insight as to why this government is selling the network. With what they are doing to the ABC and SBS, perhaps there will not be anything of substance to broadcast soon.
The relationship between the cutbacks to our national broadcasters and to this sale of the National Transmission Agency cannot be ignored. This relationship represents a commitment by this government to an ideological agenda of deconstructing the communications services provided through taxpayers' funds for the benefit of all Australians.
The NTA facilities also accommodate 503 transmitters belonging to licensed broadcasters and more than 1,000 radio communications transmitters. Why is it that Australia has such an impressive and large broadcasting infrastructure network? It is because, unlike this current government, some former administrations had the foresight, commitment and understanding as to why it was so critical for such a vast country as ours to have a well-defined, efficient and extensive physical infrastructure.
A network that is managed by government to ensure that broadcasting services are available to all Australians is what we require. We know, because of what has happened with Telstra and the reduction in services that can be largely attributed to a change in Telstra's priorities as a public organisation—now a partially private organisation—that there is a relationship between that commitment to services to all Australians and ownership. We also know that the intent, will and philosophies of the government of the day also determine the quality through the level of the funding afforded to those services.
Out of all of NTA's assets there is one component that is absolutely invaluable and cannot be quantified, and that is the people 
 who work there. In this government's rationalist quantifying of government assets and the sort of dollar it hopes to reap from its sale, it cannot quantify the corporate knowledge and experience of the workers, many of whom have spent their whole professional lives working for this organisation. There are people within the NTA that have seen it grow, develop and provide a remarkable service that they are very proud of as employees of the NTA and the Australian Public Service. They are also very proud of the actual technical capacities that they have been able to achieve.
It is because of the dedication and commitment of the people who work there that we have seen the NTA go from strength to strength, with improved and more efficient services as well as clocking up some singularly identifiable and impressive achievements. It is particularly because of the NTA's excellent performance over recent years that there can be no argument and no justification for the government to be bringing the bills before this place. There is no argument or justification from the government as to any inefficiencies. There is no argument from this government as to why it can justify the sale of the NTA in any form.
Evidence of this lack of justification, I believe, can be found in the government's refusal to release its scoping study. That scoping study would canvass and seek to quantify the economics behind the structure of the NTA and the services it provides, the cost to government and the returns to government in the form of service. How is this parliament to decide whether the government is proceeding down the most appropriate route in maximising the return to the Australian taxpayers and seeking to protect the public interest without this information being available? Does the government expect us to do it on trust?
I believe this government has lost the trust of the Australian people with its short-sighted measures. These short-sighted measures over the last two years and a bit have meant that Australians cannot trust what this government has to say. When that lack of trust is highlighted by a refusal to provide basic informa 
 tion to allow proper parliamentary consideration of these issues, it reinforces the view.
The opposition has concerns with many areas connected to these bills. I would like to go through some of those specific areas. Although the bill guarantees access to the NTA facilities for the ABC and SBS for the next five years, there is very little information as to what will happen after those five years. In the midst of a time of great change, of great technological progress, and indeed political consideration of the management of that technological progress, particularly with respect to digitisation, what sort of fiasco is the government trying to establish here? Imagine the difficulty that the national broadcasters are going to be in when they seek to negotiate with a company, or perhaps a series of companies, of corporate entities, which will have a clear monopoly over transmission facilities and the transmission networks.
Here is one of the first fundamental contradictions of this whole process. Here we have a government whose rhetoric waxes long and rather lame on issues of competition, of achieving efficiencies, through that means. Yet this proposal is a transfer of what could be construed as a public monopoly to a private monopoly. In the eyes of competition policy, the latter is the far worse result in terms of consumers and certainly in terms of the public interest.
I am quite bewildered as to how some senators on the other side of this chamber who purport to represent regional Australia are supporting these bills, considering that they contain no guarantees regarding the maintenance of services in rural and regional areas. We see speculation currently in the context of the Telstra privatisation debate that the only way this government can protect services for regional areas is not through a process of asset sales, of deregulation, of competition in the private sector, but through re-regulation to force those corporate entities to provide a prescribed minimum service in areas that don't `turn a quid'. And let's face it—because we are such a big country, because we are so vast, some areas of this country in the telecommunications context will never turn a quid. In this fact lies the 
 very foundation of arguments supporting the retention of public ownership, not only of our telecommunications service provider Telstra, but also of authorities like the National Transmission Authority.
While some members of government have made certain claims that the contract with the purchaser of the network would look after these matters, this guarantee should appear in the bill if this parliament is to have any faith that the government and the new owner will meet these obligations of looking after those in the bush. Over the last two years, time and time again it has been the Australian Labor Party highlighting the concerns of regional Australia. The cuts to the ABC and the sale of Telstra, which I have already mentioned, and the cutting of Radio National are all examples of the diminution of services in the communications area to regional Australia.
Here is another bill that does nothing to protect or support, let alone enhance, those critical services. I ask: where are those supposed to be the voices of rural Australia speaking up when this government is making decisions that will hit people hardest out there in rural and regional Australia? We do not hear them in debate because we are dealing with the Liberals' ideological agenda. The National Party representatives in this place are not to be seen when it comes to slashing, funding, cutting and selling off our telecommunications infrastructure.
There is nothing in this bill that guarantees that the current policy objectives of the National Transmission Agency will be maintained. While the bill does contain some limited community service obligations, these are far more constrained than those which are currently in existence. How ironic it is that when the government is deciding to sell off Australia's broadcasting infrastructure it actually reduces the community obligations on those who will control the transmission network.
With respect to the ABC and SBS, the minister claims they will draw up a compact with the two broadcasters which will seek to spell out what the coverage and quality expectations will be for those who own the national transmission network. Well, how is 
 that for a gesture? The same minister continues to cut the funding of our national broadcaster with each consecutive budget and, with respect to technological progression, an issue which is fundamentally linked to the services that the National Transmission Authority provide, they have restricted the capability of the ABC through lack of sufficient funding for their digitisation strategy.
The government claims that in return for this compact it will be covering the costs of the transmission contracts for the next five years. Let us see, does that relate to the timetable for the digitisation strategy? It comes close, it is a big longer. How does it relate to the out years funding commitment by this government to the ABC? All these things must be reviewed alongside each other. Five years does not afford the protection to the national broadcaster that is required to make what is fundamentally an irreversible decision to sell the authority. I think it is also a reasonable thing to say that I can assume that undertaking is about as good as Minister Alston's undertaking a couple of years back to actually guarantee ABC funding.
It is very difficult for anyone to claim that the NTA is an inefficient organisation. To what degree the government will lean on this, I expect we shall hear. The NTA over the last few years dramatically expanded its network, resulting in the substantial expansion of radio and television services to regional Australia. In fact, the expansion of the network since 1992 has facilitated an extra 1.3 million Australians having access to national radio and television services. ABC services alone have been extended to a further 468,000 Australians over the last six years, with 453,000 Australians also now having access to SBS television.
This growth, this improved access to these services, has got to be attributed in some way to the dedication of the team at the NTA and the former Labor government's vision and commitment to expanding the network. This vision and dedication is lacking from this government and I am yet to hear how this vision will emerge in the private sector. This government stands up here and says that a corporate entity which purchases the NTA 
 will arrive with such a vision, with such a commitment to expanding the opportunities of all Australians to access such services, with an underlying philosophy of equity of that access.
I want the government to tell me how it will do that, because experience shows us that the only way governments can enforce a commitment to those issues by corporate entities is through a re-regulation, through a strident compliance regime that in turn starts to eat into any perceived deficiencies that they hope to attain through the sale in the first place. And with a compliance regime must come penalties, there must come a disincentive if that corporate entity does not conform with the desired requirements of the government.
Here is the second greatest contradiction: the government is floating these concepts up against the rhetoric that we hear from it about free market enterprise, about how the private sector always does it better than the public sector, but it starts to ring very hollow and is exposed as not being an argument of substance when it comes to the selling off of public infrastructure in this way.
Like many senators on the other side of the chamber, I too am a keen listener of Triple J and one of the greatest achievements of the National Transmission Authority was its expansion of the network that has facilitated the broadcast of Triple J to thousands upon thousands of young Australians. Triple J has been revolutionised as a result of regional broadcasting and has not only acted as a wonderful new service to young people in rural and regional Australia but has brought metropolitan young people and rural people together. It has provided a unique unifying factor amongst the youth of this country. Where is the vision going to emerge from this government and what are their solutions to address these concepts? Triple J's series of `Unearthed' concerts have been great examples once again about how we bring rural and regional Australia together with metropolitan Australia, sharing their culture, sharing their voice.
These are the tangible examples of what I am talking about when I talk about equity and 
 access and how our communications and telecommunications infrastructure are so critical to all Australians. It is not just about switching the TV on or the radio on and being able to get a service, it is about the quality of service that provides. That point takes me back to an earlier point in that you cannot address these issues unless you look at the big picture, the funding issues relating to the national broadcasters that use the NTA. It is all linked and it all points to how critical the retention of public ownership of these services is because that allows philosophies of parties like the Labor Party to shine through and allows these services and the opportunities that they subsequently provide to continue to be a feature on the Australian political landscape. In conclusion, I would once again like to recognise the dedicated work of all the employees of the NTA over the years. They are a group of people who have much to be proud of.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—In listening to the debate so far today, I have been very cheered to see issues of public interest brought up continually, in particular by the ALP. I took particular interest in that because for some time, in fact since before 1995, we have been dealing with the issue of competition policy, that is, the major shift in policy that has occurred—and we know that it is supported by both major parties—where everything that can be done by the private sector and everything that can be opened up to the market will be opened up to the market. This is an ongoing process. What happened in 1995 is not the be-all and end-all. We are involved in this process as we speak and in the end, by legislation, we will be required to open sectors up to the market unless there are exemptions, and I have not seen any.
I find their contributions encouraging but also concerning because public interest was never a strong point of the 1995 competition policy legislation. Whether it is opening up markets, opening up public provision of services to the market or, as in this case, privatising what is currently a public asset, we have no legislative guarantee that the public interest will prevail. It is all very well for the 
 Labor Party to rail against the ignoring of public interest in this regard, but they did not listen in 1995. They are still resisting and, in fact, they told me they would not vote for an inquiry—a long overdue inquiry—into the social impacts of competition policy. That motion stayed on the Senate Notice Paper for weeks—in fact, probably months—waiting to see whether there was some iota of support in the Labor Party for looking at the whole gamut of issues involved with competition policy to see if we can responsibly assess, as a community and as a parliament, whether we are going in the right direction and whether we have put public interest in the right place in terms of public policy. And they have resisted it.
We know the government is likely to resist it. We know that in 1995 there was a Labor government and a different Prime Minister, but there is time to reassess that now. It is no good saying, every time one of these issues comes up, `The government of the day is not acting in the public interest' when we had the chance, and still have the chance, of assessing whether we can put public interest more strongly into the competition policy regime.
I will move to the Greens (WA) position in relation to the National Transmission Network Sale Bill. The Greens (WA) are not convinced that the sale of the national transmission network is ostensibly in the public interest. The plan is to sell off the range of assets currently contained in the National Transmission Agency. Essentially, the assets consist of transmitters used to broadcast ABC and SBS television and radio programs throughout Australia. The government's argument is that it will enhance customer service through competition. In addition, the government proposes that the sale will benefit the public by retirement of debt.
Going back to the debate we had in 1995, what we could find out in 1995 from both major parties was that public interest equals competition equals public interest. It was a circular argument. There were some exemptions but they were very limited. We find these arguments less than convincing. Competition and debt retirement seem to be the government's catchcry and pet argument 
 whenever they cannot think of a rational reason to pursue their endless privatisation and deregulation agenda. We heard it with Telstra and the banks, and the same line has been pushed again in relation to the national transmission network. It is highly questionable whether increased so-called competition and debt retirement are in the public interest in this case. While these things are not necessarily bad in principle, it is necessary to look at the costs associated with going down this track. It is also necessary to look at alternative means of achieving the same results.
The national transmission network, under Commonwealth control, is an extremely efficient network. As mentioned by other speakers, in the last few years it has dramatically expanded its network and, in doing so, has performed an admirable role in extending radio and television access. A lot of that has come, I have to add, by parliamentary pressure. It could be pork-barrelling and it could be before elections, but parliamentary pressure has added to that. Pressures within electorates, we know, have added to that.
The national transmission network has spent a lot of money keeping its equipment up to speed, despite funding cuts. Over the last few years, the national transmission network has not only updated and expanded its services but has also managed to implement significant savings in its recurrent costs. As the NTN is already providing excellent and efficient service to its customers and the community at large, the claims of efficiency through competition—another of the famous catchcries of government, despite any evidence to the contrary—does not hold much water. When you cream off the profit margins here, who is getting more benefit than they got before?
The Greens (WA) have major concerns about the continuation of national coverage and customer service obligations in regional, rural and remote areas. We have already heard of the plans to make digital telephones and television services compulsory and to cut off the access to analogs. This is another situation where, in the future, technology itself may cut off access, and what direct implications does that have for parliamentary input into the provision of services?
Facilities in the bush are faced with yet another threat by this sale. The community service obligations are a watered down version of what is already in existence, and we have seen that before. Whenever there is a government asset for sale, in order to push up the price, they reduce the compliance for those networks. So instead of having more oversight and more regulations, as they would usually do in America when there is a public service provided by a private provider, they are actually having less; and I find that extraordinary.
The government is making noises along the lines of `she'll be right, mate'. The government plans to ensure national coverage through the contract with the purchaser of the network. This is clearly an unsatisfactory arrangement. Any protections or assurances of access in the bush should be in this bill so that the parliament can determine whether or not they are adequate. Will the contract ensure quality of access? Will it even ensure current access? What about the price of continued access? What about those rural and regional areas that do not have current coverage? There are no promises made about extending coverage to those people who do not already have access.
Remember that, under corporate law, the primary obligation of the corporation which purchases the national transmission network, whether they are from Australia or from overseas, is to their shareholders. They will do whatever is best to enhance the profits of their shareholders. If that means cutting, reducing or limiting access to services in remote and regional areas in Australia, under corporate law that is what they must do unless there are laws to tell them otherwise. We note that commercial broadcasters will be provided with a grant to operate in declared remote areas. This grant should be extended to national and community broadcasters.
Long-term access to transmission facilities for the ABC and SBS is another issue that is still up in the air. The bill assures access for the next five years, but what will happen after that? Will we be assured by another wink and a `she'll be right' from the government? The ABC and SBS will undoubtedly be in under 
 dog positions when it comes to doing their own bargaining when the five years is up. They will be bargaining with owners in a distinct monopoly position. As the government has acknowledged—and, indeed, is proud of—the ABC and SBS will be in a direct commercial relationship with a provider. A direct commercial relationship comes with all the power imbalances that come with any monopoly provider and with all the pressures to make direct commercial decisions and not public interest decisions.
Another concern is that the national interest objectives of the ABC and SBS will be undermined. The Friends of the ABC are concerned that working in a commercial context could put unwanted and unwarranted pressure on the ABC and SBS to cede to commercial interests, especially when the five years are up. On top of that, the ABC and SBS are reliant on the government to fund their access to the network. How long will that last? Promises of funding have been made and broken in the past. The promise of maintaining funding in real terms to our national broadcasters has proved to be hollow. Our national broadcasters have had to feel the pain and have been made sacrificial lambs every year when the knife comes out at budget time—of course, this is less so in an election year. Not only are the ABC and SBS faced with the uncertainty of  continued access but also they will not know the price of access or whether the government will provide adequate funding.
The government claims that the ABC and SBS want this direct commercial relationship and that it is just playing fairy godmother in making that wish come true. Obviously I have heard from representatives of the ABC and SBS, as have many other players in this debate. They said to me quite clearly that they want to have some aspect of control of the network. Will this do it for them? I think the government misstates the position of the ABC and SBS in this regard. What they really want is, as I said, greater control of the transmission network. This does not necessarily mean the sale of the national transmission network. We would argue that, with the sale of the network, the ABC and SBS potentially may 
 have less control through public accountability. So, yes, they do want some control of the network and to have a greater say in transmission. I am not entirely sure that, in the current commercial environment, this is necessarily in the best interests of consumers in remote and regional Australia—that still has to be argued. Does the sale of the network give them greater control? This is yet to be proved.
The government could have allowed the ABC and SBS greater control by directly funding their transmission costs and providing them with control of the radio communications spectrum used to broadcast their services. The sale of the national transmission network does not have to be a step towards giving greater control; in fact, it may lead in the other direction. Although I imagine that it would be heresy if the government extended the funding to the ABC and SBS when it was something it could flog off to service debt, it is something that should be considered.
Community broadcasters are also under threat. These energetic and colourful broadcasters do not, under this bill, receive any kind of supplement or real guarantee of access to transmission facilities. The government is showing a complete lack of understanding of the role and importance of community broadcasters. They play an important and unique role that cannot be replaced by commercial broadcasters. They present a diversity of views and opinions that provides a unique service which caters to local people. Many community broadcasters would go under if they had to pay full prices for access to broadcasting services. This would be a grave loss to the community and a significant reduction in diversity. But maybe it is in the interests of the government to have those voices silenced. Is this the kind of vision that the government has for the future of Australia?
Another concern relates to who will buy the national transmission network. There are no limits on foreign ownership, for a start. Also, the bill makes no provision for potential conflicts of interest if a commercial broadcaster bought the network. What are the implications there? Will there be any restrictions in 
 the legislation? No. For instance, if there were a breakdown in the network, the commercial services would be repaired ahead of the national broadcasters.
All in all, the Greens have not been convinced that the government has provided enough assurances to the Australian community. We have been asked to stand at the abyss and to take a leap of faith that things will work out better not only for the bottom lines of broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—but also for the provision of services to the Australian community. We are talking about short-term budget bottom lines as opposed to long-term interests. I have strongly argued that we have never assessed long-term Australian public interest in relation to competition policy; the Labor Party has resisted us doing that. Now that we have more and more examples of where this is going wrong without any real control by the parliament, maybe the Labor Party will agree that it is time to go back and look at public interest and the social impacts of competition policy. The benchmark should be community service, not an ideological agenda. This bill does not address the real impacts of service provision in Australia.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-27,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. We apologise that Senator Alston is not able to be here. He is on his way back to Canberra and will be here shortly. He has asked that I sum up the second reading debate and move to the early consideration of the bill in committee.
A number of important issues have been raised by honourable senators opposite during this debate. Can I say from the outset that I share with Senator Margetts an interest in the approach of the Australian Labor Party to these issues. We saw, as Senator Margetts will remember, an approach by the Australian Labor Party in government which—and I believe to former Prime Minister Keating's great credit—embraced competition policy. We saw a move to bring the benefits of competition to the Australian economy, and I praise the former Prime Minister for that. Although he had many failures as a Prime 
 Minister, one of his great achievements was to bring competition policy to many parts of the Australian economy that had not previously be exposed. He did so in a sensible, practical and workable way.
The Australian Labor Party in government had that approach to competition. They also, as Senator Margetts will recall, had an approach to privatisation—the privatisation of great Australian icons. In government, of course, having promised at the 1990 election that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank—and Ben Chifley would turn in his grave—they sold the Commonwealth Bank. It was the Victorian Labor Party that sold the State Bank of Victoria.
—That is national infrastructure.
—We will get to infrastructure, Senator Schacht, because you are pretty good at selling that too. You sold Australian Airlines. The people opposite sold Qantas. Of course, it might be argued that one of the two major airlines formed a significant part of the national infrastructure. After promising they were not going to sell, Labor sold the airline. It also sold the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories—a massive, dominant and crucial part of the social fabric of this country that provides serums and a range of other pharmaceutical products.
Senator Schacht, by way of interjection, mentioned infrastructure. We know from reading what has been written since the defeat of the Keating government that the first tranche of the Australian Labor Party's telecommunications privatisation program in the area of telecommunications infrastructure was well afoot in 1991. Their plans to sell Telstra, in fact, were well afoot. Their plans to privatise the Yellow Pages and a range of other parts of Telstra, and indeed Telstra itself, were well in hand at the time the Keating government was defeated. The first tranche of the Australian Labor government's telecommunications privatisation program was the sale in 1991, as I recall, of Aussat. You have to go back—I think it was the Aussat repeal bill in 1991—to see who supported the sale 
 of that important part of a telecommunications infrastructure.
Senator Schacht has gone very quiet now—he is complying with standing orders for the first time in his parliamentary life. He has gone very quiet now we raise Aussat, this crucial part—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I have always had an attitude that when people get up and drop a bit of abuse on you and so on, that that is the give and take of the parliament. I have never been a great one for taking points of order. But I have to say that I have been here for nearly 11 years and I have always complied with the standing orders and the direction from the chair. I know Senator Ian Campbell is enthusiastic in exaggerating my role in the Senate, but I have to say that I have always complied with the standing orders in the Senate and I think that you might want to reconsider the broad scope of his remarks in that area.
—Senator Schacht, you have made your point, but there is no point of order.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The point I was making, of course, was that the Australian Labor Party in government was pretty gung ho about selling major bits of infrastructure, and Aussat was clearly a part of that. A substantial part of the telecommunications infrastructure of Australia was sold and, of course, it could only have been sold if the Senate had passed the Aussat repeal bill in around 1991. This was very much part of Mr Beazley's policy when he was communications minister, it was very much part of Australian Labor Party policy, and it was the first bite of the Labor Party's implementation of their plan to privatise telecommunications in this country.
The sale of Aussat did not really need the support of the Democrats to get through this parliament because clearly the coalition would have supported it. You hear from the Democrats fairly regularly, when a privatisation debate comes up here, that they have never supported a privatisation. The fact is that 
 when it came to Aussat, a crucial piece of telecommunications infrastructure—the sale of the substantial satellite network of Australia—the Labor government was supported, of course, by the Australian Democrats. At the time, I understand Senator Kernot led the charge to get the Democrats to support that legislation.
Senator Margetts, I know you were not here in 1991, but your party has been the only non-coalition party in this place that has been consistently opposed to privatisation on fundamental philosophical grounds. We have always supported privatisation.
—You are just filling in time until Richard gets here.
—I am not; I am making the point about the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party when it comes to these debates. They have not given any reason why the national transmission network should not be privatised, and I wanted to knock over a number of the arguments in relation to that. The Labor Party's philosophy and policy in relation to this, if they were to be consistent, would have a number of logical consequences. They have said that we cannot sell this—and Senator Schacht, by way of interjection, has made it clear that this is their philosophy—because this is a major part of infrastructure, and it should not be sold. Firstly, they sold Aussat—
—There is no comparison between a satellite and 1,500 transmitters across Australia.
—There is no comparison, but of course Aussat is a network; it is a communications network. If you continued in a consistent manner the application of the Labor Party's philosophy and principles and policy in relation to this matter—and the great thing about the Labor Party, I guess, is that they do not follow a consistent path, because if they did, the country would have been in a worse position than it was. They are very pragmatic, they change, depending on which way the wind blows, like an old windmill. If the wind blows from the east, they swing around like a wind vane. 
If you cross the Tweed River—this is the Wayne Swan doctrine and the Kim Beazley doctrine—just in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, their policy, position and rhetoric on native title has to quickly change. If you move from Western Australia across the Nullarbor Plain, their position on native title has to change. When Mr Beazley, Mr Smith, Senator Cook and Senator Bishop, amongst others, go to the city of Kalgoorlie, they have a position on native title, but when they get over here it is different. So I guess, in a way, the inconsistency and hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party and their smorgasbord approach to policy—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on relevance, and what the Labor Party's position north of Tweed Heads has to do with this bill.
—Senator Conroy, the minister is summing up the second reading debate, and I am quite interested in hearing what he has to say. I am finding it rather difficult with interjections from my left, I might say.
—On the point of order, as part of my summing up of this debate, I am going to get to issues effecting regional—
—What has Wik got to do with this?
—I was about to get to issues effecting regional Australia. Mr Acting Deputy President, we have had all of the coalition senators talking about the government's range of policies in relation to regional Australia and, if I am allowed to under your stewardship of the chamber, I am going to get to the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the treatment of regional Australia, particularly when it comes to things like Wik, and that is why it is important to look at regional Australia.
—I think you have made your point on the point of order. There is no point of order, and I ask you to continue your summing up on this particular bill.
—I appreciate being allowed to continue. This is where the hypocrisy is, and I was getting to the point about consistency in policy as it relates to telecommunications quite specifically.
If you were to apply the Schacht doctrine, the Lundy doctrine, to the ownership of telecommunications infrastructure and the ownership of networks, they would not have sold Aussat, they would have kept that in public ownership, and, quite frankly, they would have purchased from Vodaphone, or Iridium, their low earth orbiting satellite network. They would go and buy 66 satellites because it is a crucial part of Australia's emerging telecommunications infrastructure and they would say, `Sorry, this is national telecommunications infrastructure and the public should own it.'
Furthermore, they would go to Foxtel or to Telstra corporation and they would say, `This cable that you have rolled out on the ground to enable hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians to get the benefit of cable—'
—Iridium cannot broadcast television; it is about mobile phones, dill!
—Order! Senator Schacht, you have been continually interjecting. I note from the speakers list you have already spoken, you will have an opportunity in the committee stage to reiterate your position. I would like to hear the minister make his points in silence.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. I spoke to the bill. It is their bill. He has spoken about everything else that is not in the bill. Iridium is a satellite system that has got nothing to do with television or radio broadcasting—it is about mobile phones, for goodness sake. We have had talks about Wik; we are asking him to debate the bill.
We know he has got to fill in 15 minutes of time until Senator Alston gets back from abusing the ABC board, but we ask the minister at the table to talk about the bill. Further to my speech in the second reading debate, could he please explain, simply, 
 whether the government has signed an agreement with the ABC or SBS on what money it is going to provide for the next five years to pay for transmission costs? It is a simple request from the second reading debate, and you still have not answered it. I can tell you, Parliamentary Secretary, Iridium is not the way to deliver ABC broadcasting.
—If that was a point of order, it was a rather long one. There is no point of order. Minister, will you continue your summing up, and I remind you that, presumably, the questions asked by Senator Schacht will be answered in the committee stage.
—If we do not have this constant interruption with points of order, I will get to it. I have got a series of responses to very important points made by honourable senators opposite—mostly, other than Senator Schacht.
There is a key principle here: we are trying to look at the position of people like Senator Lundy, who contributed to this debate on the public ownership of the means of production and these distribution networks, when it comes to telecommunications. If you can argue that broadcasting and the ownership of broadcasting networks is not related to Telstra and Foxtel's cable, then Senator Schacht is drawing a very long bow, if not a very long cable. If you apply their principle, which is that the Commonwealth should own this transmission network, then the Labor Party's policy should be that they would nationalise the Foxtel cable network. It is as simple as that. There is no difference.
—The Foxtel cable is owned by Telstra which we want to keep in public ownership.
—Senator Schacht reinforces our position that they would prefer to have a cable network, and indeed Optus is cable. Senator Schacht might by way of interjection—without encouraging him any further—suggest whether the Labor Party intends to nationalise the Optus cable network.
—Here we go.
—In principle there is no difference. This is a transmission network. To get to the specific points, we do need to ensure that regional Australia receives a better service than it is receiving at the moment. We do need to ensure that. The privatisation of the transmission network is the best opportunity that regional Australia has to ensure that their transmissions are received efficiently and at the best price. The ABC desperately want this new regime because it gives them options. It gives the SBS and ABC the benefits of price competition. It gives them a whole range of new options when it comes to rolling out new services into regional areas. That is why the ABC and SBS and regional areas in particular benefit from this.
I get to the point that I was discussing when we were debating that point of order earlier, Mr Acting Deputy President. These Australian Labor Party people opposite would have you believe that they are the friends of people in remote and regional Australia. I ask Senator Schacht or Senator Lundy to go out to Wyndham, Kununurra, Leonora, Leinster, Laverton, Esperance, Halls Creek, Mount Magnet or Meekatharra—any of those places—and hold a discussion on public policy out there. I will tee up the venues.
—Yours is the first government ever to put a TV station off the air—GWN in Wyndham.
—I challenge Senator Schacht. We will have a debate about public policy in Kalgoorlie. Do you know what they will say to the Australian Labor Party? `Don't you pretend to be our friends up here. We know how you voted on the Wik legislation, we know what you were doing to our economy. Don't come and talk to us about ABC or SBS.' You would be lucky to get out of there in one piece, Senator Schacht, after voting the way you did on the Wik legislation. You are destroying regional Western Australia.
Oppostion senators interjecting—
—The people in remote and regional Western Australia know that you do not get the best expansion of transmission services by having the transmis 
 sion network owned by the Commonwealth of Australia. What you have got to ensure is that you have a good access regime. We have already put in by way of contract between the ABC and SBS a five-year guaranteed contract. Everyone talks about five years but it is actually 14 years. They all ignore that. You have got five years plus three years plus three years plus three years, so the access is guaranteed for an absolute minimum of 14 years.
—You have not guaranteed the money for 14 years.
—The Commonwealth has guaranteed the funding. Furthermore, the access regime is guaranteed as well. In terms of coverage and quality of ABC and SBS services, the legislation does provide a regulatory framework which will underpin contractual controls to ensure that the government's commitment to preserving the existing coverage and quality of ABC and SBS is met. The opposition, of course, choose to ignore that. Furthermore, the minister's approval will be required if the NTA wishes to sell or transfer some or all of its assets needed to supply these services. There is a guarantee: if the NTA does choose to move out of an area, it will have to come back to the minister, and the minister is required—
—He will cave in absolutely. In all of these matters he is an abject coward.
—God help Australia if Senator Schacht ever becomes the minister. The people of Australia remember very clearly what happened with ministers for communications when the Labor Party was in power. We had this fantastic roll-up. We had Mr Beazley when he was minister for communications stuff up Aussat. Then we had Senator Bob Collins. He was a ripper. Who remembers cascading bids? That was a lot of fun, wasn't it?
—Has this got any relevance whatsoever?
—Well, Senator Schacht interjected about the minister for communications, who has actually got communications policy back on the track. We have got a quite clear policy being imple 
 mented. I say to the people of Australia: on communications policy, compare Senator Alston, somebody who knows what he is doing, a quality minister, to old Mr Beazley, who spent the first couple of years in the portfolio trying to find out what a policy was—
—Senator Campbell, could we return to the summing up of the bill?
—We are talking about it, Mr Acting Deputy President. This bill is a crucial part of our policy to try to fix up the mess that the Australian Labor Party left communications policy in in this country. Cascading bids: say no more. Senator Collins, I hope you are enjoying your retirement, because the communications industry certainly is.
We need to look at the very important issues relating to community broadcasters and radio for the print handicapped. The 19 community broadcasters which currently use the NTA transmission facilities will be required to pay commercial charges. This will put these 19 broadcasters in exactly the same position as the more than 120 other community broadcasters who already make their own arrangements for the use of non-NTA sites. The government estimates that the aggregate increase for these 19 broadcasters will approximate $30,000. The government today announces formally that the Community Broadcasters Foundation will be given—
—More notes, quick. He has run out.
—I have got plenty of notes here; it is just that part of the writing is slightly hard to read. I formally announce that the government will be providing to the Community Broadcasters Foundation an annual grant of $30,000, which will more than cover that.
Can I also say that, in relation to SBS self-help programs, today the minister will be announcing new funding to be provided to the SBS to establish a program to help new self-help groups with their establishment costs. Senator Schacht may want to listen to this. The funding will be around $150,000 in 1998- 
 99, $300,000 in 1999-2000, and then $500,000 per year ongoing from the year 2000. That is to assist SBS self-help programs.
Furthermore, today the minister will be announcing that new funding of around $2.5 million will be provided to SBS over the next three years to assist with improvements in the quality of SBS television reception in Sydney. While it is entirely a matter for SBS, it is likely that the funding will be used to relocate the main transmitter. As I have said—
—You must be getting some political heat. You're trying to drag some money out.
—Senator Schacht talks about heat. They say that they are friends of the ABC. The ABC is extremely keen to ensure that it receives the benefits of the improvements that the increases in the efficiency of national transmissions will deliver to it. The ABC and the SBS, as Senator Schacht would admit if he were to be entirely frank about this, will be significant beneficiaries of this reform. It is a great shame that the Australian Labor Party have refused to support this. It is clearly an act of hypocrisy compared to their position on these matters in government, particularly in relation to the way they sold Aussat. I commend the bill to the house.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-05-27,"—by leave—I wish to make a brief personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, said at one point in relation to the sale of Aussat that the Democrats had voted for the sale of Aussat. If he checks Hansard  of December 1990 he will find that the Democrats and former Senator Jo Vallentine were the only senators to vote against the sale of Aussat. He is probably thinking about the Aussat Repeal Bill, which was an appropriation bill as a consequence of the sale of Aussat. No vote was taken but the Democrats did indicate that we would reluctantly agree to the appropriation being made because the sale had already taken place.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

—That's not the sale. You said we voted for the sale.
—No, I did refer to that bill by name. I was grappling for the exact name but I did say the Aussat Repeal Bill. We can have an argument about whether or not that constitutes agreeing to a privatisation. Senator Bourne, I accept, on the face of it—

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-05-27,"—I rise today to speak about an issue which I believe is of great importance: the 
 issue of securing our financial future. When I was a youngster going from primary school to secondary school, Australia's financial situation was in a very good state. For young people of my generation—and I include you in that, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds—the world was our oyster. There were opportunities galore and jobs galore. But gradually, over a period of time, those opportunities have been whittled away, particularly over the 13 years that Labor was in government.
On 12 May 1998 Peter Costello, the federal Treasurer, announced a budget surplus of $2.7 billion for the financial year 1998 to 1999. Further budget surpluses are projected to reduce net debt from a peak under Labor of about 20 per cent of GDP to around 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2001-02. That is an extraordinary achievement. I am often asked why this government is so determined to reform the economic management of this country and reduce debt. The reason we are so determined, firstly, is that there are a lot of older Australians that I have met as I moved around the country doing consultations for the International Year of Older Persons who are alarmed that the legacy they left us, the inheritance they left us, was being squandered and that the inheritance of the next generation was being spent by this generation—and basically by Labor when it was in government for 13 years. What we were doing was using up the inheritance we had, and we were borrowing against the inheritance of the next generation.
Debt does not exist in isolation. When you have debt, as all of us who have mortgages or have bought something on time payment know, interest must be paid on the debt. When government debt grows, as it did under Labor, it must also be paid for through interest repayments. Those interest repayments represent opportunities forgone. In the terms of economists, what you spend on interest you cannot spend on other things. I remember a lesson I learnt when I was a youngster. I wanted to buy a dress. In those days people used to go door to door selling clothes on time payment. My mother warned me about buying this dress, but I wanted a new nylon 
 dress. They were the days when nylon had come out.
—Still got it?
—No, I have not still got it. But I decided that I was going to buy this dress, and I was going to pay two shillings a week on this dress. My mother was right because, by the time I had finished paying for the dress, the dress had worn out and was out of fashion. I learnt a very big lesson from that about buying something on time payment. I also had to pay interest, and I paid a lot more for that dress than I should have. It was a very good lesson. Thank heavens it was only on a dress that I learnt that lesson.
—Not on the national accounts.
—Not on the national accounts. My mother let me have my head, and I am glad she did because I learnt a very good lesson; a lesson which people on the other side obviously have not learnt.
If you have a debt on the national accounts, you have interest repayments which could have been otherwise spent. As Senator Vanstone said, it could have been otherwise spent on improving Australian schools, housing and hospitals—and all the other things that people come into our offices telling us we ought to be spending money on. These repayments grow with the debt, and eventually higher interest rates are needed to attract the necessary funds. Higher interest rates affect all Australians. They affect farmers, who find it increasingly difficult to keep up with repayments on their properties. We saw in that time of high interest rates under Labor banks foreclosing on farms and people moving off the land.
Families face higher mortgage rates, and a significant proportion of families' income is taken up on paying mortgage rates. The goal of trying to purchase a home by young people is getting further and further out of their reach. Small businesses have difficulty raising funds and meeting repayments. When that occurs the first thing they do is reduce their number of staff. Rising debt and increasing interest rates quickly become a cycle and lead 
 to unemployment. As I have said, businesses are forced to lay off staff to keep up with the repayments of debt.
Another factor which occurs is that funds from overseas investors fuel land and price speculation, and they take these things out of the reach of ordinary Australians and again push up inflation. While inflation may give the impression of growth in wages and other benefits, this growth is illusionary as inflation is typically accompanied by high interest rates and rising prices for basic commodities like bread and milk. Successive Labor governments oversaw the cycle of debt, high interest rates, high unemployment and high inflation. I think we constantly need to remind the Australian public that under Labor the budget deficit each year was running at about $10.3 billion. That is, every year we were spending $10.3 billion more than we had, more than we were receiving in taxes. We were living off the next generation's inheritance. For grandparents who are listening, we were spending your grandchildren's money. For parents listening, we were spending your children's money. We were $10.3 billion in excess. Government debt reached $96 billion, or more than $5,000 for every Australian. Home interest rates peaked at 17 per cent, and small business interest rates reached 20.5 per cent. Unemployment climbed to 11.2 per cent, and inflation averaged 5.7 per cent.
It took the Liberal-National Party coalition to break the cycle. As announced in the federal budget of 12 May 1998, we expect to achieve a surplus of $2.7 billion for 1998-99. We also anticipate that by 2001-02 government debt will have fallen from $96 billion to $9.6 billion, representing a decline in government debt from 20 per cent of GDP to around 1.5 per cent. As I have said, when you do not have that debt, you are not paying off the interest and you can afford to do other things.
Flow-on effects from this sound financial management have seen home loan interest rates fall to 6.7 per cent, the lowest rate since—as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) constantly reminds us—man first walked on the moon. Unemployment is now well down on the rate reached under Labor, and inflation is 
 running at minus two per cent—and that is the lowest that has been seen since the sixties.
With debt having been brought under control by this government, we can now implement initiatives for the benefit of all Australians. As many of my honourable colleagues in the chamber know, one of my particular interests is in older Australians. As a result of our behaving in a financially responsible way, we have seen benefits being able to be given to people.
We have extended access to the Commonwealth seniors health card to an additional 220,000 self-funded retirees. Many of these people are on reasonably low incomes; some of them just above the pension. However, they have not been able to get benefit. So we have given them a sense of security in that, after they have purchased 52 scrips—I think it is—at $3.20, they then, like pensioners, can receive the rest of their medication for free. This is something which has been asked for by self-funded retirees.
But it was never given by the Labor Party when it was spending money willy-nilly, borrowing $10.3 billion a year—never given to those people who really wanted the security of knowing that, if they required an extensive amount of medication, it would be free after having reached a certain number of scrips. When Labor was in government, the cap was so high that it gave self-funded retirees a great degree of concern.
We have allocated $280 million to the government's staying-at-home care and support for older Australians package. Again, as we have moved around Australia talking to people, one of the things they say is, `We want choice; when we are frail and need assistance, we want the choice of either staying at home or being cared for in a residential setting.
Because we have been more frugal than the Labor Party, the other thing we have been able to do is offer gold card access to qualifying World War II veterans. This has meant the spending of about $500 million, but World War II veterans who have faced hostile forces will now be entitled to a gold card. That, I know—and I have already talked to some veterans about it—gives them a great 
 sense of comfort. But the other thing it does is take off the state bill a number of those people who would otherwise have been in public hospitals around the state, receiving public benefits from, say, dental schemes and puts them onto the Commonwealth bill. So it gives also relief to some older people who will now have space and beds in hospitals and access to dental programs which were being taken up by those veterans. So there is a double effect for the public: first, that those veterans now will be paid for; and, secondly, the spaces they may have taken up will be able to be used by others.
Education, training and job prospects for Australian young people are being improved and mutual obligation principles enhanced through a $350 million funding package. What we are saying through a lot of our policies is that there is a obligation, that we have a responsibility to care for those in need, for those who are unemployed, but that those people also have a responsibility back to the community. Many young people are responding in a very positive way to the challenge being put to them that they have a responsibility along with the rights and privileges they enjoy as members of Australian society.
The investing for growth industry statement has been announced, with $1.3 billion being allocated as part of our extensive industry reform agenda. Another $180 million has been allocated to addressing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, on top of the $1.25 billion already allocated to the National Heritage Trust by this government.
All of this is being able to be done because we have behaved in a way which is responsible, and we are not borrowing to fund these initiatives. The initiatives of previous Labor governments were undertaken with borrowed money—money borrowed from the next generation.
Today, in here, I heard Senator Cook saying, `We're going to oppose your tax reform policy because you haven't brought it to the people in time, and they should have time before an election.' He continued, `So, if you get back in, even though it might be a budgetary measure, we're going to oppose it.' Senator Murray challenged him and asked, 
 `Well, what are you going to do on the issue of tax?' Senator Cook then replied, `We're not going to tell you, and we'll tell you in good time in due course.' I believe that section ought to be taken out of the Hansard and given to a first year philosophy student for an exercise in logic. You are saying, `We're not going to support you if you get into government because you haven't released your package,' but you are saying to the Australian public, `If the Labor Party gets into government, it will be okay, but we're not going to give you the details of our tax package or any other package.'
Why should we have to give the information out any earlier than the Labor Party? The fact is that the Labor Party is demanding of the coalition more than it is prepared to give to the Australian public. This seems a very odd argument: we were going to support your tax reform; now we are not because you have not released it in time. Come out and tell us what your policies are; come out and tell us what you are going to do about tax reform. Anyway, even if the Labor Party were to tell us what they would do about tax reform, would the Australian public believe it?
I remember the 1993 budget. Mr Keating got up here and said, `I will build these personal tax cuts into l-a-w, into law.' He said, `It's not a promise; they are tax cuts written into law.' He told the Australian public that they could rely on it because it was l-a-w, law. And what happened after the election?
—Mr Beazley was there too.
—Mr Beazley was involved in that too—Mr Beazley and Mr Keating—`This is an l-a-w promise.' But it was b-r-o-k-e-n, broken. That was a promise that was written into law which was broken.
Not only that, they ran around telling pensioners that all pensioners would be taken out of the tax system by 1995. What hypocrisy. How terrible. Five days after that election Mr Blewett came out and said, `Oh, that was wrong; we shouldn't have had it in the policy.' How cynical. And within two years of that budget, sales tax on cars went up from 15 per cent to 22 per cent, the Medicare levy 
 went up, pharmaceutical charges went up, company taxes went up from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, wholesale sales tax—that hidden tax that you can slide up without the public knowing—went up 2 per cent, excise on petrol went up and excise on leaded petrol went up even more, which again affected the battlers because they are the ones who cannot afford new cars on unleaded petrol. So if anybody thinks that they can believe the Labor Party on taxes and tax reform, let me remind them of their record.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-27,"—My question is to Senator Ellison, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is it not the case that job brokers like Employment National, Drake, Mission Australia and the Salvation Army have no legal and contractual obligations to help find a job for those not on benefits? Is it not also correct that for the middle-aged unemployed the best thing is to get them job help immediately?
Can the minister confirm that, under the government's new system, if you are middle-aged and married, you will be denied immediate guaranteed free employment services and forced to the back of the unemployment queue? Is the minister aware that there are 400,000-plus unemployed Australians who are now being forced to the back of the queue by the new job network?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-05-27,"—Of course, that is not true. We have provided more opportunities for job seekers and some three-quarters of those organisations which successfully tendered for this—and there were 310 organisations—were involved in existing programs in relation to job search and looking after people who are looking for work. Over half involved case management and skillshare people and 50 per cent were involved in dealing with the more disadvantaged section of the job seeking population.
That means that, out of the 310 organisations, a good percentage of those people who will help people look for work have had experience in dealing with disadvantaged people. In that I include indigenous people, migrants and those people who are older. When Senator Sherry looks at those figures, he can rest assured that there are people in the job network system who are experienced in dealing with this sector of the market.
We have contracted with these providers to provide jobs for the allowees, that is, those people who are eligible job seekers. They get paid when they find those people work. That is part of the job network system. It has also brought into the system experienced people to assist those others whom Senator Sherry has mentioned, and these people have that experience. Fifty per cent of these people have experience in dealing with disadvantaged people, and I include in that those people who have some sort of disadvantage—such as those who have English as their second language, migrants, indigenous people and the older cohort.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-27,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Given that the minister was not able to answer my question yesterday regarding the property holdings of Kiskin Ltd—I suppose it is difficult to keep track of such wealth—I ask: can the minister confirm that some or all of the property holdings of his Kiskin company have direct or indirect links with the minister's portfolio responsibilities for coal? Specifically, can he confirm that Kiskin owns the Hillview cattle property, and can he confirm that this property contains significant reserves of coal deposits?

Given that the Minister for Resources yesterday admitted that he owned through Kiskin a number of residential properties used to house workers and contractors in his own coal mine, namely Jellinbah, is that the real reason that the minister did not fully declare his property holdings through Kiskin? When can the parliament, Minister, expect a full and truthful disclosure of all your conflicts of interest, shares and property? When will the minister do the right thing by his colleagues and by his mate the Prime Minister and resign?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy: Farm Assistance Package</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-05-27,"—Senator Faulkner kicks off these questions with statements that are incorrect. I do not have a company called Kiskin, never have had a company called Kiskin. As has been disclosed—
—Is it your family trust?
—the family trust, which has been legally moved across to the family where it operated for about the last two or three years or more, had an interest in that of two per cent. Part of that process was that Kiskin, which was really owned by the four major shareholders of the company, had its assets outside coalmining leases. This included a range of things, like the housing I mentioned yesterday. It also in the process—I think the time was about 1993—acquired a cattle property.
—What about Kiskin unit trusts? 
—What are you taking about, you galah?
It acquired a cattle property, and it operated as a cattle property. Since the time that I resigned as Chairman of QCMM I have no knowledge whatsoever of the ongoing ownership—of what Kiskin owns or what it does not own.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy: Farm Assistance Package</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-05-27,"—We have Senator Faulkner regurgitating this over and over again. There has been no conflict of interest. You have shown no conflict of interest, and no potential for the conflict of interest. Here you are asking me to run out individual properties. I suppose you want to know the names of the people who live in the houses. The actual assets themselves could well have been held by QCMM. If they were, you are saying you want nominated what piece of machinery. I am sure that pieces of machinery up there would be worth more than a house. This is just rubbish stuff coming again from Senator Faulkner. Full disclosure has been made. There has been no conflict of interest.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-05-27,"—Yesterday Senator Neal asked me a question about indigenous housing. I wish to add further to that as time had expired. Expenditure on housing and infrastructure over the years 1995-96 to 1997-98 was reduced as a result of the 1996-97 budget to a new base of $210 million. Since then the base has been maintained, after allowance for one-off adjustments in each year. What I said yesterday was perfectly correct. In respect of the 1998-99 ATSIC budget for housing and infrastructure, there has been a slight reduction from 1997-98—
—A slight reduction?
—wait until you hear the rest of the answer—as a result of the government redirecting $5 million to the TSRA for housing and infrastructure. On the question of the ATSIC home loans program expenditure, the figure quoted $38.2 million is a conservative estimate. It is a self-funded program and expenditure depends on receipts from loan repayments and loan discharges. I am advised the estimate could be as high as $44 million.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aboriginal Housing</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech

SENATE  QUESTION
NUMBER1168
SENATOR FAULKNER  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 23 April 1998:
With reference to the Medicare offices closed since March 1996:
(1)	 (a)	 How many sites were owned by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC); and

(b) how many were leased.
(2)	 For each of the leased sites: (a) in which State and suburb/town is the site located; (b)  what is the unexpired period of the lease, (c) what is the lettable space involved; and (d) what is the cost of the unexpired period of the lease or of buying out the lease.
(3)	 For each of the owned sites, if any, what does HIC intend to do with the site.
SENATOR  HERRON— The Acting Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) (a)Three (3).
(b) Forty (40).
(2) (a & c)	 See Attachment.
(b & d)	 The Health Insurance Commission (HIC) considers the information requested in 2(b) and 2(d) could be used against the HIC in contractual negotiations. The HIC negotiates leases with a range of major commercial property owners and managers throughout Australia. Release of this information may compromise the HIC's ability to negotiate the most favourable terms for the Commonwealth.
(3)	 The owned sites transferred to Medibank Limited upon its separation from the HIC. The HIC no longer has any responsibility or control over these sites.

SENATE QUESTION
NUMBER 864
SENATOR FAULKNER  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 9 September 1997:
(1)	 What is the location of all Medicare offices.
(2)	 How many transactions do they perform each year.
(3)	 For those Medicare offices that will remain open: (a) what is the term of the lease; (b) what is the annual cost of the lease; and (c) when was it last renewed.
(4)	 What is the population that each office services.
(5)	 What is the location and transaction turnover of those Medicare offices proposed to be closed.
(6)	 For those Medicare offices proposed to be closed: (a) what is the annual cost of the lease; (b) when was it last renewed; and (c) when does it expire.
(7)	 Are there any offices in (6) on a day to day lease; if so, from what date.
(8)	 What were the criteria that were used to determine which offices would close and which would remain open.
(9)	 With reference to the Government's decision to separate all Medibank Private functions out of Medicare offices:
Will separate offices be established to service Medibank Private; if so: (a) how many; and (b) 
 will they replicate the remaining Medicare offices: if not, why not.
(10)	 Have any additional costs been identified or alternatively estimated to rent Medibank Private offices; if so, what is the annual cost.
(11)	 What is the estimated additional one-off and recurring cost, over and above rent, to separate functions.
(12)	 How many staff positions will be lost to Medicare as a result of the decision.
(13)	 Has a new minimum staffing level for Medicare offices been developed; if so, what is it.
SENATOR HERRON— the Acting Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:
(1)	 The answer is at Attachment A.
(2)	 The answer is at Attachment A.
(3)	 Medicare offices currently provide both Medicare and Medibank Private services until 30 June 1998. The Health Insurance Commission (HIC) considers the information requested is commercial-in-confidence and could prejudice contractual negotiations.
(4)	 The answer is at Attachment A.
(5)	 The answer is at Attachment A.
(6)	 See Answer (3).
(7)	 See Answer (3). 

(8)	 The criteria which were taken into consideration when identifying Medicare branch office closures included:
.	 claiming patterns including cash service workloads (ie less than 400 daily average Medicare cash services);
.	 proximity to other branch offices (ie no more than 12kms by road);
.	 capacity to redeploy staff; and
.	 leasing and other property issues.
All 43 branch offices identified for closure are 12 kilometres or less from another branch office and enable the HIC to effectively redeploy staff from offices which are closing. The HIC in its assessment of branch offices sought to minimise any inconvenience to the public.
Lease expiry and other property issues were utilised to optimise closure arrangements in conjunction with the other criteria.

Medibank Private has not announced the final number of branch offices in the network.
Medibank Private considers this information to be commercially confidential.
(10)	 Medibank Private will contribute significant funds to the operation of the joint network of offices until 30 June 1998. These funds will then be allocated to establishing a separate network.
(11)	 Separation of Medibank Private from the HIC was undertaken without additional cost to the Commonwealth budget. The HIC will manage any change in costs within its current budget allocation over the period of the forward estimates.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-05-27,"—On Thursday, 14 May, Senator Brown asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, whether the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs had spoken during the previous few days with their opposite numbers in Indonesia about the situation there. I have sought the Prime Minister's advice and he has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I have two matters to raise pursuant to standing order 74(5).

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
I do so because this answer is well overdue. As I said, it was lodged on 30 March, some 59 days ago. It is one day short of being double the time provided for under the standing order. It is also an important question because it goes to possible breaches of Mr Howard's ministerial code of conduct and the code laid out in the cabinet handbook by the Minister for Resources and Energy, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Trade. To quote the cabinet handbook:
Ministers at meetings of the Ministry, Cabinet and Committees, must declare any private interests held by themselves or members of their immediate family in matters under immediate discussion where those interests conflict or might conflict with their public duty as Ministers.
It continues:
Ministers should adopt a broad interpretation of the requirement that they take into account the interests of family members and all the interests of their own in considering whether there is a conflict or a potential or apparent conflict which should be declared. General declarations should be made in all cases where an interest exists which could not be said to be shared with the rest of the community.
It seems that Mr Anderson read the handbook when he became a minister. When he was interviewed on the ABC's Countrywide  program in early May 1996, he said he would absent himself from both the discussions and votes of cabinet where the matters being considered could place him in a conflict of interest. Let me quote exactly what Mr Anderson said. He said:
I think my requirement is that I satisfy the Prime Minister and Cabinet that there is no conflict of interest and in any particular situation that might arise where a decision has to be made then I can declare my interest. I would always do that and if necessary refrain from debate and even voting. 

Former Senator Collins, who was pursuing the matter at that time, asked whether or not Mr Anderson, as a farmer, would receive a rebate under the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In reply, Senator Parer said that Minister Anderson was a farmer and, as a result, he would get the normal diesel fuel rebate that applies to rural producers.
But did Mr Anderson absent himself from the expenditure review committee and the cabinet deliberations on the future of the diesel fuel rebate scheme? He did not. In a press release issued on 13 August 1996, Senator David Brownhill, the then parliamentary secretary to Mr Anderson, welcomed the announcement of the retention of the diesel fuel rebate. Senator Brownhill said:
I know the persuasive arguments put to the ERC by the National Party Deputy Leader, John Anderson, and his role in ensuring the scheme retention cannot be overemphasised.
In a press release dated the same day, Mr Anderson said:
I have consistently argued the case for the DFRS.
Madam President, the diesel fuel rebate scheme is not an interest that is shared by the whole community. It is a benefit available to a relatively small sector of the community, including Mr Anderson, Mr Fischer, Mr McLachlan and Senator Parer.
The question on notice that the government has had before it for 59 days asks what financial benefit these ministers—who were all in the cabinet room arguing for the retention of the diesel fuel rebate scheme—received. The Senate and the public have a right to know. The public record shows that Mr Anderson breached the cabinet guidelines by participating in a cabinet debate where there was a clear conflict of interest. I will be interested to hear whether Mr Fischer, Mr McLachlan and Senator Parer ignored the rules as well. I note that I am to receive an answer by the end of this week. I await that answer with great anticipation. The commitment has been made that I will get it this week. I expect to get it.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to taxation on family trusts.
It is hard to take note of an answer given by Senator Kemp because waffle is pretty hard to take note of.
—Madam President, on a point of order: Senator Conroy has ruled himself out of order.
—Sit down!
—Madam President, I ask you to accept his ruling.
—I would suggest that you make your remarks totally relevant to the issue under discussion, Senator.
—I am taking note of the waffle. Senator Kemp made some sort of play, claiming that the Labor Party had in actual fact ignored the issue of trusts. I hope you stay, Senator Ian Macdonald, because you are someone with a personal interest in this. You might be interested in this debate.
—Order! Senator Conroy, would you like to address the chair, please?
—Certainly, Madam Deputy President. Senator Kemp talked about how the Labor Party had ignored trusts. `It all happened while you were in government,' is his standard defence of the inaction of this government on this issue. In 1993, just before the 1993 election, the tax office informed the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, that the biggest single growing problem with tax avoidance in this country was family trusts.
What happened after we won the 1993 election? We commissioned a number of reports. We asked the tax office to have a look at it and make suggestions. After a lengthy examination of the statistics involved and a long look at the spivery that had been going on, they came up with 12 recommendations. Not long before the last election in 
 1996 they put some recommendations to the government showing the top 100 taxpayers were avoiding up to $800 million through family tax structures. That is nothing more than blatant tax avoidance.
—Why didn't you do something about it?
—After the election we introduced a number of bills to do with this very issue. One of those opposing is shouting, `Why didn't you do something about it?' Bills were introduced in parliament, Senator Ian Macdonald.
—Address the chair, please, Senator Conroy.
—What happened after the election when the coalition was elected? With no explanation whatsoever they dumped one of the bills that would have dealt with this problem. They let it slip out. There was no explanation whatsoever. What did we see in the recent tax office statistics? One in four trusts posted tax losses despite having a combined income of $26 billion—$26 billion and they made a loss! They have got to be pretty badly managed—$26 billion in income and they made a loss. There are 400,000 trusts involved. That means almost 1.8 million Australians received distributions from these trusts. These are blatant examples of tax avoidance and spivery.
I am glad some of those opposite have stayed in the chamber because what we have seen in this government is John Anderson, Alexander Downer, Tim Fischer, Robert Hill, Ian McLachlan, Daryl Williams, Richard Alston, Jocelyn Newman, Chris Ellison, John Herron, Judi Moylan, Warwick Parer—
—Senator, would you like to refer to these people by their correct titles, please?
—Have I got to name them all again?
—And others.
—And others have all got family trusts. No wonder the family trust debate has been allowed to slip under the carpet on that side.
—You didn't mention me.
—I would love to, Senator Macdonald. But thank you for nominating yourself. There are 105,069 trusts. They have a total business income of $26.2 billion and they declared a loss. That means there was no tax payable on the income that was earned and distributed to the beneficiaries, some of whom are probably on that side of the chamber. They paid no tax on it because they have been able to take advantage of the trust distribution laws. We know that 33,956 trusts—that is, less than 10 per cent of trusts—had a taxable income of more than $100,000. Only 10 per cent paid tax, despite the total income of the trusts being $118 billion. The 33,956 trusts had an income of $118 billion and only 10 per cent of those poor trusts could manage to pay tax on over $100,000.
Family trusts are nothing more than tax avoidance vehicles. They use income splitting and they use the lower marginal tax rates—that is what they are about. This government has promised to protect family trusts. They are going to protect family trusts. They are going to put a tax on food and they are going to put a tax on health.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-27,"—The previous speaker, Senator Conroy, might indicate to us some of the taxation provisions for trade unions. Do you know whether they pay tax out of their huge earnings? If you want to get into a debate about that, we might have a look at the fact that trade unions do not pay tax. That might be an interesting question.
Senator Heffernan interjecting—
—Thank you, Senator Heffernan—they fund the Labor Party entirely. They are absolute captives of the trade union movement. That is why the Labor Party will never look at the taxation of trade unions. It demonstrates the shallowness of the Labor Party on this as on any matter they seek to raise on this particular issue.
—Do you have a family trust? 
—As the previous speaker said, I have a family trust. I think, from memory, I entered into mine in the years of the Whitlam government—that is how long I have had mine. I think most of the people for whom I acted in my legal practice in a farming community in North Queensland had family trusts and have done so from those days. I and a lot of other Australians have had them since 1972 quite legally. It was done in conjunction with the law.
—It is spivery.
—It is spivery? Senator, why didn't Mr Whitlam's government do something about it? Why didn't the Labor government do something about it?
Then we move to that fateful year—I think it was 1983—when the Labor Party won an election. Regrettably, they won a few elections after that. I think you won five elections on the trot, didn't you? Why didn't you do something about this great problem that you have now identified—all this chicanery? What did you call it? What were the adjectives you used? Have you forgotten?
—Through the chair, please.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was just trying to get some assistance from the senator on the terrible adjectives that he used to describe these horrible family trusts. If they are as bad as you say they are, why didn't your government do something about them in the 13 long years that you were in power?
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Give me those adjectives again so I can quote them back to you. What did you say? Why didn't you do something? Senator Heffernan tells me that one of the reasons might have been that Mr Keating had a family trust and that as Treasurer or Prime Minister he did not want to do anything about it. But Mr Keating did nothing wrong. He acted quite within the law and he did what any sensible Australian would do to arrange their affairs properly. Senator Murphy, one of your colleagues I 
 think, has a family trust—nothing wrong with that. Good for him! He is one of the few people on your side who shows a bit of acumen, a bit of sense and a bit of understanding of the laws that the Labor Party government implemented and managed over 13 long years.
—Effective tax planning, is it?
—Senator Conroy, I am going to pause here. I am going to allow you to interject, if I may, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Through the chair.
—I know it is improper, but I am just going to pause and wonder a bit myself why it was that the Labor government, in 13 long years, did not do something about these family trusts that Senator Conroy has spent the previous five shallow minutes describing. I will just ponder to allow Senator Conroy to interject.
—Why did you withdraw the legislation from this parliament that we put in the last one?
—I do not hear Senator Conroy yet. I know I am a bit slow—I confess that. But if it is so bad now, our government is doing something about it. We are looking at it. Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Kemp and Mr Costello are looking at some of the worst rorts in the tax system that your government allowed to be perpetrated over 13 years. My colleague mentions Mr Keating and some of his Danpork trusts. We are looking at those trusts that your government allowed to be perpetrated.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I also wish to take note of the answers to questions asked by Senator Faulkner, Senator Conroy and Senator Cook. It is clear that the issue of tax reform will be a central element at the forthcoming federal election. Tax reform, of course, encompasses a range of issues: the GST; the appropriate mix between tax on income and tax on expenditure; the role of tax in savings policy; and the role of tax as a driver or initiator of change 
 in the productive side of our economy. Equally, levels of taxation for individuals, corporate entities and other legally sanctioned arrangements such as trusts should, and one presumes will, be part of that overall debate—in that context, the future role of trusts is part of the continuing debate. There is nothing magic about trusts—nothing new. Family trusts have become a very popular tax minimisation device in this country in the last eight or nine years.
The previous government was moving to eliminate many of those artificial and contrived arrangements when it was derailed by the previous opposition in late 1995. The current government went a small way to eliminating some of those abuses with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill of late 1997 and early 1998, but it did not seek to remedy the critical problems in trusts, and two defects spring readily to mind. Firstly, trusts, properly structured and utilised, can be used to minimise tax exposure, particularly for those who earn a substantial part of their income from investments. Secondly, hundreds of thousands of people have sought to use family trust arrangements to change their tax profile. All too often people simply use the establishment of family trusts as a device to alter their status as PAYE taxpayers and hence enjoy the lower tax regime enjoyed by trusts.
This avoidance, minimisation, re-arrangement—call it what you will—naturally has a serious impact on government and its role in the community. It inevitably leads to arguments about the appropriate tax mix, the breakdown of the tax system, haemorrhaging of the tax system. This, in turn, is used as justification by the government parties, the corporate sector and elements of the welfare lobby for the introduction of new and additional taxes on consumption. It is a very simple equation that is put in this debate: middle and high income earners use trusts to reduce tax payments; the scale of such use is sufficient to imperil the existing taxation system; to maintain the integrity of the new system we impose a new tax, a GST on consumption; and finally, everyone is treated 
 equally because all goods and services are taxed equally at point of sale.
What is so bad, so offensive and so inequitable about this trust/GST mix is the wholesale transfer of tax liability and tax responsibility from high income earners—high net worth individuals; those with significant income producing assets—to those at the bottom end of the food or taxation chain. When redistribution occurs, there is indeed a progressive tax system, but it is the reverse of common understanding. The redistribution is from low and middle earners to high income earners. For want of a better description, it is a perversion.
Who are today's low income earners, we ask? Low skilled workers, many single income families, many single income parents, welfare and pension recipients, casual and part-time employees. All of these groups currently spend 100 per cent of their income on consumption. Net household debt, figures suggest, is approaching 200 per cent of income through borrowing. The government proposal is to whack these people with another tax—a GST on every dollar they spend—and in one fell swoop reduce their disposable income by 10 per cent, 12 per cent or 15 per cent via the GST. Why? Because so many hundreds of thousands of individuals use trusts to alter their tax liability. They alter it so much, we are told, that the future of the entire taxation system is in peril. Because so many do not pay a share—their fair and equitable share—the system haemorrhages and insufficient revenue is received by government to fund necessary government purposes, and because of that we have to re-jig the whole system. Deliberate evasion, deliberate minimisation, avoidance through family trusts—now in excess of 300,000 or 400,000.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-27,"—I would like to speak to the motion moved by Senator Conroy in respect of answers to questions without notice. I found it quite amazing that Senator Cook and other Labor Party senators would ask questions of Senator Kemp on cracking down on tax avoidance because, as you would 
 know through your own experience in our time in opposition, the Labor Party seemed to speak a lot about cracking down on tax avoiders. Every time they tried to say how they were going to balance some future budget—something that they were singularly unsuccessful in doing in 10 out of 13 years in government—they would have this sort of magic pudding, called `the cracking down on tax avoidance magic pudding.' They were always saying, `Somehow we will balance our budget by cracking down on tax avoiders.'
Labor were very unsuccessful because they were either lazy or incompetent in government. They always spoke about cracking down on tax avoidance and now, in opposition, they are saying, `We would have got around to doing that in the 14th year,' and `Look at the legislation we brought in in the dying minutes.' It was not even five minutes to midnight. As you would recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that legislation was brought in at about 30 seconds to midnight, just before they were turfed out of office.
You have to look at Labor's record on tax reform and attacking tax avoidance; they really did nothing. They talk about trusts, and Senator Bishop from the state of Western Australia has said that these trust structures became very popular over the last eight, nine or 10 years. I remind him that, even though he may not have been a part of the previous government, the Labor Party was in power for all of that decade, and that during that time they did not do anything about trusts—not in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 or even 1990. They did not do anything about them in 1991 or, as I recall, in 1992. In 1993, as I said, at 30 seconds to midnight in December, they said, `Oh, all of a sudden we've got this bill.' The bill, of course, was too little and too late as far as the Labor Party's credibility on tax reform is concerned.
Can I say what the Labor Party's concept of tax reform really is? It is well and truly on the record. The Australian people do need to understand what Labor means when they talk about tax reform. It is very hard for Labor to get a policy up because every now and then one of their spokespeople will raise a policy and have it quickly knocked off because they 
 realise that it has not been discussed or because suddenly it is unpopular.
Labor's form over the years is well documented in terms of the new taxes they brought in. They promised not to tax capital gains, and of course they taxed them. They promised no changes to the tax system and no increases, and they had this trifecta or whatever it was—that tax would not increase as a proportion of GDP. But they drove it from 22 per cent up to 27 per cent in a short time and still managed, with all of the tax increases, to continue increasing the deficit.
Labor's records on deficits, tax and interest rates go hand in hand. They drove deficits up. Their record on deficits averaged $12.2 billion in current dollar terms. This was not for one, two or three years; the Labor Party in government ran $12.2 billion deficits for 10 years out of 13. The average deficit that Labor ran was $12.2 billion. It is a remarkable achievement.
Labor Party people may wonder why they get tagged as the high interest rate, high deficit, high tax party. It is because they have got so much form. If you had the sort of form that these people had on deficits, interest rates and taxes, you could pick them in every race. You would not have to get the form guide out; you would not have to get advice from anyone; you would not have to go around and talk to other punters, the trainers and jockeys. You would say, `These guys are absolute, guaranteed winners in the race for high interest rates, high debt, high inflation and high taxes every single time they enter the race.'
Senator Faulkner wants carbon taxes and environmental taxes; other Labor people want bed taxes—Premier Carr has already introduced that. The jobs levy was a beauty, a really good idea—let's put a levy on jobs. Brian Howe wants polluter pays and congestion taxes; Wayne Swan wants some luxury taxes; Lindsay Tanner wants inheritance taxes; Martin Ferguson wants more wealth taxes; and Gareth Evans says `let's have some higher taxes.' They are very good on taxes; they increase taxes massively. They had the biggest deficits in Australian history and, as we know, they had the highest interest rates 
 in Australian history. They really have nowhere to go. They spent 13 years in government and were not prepared to crack down on trusts. (Time expired)

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-05-27,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the proposed referral of the provisions of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, the committee report on 23 June 1998"".
The committee's report, as presented by Senator Calvert, indicates that, while the committee proposes the referral of the bill, it does not indicate a reporting date and notes that the committee could not agree upon a reporting date. This amendment proposes to the Senate that the reporting date be 23 June in order to enable the Senate to have the opportunity to debate this bill this session.
This bill does contain a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in a report it made on the 1996 election nearly 12 months ago. That report was handed down on 16 June last year. Of course, the proposals in the report were thoroughly debated by that committee in the lead-up to the tabling of that report and have been in the public arena now 
 for nearly 12 months. In the two-and-a-bit years since the previous election, these matters have been debated thoroughly, have been in the public arena and have been debated by all the parties represented in this chamber. As I said, the committee's recommendations have been in the public arena for all of that time.
The government does not really see, in light of those facts, any real need for this bill to go to a committee, but we accept that that is sought by at least one party in the chamber and therefore it will occur. We do think the reporting date should be relatively soon. All these matters have been on the public agenda for quite some time and we think 23 June is an appropriate reporting date for a legislation committee. That will ensure that there is the opportunity, time permitting, for the bill to be considered by the Senate in this session. I commend that amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,17,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I oppose this amendment and take this opportunity to briefly address the Senate on the question before the chair and the very much related issue of the motion that stands in the name of Senator Ian Campbell to propose to exempt this particular bill from the provisions of standing order 111. I think it might save the Senate some time if I try to briefly address both of those issues and indicate that the opposition, for its part, will not support the cut-off motion for this bill. It might save debate on that particular motion to make a contribution at this point because, of course, this is the related issue of the reporting date of the committee on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 .
We do not accept the paltry arguments that the government puts forward in relation to the urgency for this bill. We wonder why, if it is so urgent, it has taken so long for this particular piece of legislation to come before us. I think that this bill contains some measures that are highly politically partisan and they are, in the view of the opposition, motivated by an attempt to gain clear political advantage before the calling of an election—hence the rush by the government to deal with this 
 particular matter in this session of the parliament.
We have made it very clear that some of the provisions of this bill—like, for example, the proposal to increase from $1,500 to $10,000 the amount above which a donor to a political party must furnish a return for the financial year—are not acceptable to the opposition. Of course, it is the Labor Party in this country that has led the charge in relation to improved disclosure laws. We cannot accept the proposal of the government to increase from $1,500 to $5,000 the amount received from a person or an organisation that political parties are required to disclose during a financial year. Again, we think this is very much a retrograde step and very much against the spirit of what the Labor Party has long embraced in relation to disclosure.
We are particularly concerned about the issue of the Greenfields Foundation, which is not adequately addressed either in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  or in any proposed government amendments to that bill. We view this use by the Liberal Party of the Greenfields Foundation to launder funds as one of the most serious breaches of the spirit and letter of the funding and disclosure regulations that we have seen. It is up there with the Liberal's use of the Free Enterprise Foundation. Sadly, this bill does not do anything to address this very important issue. We are concerned that the government has been complicit in allowing this rort to exist, and we intend to pursue—and pursue very vigorously indeed—amendments to ensure this multimillion dollar loophole in relation to the loan from the Greenfields Foundation is no longer able to be exploited by the Liberal Party before, during and beyond the next election.
We think that there are some very important issues here. Many of them are very politically sensitive. We think they come to the Senate with, unfortunately, the motivation being an attempt at partisan and serious political advantage on the part of the Liberal Party. We think this requires far more mature consideration. When you are going to change the electoral laws so significantly in a country like Australia, by and large, it should receive 
 a fair degree of bipartisan support. That is the spirit with which the Labor Party is approaching these issues, and that is why we oppose the amendment that has been moved by Senator Minchin and will not be supporting the proposal. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-05-27,"—I have concerns about this legislation as well, particularly the components of the legislation which pass on information details of electors, including their date of birth and salutation—the title they use—to members of parliament, to senators and to registered political parties.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. My point of order is that the motion before you relates to an amendment to the report of the Selection of Bills Committee—to the referral of a bill to a committee and, particularly, a reporting date. I think that Senator Brown would need to be relevant and, to be within standing orders, to be quite specific about that motion, which is a very specific proposal.
—There is no point of order, Senator Campbell.
—I think that is a correct ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President.
Another matter that concerns me is the provision that any person sentenced to imprisonment will not be entitled to be enrolled to vote. When and how the committee deliberates on that is important to me. It is important to me because these are matters of fundamental, democratic rights. In particular, there is a need for us to ensure that prisoners are well placed to come back into civil society. We are not talking here about axe murderers; we are talking about prisoners who have short-term sentences up to five years. People who are imprisoned for more than five years already have the right to vote taken away from them. I do not think it is good legislation for the government to be moving to strike all prisoners off the roll because it believes that that is going to give it a voting advantage or for whatever other reason it might have.
I am also concerned about the move to make it more difficult for the public to peruse who gives money to political parties and who 
 is, therefore, influencing political parties through their donations because this raises the donation level which is required for reporting when people make donations to political parties. It is very important legislation. It does need proper scrutiny. I and the Greens have considerable concerns about the legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,17,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I would like to foreshadow an amendment but I have not yet had a chance to put it in writing. It was suggested to me only 10 seconds ago.
—Who by?
—I could not possibly reveal the source. Rather than adopting Senator Minchin's course—which I understand is to report by 23 June—I think our attitude would be to report back on the first day of the next sitting. Maybe those opposite could assist me with when that is going to be.
—10 August.
—Perhaps 10 August or 10 November. That is not really in your hands, is it? I was going to put that in writing as a foreshadowed motion, but if this amendment is carried then you will not even require it in writing. Senator Faulkner has given some indication as to why this particular bill should have a little longer hearing, and Senator Brown has reinforced that.
I found it interesting in the budget papers to see a figure over three years of $45 million. That is one of the reasons I want to reconsider some aspects of this bill. It is not true to portray this as a necessarily bad bill. It is a bill with some controversial aspects that people may say is good electoral practice or partisanship, but the part that interests me most is the provision in terms of tax deductibility.
—It is not in this bill.
—Are you indicating that it is not in this part of the bill?
—It is in a separate tax bill.
—It is going to be in a separate tax bill. I hope that you are not going to try to get that through a cut-off 
 motion this session, because it is quite a remarkable figure. It is in some ways linked, because you always look for all the electoral reform that is being brought in. I found that figure of $45 million fascinating, because it is basically saying that political parties over those three years will receive donations of beyond $100 million. If you take what the company tax rate is and you take what the personal tax rate is and try to average it out, bearing in mind that some donors already giving money will benefit from it, over three years something like an extra $80 million will float into the political process. I hope that is not a start to say that we will do that rather than public funding, because that would lead to a very inequitable position.
—Your members on the committee agreed to this.
—Yes, they did. I regret that they did not have my guidance, but they shortly will have my guidance on this particular issue. One thing that the committee did not have, Senator Minchin—and I will finish this part of the contribution on that point—is any estimates. You have put the estimates in the forward estimates, and I have no idea how you calculated them.
—Treasury did not have our guidance.
—I am sure they did not. Maybe we will have to see Treasury to find out how they came up with that figure. I suppose what I am really saying is that this bill does have a chance of succeeding through the Senate with some amendments given mature consideration. If you put a very short reporting time on this, and if you defeat us on the cut-off motion, then it will be Wik II in the committee stage. You do not want that; we do not want that.
We would rather some time to try to work out a reasonable proposition. We know Senator Minchin is a reasonable person on these things. He does listen, he does engage in discussion. Sometimes he concedes; sometimes he digs his heels in. We know him in that particular way. We can also say that, if he ever gave his word on something, we know he would keep it. But I do think it would be better on this occasion to have a 
 more extensive reporting date and actually get the job done than to get a quick reporting date. I can pretty much guarantee you—it is not a threat; it is just an indication—that you will not get it done in the committee stage of this session.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,17,1,speech

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-05-27,"—by leave—I want to take the opportunity on the first day of National Reconciliation Week to confirm the government's strong commitment to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This week, all Aus 
 tralians can show a commitment to reconciliation, inform themselves about the indigenous perspective and participate in reconciliation activities. National Reconciliation Week is marked by two very significant dates. Today, 27 May, is the anniversary of the referendum in 1967 which empowered the Commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal people. The concluding date of National Reconciliation Week is 3 June, the anniversary of the High Court's Mabo decision.
The theme this year is `Communities Working Together'. All over Australia, local councils, churches, business and community organisations will be acknowledging the cause of reconciliation, and I urge everyone to join in their local activities. Australia's traditional values of a `fair go', of tolerance, of acceptance of diversity and of looking after each other in times of need provide the context for successful reconciliation. In 1991 we were happy to support the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. We continue to support the council's objective, which is to promote reconciliation based on an appreciation of indigenous cultures, achievements and the unique position of indigenous people in Australia.
There are three major elements to a successful reconciliation process. We should acknowledge the realities of our shared history and its continuing effects. We should, in line with the theme for National Reconciliation Week, work together towards a common future in which we share equally and in which we appreciate and respect our varied traditions and cultures. Finally—and this is the key—we need an ongoing commitment to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage.
This is one of our major policy priorities. There can otherwise be no meaningful reconciliation. We look forward to the day when indigenous people share equally with all other Australians in the social, economic and cultural life of this country. We look forward to the day when indigenous people are able to leave behind welfare dependence and take control of their own lives and communities. We know that this will not be achieved if indigenous people continue to lag behind in 
 the key socio-economic areas of health, housing, education and employment. The Government's efforts have been concentrated in these areas, and I believe we are beginning to see results.
In the recent budget, I issued a ministerial statement which, for the first time, puts on record exactly what the government is doing to meet its goals. It shows that we spend almost $1.9 billion annually on indigenous-specific programs, and over 70 percent of this is in the key areas I mentioned. Since coming to government we have increased indigenous health spending by nearly 40 percent. The Prime Minister announced in February a project to address the severe eye health problems in indigenous communities. In a country with all of Australia's advantages, it is intolerable that so many indigenous people should be afflicted with avoidable blindness. The measures we are putting in place will make an appreciable and early difference. We are also providing an immunisation program for influenza and associated diseases which are a major cause of ill health and death in indigenous communities. It is by practical, realistic and effective measures such as these that we aim to achieve significantly better outcomes for indigenous people.
Mr Acting Deputy President, we acknowledge that there is a huge backlog in the provision of adequate housing and health related infrastructure in indigenous communities and, unfortunately, the available funding is not unlimited. We have decided that our priority should be those communities that are particularly needy and which, because of their location in remote areas, cannot access mainstream programs.
The innovative ATSIC-army community assistance program, which we initiated shortly after coming to government, has already had some excellent results. Seven priority remote communities have been identified and the army is providing housing, sewerage and better, cleaner and safer water supplies. More significantly, it also has community members who are trained by army personnel to maintain the new infrastructure so that the value of the asset will be preserved, and the benefits in terms of improved health will be sustained. 
 Indeed, during a recent trip by the Prime Minister and me to the Northern Territory to visit Aboriginal communities, we were able to see the very real improvements which will be made to the community of Elcho Island under the program. These include the construction of 10 houses, the provision of solar power and the upgrading of water supplies.
Mr Acting Deputy President, these results demonstrate that this program is delivering real benefits to indigenous people in the most needy of remote communities. And today the Prime Minister has announced that the government will commit an additional $5 million to extend the program. I will be consulting with ATSIC to provide matching funding as it did under the pilot program.
I particularly want to express my thanks to army personnel who have contributed so willingly to the success of this program and the productive consultation processes which they undertook with local communities. Indeed, the program is an excellent example of this government's approach to the reconciliation process, particularly in light of the very constructive relationships which were formed between army personnel and the indigenous communities.
Mr Acting Deputy President, indigenous children suffer particular disadvantage in educational outcomes. The comparative participation figures are very telling. Indigenous children have a secondary school year 12 retention rate of less than 30 per cent, compared with some 70 per cent of other Australians. Only nine per cent of indigenous young people are attending tertiary institutions, compared with 22 per cent of the non-indigenous population. Twenty-five per cent of indigenous students leave school before year 10. For other students, the figure is only two per cent. In terms of educational attainments, 75 per cent of indigenous students in primary schools have significantly low levels of literacy and numeracy, compared with 33 per cent of other students. The situation is exacerbated by the remoteness of many Aboriginal communities which have no educational facilities and are located a considerable distance from the nearest schools.
This government is committed to assisting indigenous students to reach their full potential and has provided increased funding, including to the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. I am pleased to note that the government will be providing a package of initiatives of more than $15 million under this program for new equipment and facilities, including computers, school buses and accommodation for teachers in remote areas. The additional funds will also be used for curriculum programs aimed at improving the reading and writing skills of indigenous children, particularly in those vital early primary years. This funding will go to schools, both government and non-government, preschools and vocational and training institutions. It augments the $20 million announced by this government in December for similar facilities and projects for indigenous students in non-government schools and pre-schools.
Mr Acting Deputy President, we are also very supportive of the community development employment projects scheme. It may not be very well known that indigenous people have been working for the dole for the last twenty years under this scheme—which was introduced by the coalition government in 1977—both to gain work experience and to improve community amenities. Demand for places has always been high despite some disincentives in terms of reduced welfare entitlements and taxation rebates. In the last budget we removed those anomalies, and we will provide CDEP workers with the same allowances available to mainstream work for the dole participants. This will bring more money into indigenous communities to assist in their economic development.
An appreciation in the wider community of the unique culture and heritage of Australia's indigenous people is also integral to reconciliation. I am pleased that I have been able to take the Prime Minister to the Torres Strait Islands and eastern Arnhem Land. The pride indigenous people take in their traditions, the enormous effort that is put into maintaining these traditions and the important role of the family in indigenous communities are to be much admired. Over recent years many Australians will have enjoyed outstanding 
 work by indigenous people in the visual and performing arts.
Understanding the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians is essential to an appreciation of their culture. We have a profound respect for the deep spiritual attachment of indigenous people to their traditional land, and we support the principles of native title as set out in the Mabo and Wik decisions. But of course other Australians have attachments and rights to land as well and a balance must be struck. I believe we have achieved that balance with our native title amendments. If no single group is entirely happy with the outcome, I hope it will be acknowledged that the result is the best compromise amongst varied interests. The other key element is understanding our shared history and recognising that this history continues to contribute to today's disadvantage.
Last December we announced a $63 million package of practical measures clearly targeted at the most urgent and pressing need identified in the Bringing them home recommendations—getting family members back together. The funds we set aside will be used by ATSIC to establish `link up' centres in each state and the Northern Territory to assist people wanting to trace missing relatives. Substantial funds were also allocated to provide new and enhanced counselling services in recognition of the trauma and distress that many families have faced.
Reconciliation is, however, also about the future; it is especially about the future. It is about determining common goals and building enduring partnerships that will take us together into the next century. We are an egalitarian people, we are a fair and tolerant people. I believe we have a real commitment to those elements of the reconciliation process that I have talked about: acknowledging the past; appreciating indigenous culture; working together; and, most importantly, addressing those disadvantages that prevent indigenous people taking their rightful place in contemporary Australia. We are entering an exciting time in our history and, with mutual trust and respect, the process of reconciliation will be one of the great successes of that history.
I congratulate Evelyn Scott and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on their efforts in coordinating this week's activities and again urge everyone to enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of reconciliation. I table the statement and seek leave to move a motion.
Leave granted.

That the Senate take note of the statement.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>National Reconciliation Week</title>,Ministerial Statements,25,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-27,"—Reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians is critical to our capacity to move forward as a maturing nation. It involves reconciliation between our cultures and reconciliation with our shared history. Reconciling with our shared history involves acknowledgment, acceptance and mutual respect. It must involve a shared sorrow and regret for the events, attitudes and policies of the past that brought so much pain then and has left a legacy of personal and social distress with indigenous people today.
The Prime Minister has told us that we must acknowledge the realities of our shared history and its continuing effects. We wholeheartedly agree with that. But is this the same Prime Minister who so enthusiastically moved to entrench the expression `the black armband view of history' in common use? Is this the same Prime Minister who said:
Call an end to the self-flagellation, the introspection, the willingness to accept unfounded criticisms?
Is this the same Prime Minister who, when speaking to the Age  newspaper, said:
We can look any people in the eye and say we have done right by our citizens?
Is this the same Prime Minister whose response to the racist diatribes in the maiden speech of the member for Oxley in the House of Representatives was to triumphantly announce to the Queensland Liberal Party in particular and the world in general:
The pall of censorship of the Keating years has been lifted?
That brings us, of course, to the coalition's major contribution to National Reconciliation Week: its decision to direct preferences to One Nation in Queensland. Such exquisite 
 timing! They were no doubt mindful of One Nation's Hervey Bay spokesman's acute observation. He said:
There's nothing wrong with Asia that an `A' bomb and anthrax couldn't cure—
when deciding on this crucial reconciliation issue.
The Prime Minister noted that National Reconciliation Week will end with the anniversary of the Mabo decision. The opposition applauds his assurance that the government accepts the outcome of the Wik and Mabo cases. What a pity that the Prime Minister's actions have failed to reflect those words. The Mabo decision was central to and critical to reconciliation. The pride and reassurance that flowed to indigenous Australians from this recognition of their prior rights in this country is real and measurable; measurable in their willingness and ability to pursue the logical benefits of these discovered rights in public and in the courts. It truly affirmed them and gave many of them confidence that our system of justice can recognise and protect them.
The response of certain elements in the community, including most of those who currently form our national government, was to attack the decision and deny its legitimacy. Furthermore, they embarked on a deliberate campaign in regional Australia to spread misinformation, fear and panic. Whatever the short-term political results may have been, we will all live with the resultant racial disharmony for years to come.
And they did not stop there. They attacked the High Court as well. As Gerard Henderson remarked yesterday, `Neither Ben Chifley in 1949 or Robert Menzies in 1956, despite High Court decisions that cut to the core of their political agendas, ever did such a thing.' Not only did the coalition let loose the more lamentable specimens from the dark corners of their own backbench but also they assailed the court from the frontbench as well after both the Mabo and Wik decisions.
The Keating government, in the context of the coalition's campaign of fear and loathing, framed a legislative response to Mabo in 1993. They did so in the face of total non-cooperation from the coalition. The conserva 
 tives did not seek to deal with this newly discovered right; they sought to deny and suppress it. In government their response to the Wik decision was to draft a systematic winding back of the right of indigenous Australians that the High Court had recognised. The Wik decision was about coexistence and the primacy of property rights granted since European settlement. It could have been a major instrument of reconciliation.
Confronting truth and understanding past mistakes is a public policy issue. Expenditure programs for indigenous Australians in health, housing, education and training are welcome and necessary. However, if such programs are predicated on the assumption that we are simply dealing with a group within an homogenous wider community that suffers from material deprivation, and that such deprivation can be redressed by targeted spending, then we are all doomed to further disappointment.
Australia's indigenous communities continue to bear the scars and the pain and the disabilities that come from a history of dispossession, social dislocation, destruction of their language and culture, and the systematic destruction of families. Public policy makers in this country must accept that reality and respond creatively to the challenges that this understanding brings to effective program and policy delivery.
Great numbers of indigenous Australians and many health and education professionals tell us that progress must start with healing and that an apology—an expression of regret—from authorities that have represented oppression and pain is central to that healing. Why in the name of good government, if not in the name of humanity, should this government deny them such a simple, symbolic gesture? The Prime Minister can't apologise. His Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs—
—Leaves the chamber.
—He leaves the chamber while this statement is being debated, and he says that apologies are for wimps. Who can forget what he said in question time yesterday? He accused the opposition in this chamber and the opposition in this nation— 
 the Labor Party—of being participants in `the crying game'. Who can ever forget that that is all you get from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs? And what is the abiding message of all of this? What are we to read into the code? I suspect that what we have, on balance, is a situation in which Australians in favour of reconciliation suspect that they have got no friend in the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.
—And no-one to represent them.
—And those who are opposed to reconciliation, Senator Woodley, privately celebrate their suspicion that they have a secret friend in the Prime Minister. We in the Australian Labor Party, we in the opposition, welcome and acknowledge the start of National Reconciliation Week, and we endorse the Prime Minister's call for all Australians to participate in National Reconciliation Week.
We thank indigenous Australians for their patience. We thank them for their acceptance and their forbearance in the face of all that has happened, and we join them and all Australians in the knowledge and the hope that things will get better. We can and will be reconciled. We can and will move forward to a better future.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>National Reconciliation Week</title>,Ministerial Statements,25,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-05-27,"—I wish to respond to the minister's statement on behalf of the Australian Democrats. There is no doubt that the Democrats are committed to reconciliation. We have put that on the record on many occasions and we will continue to work for reconciliation.
But I must say that reconciliation has to be based on justice and there is not much justice in this place, certainly not this week. It is distressing, during National Reconciliation Week, to hear reports of the most anti-reconciliation party in this country, One Nation, rising in the polls. In fact, One Nation is perhaps the most unbelievably misnamed political party in the history of this country, for it represents neither one nor one nation. It is not one because it is in fact many parties, individuals and extremist groups, and it is not for one nation, because if it gains any seats in 
 coming elections it will totally divide and fracture this nation of ours.
The Democrats also believe that the Prime Minister of this country must take responsibility for the rise and rise of One Nation. Mr Howard defended the member for Oxley almost from the beginning. In that atmosphere—I suppose one must call it tolerance; I cannot think of another word, although it is a misuse of tolerance too, I think—the One Nation party has survived and thrived.
Today, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has said, we hear that the coalition in Queensland has given One Nation its stamp of approval with its second preference. In other words, the coalition in Queensland would rather have One Nation members of state parliament than Labor members. That is shocking, sad and very cynical. We wonder if the federal coalition will follow suit and declare its support for One Nation. I guess that may happen at the end of reconciliation week.
We believe that the conservative parties are playing a very dangerous political game. By creating that atmosphere of tolerance, the Prime Minister may have dug his own political grave. One Nation now appears to present a formidable electoral threat to the coalition, federally and in Queensland. This is the cost to reconciliation in this country from the rise of the One Nation party.
But there is a bright side: the people's movement for reconciliation is growing larger every day. That is wonderful news. Yesterday in Canberra, hundreds of people were turned away from many of the events which were held to celebrate and, by way of ceremony, say sorry to the indigenous people of this country. Many of us went to the celebration in the theatrette and not only was the theatrette absolutely packed but every square inch of available space outside the theatrette was packed and hundreds—
—The government didn't allow them to use the mural hall for some reason.
—We heard that, although the President has some explanation. But you are right. I was very angry about 
 that, as were people at the ceremony. But that is the bright side: that there are many people, a growing body of people, in this country who really do believe in reconciliation. That is wonderful news.
Reconciliation is about mutual respect between people. Mutual respect means people can say sorry to one another; that is the way that mature relationships develop. Having said sorry, we can then go on. The movement around Australia of grassroots people who are saying sorry to the stolen generation is acknowledging their pain and suffering, sharing their grief and then moving ahead. The Democrats were happy to personally offer our apologies to the stolen generation in the sorry books. We know that admissions of guilt are not being sought, but we know that saying sorry allows this nation to grieve, to heal and to move on.
I believe, as we note with alarm the rising popularity of the One Nation party in Queensland, it is significant to note the equal rise in popularity for the reconciliation movement in Australia. Sorry Day activities in Canberra yesterday were booked out, so it is not all bad news.
I conclude by referring to an article in the Australian today about the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. There was a suggestion of criticism of the chair of that council, Evelyn Scott, and that article quotes me. I want to place on record my unqualified support for Evelyn Scott as chairperson of the council and my support for her as she seeks, through the council, to advance the cause of reconciliation in this country. To that end, the Democrats are unequivocally committed.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>National Reconciliation Week</title>,Ministerial Statements,25,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-27,"—I feel sad about the statement presented today by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The sadness relates to the lack of understanding that jumps out from the pages of the document that has been presented. The very first paragraph says:
. . . confirm the government's strong commitment to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
The Greens (WA) have always had some concern in relation to the concept of reconciliation. Our concern relates to the fact—and it 
 has been expressed to us by many indigenous people throughout Australia—that reconciliation tends to sound like a `kiss and make up', a `if only we can come together again, then things will be okay'. That superficial element of reconciliation, or some superficial understanding of reconciliation, tends to come from this page. The following statement is made in paragraph 4:
The theme this year is Communities Working Together . All over Australia local councils, churches, business and community will be acknowledging the cause of reconciliation . . .
What does that mean? I argue that it means nothing because it basically does not acknowledge the need for the healing in the first place. `Acknowledging the cause of reconciliation' is meaningless. It does not give any indication of the need to recognise the physical, psychological and sexual abuse and discrimination that have occurred and that need to be acknowledged for the healing to take place. It does not acknowledge the systematic disenfranchisement, the removal from land, and the ignorance and disrespect for indigenous culture and values. That must be acknowledged. Without acknowledgment, we will not learn and we will not progress.	  Even so, reconciliation is only a word if it does not mean more, if it does not mean actual actions.
We basically have an indication that the government believes that the situation many indigenous people find themselves in is of their own making. The document states:
We look forward to the day when indigenous people are able to leave behind welfare dependence and take control of their own lives and communities.
Wouldn't that be wonderful? But self-determination is not actually on the government's agenda. So basically this government is saying, `Leave behind your culture, forget what we have done, forget what successive generations have done and pull yourself up from the situation you find yourself in.' We see that further on it says:
It shows that we spend almost $1.9 billion annually on indigenous-specific programmes . . . 
Very interesting. It goes to state and territory governments, in the main. Yet what is the 
 centrepoint of this reconciliation statement? It is dunny based paternalism. The only example this government can give is sending the army in—without actually asking indigenous Australians whether that is what they want to happen in that manner. It is using a special appropriation but requiring that ATSIC put up money from their already stretched budget to provide matching funds. It is not providing extra money but requiring that ATSIC give up some other program, some other priority, in order to match the funds that people in indigenous communities were not asked about in the first place.
What kind of dunny based paternalism is this? It basically misses the whole point. Why were state governments not required to put in that portion of the $1.9 billion of federal taxpayers' money that people pay to state and federal governments to provide basic services—basic services that mean public housing that is more than concrete and wire pens like you get in many remote and regional areas of Australia. Would this be accepted in any other portion of the Australian community, especially when, to receive basic health and education services, people have to be forced to sign up to mining agreements, for their basic human rights? So the great contribution to reconciliation by this government is actually to take $5 million off ATSIC from their other programs, or sit and wait to see whether or not they will accept taking $5 million out of their other programs.
Is the army the best or most appropriate means of providing the service? I do not know. Have ATSIC been advised? Did ATSIC get a choice? Did Aboriginal communities get a choice? Is this their priority? Is this a way to move towards self-determination? Quite frankly, I think the issue of sovereignty must be brought back onto the agenda. We know that it has never been decided by the High Court because they cannot. The High Court of Australia cannot decide on sovereignty because at the very moment those words come out of their mouths they themselves no longer exist.
If Australia cannot deal with the issue of sovereignty in that way, we have got to deal with it in another way. The other way is to 
 actually deal with self-determination: work towards a meaningful treaty process, work towards agreement with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations of Australia and work towards finding real self-determination. If this dunny based paternalism is the best the government can do, we will continue to be in the state we are now, with total lack of understanding of what the real issues are, total lack of understanding of the need for recognition and total lack of understanding that in any program you put together the very least you need to do is find out whether that is what the communities are wanting and, if so, how they want it delivered.
This is more than sad; this is tragic. I really think that the people in other countries are looking with great distress and sadness at what this government is doing. I do not personally believe that the big racist problem in Australia is a particular minor party or individuals standing for parliament. They are reflecting the environment that has been created by a political scapegoating, divisive mentality. This government is seeking to gain from that mentality. It is seeking to gain from the distress within the Australian community that has been created by the combined major parties in this parliament. Until we start addressing those, we will always be attacking one or other minor party.
I believe there is blame to be had for the simplistic arguments that are put up by those people who are specifically standing on racist platforms. Of course that is not to be applauded. But the government and the Labor Party bear some responsibility for that level of distress that exists within the community. Until we start looking at the cause of this distress and until we start looking at the reason why scapegoat politics and wedge politics and divisive politics are in such a fertile environment in Australia, attacking those people who are gaining politically from it will not address the problem. We have got to start healing this country as a whole. We have got to start helping indigenous Australians to be part of the healing process, but we also have to start healing this nation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-27,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society . I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society
PREAMBLE
The Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee: Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society,  which documents developments in Adult and Community Education (ACE) in Australia since its earlier report in 1991 and makes recommendations for future development of the ACE sector. This report will prove to be a valuable resource document for governments, organisations, institutions, educators and individuals.
The release of this report follows the release of the new National Policy on Adult and Community Education, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). Both the report and the new National Policy will contribute significantly to promoting and advancing ACE nationally.
State and Territory governments have primary responsibility for the ACE sector. The Commonwealth's role is primarily policy advisory. Consequently, many of the recommendations will require consideration by State and Territory governments.
Commonwealth support for the sector is manifested in a number of ways, including:
.	 Commonwealth funding for the Adult and Community Education Programme administered by the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA), which provides significant support for: research into ACE; activities such as Adult Learners Week designed to promote the sector; and the continuation of the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education's role as the peak body representing the sector; 

.	 at the discretion of State and Territory governments, access by ACE providers to funds for Vocational Education and Training (VET) provided by the Commonwealth through ANTA to the States and Territories;
.	 the new labour market assistance arrangements funded through the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) under which contracted organisations are free to choose the type of assistance, including training, they see as necessary to get a jobseeker a job. These arrangements create a valuable opportunity for ACE providers to market their services to the contracted providers and expand their current involvement in the training of job seekers; and
.	 the Commonwealth's representation on the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE.
The Commonwealth, in considering its role in ACE, must take into account its overall role in, and responsibility for, all aspects of education and training. In this context the Commonwealth's deliberations must be conditioned by two key factors:
.	 the level of budgetary support the Commonwealth can provide for education and training activities across the full spectrum of education and training; and
.	 the most appropriate balance for the distribution of available Commonwealth resources across the various education and training sectors.
The way in which the recommendations contained in the report `Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society ' have been formulated has presented some difficulties in responding to the report. The two key recommendations are:
.	 Recommendation 2, which calls for a combined National ACE/VET policy; and
.	 Recommendation 3, which calls for the replacement of ANTA by a new body, the National Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training Authority (NACVETA).
Recommendations 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 and 20 are subsequently formulated in a way that makes them dependent upon acceptance, and implementation, of Recommendations 2 and 3.
In response, the Government has chosen to respond to the underlying intent of these recommendations, rather than simply in the context of their dependence on Recommendations 2 and 3, which the Government does not support. This allows for the important underlying issues raised by these recommendations to be considered in the Government's response, regardless of its position on Recommendations 2 and 3. 

RESPONSES TO INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government:
.	 make an unequivocal commitment to the concept of lifelong learning and the promotion of a learning society; and
.	 imbue its education policies and associated funding mechanisms with the values and principles of lifelong learning for all Australians.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth supports this recommendation.
The pace of technological and structural change has made it increasingly necessary for individuals to participate in further education and training on a regular basis if they are to acquire, maintain and enhance the skills necessary to participate effectively and fully in the labour market and other areas of society.
Consequently, over the past decade or so, governments in Australia and overseas have come to recognise that the traditional pattern of full-time education and training followed by a working career in which further education and training play a minimal role will no longer meet the needs of all individuals in modern industrialised societies. The Commonwealth's response has been to develop and implement education and training policies within the overall context of a growing need for lifelong learning.
Commonwealth policies and initiatives now in place that promote and advance the concept of life-long learning include:
.	 a schools literacy and numeracy strategy that will ensure that students acquire the basic literacy and numeracy skills necessary for effective participation in the labour market and/or post-school education and training;
.	 initiatives in vocational education and training, such as refinements to the New Apprenticeship system, and reformed labour market assistance arrangements which will maximise access to appropriate post-school education and training for school-leavers, adults and the unemployed;
.	 providing an increasingly demand driven system where end-users have an effective say in determining the content and delivery of courses and a wider choice of provider;
.	 enabling individuals to move more easily across the various education and training sectors; and
.	 enabling individuals to gain formal recognition of skills acquired in informal contexts. 

These initiatives are making participation in further education and training a more flexible, attractive and viable option for Australians.
The National Strategy for VET developed in 1994 identifies the creation and promotion of lifelong learning  as a priority for VET.Similarly the National Policy for ACE, adopted by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA stresses the importance of meeting the lifelong learning needs of adults and fostering a culture of learning in Australian society and organisations. For example, under Strategic Outcome 3 `Promoting ACE' outcome 3.1 states:
.		 'Governments, communities, industry and other education sectors increasingly recognise the role of ACE as an important agent of lifelong learning.'
Recommendation 2:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth Government bring together the National ACE Policy and National VET Policy to establish an integrated  National Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training (NACVET) Policy   giving effect to the commitment to lifelong learning.
Recommendation 3:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that, in order to implement, monitor and fund the new  NACVET Policy  the Commonwealth government restructure ANTA to establish the  National Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training Authority (NACVETA ).  The membership of the Authority's Board will be modified to ensure that an adequate ACE perspective is available to the Authority, and the way in which the Authority distributes its funds should reflect its revised charter.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support these recommendations.
The Commonwealth's main priority in relation to lifelong learning is to ensure that Australians have the skills and flexibility needed to meet the challenges of continuing technological and structural change, and to compete effectively in an increasingly globalised economic environment.
The ACE sector and the VET sector have distinct and mainly separate purposes which are reflected in a largely government responsibility for VET while ACE has developed largely from community impetus. Where there is an overlap of purpose, very good arrangements for cooperation have been developed, and as noted above there is strong support from government for ACE through the National ACE policy. Combining the two sectors as recommended in the Report would tend to undermine the primary objectives of each and 
 detract from Commonwealth Government efforts to improve the vocational prospects of school leavers.
Under the new arrangements for labour market assistance, there is potentially a new role for ACE. ACE providers will be able to become contracted Employment Placement Enterprises in their own right, and/or provide labour market training to the clients of Employment Placement Enterprises (EPEs) that meets the specific requirements of the EPE and its client.
Revised ANTA Agreement
The Commonwealth government has recently settled a revised ANTA Agreement with State and Territory Ministers for submission to respective State and Territory Cabinets for approval. The revised Agreement commits the Commonwealth to maintain funding in real terms for the life of the revised Agreement (1998—2000) and the States and Territories to achieve growth from efficiencies. The revised Agreement continues to cover vocational education and training separately from ACE. Work is also under way on a new National Strategy for VET to provide the framework for the States, Territories and ANTA to achieve the objectives of the revised Agreement.
Recommendation 4:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the new  NACVET Authority  report annually to the Australian Parliament on the achievement of policy outcomes.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation, which is dependent upon implementation of Recommendations 2 and 3 above which the Commonwealth does not support.
The National Policy on ACE, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, contains specific processes for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on progress under each of the National Goals of the policy. These processes include:
.	 an annual report to MCEETYA (reports from each State and Territory against the National Goals and Outcomes will form the basis of the annual report);
.	 regular monitoring of progress at the National, State and Territory level by MCEETYA through its ACE Taskforce;
.	 a mid-term review 18 months after endorsement of the policy (ie by end 1998); and
.	 a further review in the year 2000 to determine the degree of success in achieving outcomes and to determine future strategic directions and goals.
Recommendation 5
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government negotiate with the 
 States and Territories a set of  Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training (ACVET) Agreements .  These Agreements will require each State and Territory to develop  Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training (ACVET) Profile  consistent with the National Policy.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
To the extent that ACE providers deliver publicly funded VET courses, they are already included in the State's Annual VET Plans negotiated between ANTA and States/Territories.From 1998 these plans will be more strategic and outcomes focussed and performance will be measured against agreed Annual National Priorities. The ANTA Ministerial Council has already agreed to the priorities for 1998.
Recommendation 6:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that:
.	 in order to be eligible for Commonwealth funds, providers be registered as a quality provider with a State or Territory Education and Training Authority;
.	 registration be based on providers meeting standards of quality set by the relevant industry, professional or educational association;
.	 three broad categories of providers be registered as follows:
Category A	 Specific Industry Education & Training
Category B	 Non-specific Industry Education & Training
Category C	 General Education & Training
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
In many instances, access to Commonwealth funds should be contingent upon the provision of accredited training, as is the case with VET funding, not simply that provided by a registered provider of training.
The proposal to make it an essential requirement for eligibility for Commonwealth funds that providers be registered is too restrictive. It has the potential to restrict the flexibility required to best accommodate the education and training needs of Australians.
For example, under the labour market assistance arrangements, contracted organisations are free to choose the type of labour market assistance, including training, they see as necessary to place job seekers in a job. The contracted organisations are also free to choose what they view as the most appropriate form of training, regardless of whether 
 it is accredited and/or provided by a registered training provider. This flexibility is an essential element of the arrangements. Registration of training providers would not add to this flexibility and would have an unfavourable effect on the operation of the labour market assistance arrangements. The Commonwealth could not administer such a registration scheme for the purposes of the labour market assistance arrangements.
The Commonwealth is already addressing key issues related to registration requirements and associated quality and recognition issues. For example, the National Training Framework for VET agreed by the ANTA Ministerial Council will include streamlined, quality assured training provider registration arrangements. In particular the Australian Recognition Framework was implemented from 1 January 1998 and provides for the mutual recognition of training organisations and the qualifications issued by those organisations.
The aim of the National Training Framework is to produce flexible quality training outcomes with a national qualifications outcome.
ACE providers who wish to become VET Registered Training Organisations can use the flexibility of this new approach to develop training programmes which are responsive to their clients' needs. The Commonwealth has reservations about the proposal for the registration of three broad categories of providers:
.	 effective criteria for distinguishing between these categories would be extremely difficult to develop;
.	 there would be considerable difficulties in applying the distinctions; and
.	 implementation of the proposed distinctions would have significant effects on the current classification of courses, adding further complexity to already complex classification issues.
The Commonwealth believes that when ACE providers wish to access Commonwealth funding they should do so in the context of arrangements that have been put in place for the provision of various forms of training. For example:
.	 to access VET funding they should meet the appropriate VET registration arrangements; and
.	 to access funding under the new arrangements for labour market assistance, they should either:
-	 seek to become contracted Employment Placement Enterprises in their own right; and/or
-	 provide labour market training to the clients of Employment Placement Enterprises (EPEs) that meets the specific requirements of the EPE and its client. 

Implementation of the National Policy on ACE, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, will address some of the underlying issues involved in this recommendation. For example, outcomes linked to Strategic Objective 5 of the policy `Enhancing the contribution of ACE to the world of work' state that:
.	 Increasing numbers of ACE providers will be registered to deliver accredited programmes;
.	 ACE providers will be increasingly able to compete in the open training market; and
.	 ACE will play a greater role in training for local and regional labour markets.
Recommendation 7:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that a  National ACVET Equity Fund  be established under the new  NACVET Authority  to target groups currently under-represented in education and training.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent upon implementation of Recommendation 3, which the Commonwealth does not support.
Existing Commonwealth policies already recognise the need for disadvantaged groups to have equitable access to education and training opportunities, and numerous initiatives are already in place to improve access to and participation in education and training by disadvantaged groups.The participation of disadvantaged groups in the Government's new labour market assistance arrangements will be monitored to ensure that the relative representation of disadvantaged groups in labour market assistance is maintained.
ANTA has a number of projects under way to address the needs of identified client groups, to improve their access to and participation in training and to enhance the quality of outcomes for them within the national VET system.
A new National Strategy for VET is currently being developed by ANTA in collaboration with the Commonwealth, States, Territories and industry. The strategy will provide a framework for planning and determining major directions for the training system. It will be developed around five key objectives, one of which is achieving equitable outcomes in VET.
States and Territories are responsible for delivery and administration of VET under ANTA arrangements and have funded a range of initiatives to assist disadvantaged people. States and Territories report progress against the National Strategy.
The Authority has developed, in consultation with advisory groups, a number of strategies to achieve access and equity in vocational education and 
 training, which are described in  Equity 2001  released by ANTA in September 1996.
In the development of specific strategies to achieve significant improvements in access and equity, ANTA seeks advice from advisory groups (such as the Disability Forum and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' Training Advisory Council) which include, among their members, representatives who bring community education views to this consultation process.
The National Policy on ACE endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA has a strong focus on equity. For example:
.	 under `Vision' the Policy states:
-	 'ACE provision will be determined and shaped by the learning needs of communities across Australia to ensure that: people from all backgrounds and circumstances have equitable access to the knowledge, skills and understandings they need to participate fully in the economic, social and cultural life of the community';  and
.	 goal 3 `to strengthen the responsiveness of ACE to learners' (one of the three overall goals enunciated in the National Policy) addresses equity issues in detail:
-	 strategic objective 6 `fostering inclusiveness' (one of three strategic objectives for goal 3) states that fostering inclusiveness is `Ensuring that adults have equitable access to learning opportunities appropriate to their needs throughout life.';  and
-	 the outcomes linked to objective 6 (which provide a yardstick against which progress can be measured) draw specific attention to ensuring greater participation in ACE by disadvantaged groups and that equity principles are built into all ACE services.
The endorsement by State and Territory governments of the National Policy on ACE, ensures that, in their strategies designed to achieve the goals and objectives of the policy, States and Territories will give due weight to mechanisms for improving equity outcomes.ACE providers have an important role in the provision of learning opportunities for the more disadvantaged groups in the community. The work of ACE with women, rural and isolated communities and Indigenous Australians is of particular importance in increasing access to education and training. Funding for these groups is an issue for the States and Territories to be determined within the ACE funding context.
Recommendation 8:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government 

.	 give priority to the infrastructure and capital requirements of community-based providers of ACE;
.	 require that State and Territory governments assist community-based ACE providers to meet the costs of becoming registered providers; and
.	 require that ACE providers have formal representation within the State and Territory  ACVET Profile  processes.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
In relation to the first two points of the recommendation, these are matters for consideration by State and Territory governments, which have primary responsibility for ACE.
The Commonwealth is, however, aware that many community based ACE providers have difficulty in raising capital for infrastructure and other needs. It is also aware that that there is a large stock of publicly funded school, VET and higher education buildings and infrastructure which is currently not made available to other than public providers. Increased access to those facilities could be an important element in meeting the infrastructure needs of the ACE sector.
Much progress on ACE access to this infrastructure has already been made. Many universities provide access to a range of community-based ACE providers, as do some schools and Colleges of TAFE.
As State and Territory governments have responsibility for, and control of, schools and public VET institutions, while higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, the implications of this recommendation will have to be considered by them.
The registration of training providers is a quality assurance process that benefits both the provider and the client. In any consideration of the proposal that ACE providers receive assistance to meet the costs of registration, the implications in relation to national competition policy would need to be considered.
The Commonwealth will suggest that MCEETYA give further consideration to the underlying issues raised by the first two elements of this recommendation.
As noted under Recommendation 5 above, ACVET Profiles are not supported by the Commonwealth.
Recommendation 9:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that, where they have not done so, States and Territories report on the delivery by ACE providers of both accredited and non-accredited programmes as part of the State and Territory  ACVET Profile  processes. 

RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent upon implementation of recommendation 5, which the Commonwealth does not support.
The Commonwealth does however agree with the underlying intention of this recommendation, namely that there should be some mechanism for the collection of statistics on both accredited and non-accredited courses/programmes delivered by ACE providers.
A number of measures are already in place for the collection of data on ACE activity.
The implementation of the Australian Vocational Education and Training Management Information and Statistical Standard (AVETMISS) was agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers in 1992. It was also agreed to include adult and community education data from 1995. The Standard was designed to limit the volume of information required from these providers, in comparison to the information required from TAFE providers.
For this purpose, an ACE Statistical Collection Taskforce was established. The Taskforce included representatives of adult and community education providers. The inclusion of all activity by recognised ACE providers, both vocational and recreational, accredited and non accredited, was aimed to facilitate the measurement of the role of adult and community education providers in the VET sector.
Also, as noted under Recommendation 4 above, the National Policy on ACE contains specific processes for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on progress under each of the National Goals of the policy. These processes may well involve reporting on the delivery by ACE providers of both accredited and non-accredited programmes.
Recommendation 10:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the new NACVET Authority review its guidelines for competitive tendering in order (a) to incorporate selection criteria which encourage collaborative tenders, and (b) to require the specification of clear performance indicators in tender documentation.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent on implementation of Recommendation 3, which the Commonwealth does not support.
States and Territories have responsibility for allocating Commonwealth funding for VET distributed to them through the Australian National Training Authority. ANTA does not require States and Territories to provide information on their arrangements for competitive tendering. However, particularly where there are strong links between ACE and VET systems (such as in NSW where 
 cooperative and collaborative arrangements are well established) collaborative tenders are already encouraged. The ACE sector's strengths in providing programmes for some under-represented groups have been recognised in this context.
Wherever appropriate, ANTA uses public tendering processes for research activity, and collaborative tenders which bring together organisations with different strengths. Selection criteria usually include demonstrated knowledge of the VET sector, and as ACE sector organisations become more familiar with the development of the national VET system, they will be in a better position to develop collaborative tenders with other organisations.
The Commonwealth recognises that, for some services put out to tender, it would be appropriate to encourage collaboration among tenderers. We would expect that it is now standard practice at all levels of government in Australia to include clear performance indicators in tender documentation.
Recommendation 11:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government establish a dedicated research program to examine the relationship between intellectual activity and good health, and the ways in which that relationship might be enhanced.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying intent of this recommendation.
The relationship between intellectual activity and good health is an issue that is beginning to be addressed in Australia and overseas in the context of the pressures placed on governments by the ageing of populations. A number of Commonwealth funded projects have already examined issues relating to the relationship between intellectual activity and health.
The findings of both the Action Research Programme and Community Network Pilot elements of the Commonwealth Department of Social Security's Community Research Project provide qualitative evidence of a positive link between physical and intellectual engagement in community based activities, social capital, personal well being and the subjective elements of good health. Such links are being specifically investigated in the Health Development and Social Capital project funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and being undertaken by the South Australian Community Health Research Unit.
Results from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health will also have the capacity to inform decisions about the relationship between intellectual activity and good health. As the research participants involved in the Longitudinal Study are followed over time, more information 
 will become available to examine this relationship and the factors that affect it.
As a result of the findings from this and other research, some programmes for older people and mental health initiatives implemented by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services already take into account the relationship between intellectual activity and good health.
Recommendation 12:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government:
.	 commission a report on best practice in (a) the provision of pre-retirement education, and (b) in adult education programs targeting older Australians living in institutional or retirement village settings;
.	 draw together a coalition of peak senior citizens groups and adult education organisations to advise on matters relating to third age education;
.	 establish a steering group drawn from relevant Government departments to develop and implement a nationwide promotional campaign on the benefits of participation by older people in adult education.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying intent of this recommendation.
There are three avenues through which the intent of this recommendation will be addressed:
1. The Conference for Older Australians.
This is an advisory forum comprising distinguished older people established to advise the Commonwealth Government on its involvement in the International Year of Older Persons in 1999. The Conference will develop strategies to promote positive images of older people in the community and to provide advice on matters referred to it by, or through, the Minister for Family Services; and
2. The Healthy Ageing Task Force
This group comprises representatives from Commonwealth and State and Territory units on ageing, and was established by the Health and Community Services Ministers in October 1996. The Task Force has developed a draft National Healthy Ageing Strategy as a basis for consultations across jurisdictions and final agreement by Health and Community Services Ministers. Issues raised in this recommendation are also covered by the draft National Healthy Ageing Strategy.
Public consultations on the draft document are currently being undertaken by the Task Force. The Department of Health and Family Services is undertaking consultations with other Commonwealth agencies and national bodies.
3. The National Strategy for an Ageing Australia 

On 23 November 1997 the Minister for Family Services announced that the Federal Government will develop a National Strategy for an Ageing Australia as a vehicle to examine the broad policy issues created by population ageing and to provide a framework for activities already under way to improve the well being of Australians as they age.
It is envisaged that the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia will involve a whole of government consideration of the short, medium and long-term issues associated with population ageing to assist in the development of a broad ranging blueprint for action to address ageing in the
twenty-first century. The Strategy will build on the draft National Healthy Ageing strategy and the work being done by the Conference for Older Australians in relation to the 1999 International Year of Older Persons.
Recommendation 13:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth urge State and Territory education authorities to develop guidelines for the accessible and affordable use of public education facilities by bona fide, non-profit providers.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying purpose of this recommendation.
Much progress on this issue has already been made. Many universities provide access to a range of community-based ACE providers, as do some schools and Colleges of TAFE.
As State and Territory governments have responsibility for, and control of, schools and public VET institutions, while higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, the implications of this recommendation will have to be considered by them.
Recommendation 14:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth adopt ’learning and living in the third age' as its theme for the 1999 International Year of Older People.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth is considering this as an option for the International Year of Older People.
An advisory forum, the Conference for Older Australians, comprising representatives of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services and distinguished older people, has already been established to:
.	 advise the Commonwealth on its involvement in the International Year of Older Persons;
.	 develop strategies to promote positive images of older people in the community; and
.	 provide advice on matters referred to it by, or through, the Minister for Family Services. 

The Commonwealth will ask that consideration be given by the Conference for Older Australians to `learning and living in the third age' being adopted as the theme or one of the themes for the International Year of Older Persons.
Recommendation 15:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that any follow up to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) study on technological convergence, or any future national studies on education and technology, take into account the ACE sector.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying purpose of this recommendation.
Many national projects and studies on education and technology issues already consider the needs of the ACE sector.
Commonwealth and State Ministers of Education and Training have established the Open Learning Technology Corporation Ltd which provides services related to open learning for education and training providers, including ACE sector providers.
Under the Education Network Australia (EdNA) initiative, an electronic EdNA VET Directory has been designed and implemented. The Directory includes information on ACE. Additionally, an ACE Reference Group is assisting the EdNA VET Advisory Group to design a directory structure for a dedicated ACE section of the Directory.
Under the ACE National Programme in 1996/97, a research and development project on Convergent Technology in ACE was undertaken by the Adult, Community and Further Education Board in Victoria and the results were widely disseminated.
The National Policy on ACE, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, indirectly addresses this issue. For example, two of the outcomes linked to Strategic Objective 8 of the policy `Enhancing the flexibility of learning opportunities available to adults' are that:
.	 ACE practitioners have the capacity to make informed and appropriate decisions about the use of technology in meeting learning needs for individuals and groups in their community; and
.	 ACE providers have access to appropriate, affordable technology.
The Commonwealth will draw the attention of appropriate bodies such as the Open Learning Technology Corporation Ltd. and the Education Network Australia to this report and, in particular, this recommendation.
Recommendation 16:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the level of the Commonwealth's ACE Grants Program be 
 significantly increased and managed by the new NACVET Authority.
RESPONSE
As indicated in the response to Recommendations 2 and 3, the Commonwealth does not support the NACVET Authority element of this recommendation. Funding for ACE projects through ANTA is a matter for consideration in the annual Budget context.
Recommendation 17:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth seek a formal response to a draft of the revised National ACE Policy from key women's organisations such as the Network of Women in Further Education and from independent assessors with expertise in the analysis of gender issues.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying purpose of this proposal.
The new National Policy on ACE was finalised in May 1997 after consideration by the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE in early May 1997, and endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA. The National Policy has a strong focus on equity. For example:
.	 under `Vision' the Policy states:
-	 'ACE provision will be determined and shaped by the learning needs of communities across Australia to ensure that: people from all backgrounds and circumstances have equitable access to the knowledge, skills and understandings they need to participate fully in the economic, social and cultural life of the community';  and
.	 goal 3 `to strengthen the responsiveness of ACE to learners' (one of the three overall goals enunciated in the National Policy) addresses equity issues in detail:
-	 strategic objective 6 `fostering inclusiveness' (one of three strategic objectives for goal 3) states that fostering inclusiveness is `Ensuring that adults have equitable access to learning opportunities appropriate to their needs throughout life.';  and
-	 the outcomes linked to objective 6 (which provide a yardstick against which progress can be measured) draw specific attention to ensuring greater participation in ACE by disadvantaged groups and that equity principles are built into all ACE services.
In developing the new policy key stake holders from all States and Territories were involved in an extensive round of discussions, consultations and workshops.  

Recommendation 18:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the new NACVET Authority commission a study of best practice in relation to the delivery of adult education and training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders by community-based providers
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent on implementation of Recommendation 3, which the Commonwealth does not support.
The Commonwealth does, however, agree with the underlying purpose of this recommendation.
Relevant research is already being undertaken. $30,000 of the National ACE Programme funds administered by the Australian National Training Authority was allocated in 1997 for a study to develop guidelines for best practice and benchmarking for the delivery of ACE programmes to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.
This project, managed by the Federation of Independent Aboriginal Education Providers, aimed to investigate and clarify elements of best practice and benchmarking in Aboriginal controlled adult education. The project involved consultation with community controlled Aboriginal Education providers affiliated to the Federation and resulted in the development of guidelines for best practice and benchmarking. These guidelines will be made available to all providers of education and training to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.
Following completion of this project, the Commonwealth will ask the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE to consider whether follow-up research, funded from the National ACE Programme allocation, should be undertaken.
Recommendation 19:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth seek a formal input into the proposed new NACVET Policy from
.	 the Commonwealth Office of Disability, from the peak body National Industry Association for Disability Services [formerly ACROD], and from an independent assessor with expertise in disability issues; and
.	 the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia, and other relevant organisations concerned with educational opportunities for Australians with a first language other than English.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth supports the underlying principle of this recommendation, namely that, where appropriate, organisations such as the Commonwealth Office of Disability, peak disability groups and the Federation of Ethnic Community 
 Councils of Australia be consulted in the development of ACE policies that affect disadvantaged groups.The Commonwealth already recognises the potential of the ACE sector in meeting some of the needs of disadvantaged groups and will continue to consult with appropriate peak bodies and agencies in the development and implementation of policies that affect the disadvantaged.
Recommendation 20:
The Committee RECOMMENDS the re-establishment of the National Staff Development Committee under the new NACVET Authority. Its role should be expanded to address the professional development needs of teachers and administrators working in community-based ACE providers.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
Professional development activity such as that sponsored by the defunct National Staff Development Committee is now largely undertaken through the major Training Package developments funded by the Australian National Training Authority. Trainers, including community-based ACE providers, will be able to access this material when delivering programmes based on Training Packages.
The National Staff Development Committee was established during a period in which vocational education and training was delivered almost exclusively by TAFE Colleges and reflected nationally agreed strategies by governments to fulfil their responsibilities to develop their employees, the TAFE teachers. In a more diverse national VET system, it is appropriate now to provide professional development resources through the medium of Training Packages—available to all providers.
The Australian National Training Authority is also conducting other major projects addressing broad professional development needs in the Vocational Education and Training sector. Much of the material resulting from these projects will prove of assistance in addressing the professional development needs of ACE sector providers.
The improvement of teaching and other professional skills in the ACE sector is primarily a matter for employing authorities at the State and local level and has been addressed in the National ACE Policy adopted by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA.
Recommendation 21:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government support a national project to identify and develop standards for teaching and learning in community-based ACE settings in a manner similar to the national ACE Standards for Administrators and Managers. 

RESPONSE
The Commonwealth supports the underlying purpose of this recommendation and will refer it to MCEETYA for consideration. Maintaining and improving the standard of teaching and learning in all education and training environments remains an essential element in the Commonwealth's overall education policies and strategies.
Recommendation 22:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government send a ministerial level delegation to the Fifth International Conference on Adult Education in Hamburg comprising relevant officers of Commonwealth agencies, State education authorities and representatives of Australia's ACE sector.
RESPONSE
This recommendation was supported by the Commonwealth.
An Australian Government delegation led by a senior Commonwealth officer attended the conference, held in Hamburg from 14th to 18th July 1997. The conference addressed adult education issues of importance to all education and training sectors providing education and training to adults. The eight member delegation was comprised of:
.	 Mr Tony Greer, First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs' (DEETYA) Vocational Education and Training Division, who led the delegation;
.	 Ms Shelagh Whittleston, Counsellor for Labour, Education and Social Affairs (DEETYA's representative on the Australian Permanent Delegation to the OECD);
.	 Mr Jack Beetson, President of the Federation of Independent Aboriginal Education Providers (FIAEP);
.	 Commissioner David Curtis, a Commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC);
.	 Ms Sam Thomas, Director of the NSW Board of ACE and Chair of the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE (Ms Thomas represented the Taskforce on the delegation and was also MCEETYA's nominee to represent State and Territory government interests);
.	 Dr Alistair Crombie, Executive Secretary of the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education (AAACE);
.	 Professor Chris Duke, Deputy Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Western Sydney's Nepean Campus (nominated by the AVCC to represent the Higher Education sector); and  

.	 Ms Lesley Johnson, Principal Project Officer, Commonwealth State Relations, ANTA (nominated by ANTA to represent the VET sector).
The delegation played a successful role at the conference, the outcomes of which were favourable for Australia. For example:
.	 attendance of an official Australian Government delegation reaffirmed Australia's commitment to adult education and its deserved international reputation in this area;
.	 the invitation to Mr Greer to participate on the drafting committee was a clear acknowledgment of Australia's expertise and reputation; and
.	 the leading role played by the delegation in ensuring that Indigenous education issues were reflected in the Declaration  and Agenda for the Future  was particularly commended by other conference participants. A copy of the Declaration  and Agenda for the Future  is provided at Attachment B1 to this Response.
Recommendation 23:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government:
.	 undertake a precise analysis and costing of the public education activities of government departments and agencies;
.	 convene a national workshop of key government departments, information agencies and representatives of the ACE sector to explore public education practice, and the implications for more effective and coordinated delivery of Commonwealth public education programs.
RESPONSE
Public education or awareness campaigns undertaken by Commonwealth Departments and agencies are an essential element in implementing Government policy on a wide range of issues affecting all portfolios.
The Commonwealth acknowledges that community-based providers of ACE may often be well placed to assist in the development of public education/awareness campaigns. For example, the Australian Electoral Commission has utilised a range of adult and community education providers to assist in the delivery of both long-term and short-term public education and information initiatives.
Many campaigns such as national public health awareness campaigns are undertaken in conjunction with State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments also undertake public education or awareness activities independently of the Commonwealth. Consequently, the recommendation to `undertake a precise analysis and costing of the public education activities of government departments and agencies' raises issues that should 
 also be considered by State and Territory governments.
The Commonwealth also believes that the complexities involved in undertaking a precise analysis and costing of public education activities could mean that the costs involved may outweigh the benefits obtained. Additionally, project management practices already require Commonwealth Departments and agencies to analyse the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of such campaigns.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Committees,26,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-27,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is the government's response to the Senate Employment, Education and Training report titled Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society.  Yet again, I note that this government response is almost a year overdue, and I might begin my comments with the observation of just how disappointing it is that the government has taken so long to produce a report which effectively says so little. It is a disappointment to me, and not just to me, I suspect, but to the 400,000-odd Australians who are currently involved with the adult and community education sector in this country.
The report Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society was the second report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee. The word `Cinderella' in this context refers to the fact that this particular sector, although it involves such a very large number of Australians, is treated badly by all levels in government. It is regarded as the poor relation of the education industry in this country.
Despite the fact that some 400,000 people participate in the various programs run by the adult and community education sector, the Commonwealth expends about $685,000 a year—in 1997-98 it spent about that amount of money—through the various international programs. Of that amount, about $185,000 goes to the peak body, the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education. Additional moneys are provided through the National Centre for Vocational Education Research and some assistance is provided through a tutor task force on adult and community education. DEETYA does do some very limited work in this area.
As the committee report itself observes, what is frustrating is that everybody involved in the education debate in this country acknowledges the worth of the adult and community education sector. Everybody will tell you just how worthy these organisations are and the importance of the work that they are undertaking. Again and again the concepts of lifelong learning of all types are acknowledged in the official reports of government in terms of the benefits provided. This report here today acknowledges again the importance of lifelong learning as a principle. It is also indicated by the national vocational education strategy documents that have been developed over the years by governments at all levels. The various Australian national training authority officials will come before the Senate and equally explain how important this sector is. But what we see again and again is that that is about as far as it goes.
Very limited sums of money are provided. As I said, $185,000 through ANTA is an appallingly small amount of money given the significance of this area of education. We spend something like $3 billion a year on public education for the vocational education and training sector in terms of TAFE and various other measures, but a very small amount of that $3 billion actually finds its way towards this particular sector.
The recent ministerial council, held on 22 May, on the national strategy for vocational education and training for the period 1998 to 2003 also identified the worth of the adult and community education sector. But no commitments have been made and no priorities have been established to ensure that adequate levels of funding are provided for people who undertake this work and who provide what are extremely important facilities to many of our older Australians. Mature aged people who are seeking entry back into the education system and a second chance, people who have not been able to enjoy the benefits of a formal educational setting through the primary and secondary education system, those seeking English as a second language programs, those seeking self-fulfilment and enrichment programs and all of those people who enjoy enormous benefit 
 through the adult community education system do not have access to adequate levels of public support, despite all the pious remarks that are made by governments.
The essential problem is demonstrated again in this government's response, which says, `This is not our worry, this is somebody else's problem. We are going to get a big mirror and have a good look into it yet again, but we are not actually going to do anything about it. We are going to shunt this problem off to the states to deal with.' These are national issues of national concern and matters that require a national response.
What we really have is a fundamental problem that exists within the government's thinking about the relationship between education and training. The fundamental problem that arises is the confusion that exists between the priority that should be given to what are narrowly defined as vocational programs and the broader concerns about the importance of providing lifelong learning and the wherewithal to ensure that education allows for the effective participation of all citizens through the formal and informal educational systems that do exist, to ensure that there is effective citizenship and that people have the opportunity to maximise their personal goals, and to ensure that they can develop the skills to allow them to operate at the highest level of participation, both in the world of work and in society more generally.
We have a failure to build the necessary infrastructure through community organisations and through our formal educational systems, be they TAFE or schools, to ensure that there is an opportunity to build creative, productive and socially satisfying relationships that will lead to people securing the necessary skills, habits of thought and ways of looking at the world that will allow them to achieve those objectives. There is a fundamental problem in so far as the government has failed to acknowledge the importance of this sector by putting its money where its mouth is. What this report demonstrates to the Senate yet again is that this failure will continue.
What we on the committee argued for was that a more comprehensive national approach 
 be taken to the adult and community education sector that acknowledged just how important it was for this society to provide the wherewithal, through the adult and community education facilities that are available, to provide at minimum cost the opportunity for in excess of 400,000 Australians every year to secure outcomes that allow them to achieve full participation. This is a consideration that goes beyond a more narrow vision of vocational education and is obviously wanting in all aspects.
It is a simple fundamental fact of life that in Victoria and a few other states there is a commitment—and I acknowledge this in terms of the Kennett government; these are measures that have continued since our time in government—with the particular acts of parliament, to ensure that there is protection for the adult and community education sector. But it does not happen too often. It has happened because of the forwarding thinking of the Labor government in the 1980s.
What you have are the simple facts such as the failure to acknowledge just how much money is actually spent by all governments on this particular sector of education. There is no reliable statistical basis to identify what the unit cost of education is in this particular sector. There is simply not the attention given to the adult and community education sector that would allow us to develop this in a more effective manner than currently exists. I must say that I am deeply disappointed with this response.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-27,"—I rise to speak on this report on adult and community education. This is the second report to the Senate this decade. The adult and community education issue is something that the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee has taken a great interest in through the 1990s. In 1991, we brought down the landmark Come in Cinderella  report. That was the very first report we did on a sector of education which has contributed an enormous amount to education in this country.
The adult and community education sector is the so-called fourth sector of education—the first being primary, the second being 
 secondary and the third being tertiary, university and TAFE. What a lot of people do not realise is the actual massive size of this sector. For example, in the state of New South Wales, there are a million people doing adult and community education courses of some description. There are more students at any one point in time in adult and community education than in the universities and TAFEs put together. The difference, of course, is that these are not three- or four-year long courses. A lot of adult and community education courses are quite short. They might go for a few months or they might even go just for a few weeks. But they are very important components in learning, and they do an enormous amount for education in this country and for the community generally.
People pick up very critical and important skills not only for their lives in general but often these are little building bridges towards other levels of education. A lot of people, particularly those who have experienced failure in the primary and secondary system and do not want to go anywhere near a university or a TAFE because of that, often gain confidence by spending time in one of these short courses and then going on to higher education. It is the most cost effective sector of education. Quite often courses are run on shoestring budgets and with a lot of dedicated people assisting. It covers a very wide range of areas in the community, and during our inquiries in 1991 and 1997 we went and saw this. We went to diverse places. We went into rural areas, migrant communities, mental hospitals and prisons, and adult and community education had a very major role in these areas.
In terms of the response to the reports by governments, it is interesting to see how this has changed over the years. In 1991, the view initially was that adult and community education was something that should be handled at a regional or state level and the federal government should not get very involved at all. In the very first report, Come in Cinderella, there were 33 recommendations to the committee and the last Labor government only ever implemented 11, and they did not put very much money into it either.
—Which is a lot more than what your government is going to do.
—As a matter of fact, the last Labor government set up an office relating to adult and community education in the federal bureaucracy, and during one estimates hearing, Senator Carr—I do not know if you were in the Senate at that time—I asked a question on it and they looked around for the officers to answer and they could not find them. The minister at the desk at the time was Senator Schacht, I think, and he said, `Gee, have we actually lost a whole division?' That whole division was the equivalent of about one or two people.
So let's get it in perspective, Senator Carr. When you criticise this government about what we are doing in response to the report, let's look at what your government did in response, which was very little indeed. You instituted a number of new measures, brought it in a new direction and did start to put a federal focus, and given that today you have paid tribute to Jeff Kennett and the work he has done in this area in Victoria, I will also pay tribute to that start you made. But let's be serious about it, Senator Carr—you did not really put many resources into it at all.
We come to the report that we are dealing with today. I suppose the disappointing thing, looking back on the approach of the committee, was that we were moving towards saying that the whole thing was a matter of reorganising the bureaucracy. I regret that we actually took that approach. I thought, having developed a very good report the first time and having started off in a new direction, that we should have extended that a little bit further rather than just putting bits of bureaucracy together.
I think the hope for people in adult and community education is in the way in which the job market structure is changing at the moment and the way in which intensive assistance works in the FLEX 3 where people can, as part of intensive assistance, get extra education and training. They do not have to go to the TAFEs or the universities; they can actually go to adult and community education providers if that is appropriate. These are very effective providers. They are very cost-effec 
 tive providers. I am sure that, under this new regime that this government has set up, the adult and community education sector which is flourishing will continue to flourish.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Committees,26,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I would like to make some comments about this report. First of all, it is very disappointing that we had a unanimous report from our committee that has been so significantly dumped on by the government in this response. I think it is insufficient for Senator Tierney to say that we made recommendations for more bureaucracy and nothing else. That is certainly not the case. I think anybody in the Senate would acknowledge Senator Tierney's commitment to adult and community education. I would like it if sometimes he practised something of the same kind of generosity and acknowledged the initiatives of the Labor government to get adult and community education onto the political agenda at all.
The whole point of this report was that, given that adult and community education was on the political agenda, and given that there had been a very significant report, the Cinderella report from Senator Tierney and his committee, five years down the track we should have a look and see what was happening. You would have thought that the government would have been assisted in the whole approach to adult and community education by our reflecting on the state of play. The Labor government, in supporting adult and community education, particularly focused on the vocational education training end of adult and community education. This report was saying, very importantly, but you have forgotten one large part of adult and community education, and we want to recommend that it not be overlooked.
There are a number of reasons why. My colleagues have spoken about it, and the report spells out the importance of adult and community education for people who missed out the first time through in education, for people who got through school without being able to read and write, for people who went through school and now need to upgrade their skills. Their education was all right for them when they left school but it is no longer 
 appropriate. We hear again and again of the importance of education for employment these days. Many people are able, with adult and community education, to come back and access education in a very affordable and accessible way.
We think this is a critical part of adult and community education. We know its importance, we know its success. It is hugely welcomed by the community and very largely participated in. Our report stressed the importance of it, and this government has chosen to give a big flick to the majority of this report. I find that very depressing. In particular, the committee was interested to note that people from western suburbs and people from lower socioeconomic areas of the country were much less likely to access adult and community education than people from better off areas and from the eastern suburbs.
Secondly, a very large number of participants were women, far more than men. It would be interesting if the government had picked up on our drawing this to their attention, by saying that we think adult and community education should have a universal application and accessibility. So will you please find out why it is that men, and particularly men from working class or lower socioeconomic areas, are not making the same access and use of adult community education as others. It is a very important point.
For some of my colleagues age has begun to weary us, and it is important that we recognise another very important point from this report: that is, the importance of continuing intellectual activity of adult and community education for preventing the onset of Alzheimers. I am not at all sure that this is proven yet, but there is some nicely documented evidence that if you do your daily crossword and regularly play bridge you can hold off the onset of senility.
—And eat Freddo Frogs.
—I am not at all sure what contribution that makes to this discussion, but I take it that it is meant well. It may be that we do not necessarily have to play bridge and do the daily crossword, but it is very interesting.
The evidence brought to the committee is quite clear, and it is of great concern to us that, as more and more Australians are going to live to a ripe old age, it is important that more and more of those Australians feel as though they have something useful to do with their lives, something to contribute to the community. One of the best ways they feel that they can participate, keep up with events going on in their community, interest themselves in whatever, is if they have access to adult and community education. I note that the government is somewhat grudging but at least a bit sympathetic to the notion that we should look at the impact in terms of health, particularly the health dollar costs, of the points that I have made.
People may smile and say, `We are not sure that it is true about bridge and the daily crossword,' but we do know that the relationship between intellectual activity and good health is an issue that is beginning to be addressed. I do appreciate that this point has been taken up. The trouble is that it does give weight to the notion of adult and community education being something for old people to do to keep themselves gainfully distracted. That is not what adult and community education is about at all. I certainly hope that because of this report, through its support at least of that recommendation, the Commonwealth will establish a dedicated research program to examine this. I am not sure that they will do that, but they are certainly going to look at the connection between health and intellectual activity. I would hate this to be taken as any way skewing adult and community education to old people and the basket weavers in our community. It does no credit to what adult and community education is about.
I am disappointed that there was no support for the recommendation regarding the capital needs of adult and community centres, particularly those in the neighbourhoods and in the community. One of our recommendations says that we would like to see educational facilities like schools more available for use by other community groups, and adult and community education might be an entirely appropriate group to use such facilities. 
 However, we also know that not all community groups can move or want to move. They are differently accessible for people, and I am very disappointed that the government sees no need to try to support the capital needs of community and neighbourhood adult and community education centres, in particular, that of supplying a computer. The government has a lot of requirements in terms of data and reporting back but no appreciation that to provide that kind of data centres will need the assistance of some capital money, in particular, for a computer.
The final point I wish to make is the overwhelming rejection of this report. That has to be a disappointment for all of us but, I would have thought, particularly for those government colleagues who have actually been belted out of court by their own government.
I find it particularly disappointing that, in rejecting the principal recommendations, the government points out that there is a significant difference between ACE and VET. The whole raison d'etre of this report was to say that we recognise that, in picking up adult and community education, the previous government had done that very well, but the focus and the large amount of money had gone to the vocational end and ignored, or somewhat minimally supported, the ACE end. The whole report was about putting those two together, but the government sees fit to continue the separation. In particular, they go on to say:
Anyhow under the new labour market assistance there is a potential for a new role to ACE. ACE providers will be able to become contracted employment placement enterprises in their own right and/or provide labour market training to the clients of employment placement enterprises (EPEs) and that meet the specific requirements of the EPE and its client.
We have heard already of the unmitigated shambles called the establishment of the new Job Network under this government. There are thousands of community organisations possessing previously gained expertise and skills that have been totally disregarded. Why anyone would think that an undercapitalised community centre for adult and community education might now be able to leap in to become a contracted employment placement 
 enterprise without that backup and support is, I think, drawing a very long bow or, in fact, sheer folly.
While I would hope that people who attend any such centres may be able to get assistance with their employment, the suggestion that you can reject the thrust of our report by suggesting that adult and community education centres become employment placement enterprises is unlikely to happen. And it completely misses the point of why we reviewed adult and community education with the Come in Cinderella report. What it means, of course, is that this task remains for the return of a Labor government.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title>",Committees,26,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-05-27,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society . I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society
PREAMBLE
The Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee: Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society,  which documents developments in Adult and Community Education (ACE) in Australia since its earlier report in 1991 and makes recommendations for future development of the ACE sector. This report will prove to be a valuable resource document for governments, organisations, institutions, educators and individuals.
The release of this report follows the release of the new National Policy on Adult and Community Education, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA). Both the report and the new National Policy will contribute significantly to promoting and advancing ACE nationally.
State and Territory governments have primary responsibility for the ACE sector. The Commonwealth's role is primarily policy advisory. Consequently, many of the recommendations will require consideration by State and Territory governments.
Commonwealth support for the sector is manifested in a number of ways, including:
.	 Commonwealth funding for the Adult and Community Education Programme administered by the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA), which provides significant support for: research into ACE; activities such as Adult Learners Week designed to promote the sector; and the continuation of the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education's role as the peak body representing the sector; 

.	 at the discretion of State and Territory governments, access by ACE providers to funds for Vocational Education and Training (VET) provided by the Commonwealth through ANTA to the States and Territories;
.	 the new labour market assistance arrangements funded through the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) under which contracted organisations are free to choose the type of assistance, including training, they see as necessary to get a jobseeker a job. These arrangements create a valuable opportunity for ACE providers to market their services to the contracted providers and expand their current involvement in the training of job seekers; and
.	 the Commonwealth's representation on the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE.
The Commonwealth, in considering its role in ACE, must take into account its overall role in, and responsibility for, all aspects of education and training. In this context the Commonwealth's deliberations must be conditioned by two key factors:
.	 the level of budgetary support the Commonwealth can provide for education and training activities across the full spectrum of education and training; and
.	 the most appropriate balance for the distribution of available Commonwealth resources across the various education and training sectors.
The way in which the recommendations contained in the report `Beyond Cinderella: Towards a learning society ' have been formulated has presented some difficulties in responding to the report. The two key recommendations are:
.	 Recommendation 2, which calls for a combined National ACE/VET policy; and
.	 Recommendation 3, which calls for the replacement of ANTA by a new body, the National Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training Authority (NACVETA).
Recommendations 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 and 20 are subsequently formulated in a way that makes them dependent upon acceptance, and implementation, of Recommendations 2 and 3.
In response, the Government has chosen to respond to the underlying intent of these recommendations, rather than simply in the context of their dependence on Recommendations 2 and 3, which the Government does not support. This allows for the important underlying issues raised by these recommendations to be considered in the Government's response, regardless of its position on Recommendations 2 and 3. 

RESPONSES TO INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government:
.	 make an unequivocal commitment to the concept of lifelong learning and the promotion of a learning society; and
.	 imbue its education policies and associated funding mechanisms with the values and principles of lifelong learning for all Australians.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth supports this recommendation.
The pace of technological and structural change has made it increasingly necessary for individuals to participate in further education and training on a regular basis if they are to acquire, maintain and enhance the skills necessary to participate effectively and fully in the labour market and other areas of society.
Consequently, over the past decade or so, governments in Australia and overseas have come to recognise that the traditional pattern of full-time education and training followed by a working career in which further education and training play a minimal role will no longer meet the needs of all individuals in modern industrialised societies. The Commonwealth's response has been to develop and implement education and training policies within the overall context of a growing need for lifelong learning.
Commonwealth policies and initiatives now in place that promote and advance the concept of life-long learning include:
.	 a schools literacy and numeracy strategy that will ensure that students acquire the basic literacy and numeracy skills necessary for effective participation in the labour market and/or post-school education and training;
.	 initiatives in vocational education and training, such as refinements to the New Apprenticeship system, and reformed labour market assistance arrangements which will maximise access to appropriate post-school education and training for school-leavers, adults and the unemployed;
.	 providing an increasingly demand driven system where end-users have an effective say in determining the content and delivery of courses and a wider choice of provider;
.	 enabling individuals to move more easily across the various education and training sectors; and
.	 enabling individuals to gain formal recognition of skills acquired in informal contexts. 

These initiatives are making participation in further education and training a more flexible, attractive and viable option for Australians.
The National Strategy for VET developed in 1994 identifies the creation and promotion of lifelong learning  as a priority for VET.Similarly the National Policy for ACE, adopted by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA stresses the importance of meeting the lifelong learning needs of adults and fostering a culture of learning in Australian society and organisations. For example, under Strategic Outcome 3 `Promoting ACE' outcome 3.1 states:
.		 'Governments, communities, industry and other education sectors increasingly recognise the role of ACE as an important agent of lifelong learning.'
Recommendation 2:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth Government bring together the National ACE Policy and National VET Policy to establish an integrated  National Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training (NACVET) Policy   giving effect to the commitment to lifelong learning.
Recommendation 3:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that, in order to implement, monitor and fund the new  NACVET Policy  the Commonwealth government restructure ANTA to establish the  National Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training Authority (NACVETA ).  The membership of the Authority's Board will be modified to ensure that an adequate ACE perspective is available to the Authority, and the way in which the Authority distributes its funds should reflect its revised charter.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support these recommendations.
The Commonwealth's main priority in relation to lifelong learning is to ensure that Australians have the skills and flexibility needed to meet the challenges of continuing technological and structural change, and to compete effectively in an increasingly globalised economic environment.
The ACE sector and the VET sector have distinct and mainly separate purposes which are reflected in a largely government responsibility for VET while ACE has developed largely from community impetus. Where there is an overlap of purpose, very good arrangements for cooperation have been developed, and as noted above there is strong support from government for ACE through the National ACE policy. Combining the two sectors as recommended in the Report would tend to undermine the primary objectives of each and 
 detract from Commonwealth Government efforts to improve the vocational prospects of school leavers.
Under the new arrangements for labour market assistance, there is potentially a new role for ACE. ACE providers will be able to become contracted Employment Placement Enterprises in their own right, and/or provide labour market training to the clients of Employment Placement Enterprises (EPEs) that meets the specific requirements of the EPE and its client.
Revised ANTA Agreement
The Commonwealth government has recently settled a revised ANTA Agreement with State and Territory Ministers for submission to respective State and Territory Cabinets for approval. The revised Agreement commits the Commonwealth to maintain funding in real terms for the life of the revised Agreement (1998—2000) and the States and Territories to achieve growth from efficiencies. The revised Agreement continues to cover vocational education and training separately from ACE. Work is also under way on a new National Strategy for VET to provide the framework for the States, Territories and ANTA to achieve the objectives of the revised Agreement.
Recommendation 4:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the new  NACVET Authority  report annually to the Australian Parliament on the achievement of policy outcomes.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation, which is dependent upon implementation of Recommendations 2 and 3 above which the Commonwealth does not support.
The National Policy on ACE, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, contains specific processes for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on progress under each of the National Goals of the policy. These processes include:
.	 an annual report to MCEETYA (reports from each State and Territory against the National Goals and Outcomes will form the basis of the annual report);
.	 regular monitoring of progress at the National, State and Territory level by MCEETYA through its ACE Taskforce;
.	 a mid-term review 18 months after endorsement of the policy (ie by end 1998); and
.	 a further review in the year 2000 to determine the degree of success in achieving outcomes and to determine future strategic directions and goals.
Recommendation 5
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government negotiate with the 
 States and Territories a set of  Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training (ACVET) Agreements .  These Agreements will require each State and Territory to develop  Adult Community and Vocational Education and Training (ACVET) Profile  consistent with the National Policy.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
To the extent that ACE providers deliver publicly funded VET courses, they are already included in the State's Annual VET Plans negotiated between ANTA and States/Territories.From 1998 these plans will be more strategic and outcomes focussed and performance will be measured against agreed Annual National Priorities. The ANTA Ministerial Council has already agreed to the priorities for 1998.
Recommendation 6:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that:
.	 in order to be eligible for Commonwealth funds, providers be registered as a quality provider with a State or Territory Education and Training Authority;
.	 registration be based on providers meeting standards of quality set by the relevant industry, professional or educational association;
.	 three broad categories of providers be registered as follows:
Category A	 Specific Industry Education & Training
Category B	 Non-specific Industry Education & Training
Category C	 General Education & Training
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
In many instances, access to Commonwealth funds should be contingent upon the provision of accredited training, as is the case with VET funding, not simply that provided by a registered provider of training.
The proposal to make it an essential requirement for eligibility for Commonwealth funds that providers be registered is too restrictive. It has the potential to restrict the flexibility required to best accommodate the education and training needs of Australians.
For example, under the labour market assistance arrangements, contracted organisations are free to choose the type of labour market assistance, including training, they see as necessary to place job seekers in a job. The contracted organisations are also free to choose what they view as the most appropriate form of training, regardless of whether 
 it is accredited and/or provided by a registered training provider. This flexibility is an essential element of the arrangements. Registration of training providers would not add to this flexibility and would have an unfavourable effect on the operation of the labour market assistance arrangements. The Commonwealth could not administer such a registration scheme for the purposes of the labour market assistance arrangements.
The Commonwealth is already addressing key issues related to registration requirements and associated quality and recognition issues. For example, the National Training Framework for VET agreed by the ANTA Ministerial Council will include streamlined, quality assured training provider registration arrangements. In particular the Australian Recognition Framework was implemented from 1 January 1998 and provides for the mutual recognition of training organisations and the qualifications issued by those organisations.
The aim of the National Training Framework is to produce flexible quality training outcomes with a national qualifications outcome.
ACE providers who wish to become VET Registered Training Organisations can use the flexibility of this new approach to develop training programmes which are responsive to their clients' needs. The Commonwealth has reservations about the proposal for the registration of three broad categories of providers:
.	 effective criteria for distinguishing between these categories would be extremely difficult to develop;
.	 there would be considerable difficulties in applying the distinctions; and
.	 implementation of the proposed distinctions would have significant effects on the current classification of courses, adding further complexity to already complex classification issues.
The Commonwealth believes that when ACE providers wish to access Commonwealth funding they should do so in the context of arrangements that have been put in place for the provision of various forms of training. For example:
.	 to access VET funding they should meet the appropriate VET registration arrangements; and
.	 to access funding under the new arrangements for labour market assistance, they should either:
-	 seek to become contracted Employment Placement Enterprises in their own right; and/or
-	 provide labour market training to the clients of Employment Placement Enterprises (EPEs) that meets the specific requirements of the EPE and its client. 

Implementation of the National Policy on ACE, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, will address some of the underlying issues involved in this recommendation. For example, outcomes linked to Strategic Objective 5 of the policy `Enhancing the contribution of ACE to the world of work' state that:
.	 Increasing numbers of ACE providers will be registered to deliver accredited programmes;
.	 ACE providers will be increasingly able to compete in the open training market; and
.	 ACE will play a greater role in training for local and regional labour markets.
Recommendation 7:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that a  National ACVET Equity Fund  be established under the new  NACVET Authority  to target groups currently under-represented in education and training.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent upon implementation of Recommendation 3, which the Commonwealth does not support.
Existing Commonwealth policies already recognise the need for disadvantaged groups to have equitable access to education and training opportunities, and numerous initiatives are already in place to improve access to and participation in education and training by disadvantaged groups.The participation of disadvantaged groups in the Government's new labour market assistance arrangements will be monitored to ensure that the relative representation of disadvantaged groups in labour market assistance is maintained.
ANTA has a number of projects under way to address the needs of identified client groups, to improve their access to and participation in training and to enhance the quality of outcomes for them within the national VET system.
A new National Strategy for VET is currently being developed by ANTA in collaboration with the Commonwealth, States, Territories and industry. The strategy will provide a framework for planning and determining major directions for the training system. It will be developed around five key objectives, one of which is achieving equitable outcomes in VET.
States and Territories are responsible for delivery and administration of VET under ANTA arrangements and have funded a range of initiatives to assist disadvantaged people. States and Territories report progress against the National Strategy.
The Authority has developed, in consultation with advisory groups, a number of strategies to achieve access and equity in vocational education and 
 training, which are described in  Equity 2001  released by ANTA in September 1996.
In the development of specific strategies to achieve significant improvements in access and equity, ANTA seeks advice from advisory groups (such as the Disability Forum and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' Training Advisory Council) which include, among their members, representatives who bring community education views to this consultation process.
The National Policy on ACE endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA has a strong focus on equity. For example:
.	 under `Vision' the Policy states:
-	 'ACE provision will be determined and shaped by the learning needs of communities across Australia to ensure that: people from all backgrounds and circumstances have equitable access to the knowledge, skills and understandings they need to participate fully in the economic, social and cultural life of the community';  and
.	 goal 3 `to strengthen the responsiveness of ACE to learners' (one of the three overall goals enunciated in the National Policy) addresses equity issues in detail:
-	 strategic objective 6 `fostering inclusiveness' (one of three strategic objectives for goal 3) states that fostering inclusiveness is `Ensuring that adults have equitable access to learning opportunities appropriate to their needs throughout life.';  and
-	 the outcomes linked to objective 6 (which provide a yardstick against which progress can be measured) draw specific attention to ensuring greater participation in ACE by disadvantaged groups and that equity principles are built into all ACE services.
The endorsement by State and Territory governments of the National Policy on ACE, ensures that, in their strategies designed to achieve the goals and objectives of the policy, States and Territories will give due weight to mechanisms for improving equity outcomes.ACE providers have an important role in the provision of learning opportunities for the more disadvantaged groups in the community. The work of ACE with women, rural and isolated communities and Indigenous Australians is of particular importance in increasing access to education and training. Funding for these groups is an issue for the States and Territories to be determined within the ACE funding context.
Recommendation 8:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government 

.	 give priority to the infrastructure and capital requirements of community-based providers of ACE;
.	 require that State and Territory governments assist community-based ACE providers to meet the costs of becoming registered providers; and
.	 require that ACE providers have formal representation within the State and Territory  ACVET Profile  processes.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
In relation to the first two points of the recommendation, these are matters for consideration by State and Territory governments, which have primary responsibility for ACE.
The Commonwealth is, however, aware that many community based ACE providers have difficulty in raising capital for infrastructure and other needs. It is also aware that that there is a large stock of publicly funded school, VET and higher education buildings and infrastructure which is currently not made available to other than public providers. Increased access to those facilities could be an important element in meeting the infrastructure needs of the ACE sector.
Much progress on ACE access to this infrastructure has already been made. Many universities provide access to a range of community-based ACE providers, as do some schools and Colleges of TAFE.
As State and Territory governments have responsibility for, and control of, schools and public VET institutions, while higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, the implications of this recommendation will have to be considered by them.
The registration of training providers is a quality assurance process that benefits both the provider and the client. In any consideration of the proposal that ACE providers receive assistance to meet the costs of registration, the implications in relation to national competition policy would need to be considered.
The Commonwealth will suggest that MCEETYA give further consideration to the underlying issues raised by the first two elements of this recommendation.
As noted under Recommendation 5 above, ACVET Profiles are not supported by the Commonwealth.
Recommendation 9:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that, where they have not done so, States and Territories report on the delivery by ACE providers of both accredited and non-accredited programmes as part of the State and Territory  ACVET Profile  processes. 

RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent upon implementation of recommendation 5, which the Commonwealth does not support.
The Commonwealth does however agree with the underlying intention of this recommendation, namely that there should be some mechanism for the collection of statistics on both accredited and non-accredited courses/programmes delivered by ACE providers.
A number of measures are already in place for the collection of data on ACE activity.
The implementation of the Australian Vocational Education and Training Management Information and Statistical Standard (AVETMISS) was agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers in 1992. It was also agreed to include adult and community education data from 1995. The Standard was designed to limit the volume of information required from these providers, in comparison to the information required from TAFE providers.
For this purpose, an ACE Statistical Collection Taskforce was established. The Taskforce included representatives of adult and community education providers. The inclusion of all activity by recognised ACE providers, both vocational and recreational, accredited and non accredited, was aimed to facilitate the measurement of the role of adult and community education providers in the VET sector.
Also, as noted under Recommendation 4 above, the National Policy on ACE contains specific processes for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on progress under each of the National Goals of the policy. These processes may well involve reporting on the delivery by ACE providers of both accredited and non-accredited programmes.
Recommendation 10:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the new NACVET Authority review its guidelines for competitive tendering in order (a) to incorporate selection criteria which encourage collaborative tenders, and (b) to require the specification of clear performance indicators in tender documentation.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent on implementation of Recommendation 3, which the Commonwealth does not support.
States and Territories have responsibility for allocating Commonwealth funding for VET distributed to them through the Australian National Training Authority. ANTA does not require States and Territories to provide information on their arrangements for competitive tendering. However, particularly where there are strong links between ACE and VET systems (such as in NSW where 
 cooperative and collaborative arrangements are well established) collaborative tenders are already encouraged. The ACE sector's strengths in providing programmes for some under-represented groups have been recognised in this context.
Wherever appropriate, ANTA uses public tendering processes for research activity, and collaborative tenders which bring together organisations with different strengths. Selection criteria usually include demonstrated knowledge of the VET sector, and as ACE sector organisations become more familiar with the development of the national VET system, they will be in a better position to develop collaborative tenders with other organisations.
The Commonwealth recognises that, for some services put out to tender, it would be appropriate to encourage collaboration among tenderers. We would expect that it is now standard practice at all levels of government in Australia to include clear performance indicators in tender documentation.
Recommendation 11:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government establish a dedicated research program to examine the relationship between intellectual activity and good health, and the ways in which that relationship might be enhanced.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying intent of this recommendation.
The relationship between intellectual activity and good health is an issue that is beginning to be addressed in Australia and overseas in the context of the pressures placed on governments by the ageing of populations. A number of Commonwealth funded projects have already examined issues relating to the relationship between intellectual activity and health.
The findings of both the Action Research Programme and Community Network Pilot elements of the Commonwealth Department of Social Security's Community Research Project provide qualitative evidence of a positive link between physical and intellectual engagement in community based activities, social capital, personal well being and the subjective elements of good health. Such links are being specifically investigated in the Health Development and Social Capital project funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and being undertaken by the South Australian Community Health Research Unit.
Results from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health will also have the capacity to inform decisions about the relationship between intellectual activity and good health. As the research participants involved in the Longitudinal Study are followed over time, more information 
 will become available to examine this relationship and the factors that affect it.
As a result of the findings from this and other research, some programmes for older people and mental health initiatives implemented by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services already take into account the relationship between intellectual activity and good health.
Recommendation 12:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government:
.	 commission a report on best practice in (a) the provision of pre-retirement education, and (b) in adult education programs targeting older Australians living in institutional or retirement village settings;
.	 draw together a coalition of peak senior citizens groups and adult education organisations to advise on matters relating to third age education;
.	 establish a steering group drawn from relevant Government departments to develop and implement a nationwide promotional campaign on the benefits of participation by older people in adult education.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying intent of this recommendation.
There are three avenues through which the intent of this recommendation will be addressed:
1. The Conference for Older Australians.
This is an advisory forum comprising distinguished older people established to advise the Commonwealth Government on its involvement in the International Year of Older Persons in 1999. The Conference will develop strategies to promote positive images of older people in the community and to provide advice on matters referred to it by, or through, the Minister for Family Services; and
2. The Healthy Ageing Task Force
This group comprises representatives from Commonwealth and State and Territory units on ageing, and was established by the Health and Community Services Ministers in October 1996. The Task Force has developed a draft National Healthy Ageing Strategy as a basis for consultations across jurisdictions and final agreement by Health and Community Services Ministers. Issues raised in this recommendation are also covered by the draft National Healthy Ageing Strategy.
Public consultations on the draft document are currently being undertaken by the Task Force. The Department of Health and Family Services is undertaking consultations with other Commonwealth agencies and national bodies.
3. The National Strategy for an Ageing Australia 

On 23 November 1997 the Minister for Family Services announced that the Federal Government will develop a National Strategy for an Ageing Australia as a vehicle to examine the broad policy issues created by population ageing and to provide a framework for activities already under way to improve the well being of Australians as they age.
It is envisaged that the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia will involve a whole of government consideration of the short, medium and long-term issues associated with population ageing to assist in the development of a broad ranging blueprint for action to address ageing in the
twenty-first century. The Strategy will build on the draft National Healthy Ageing strategy and the work being done by the Conference for Older Australians in relation to the 1999 International Year of Older Persons.
Recommendation 13:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth urge State and Territory education authorities to develop guidelines for the accessible and affordable use of public education facilities by bona fide, non-profit providers.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying purpose of this recommendation.
Much progress on this issue has already been made. Many universities provide access to a range of community-based ACE providers, as do some schools and Colleges of TAFE.
As State and Territory governments have responsibility for, and control of, schools and public VET institutions, while higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, the implications of this recommendation will have to be considered by them.
Recommendation 14:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth adopt ’learning and living in the third age' as its theme for the 1999 International Year of Older People.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth is considering this as an option for the International Year of Older People.
An advisory forum, the Conference for Older Australians, comprising representatives of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services and distinguished older people, has already been established to:
.	 advise the Commonwealth on its involvement in the International Year of Older Persons;
.	 develop strategies to promote positive images of older people in the community; and
.	 provide advice on matters referred to it by, or through, the Minister for Family Services. 

The Commonwealth will ask that consideration be given by the Conference for Older Australians to `learning and living in the third age' being adopted as the theme or one of the themes for the International Year of Older Persons.
Recommendation 15:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that any follow up to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) study on technological convergence, or any future national studies on education and technology, take into account the ACE sector.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying purpose of this recommendation.
Many national projects and studies on education and technology issues already consider the needs of the ACE sector.
Commonwealth and State Ministers of Education and Training have established the Open Learning Technology Corporation Ltd which provides services related to open learning for education and training providers, including ACE sector providers.
Under the Education Network Australia (EdNA) initiative, an electronic EdNA VET Directory has been designed and implemented. The Directory includes information on ACE. Additionally, an ACE Reference Group is assisting the EdNA VET Advisory Group to design a directory structure for a dedicated ACE section of the Directory.
Under the ACE National Programme in 1996/97, a research and development project on Convergent Technology in ACE was undertaken by the Adult, Community and Further Education Board in Victoria and the results were widely disseminated.
The National Policy on ACE, endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA, indirectly addresses this issue. For example, two of the outcomes linked to Strategic Objective 8 of the policy `Enhancing the flexibility of learning opportunities available to adults' are that:
.	 ACE practitioners have the capacity to make informed and appropriate decisions about the use of technology in meeting learning needs for individuals and groups in their community; and
.	 ACE providers have access to appropriate, affordable technology.
The Commonwealth will draw the attention of appropriate bodies such as the Open Learning Technology Corporation Ltd. and the Education Network Australia to this report and, in particular, this recommendation.
Recommendation 16:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the level of the Commonwealth's ACE Grants Program be 
 significantly increased and managed by the new NACVET Authority.
RESPONSE
As indicated in the response to Recommendations 2 and 3, the Commonwealth does not support the NACVET Authority element of this recommendation. Funding for ACE projects through ANTA is a matter for consideration in the annual Budget context.
Recommendation 17:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth seek a formal response to a draft of the revised National ACE Policy from key women's organisations such as the Network of Women in Further Education and from independent assessors with expertise in the analysis of gender issues.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth agrees with the underlying purpose of this proposal.
The new National Policy on ACE was finalised in May 1997 after consideration by the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE in early May 1997, and endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA. The National Policy has a strong focus on equity. For example:
.	 under `Vision' the Policy states:
-	 'ACE provision will be determined and shaped by the learning needs of communities across Australia to ensure that: people from all backgrounds and circumstances have equitable access to the knowledge, skills and understandings they need to participate fully in the economic, social and cultural life of the community';  and
.	 goal 3 `to strengthen the responsiveness of ACE to learners' (one of the three overall goals enunciated in the National Policy) addresses equity issues in detail:
-	 strategic objective 6 `fostering inclusiveness' (one of three strategic objectives for goal 3) states that fostering inclusiveness is `Ensuring that adults have equitable access to learning opportunities appropriate to their needs throughout life.';  and
-	 the outcomes linked to objective 6 (which provide a yardstick against which progress can be measured) draw specific attention to ensuring greater participation in ACE by disadvantaged groups and that equity principles are built into all ACE services.
In developing the new policy key stake holders from all States and Territories were involved in an extensive round of discussions, consultations and workshops.  

Recommendation 18:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the new NACVET Authority commission a study of best practice in relation to the delivery of adult education and training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders by community-based providers
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation as it is dependent on implementation of Recommendation 3, which the Commonwealth does not support.
The Commonwealth does, however, agree with the underlying purpose of this recommendation.
Relevant research is already being undertaken. $30,000 of the National ACE Programme funds administered by the Australian National Training Authority was allocated in 1997 for a study to develop guidelines for best practice and benchmarking for the delivery of ACE programmes to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.
This project, managed by the Federation of Independent Aboriginal Education Providers, aimed to investigate and clarify elements of best practice and benchmarking in Aboriginal controlled adult education. The project involved consultation with community controlled Aboriginal Education providers affiliated to the Federation and resulted in the development of guidelines for best practice and benchmarking. These guidelines will be made available to all providers of education and training to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.
Following completion of this project, the Commonwealth will ask the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE to consider whether follow-up research, funded from the National ACE Programme allocation, should be undertaken.
Recommendation 19:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth seek a formal input into the proposed new NACVET Policy from
.	 the Commonwealth Office of Disability, from the peak body National Industry Association for Disability Services [formerly ACROD], and from an independent assessor with expertise in disability issues; and
.	 the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia, and other relevant organisations concerned with educational opportunities for Australians with a first language other than English.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth supports the underlying principle of this recommendation, namely that, where appropriate, organisations such as the Commonwealth Office of Disability, peak disability groups and the Federation of Ethnic Community 
 Councils of Australia be consulted in the development of ACE policies that affect disadvantaged groups.The Commonwealth already recognises the potential of the ACE sector in meeting some of the needs of disadvantaged groups and will continue to consult with appropriate peak bodies and agencies in the development and implementation of policies that affect the disadvantaged.
Recommendation 20:
The Committee RECOMMENDS the re-establishment of the National Staff Development Committee under the new NACVET Authority. Its role should be expanded to address the professional development needs of teachers and administrators working in community-based ACE providers.
RESPONSE
The Commonwealth does not support this recommendation.
Professional development activity such as that sponsored by the defunct National Staff Development Committee is now largely undertaken through the major Training Package developments funded by the Australian National Training Authority. Trainers, including community-based ACE providers, will be able to access this material when delivering programmes based on Training Packages.
The National Staff Development Committee was established during a period in which vocational education and training was delivered almost exclusively by TAFE Colleges and reflected nationally agreed strategies by governments to fulfil their responsibilities to develop their employees, the TAFE teachers. In a more diverse national VET system, it is appropriate now to provide professional development resources through the medium of Training Packages—available to all providers.
The Australian National Training Authority is also conducting other major projects addressing broad professional development needs in the Vocational Education and Training sector. Much of the material resulting from these projects will prove of assistance in addressing the professional development needs of ACE sector providers.
The improvement of teaching and other professional skills in the ACE sector is primarily a matter for employing authorities at the State and local level and has been addressed in the National ACE Policy adopted by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers at the June 1997 meeting of MCEETYA.
Recommendation 21:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government support a national project to identify and develop standards for teaching and learning in community-based ACE settings in a manner similar to the national ACE Standards for Administrators and Managers. 

RESPONSE
The Commonwealth supports the underlying purpose of this recommendation and will refer it to MCEETYA for consideration. Maintaining and improving the standard of teaching and learning in all education and training environments remains an essential element in the Commonwealth's overall education policies and strategies.
Recommendation 22:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government send a ministerial level delegation to the Fifth International Conference on Adult Education in Hamburg comprising relevant officers of Commonwealth agencies, State education authorities and representatives of Australia's ACE sector.
RESPONSE
This recommendation was supported by the Commonwealth.
An Australian Government delegation led by a senior Commonwealth officer attended the conference, held in Hamburg from 14th to 18th July 1997. The conference addressed adult education issues of importance to all education and training sectors providing education and training to adults. The eight member delegation was comprised of:
.	 Mr Tony Greer, First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs' (DEETYA) Vocational Education and Training Division, who led the delegation;
.	 Ms Shelagh Whittleston, Counsellor for Labour, Education and Social Affairs (DEETYA's representative on the Australian Permanent Delegation to the OECD);
.	 Mr Jack Beetson, President of the Federation of Independent Aboriginal Education Providers (FIAEP);
.	 Commissioner David Curtis, a Commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC);
.	 Ms Sam Thomas, Director of the NSW Board of ACE and Chair of the MCEETYA Taskforce on ACE (Ms Thomas represented the Taskforce on the delegation and was also MCEETYA's nominee to represent State and Territory government interests);
.	 Dr Alistair Crombie, Executive Secretary of the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education (AAACE);
.	 Professor Chris Duke, Deputy Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Western Sydney's Nepean Campus (nominated by the AVCC to represent the Higher Education sector); and  

.	 Ms Lesley Johnson, Principal Project Officer, Commonwealth State Relations, ANTA (nominated by ANTA to represent the VET sector).
The delegation played a successful role at the conference, the outcomes of which were favourable for Australia. For example:
.	 attendance of an official Australian Government delegation reaffirmed Australia's commitment to adult education and its deserved international reputation in this area;
.	 the invitation to Mr Greer to participate on the drafting committee was a clear acknowledgment of Australia's expertise and reputation; and
.	 the leading role played by the delegation in ensuring that Indigenous education issues were reflected in the Declaration  and Agenda for the Future  was particularly commended by other conference participants. A copy of the Declaration  and Agenda for the Future  is provided at Attachment B1 to this Response.
Recommendation 23:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Commonwealth government:
.	 undertake a precise analysis and costing of the public education activities of government departments and agencies;
.	 convene a national workshop of key government departments, information agencies and representatives of the ACE sector to explore public education practice, and the implications for more effective and coordinated delivery of Commonwealth public education programs.
RESPONSE
Public education or awareness campaigns undertaken by Commonwealth Departments and agencies are an essential element in implementing Government policy on a wide range of issues affecting all portfolios.
The Commonwealth acknowledges that community-based providers of ACE may often be well placed to assist in the development of public education/awareness campaigns. For example, the Australian Electoral Commission has utilised a range of adult and community education providers to assist in the delivery of both long-term and short-term public education and information initiatives.
Many campaigns such as national public health awareness campaigns are undertaken in conjunction with State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments also undertake public education or awareness activities independently of the Commonwealth. Consequently, the recommendation to `undertake a precise analysis and costing of the public education activities of government departments and agencies' raises issues that should 
 also be considered by State and Territory governments.
The Commonwealth also believes that the complexities involved in undertaking a precise analysis and costing of public education activities could mean that the costs involved may outweigh the benefits obtained. Additionally, project management practices already require Commonwealth Departments and agencies to analyse the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of such campaigns.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-27,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is the government's response to the Senate Employment, Education and Training report titled Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society.  Yet again, I note that this government response is almost a year overdue, and I might begin my comments with the observation of just how disappointing it is that the government has taken so long to produce a report which effectively says so little. It is a disappointment to me, and not just to me, I suspect, but to the 400,000-odd Australians who are currently involved with the adult and community education sector in this country.
The report Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society was the second report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee. The word `Cinderella' in this context refers to the fact that this particular sector, although it involves such a very large number of Australians, is treated badly by all levels in government. It is regarded as the poor relation of the education industry in this country.
Despite the fact that some 400,000 people participate in the various programs run by the adult and community education sector, the Commonwealth expends about $685,000 a year—in 1997-98 it spent about that amount of money—through the various international programs. Of that amount, about $185,000 goes to the peak body, the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education. Additional moneys are provided through the National Centre for Vocational Education Research and some assistance is provided through a tutor task force on adult and community education. DEETYA does do some very limited work in this area.
As the committee report itself observes, what is frustrating is that everybody involved in the education debate in this country acknowledges the worth of the adult and community education sector. Everybody will tell you just how worthy these organisations are and the importance of the work that they are undertaking. Again and again the concepts of lifelong learning of all types are acknowledged in the official reports of government in terms of the benefits provided. This report here today acknowledges again the importance of lifelong learning as a principle. It is also indicated by the national vocational education strategy documents that have been developed over the years by governments at all levels. The various Australian national training authority officials will come before the Senate and equally explain how important this sector is. But what we see again and again is that that is about as far as it goes.
Very limited sums of money are provided. As I said, $185,000 through ANTA is an appallingly small amount of money given the significance of this area of education. We spend something like $3 billion a year on public education for the vocational education and training sector in terms of TAFE and various other measures, but a very small amount of that $3 billion actually finds its way towards this particular sector.
The recent ministerial council, held on 22 May, on the national strategy for vocational education and training for the period 1998 to 2003 also identified the worth of the adult and community education sector. But no commitments have been made and no priorities have been established to ensure that adequate levels of funding are provided for people who undertake this work and who provide what are extremely important facilities to many of our older Australians. Mature aged people who are seeking entry back into the education system and a second chance, people who have not been able to enjoy the benefits of a formal educational setting through the primary and secondary education system, those seeking English as a second language programs, those seeking self-fulfilment and enrichment programs and all of those people who enjoy enormous benefit 
 through the adult community education system do not have access to adequate levels of public support, despite all the pious remarks that are made by governments.
The essential problem is demonstrated again in this government's response, which says, `This is not our worry, this is somebody else's problem. We are going to get a big mirror and have a good look into it yet again, but we are not actually going to do anything about it. We are going to shunt this problem off to the states to deal with.' These are national issues of national concern and matters that require a national response.
What we really have is a fundamental problem that exists within the government's thinking about the relationship between education and training. The fundamental problem that arises is the confusion that exists between the priority that should be given to what are narrowly defined as vocational programs and the broader concerns about the importance of providing lifelong learning and the wherewithal to ensure that education allows for the effective participation of all citizens through the formal and informal educational systems that do exist, to ensure that there is effective citizenship and that people have the opportunity to maximise their personal goals, and to ensure that they can develop the skills to allow them to operate at the highest level of participation, both in the world of work and in society more generally.
We have a failure to build the necessary infrastructure through community organisations and through our formal educational systems, be they TAFE or schools, to ensure that there is an opportunity to build creative, productive and socially satisfying relationships that will lead to people securing the necessary skills, habits of thought and ways of looking at the world that will allow them to achieve those objectives. There is a fundamental problem in so far as the government has failed to acknowledge the importance of this sector by putting its money where its mouth is. What this report demonstrates to the Senate yet again is that this failure will continue.
What we on the committee argued for was that a more comprehensive national approach 
 be taken to the adult and community education sector that acknowledged just how important it was for this society to provide the wherewithal, through the adult and community education facilities that are available, to provide at minimum cost the opportunity for in excess of 400,000 Australians every year to secure outcomes that allow them to achieve full participation. This is a consideration that goes beyond a more narrow vision of vocational education and is obviously wanting in all aspects.
It is a simple fundamental fact of life that in Victoria and a few other states there is a commitment—and I acknowledge this in terms of the Kennett government; these are measures that have continued since our time in government—with the particular acts of parliament, to ensure that there is protection for the adult and community education sector. But it does not happen too often. It has happened because of the forwarding thinking of the Labor government in the 1980s.
What you have are the simple facts such as the failure to acknowledge just how much money is actually spent by all governments on this particular sector of education. There is no reliable statistical basis to identify what the unit cost of education is in this particular sector. There is simply not the attention given to the adult and community education sector that would allow us to develop this in a more effective manner than currently exists. I must say that I am deeply disappointed with this response. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-27,"—I rise to speak on this report on adult and community education. This is the second report to the Senate this decade. The adult and community education issue is something that the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee has taken a great interest in through the 1990s. In 1991, we brought down the landmark Come in Cinderella  report. That was the very first report we did on a sector of education which has contributed an enormous amount to education in this country.
The adult and community education sector is the so-called fourth sector of education—the first being primary, the second being 
 secondary and the third being tertiary, university and TAFE. What a lot of people do not realise is the actual massive size of this sector. For example, in the state of New South Wales, there are a million people doing adult and community education courses of some description. There are more students at any one point in time in adult and community education than in the universities and TAFEs put together. The difference, of course, is that these are not three- or four-year long courses. A lot of adult and community education courses are quite short. They might go for a few months or they might even go just for a few weeks. But they are very important components in learning, and they do an enormous amount for education in this country and for the community generally.
People pick up very critical and important skills not only for their lives in general but often these are little building bridges towards other levels of education. A lot of people, particularly those who have experienced failure in the primary and secondary system and do not want to go anywhere near a university or a TAFE because of that, often gain confidence by spending time in one of these short courses and then going on to higher education. It is the most cost effective sector of education. Quite often courses are run on shoestring budgets and with a lot of dedicated people assisting. It covers a very wide range of areas in the community, and during our inquiries in 1991 and 1997 we went and saw this. We went to diverse places. We went into rural areas, migrant communities, mental hospitals and prisons, and adult and community education had a very major role in these areas.
In terms of the response to the reports by governments, it is interesting to see how this has changed over the years. In 1991, the view initially was that adult and community education was something that should be handled at a regional or state level and the federal government should not get very involved at all. In the very first report, Come in Cinderella, there were 33 recommendations to the committee and the last Labor government only ever implemented 11, and they did not put very much money into it either.
—Which is a lot more than what your government is going to do.
—As a matter of fact, the last Labor government set up an office relating to adult and community education in the federal bureaucracy, and during one estimates hearing, Senator Carr—I do not know if you were in the Senate at that time—I asked a question on it and they looked around for the officers to answer and they could not find them. The minister at the desk at the time was Senator Schacht, I think, and he said, `Gee, have we actually lost a whole division?' That whole division was the equivalent of about one or two people.
So let's get it in perspective, Senator Carr. When you criticise this government about what we are doing in response to the report, let's look at what your government did in response, which was very little indeed. You instituted a number of new measures, brought it in a new direction and did start to put a federal focus, and given that today you have paid tribute to Jeff Kennett and the work he has done in this area in Victoria, I will also pay tribute to that start you made. But let's be serious about it, Senator Carr—you did not really put many resources into it at all.
We come to the report that we are dealing with today. I suppose the disappointing thing, looking back on the approach of the committee, was that we were moving towards saying that the whole thing was a matter of reorganising the bureaucracy. I regret that we actually took that approach. I thought, having developed a very good report the first time and having started off in a new direction, that we should have extended that a little bit further rather than just putting bits of bureaucracy together.
I think the hope for people in adult and community education is in the way in which the job market structure is changing at the moment and the way in which intensive assistance works in the FLEX 3 where people can, as part of intensive assistance, get extra education and training. They do not have to go to the TAFEs or the universities; they can actually go to adult and community education providers if that is appropriate. These are very effective providers. They are very cost-effec 
 tive providers. I am sure that, under this new regime that this government has set up, the adult and community education sector which is flourishing will continue to flourish.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I would like to make some comments about this report. First of all, it is very disappointing that we had a unanimous report from our committee that has been so significantly dumped on by the government in this response. I think it is insufficient for Senator Tierney to say that we made recommendations for more bureaucracy and nothing else. That is certainly not the case. I think anybody in the Senate would acknowledge Senator Tierney's commitment to adult and community education. I would like it if sometimes he practised something of the same kind of generosity and acknowledged the initiatives of the Labor government to get adult and community education onto the political agenda at all.
The whole point of this report was that, given that adult and community education was on the political agenda, and given that there had been a very significant report, the Cinderella report from Senator Tierney and his committee, five years down the track we should have a look and see what was happening. You would have thought that the government would have been assisted in the whole approach to adult and community education by our reflecting on the state of play. The Labor government, in supporting adult and community education, particularly focused on the vocational education training end of adult and community education. This report was saying, very importantly, but you have forgotten one large part of adult and community education, and we want to recommend that it not be overlooked.
There are a number of reasons why. My colleagues have spoken about it, and the report spells out the importance of adult and community education for people who missed out the first time through in education, for people who got through school without being able to read and write, for people who went through school and now need to upgrade their skills. Their education was all right for them when they left school but it is no longer 
 appropriate. We hear again and again of the importance of education for employment these days. Many people are able, with adult and community education, to come back and access education in a very affordable and accessible way.
We think this is a critical part of adult and community education. We know its importance, we know its success. It is hugely welcomed by the community and very largely participated in. Our report stressed the importance of it, and this government has chosen to give a big flick to the majority of this report. I find that very depressing. In particular, the committee was interested to note that people from western suburbs and people from lower socioeconomic areas of the country were much less likely to access adult and community education than people from better off areas and from the eastern suburbs.
Secondly, a very large number of participants were women, far more than men. It would be interesting if the government had picked up on our drawing this to their attention, by saying that we think adult and community education should have a universal application and accessibility. So will you please find out why it is that men, and particularly men from working class or lower socioeconomic areas, are not making the same access and use of adult community education as others. It is a very important point.
For some of my colleagues age has begun to weary us, and it is important that we recognise another very important point from this report: that is, the importance of continuing intellectual activity of adult and community education for preventing the onset of Alzheimers. I am not at all sure that this is proven yet, but there is some nicely documented evidence that if you do your daily crossword and regularly play bridge you can hold off the onset of senility.
—And eat Freddo Frogs.
—I am not at all sure what contribution that makes to this discussion, but I take it that it is meant well. It may be that we do not necessarily have to play bridge and do the daily crossword, but it is very interesting.
The evidence brought to the committee is quite clear, and it is of great concern to us that, as more and more Australians are going to live to a ripe old age, it is important that more and more of those Australians feel as though they have something useful to do with their lives, something to contribute to the community. One of the best ways they feel that they can participate, keep up with events going on in their community, interest themselves in whatever, is if they have access to adult and community education. I note that the government is somewhat grudging but at least a bit sympathetic to the notion that we should look at the impact in terms of health, particularly the health dollar costs, of the points that I have made.
People may smile and say, `We are not sure that it is true about bridge and the daily crossword,' but we do know that the relationship between intellectual activity and good health is an issue that is beginning to be addressed. I do appreciate that this point has been taken up. The trouble is that it does give weight to the notion of adult and community education being something for old people to do to keep themselves gainfully distracted. That is not what adult and community education is about at all. I certainly hope that because of this report, through its support at least of that recommendation, the Commonwealth will establish a dedicated research program to examine this. I am not sure that they will do that, but they are certainly going to look at the connection between health and intellectual activity. I would hate this to be taken as any way skewing adult and community education to old people and the basket weavers in our community. It does no credit to what adult and community education is about.
I am disappointed that there was no support for the recommendation regarding the capital needs of adult and community centres, particularly those in the neighbourhoods and in the community. One of our recommendations says that we would like to see educational facilities like schools more available for use by other community groups, and adult and community education might be an entirely appropriate group to use such facilities. 
 However, we also know that not all community groups can move or want to move. They are differently accessible for people, and I am very disappointed that the government sees no need to try to support the capital needs of community and neighbourhood adult and community education centres, in particular, that of supplying a computer. The government has a lot of requirements in terms of data and reporting back but no appreciation that to provide that kind of data centres will need the assistance of some capital money, in particular, for a computer.
The final point I wish to make is the overwhelming rejection of this report. That has to be a disappointment for all of us but, I would have thought, particularly for those government colleagues who have actually been belted out of court by their own government.
I find it particularly disappointing that, in rejecting the principal recommendations, the government points out that there is a significant difference between ACE and VET. The whole raison d'etre of this report was to say that we recognise that, in picking up adult and community education, the previous government had done that very well, but the focus and the large amount of money had gone to the vocational end and ignored, or somewhat minimally supported, the ACE end. The whole report was about putting those two together, but the government sees fit to continue the separation. In particular, they go on to say:
Anyhow under the new labour market assistance there is a potential for a new role to ACE. ACE providers will be able to become contracted employment placement enterprises in their own right and/or provide labour market training to the clients of employment placement enterprises (EPEs) and that meet the specific requirements of the EPE and its client.
We have heard already of the unmitigated shambles called the establishment of the new Job Network under this government. There are thousands of community organisations possessing previously gained expertise and skills that have been totally disregarded. Why anyone would think that an undercapitalised community centre for adult and community education might now be able to leap in to become a contracted employment placement 
 enterprise without that backup and support is, I think, drawing a very long bow or, in fact, sheer folly.
While I would hope that people who attend any such centres may be able to get assistance with their employment, the suggestion that you can reject the thrust of our report by suggesting that adult and community education centres become employment placement enterprises is unlikely to happen. And it completely misses the point of why we reviewed adult and community education with the Come in Cinderella report. What it means, of course, is that this task remains for the return of a Labor government.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-05-27,"—I seek leave to have the vote on the second reading to the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997  and the National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997  taken again.
—What is the explanation?
—Perhaps I could throw some light on that. I was the person who missed the division at 12.40 p.m. I had gone to a function in the private dining room at about 12.35 p.m. without my pager and I did not hear any bells up there, nor did anyone draw my attention to it. I missed the division; I was in the private dining room at a function at the time. I ask the indulgence of the Senate to have the motion recommitted.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-27,"—by leave—You have explained, Madam President, your misadventure, I think is the phrase often used when people miss a division. The Labor Party and the opposition make it clear that we have never, as far as I am aware in my time, refused where people have explained why they have missed a division through circumstances beyond their control or where it is quite reasonable. It happens to us all and it will happen consistently to us all in the future. However, there is a consistent pattern that it seems to be the 
 government members who overwhelmingly are running into misadventure.
Madam President, you have a different position and fulfil functions representing this chamber at numerous engagements from lunches through to dinners, presentations, launches, et cetera. My astonishment is why the Manager of Government Business (Senator Ian Campbell) did not arrange a pair for the debate.
—Perhaps I can help. I didn't ask for one.
—I see. Madam President, I respect the fact that you were being diligent and thought that you would be able to make the division. Being in the private members' dining room on the third floor, there is not much spare time out of four minutes to get back down here, anyway.
—It is possible, but I didn't even try. I didn't realise it was on.
—Madam President, I want to make this clear: we accept your explanation and, I think the phrase is, `misadventure'. That might be a bit too enthusiastic in this case, a bit too wide a description. We are not going to oppose the item being recommitted, but I would say to the Government Manager and to you, Madam President, with due respect, that if you as President of the Senate are representing us at these functions it is only reasonable that you have a pair. That, I am sure, would never be objected to by the managers of our side.
During the debate on this bill, the National Transmission Network Bill, which the government has made very important, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) was absent. He had to rely on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell). We had one of these strange times where a parliamentary secretary, representing a minister who was absent, was actually filibustering on his own bill to fill the in time so he would not have to go into the committee stage of a bill where there were some technical amendments to be dealt with. Again, this certainly in no way reflects on the President of the Senate. It certainly reflects on the 
 incompetence of the minister and the government in managing their own bill that the minister is away abusing the ABC board and leaves the parliamentary secretary here not well briefed. So we have to have a filibuster at the close of the second reading debate to fill out the time until a quarter to one and then the opposition is told: `You are wasting time. You are holding up the government's program.'
It was a very poor performance today on this issue. This was an important bill. It is the privatisation of the National Transmission Agency, which the government has made great play of. It is poor that the minister was not present. I think it is poor that the parliamentary secretary was not able to handle the committee stage so he filibustered so we would not have to go into committee. Madam President, we accept your explanation, as we always have, because we accept in these circumstances—
—You are not making sense; sit down.
—You will never make sense, Senator Knowles. So on this basis we accept your explanation. Madam President, if I may conclude, I think you should ask for a pair in the future. When you are representing the Senate at these functions you should be able to do so without having to rush for a division.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is with some regret that I rise to speak to this report into the Australian National University.
—We share your regret.
—No doubt you will share it a great deal more by the time I have finished. I do not have any direct criticisms of the Australian National University as an institution, far from it. I think it is one of Australia's leading universities. What I am saddened by is the situation that is revealed in this report. The report notes on page 7 that the university has suffered greatly as a result of the six per cent cutbacks in funding by this government—a six per cent reduction in funding to the year 2000. It says that in cash terms that is a cut of between $12 and $15 million annually.
That is an extraordinary assault upon one of Australia's leading education institutions, and for that this government ought to be condemned. What you have got is a government that is dedicated to the reduction in the effectiveness of our higher education institutions right across this country, not just at the ANU. But it is particularly noticeable at the Australian National University.
The substantial reduction in the priority given to education by this government has seen a reduction of some $4.3 billion right across the portfolio of education. In higher education, there are 21,000 fewer places as a result of public investment in education and as a direct result of this government's reduction of six per cent in the operating budgets provided to the universities of this country. This has resulted in a reduction in the facilities that are made available. Hundreds of jobs have been lost as a result of budget cuts at the Australian National University. In the departments of art history, modern European languages, history and political science, there has been a reduction in courses available. There has been an increase in industrial action as 
 the university has had to try to make up for the reduction in public funding made available by government.
Protests by students and teaching staff have highlighted the failure of this government to provide adequate resources to the university sector. Professor Dean Terrell, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, said in a memorandum, `I consider it to be essential that the general public is made aware of the financial difficulties and associated budgetary challenges facing higher education.' All of this is revealed in the annual report of the ANU and I think the university authorities should be thankful that it is being drawn to the public's attention. What were once regarded as some of the best university programs in the country are under attack as a direct result of the reduction in funding to the university itself.
—One of the board members just walked out.
—That is the point. Members of this Senate are represented on the board—and I thank Senator Ray for drawing that to my attention—and we do not hear one comment from this government's representative on the board of the ANU to indicate to this Senate what his concerns are in regard to the university. I note on page 17 of the report that hundreds fewer staff are being provided to the university as a result of those cutbacks. What have we heard from this government? Not a word. It is an appalling situation which I think the Senate ought to be very concerned about. I hope that as a result of the discussion of this annual report, there is broader understanding in the community about the impact on one particular university of cutbacks to universities across the country.
This is a model that we have seen in a number of places, particularly at regional universities in the smaller regions of provincial Australia. The assault that has been experienced by the Australian National University and others is a disgrace and it is something that this government, in the long term, will be condemned for.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian National University </title>,Documents,29,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-05-27,"—I also rise to discuss 
 the ANU's annual report, which sets out the activities of the Australian National University for 1997. At the beginning of the report the mission statement is set out, which states:
The mission of the Australian National University is to be one of the world's great research institutions, distinguished by outstanding teaching, guiding students to the frontiers of knowledge and the best standards of scholarship.
These may seem lofty ambitions indeed, and it is extremely saddening to see how such aims have been frustrated by the drastic underfunding of higher education by this government. The previous speaker has referred to some of the drastic funding cuts we have seen over the last two budgets.
The impact of such underfunding is made abundantly clear in the report. The `review of 1997' states:
Financial constraints caused by reductions in Commonwealth funding to the higher education system made 1997 a difficult year for The Australian National University.
The year 1997 was the year in which the Australian National University began to feel the effects of the six per cent reduction in government funding, resulting in a reduction of $12 million to $15 million per year. Combined with an unsupplemented staff increase of nine per cent—this is the first time that the government has not supplemented such an increase—the university has been under tremendous pressure to maintain its high standards under these severe financial constraints.
Thus far, administrative areas have been the hardest hit. This has seen administrative staff, already under strain trying to cope with the changes to HECS introduced in 1997, placed under even greater pressure. The university anticipates that its future will see course offerings and research equally adversely affected.
To date—and I notice Senator Carr referred to staffing cuts—the university has lost 61 staff from its faculties: 31 academic staff and 30 general staff. The Institute of Advanced Studies, a world-class body, has lost 15 academic staff and 100 general staff, resulting in courses like archaeology and natural 
 history being discontinued at a particular level.
Earlier this year, the arts faculty discontinued Russian studies, and many of us in Canberra would have seen the student protests on the news. Last week, further staff redundancies were announced. Target loads for the university have fallen from 7,110 in 1996 to 6,180 in 1998. The undergraduate load has gone from 6,080 to 5,965 in the same period. This has caused a reduction of about $950,000 to faculties, so they are actually losing money as a consequence.
The reduction in the target load is such that the university anticipates funding fewer postgraduate positions. The university council has therefore resolved that unless the situation changes and adequate funding is restored, it will charge fees for all postgraduate students from the year 2000 onwards. So we are going to see further up-front and full fees charged as a consequence of this government's actions.
The arts and science faculties are under particular strain, and they are projected to run deficits this year. The library, of course, is one of the first places to suffer from funding cuts and indeed it is at the ANU. There was a 13 per cent rise in the cost of serials last year, and a loss of about $600,000 in purchasing power due to the decline in the value of the dollar relative to the US dollar and the pound has seen many of the serials cancelled.
The library has also had to reduce its staff levels from 157 to 138, and it has shortened opening hours as well. This has been especially problematic for mature age students and part-time students who face difficulty in accessing the library after hours and on weekends. Students without access to information technology have also been affected as they no longer have sufficient access to library computers. However, despite considerable pressure from government on universities to compensate for the funding shortfall by introducing up-front fees, I am proud to say the Australian National University has thus far resisted such pressure. The Democrats commend them for that decision.
This report highlights the situation many higher education institutions around the 
 country find themselves in as a result of this government's brutal slashing of the higher education budget. Like many other institutions, the ANU is struggling to fulfil its high aims despite the ever tightening constraints imposed by a government which fails to appreciate the many benefits which flow from the provision of readily accessible, publicly funded and high quality education.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian National University </title>,Documents,29,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-27,"—I rise to speak on the same report, the annual report of the Australian National University. I am a member of the council of the Australian National University. Each month I have the opportunity to sit and hear the deliberations of this truly great Australian university.
It was interesting to listen to the previous comments, particularly in light of the general response to the initial budget savings under this government. If I recall, it took up about three minutes of the time of the council at that time. But I think what Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr forget is the way in which the previous Labor government tried to bring down the Australian National University in many ways. The reason was that it is a very different type of university. Senators will remember that, when Mr Dawkins was the minister, he brought in what he called the `unified national system'. It was his eastern Europe-Communism type approach: his one type of model and `let's have it all pretty much the same' type approach.
The ANU stuck out like a sore thumb in all that because it is not your typical Australian university. It has something called the Institute of Advanced Studies, which is a major research section in this university. It has a world-class research centre. The John Curtin School of Medical Research, which is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies, boasts two Nobel prize-winners in just one school of the Institute of Advanced Studies. This is a world-class research institution; a world-class university.
Let us look at what the previous Labor government tried to do to it. I was a deputy chair of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee that inquired into what Labor tried to do to the John Curtin 
 School of Medical Research. This was the first chink in taking the Institute of Advance Studies apart and trying to make the ANU like any other university. The then government actually moved the funding for the John Curtin School of Medical Research—this first-class research school—out of the ANU and put it under the Department of Health; it was not even under the Department of Education. Our report severely criticised what the Labor government did and was the mainspring for the action that eventually led to the restoration of the John Curtin School of Medical Research within the Institute of Advanced Studies. So the Senate had a major role in keeping the integrity of the Institute of Advanced Study in place.
The other little thing the previous Labor government tried on the ANU was to combine it with the University of Canberra, claiming that in this area there perhaps should be only one university. That would have been a major mistake. I think history has shown that both universities have very different missions and fulfil very important roles in the Canberra and southern New South Wales region. So we have the ANU at this point in time.
It is claimed in the responses to this report that the ANU has been greatly affected by budget cuts. The cuts have had some minor effects—Russian has disappeared, for example—but from where I sit on the council I cannot see these effects as being major. I am sure they are not as severe as were the cuts in the Dawkins years when university enrolments in this country expanded by 40 per cent. The commensurate finance did not expand anything like that, and therefore the universities were left struggling.
It is interesting that Senator Stott Despoja—who, like many of the Democrats, is in fantasy land—talked about `fully funded public higher education of high quality'. It is almost a contradiction in terms because the reality is that, in the current budget situation, the government cannot do that. There just is not enough public money to fund universities to the extent that is needed. Even the Labor government recognised that. Who brought in fees? It was the Labor government—a long 
 cry from the Whitlam era when universities were to be totally free.
I was in the system at that time. What actually happened in the universities during the Whitlam era, as there were no fees, was a scaling back of resources and staffing, a lengthening of the hours staff worked and a run-down in general facilities. Why? Because there was not enough money there. The Labor government was finally run over by reality. It brought in fees, encouraged universities to raise money in other ways and introduced foreign full fee paying students—all of which we applaud. That is what they should have done, and that is what we are continuing. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian National University </title>,Documents,29,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-05-27,"—I rise to put forward some comments in relation to the annual report of the Australian National University. Listening to Senator Tierney advocate his view in relation to university funding it is quite interesting to note that, nowhere in the rhetoric that we have just heard from Senator Tierney, do we find any commitment to equity of access to higher education in this country. In fact, what we are hearing from Senator Tierney is exactly the opposite: that universities should remain open only to the elite or those who can afford to fund their access. That is the message contained within the Liberals' contribution to this particular debate. We have seen through the massive cuts to the higher education sector the manifestation of that philosophical view.
I would like to turn my comments to the ANU and its role in our local region. As senators would know, the Canberra community has suffered many times over from cuts by this government. They are cuts that have affected our community in the harshest way, in the form of jobs and job losses. We have just heard from Senator Stott Despoja the degree to which people have lost their jobs at the ANU as a result of these cuts. Add to this the cumulative effect of public sector cuts and the flow-on to the private sector and we have a severely damaged regional economy. Education in the ACT and region represents over 30 per cent of our economy. We are very proud of our education base and it is one of our 
 great strengths in this region. The ANU is very much a centrepiece of our education infrastructure.
The ANU also plays a critical role in technological developments in areas such as AARNet and the introduction of new information services to students, and indeed to the whole network of universities around this country. At no point has this innovation and commitment to these areas been recognised by this government in a way that will sustain and enhance the role that universities have played in improving access to new information technologies. The relationship between the ANU and an absolute myriad of cooperative research centres, associated particularly with the information technology area but also a wide range of other areas, positions the ANU soundly in the structure and affords it the status of being an education leader both in our region and in Australia.
Since I was elected to this place just over two years ago I have attended many demonstrations and rallies organised by both staff and students at the ANU demonstrating against the actions of this government. The cuts are not just to university funding, affecting academic and non-academic staff. We are still feeling the effects on almost a day to day basis as the university announces cut after cut forced by those funding arrangements. But students are also affected by cuts to Austudy and changes in arrangements. My electorate office was absolutely deluged as a result of the monumental stuff-up in relation to Austudy early last year.
If these attacks on support for students and funding levels for universities continue, the upshot will be less opportunity for young Australians. The upshot, of course, will be a diminution of the status of our higher education institutions in this country. That will result in a decline in general investment in areas like research and development and commercialisation. That, in turn, will undermine our economic growth prospects. There is no denying that these cumulative effects of cuts on universities will affect these longer-term issues.
The last point I would like to make is: think of what you are doing to the morale of the 
 students in that place. Students now are facing increased fees. They are facing fewer opportunities as a result of this government. Start linking cross-portfolio areas about youth affairs and higher education. If you address the issue in the context of young people's morale, you start to see a very desolate picture being presented by this government. It has no compassion. It is not committed to the youth of Australia. What it is doing in higher education is a graphic example of that neglect. (Time expired)

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-05-27,"—I want to acknowledge a very important event which will take place in Tasmania tomorrow. For some time now, there has been ecumenical prayer for mothers and unborn babies in Tasmania. Tomorrow, 28 May, a new milestone will be reached in ecumenical prayer. At 10 a.m. at Saint Therese's Catholic Church, Moonah, there will be the 300th week of the prayer. For the past six years there has been weekly prayer for mothers and unborn babies in Moonah's Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Salvation Army and Uniting Church churches.
This could be the longest continuing ecumenical prayer in Tasmania's history. The prayer lasts for about 20 minutes. People of all ages and all Christian faiths attend. Occasionally, there have been interstate visitors. Five Metro buses carry large paid ads for the prayer. The prayer has a very positive focus: that God will keep all Tasmanian mothers and their unborn babies safe and well.
This prayer has had great results. The advantages are of course that the prayer is ecumenical, that it is persevering, that it brings continuing help to mothers and unborn babies, that it is very gentle and non-confron 
 tational, that it is pro-life in the very best sense, and that it shows that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ecumenical Prayer</title>,Adjournment,30,1,speech

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-05-27,"—The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
During the period 1 October 1997 to 28 February 1998 the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC):

(a) approved a facility for one mining project: an export finance guarantee relating to the expansion and upgrading of the existing Sarcheshmeh copper smelter in Iran. If this project proceeds, EFIC expects an exposure of A$32.5m;
(b)approved insurance cover for mineral shipments as detailed in the Table attached. The row headed `Total Amount Approved' represents the total value of the export contract or invoice. EFIC's liability in the event of a claim would be a proportion of this amount. Often the liability would be 90% of the listed figure, but the liability could be as low as 50%. In addition, exporters may not have utilised the cover (or all of the cover) offered;
(c) did not receive information from exporters which permits it to identify whether the export was of woodchip. The information available related to all exports that the exporter has identified under the category of `wood and wood products';
(d) did not offer any facilities relating to dams;
(e) is not able to identify `renewable energy industries'.
