Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Australian sugar industry, comprising more than 4,000 farms across Queensland and northern New South Wales, is an important contributor to regional economies in these areas and the Australian economy in general.


It produces on average 34 to 38 million tonnes of cane per season, which equates to approximately 4.5 to 5.5 million tonnes of raw sugar, with a gross value of production of $1.5 to $2.5 billion.


More than 80 per cent of this sugar is exported, making Australia the third largest raw sugar supplier in the world.


As with all industries, particularly those that are heavily export dependent, research and development underpins the competitiveness of the Australian sugar industry. It drives productivity improvements and ensures the economic viability of the industry. It also generates significant flow-on effects to the broader community and economy in terms of regional development, exports and employment opportunities.


It is vital that research and development is delivered in the most effective and efficient manner.


With this in mind, the Australian Sugar Industry Alliance undertook a review of research and development arrangements and recommended reform of these arrangements to best meet current and future needs.


On 22 September last year, it submitted a proposal to the Australian government asking it to restructure research and development arrangements.


Under these reforms, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation , or SRDC and BSES Limited will be wound-up and their assets and research and development functions, along with the research coordination activities of Sugar Research Limited, transferred to the industry owned company Sugar Research Australia Limited, which was established on 8 May 2013.


Under the proposal, the statutory levy will increase from 14c per tonne to 70c per tonne of sugar cane that is processed or sold for processing, shared equally between growing and milling businesses. Thirty-five cents a tonne will be paid by the growing business and 35c a tonne by the milling business.


While this is a significant increase, the new statutory levy will also replace the BSES Limited service fee for both growers and millers.


In considering the proposal, the government looked at other options, including continuation of existing arrangements. It also took account of objections received during the formal six-week objection period, of which there were eight, and other representations on the issue.


The government determined that, on balance, this proposal represents the best mechanism for long-term delivery of research and development to the sugar industry.


This view is supported by the industry itself. All levy-paying businesses had the opportunity to vote on the new arrangements, including the increase in the levy, in a poll of all levy-paying businesses run by the Australian Electoral Commission in a poll in August 2012. Eighty-four per cent of those growers who voted supported the proposal. This represents 64 per cent of all cane growers. Seven of the eight milling businesses also voted in favour.


The changes will build on, rather than replace, current arrangements.


The knowledge and expertise of BSES Limited will not be lost but will transfer across to the new industry owned company. Similarly, the research and development knowledge that has been facilitated and funded through SRDC will remain publicly available, as will that generated by Sugar Research Australia Limited.


Operating one industry research body should deliver increased efficiencies. The new company should have the capacity to better integrate and avoid duplication of research and development activities across the sugar industry supply chain, leading to a wider range of research opportunities and increased industry and public good benefits.


Incorporating the existing sugar statutory levy and voluntary contributions under a new statutory levy will eliminate free-rider problems, as all industry members that benefit from research and development services provided by Sugar Research Australia Limited will now contribute the same amount to its operation through the new statutory levy.


The change should, therefore, create a stronger national research and development capability, establish equity in the industry in relation to financial contributions to R&D and provide certainty to growers and millers about their liabilities and the amount of funding that will be available for research and development.


There will also be reduced compliance costs for levy payers with growers and millers paying fewer individual levies and fees.


The bills before you today, the Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013, and its companion bill the Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, provide the mechanism to implement key elements of reform of sugar R&D arrangements.


The bill, which commences on the day after it receives royal assent, provides the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with the power to enter into a funding contract with an eligible company, currently proposed to be Sugar Research Australia Limited, to enable it to receive and invest levies collected by the Commonwealth for research and development. It will also allow it to receive the Commonwealth's matching funding for eligible research and development expenditure up to a determined funding cap.


Once the funding contract is in place, and the minister is satisfied that Sugar Research Australia Limited will comply with its contractual and statutory obligations, the minister can declare the company with which the contract is made to be the industry services body.


The companion bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts and regulations to ensure the new arrangements operate, as intended, in respect of the imposition and collection of the levy, including provision for the increase in the levy rate on 1 July 2013.


It also covers matters arising from the transition to a new industry services body such as the transfer of assets and liabilities from SRDC to the industry services body and the wind-up of the SRDC on 30 September 2013.


While the government supports the proposal, it is also conscious of the need to make sure that appropriate governance arrangements are in place and, where appropriate, are reflected in Sugar Research Australia Limited's constitution.


In this regard, the government has made sure that issues such as accountability to government and members, protecting the rights of levy payers, appropriate consultation and the operation of Sugar Research Australia Limited as both a funder and provider of research have indeed been addressed.


The government worked closely with the Australian Sugar Industry Alliance in the development of the constitution for Sugar Research Australia Limited to make sure it supports, among other things, a suitably skilled and independent board and the rights of all levy-paying members to be treated equitably.


Sugar Research Australia Limited will be unique among rural research and development corporations as both a purchaser and provider of research. Sugar Research Australia Limited's constitution requires it to ensure the sugar industry is supported by research capability from a range of providers. In addition, and noting the potential for conflict of interest, there will be explicit governance oversight of this issue by the Audit and Risk Committee of Sugar Research Australia Limited.


The contract between the Commonwealth and Sugar Research Australia Limited, commonly referred to as the Statutory Funding Agreement, will also play a key role in achieving this objective.


The Statutory Funding Agreement will set out the expectations of the government in relation to the prudent management of industry and Commonwealth funds and the development of strategic and annual operating plans.


The Statutory Funding Agreement also requires the development of an agreed industry consultation plan and priority setting process. It is important that this is in place to both guide and ensure a broad industry consultation process. It is appropriate for all industry levy payers to be consulted on the operation of the company and to contribute to its priority setting processes.


In line with government policy, the Statutory Funding Agreement will require Sugar Research Australia Limited to identify extension pathways that will facilitate the adoption of its research and development outcomes. Every three years, it must undertake a performance review to assess the company's effectiveness in meeting the priorities, targets and budgets outlined in its plans, and its performance in meeting the obligations of the funding agreement. Final performance review reports will be publicly available.


With the Statutory Funding Agreement and the revised constitution, the government is confident that the governance arrangements for the new organisation will satisfy transparency and accountability requirements and support an efficient and effective organisation. This, in turn, should contribute to increased productivity and profitability for the sugar industry.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (09:28):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.


It is not acceptable in Australia, a relatively wealthy country, that so many Australians remain homeless.


A home is the foundation on which a person builds their life. Without stable homes, people struggle to live healthily, stay in training or education, and find and keep jobs.


This Labor government has made homelessness a national priority. Our white paper, The Road Home, outlines how we intend to reduce homelessness—through a program that will require sustained effort by governments, business and the broader community.


We have set clear targets—to halve the rate of homelessness by 2020, and to provide supported accommodation for all rough sleepers who need it.


These targets will be achieved through a significant boost in spending, new agreements with the states and territories, and an overhaul of the existing legislative framework.


Already, we have seen progress, including through early intervention to prevent homelessness.


The community based early intervention service, Reconnect, has helped more than 67,000 young people to get back with their families and into school or training.


The Household Organisation Management Expenses Advice Program has given advice and assistance to many families—struggling with rent and mortgage payments during times of personal or financial crisis—helping them to stay off the streets.


We have seen our Personal Helpers and Mentors program, or the PhaMS program, prevent people with mental illness from becoming homeless—by giving them support to build social networks, gain employment, and learn to manage their illness and live independently.


We have moved towards integrating mainstream and specialist homelessness services by improving the responses from 'first-to-know' agencies and providers—such as headspace, working with young people with mental health issues, and Job Services Australia—providing tailored assistance to homeless job seekers.


These are just some of the ongoing practical initiatives that will help break the cycle of homelessness for vulnerable people.


The homelessness legislative framework was the subject of a comprehensive inquiry during 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth. The committee's report, Housing the homeless, has been vital in shaping this bill introduced today.


With the exception of a legislative right to housing, which is outside current government policy and, in practice, would be significantly dependent on the actions of the states and territories (which are responsible for housing), the committee's recommendations have been incorporated into this bill to the best extent possible.


This bill complements a broader reform process to reduce homelessness, incorporating substantial co-investment with states and territories to expand and implement a range of practical measures to support, and improve outcomes for, Australians facing homelessness. The bill underpins the need to sustain this effort into the future.


The bill draws national attention to the experience of homelessness, and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. This is in line with the objective expressed within the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, and local government.


The bill acknowledges the direct relationship between addressing homelessness and social inclusion. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed, and the strategies we see as necessary to reduce homelessness.


The bill also confirms the Commonwealth's commitment to cooperation and consultation in reducing homelessness, and promotes the human rights of people facing homelessness.


This legislation that is introduced today has been strengthened through a two-month public exposure period in mid-2012—and we express our gratitude to those many people who lodged written submissions on that exposure draft.


All suggestions made have been carefully considered, and the bill has been refined as a result. In particular, the definition of homelessness has been improved in light of comments from a number of stakeholders.


We have now clarified that people staying in crisis accommodation (such as a refuge or shelter) cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of 'choice'—we know all too well that people do not choose homelessness by living in crisis accommodation.


The definition of 'homelessness' now also recognises that safety must be recognised as a vital element in a person's living circumstances. Some people may be homeless because they have no safe place to live, even if they do have a usual address. For example, a person who is living temporarily with friends or relatives and cannot return home safely because of domestic violence will now be recognised by the legislation as experiencing homelessness. This preserves an element of the previous legislative definition particularly valued by stakeholders.


Stakeholder feedback has also been reflected in the bill in important matters such as the range of factors recognised as contributing to homelessness, and in the Commonwealth's aspiration for all Australians to have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing.


This new legislation will replace the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994, which set out important principles and guided the Commonwealth's response to homelessness in Australia for many years.


That act recognised people who are homeless as one of the most powerless and marginalised groups in society. It made clear the parliament's view that support should be provided in a way that respects people's dignity as individuals, enhances their self-esteem, is sensitive to their social and economic circumstances, and respects their cultural backgrounds and beliefs.


The new legislation preserves the best features of the 1994 act. The Homelessness Bill 2013 gives us the opportunity to retain in law the important statements about homelessness, the partnerships, effort and strategies that are needed to tackle it, and the treatment and support that vulnerable Australians deserve.


The 1994 act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program—the SAAP. However, new arrangements were introduced in 2009 under the federal financial relations framework, superseding the funding mechanism under the 1994 act.


This current funding framework for Commonwealth, state and territory efforts to reduce homelessness—with funding provided through Commonwealth-state mechanisms such as the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment—will continue. That funding framework is the vehicle for the practical steps Australia is taking in support of its international obligation to realise progressively the right to adequate housing.


This bill is therefore complementary to the comprehensive funding arrangements already in place, and is not a funding instrument in itself. The Gillard government continues to work with states and territories on the best possible funding outcomes under the existing framework and the substantial measures that flow from it.


Similarly, the bill is just one part of a bigger policy program of support to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.


The issue of service quality is being pursued by working with states and territories to develop a non-legislative Homelessness National Quality Framework. This framework is being developed with the benefit of consultations and workshop sessions with service providers and stakeholders and individual interviews with homeless people. The framework will be the primary strategy for the white paper goal of ensuring quality services.


The Australian government has committed around $5 billion in new funding since 2008 to provide support services and programs to help people who are homeless or at risk.


Under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, the Australian government, together with the states and territories, has committed $1.1 billion to provide new and better integrated accommodation and support services. The agreement is delivering over 180 new or expanded services across the country to tackle homelessness, as well as 600 homes under the A Place to Call Home initiative.


Increasingly, we are in a position to assess progress against the homelessness targets—using tools such as robust census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and information collected by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.


These data will be supplemented by the first national longitudinal study of homelessness in Australia, Journeys Home, and research supported by our $11 million-investment on the Homelessness Research Agenda to help drive the development and implementation of evidence-based policy—looking at matters including the experiences and needs of particular vulnerable groups such as families, children and victims of domestic violence, the effectiveness of homelessness programs, and how to end rough sleeping in cities around the country.


The Australian government remains committed to improving outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Ensuring that people receive high-quality services and get every chance to move out of homelessness, or avoid it altogether, is key to the government's policy agenda in this area.


The welfare and safety of our fellow Australians matter a great deal. There can be no more worthy cause than doing all that we can to help reduce homelessness, and this bill is a clear statement of our commitment and values in this vital policy agenda. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (09:41):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I present the committee's seventh report of 2013 entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: bills introduced 14-16 May 2013, legislative instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments 20 April-17 May 2013.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr JENKINS:
  by leave—The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' seventh report of 2013 sets out the committee's consideration of 29 bills introduced during the period 14 to 16 May 2013, 122 legislative instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments (FRLI) during the period 20 April to 17 May 2013 and eight responses to the committee's comments in various previous reports.


The committee has identified 15 bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information. The remaining 14 bills do not appear to give rise to human rights concerns.


The committee has identified six legislative instruments for which it will seek further information before forming a view about their compatibility with human rights. The committee has decided to consider one instrument as part of its examination of the Migration (Regional Processing) package of legislation.


The remaining 115 instruments considered do not appear to raise human rights concerns and are accompanied by statements of compatibility that meet the committee's expectations. The committee notes that the general standard of statements of compatibility for legislative instruments has improved significantly in recent months.


In this report the committee has continued its consideration of the human rights implications of appropriation bills. I drew the attention of the House to the committee's initial views in this regard when I tabled the committee's third report of 2013.


Appropriation bills, like all other bills, are subject to the requirements of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. In its third report of 2013 the committee noted that it does not anticipate it will generally be necessary for it to make substantive comments on appropriation bills. However, the committee stated that it would find it helpful if the statements of compatibility that accompany appropriation bills identify any proposed cuts in expenditure which may amount to retrogression or limitations on human rights.


In its consideration of appropriation bills in this seventh report of 2013, the committee recognises the technical and particular nature of appropriation bills and the fact that they frequently include appropriations for a wide range of programs and activities. The committee notes the minister's advice that the explanatory memoranda to appropriation bills address technical aspects of the operative clauses of the bills, not the policy aspects of proposed government expenditure.


The committee accepts the minister's explanation that the detail about specific appropriations is mainly contained in the individual agency's portfolio budget statement, rather than in the appropriation bill itself.


The committee considers that while appropriation bills may not create any statutory rights or duties, they may nevertheless have an impact on the implementation of international human rights obligations, including the obligation to progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights using the maximum of resources available.


The committee therefore considers that statements that routinely conclude that appropriation bills do not engage any human rights may not be accurate in a strict sense, particularly where specific appropriations may involve reductions in expenditure which could amount to retrogression or limitations on rights.


The committee recognises that in many cases relevant questions of human rights compatibility are likely to have been taken up under the legislation to which appropriations relate, although this may not be the case where the legislative framework predates the commencement of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.


The committee considers that the most practical way to address the compatibility of appropriation bills is to ensure that human rights are appropriately incorporated in the underlying budget processes. The committee encourages the government to consider this proposition, not least as it would be consistent with the government's policy objectives in implementing Australia's Human Rights Framework to ensure appropriate recognition of human rights issues in policy and legislative development.


On behalf of the committee I would like to thank the Minister for Finance and Deregulation for her response to the committee's comments in its third report of 2013. I would also like to acknowledge the constructive discussions on this issue between her department and the committee's secretariat and I thank the minister for her offer for departmental officials to brief the committee. While the committee's commitments may not permit it to take up this offer during this parliament, it considers that there would be benefit in continuing this dialogue in the next parliament.


I commend the committee's seventh report of 2013 to the House.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:08):  Now begins a long a process in the House of considering in detail the 71 pages of amendments the government dropped into the parliament yesterday. I say at the outset that the sheer incompetence of this government in trying to implement a new school funding model has been quite breathtaking. It has been like watching a passenger jet slamming into the deck of an aircraft carrier which has just hit an iceberg.


The Gonski report was handed to the government in late 2011. It was published in February 2012. We are now in parliament in June 2013 with the school funding model due to run out on 31 December this year, yet the government is still trying to get agreement to a new school funding model—six months before it is supposed to take effect.


It is quite impossible for this government to implement a new school-funding model competently in the time that it has given itself. If this government were competent, if it understood good public policy, if it were not obsessively inwardly focused, it would have been doing this last year. It would have been going through the process methodically and calmly like adults in the room, rather than threatening and shouting with megaphone diplomacy to the states and the non-government sector.


In this particular instance, late last year the government introduced a nine-page bill, a bill full of platitudes, called the Australian Education Bill—a nine-page bill with no detail—which they expected the parliament to debate and which we have been dutifully debating. Yesterday, without any notice to me as the shadow minister, without giving me the courtesy of delivering these amendments to my office, they dropped 71 pages of detailed amendments into the parliament which they expected to debate and pass at five o'clock last night. The minister insists that my office had these amendments delivered to it. It did not. There is no record in my office of these amendments appearing at any point yesterday. In fact, to get access to these amendments, my office had to download them from ParlInfo so that I had access to them. So, whatever the department or his office is telling the minister, I have no record of ever receiving these amendments.


There are 71 pages of detailed amendments introducing a complicated new funding model—much more complicated than the model we have had since the year 2000. There is so much detail in these amendments that it is utterly outrageous for the government to expect the parliament to consider them and pass them in a matter of hours. The normal process, if this government had not given up governing already, would have been to have introduced these amendments, to have consulted with the shadow minister and to have given at least a week or two for the Independents and the coalition to consider these amendments and come to a position. Instead, this government has given up governing. It is just trying to tick boxes and it thinks that an asinine debate about a new school-funding model rushed through this chamber will somehow repair its stocks with the public. What would repair its stocks with the public is a government of adults that actually governed for the good of the country rather than an inwardly obsessive government worried about its own political survival.


I will over the course of this debate go through in detail many of the concerns that the coalition has about this new school-funding model. But, before I get to the detail of the amendments, which I will go through, I will mention another part of the process, and that is that the sector itself has been shut down with confidentiality agreements that would make the Committee of Public Safety in revolutionary France blush with its heavy-handedness and its draconian measures. The non-government sector has not had the opportunity to speak to its sector, as any government would expect it to do, because of those confidentiality agreements.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:13):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 consideration in detail. We have just heard from the shadow minister about process. There is no process in this particular bill, as we have seen since it was first brought to the chamber back in late 2012. Since then we have been preparing speeches, and I finally got to speak on it on Monday. I am seriously concerned about the shadow minister's health. I know he has been running around trying to deal with this bill, deal with the minister and deal with all the schools and the stakeholders involved in this, and I am seriously concerned about the process that he has had to deal with. I am sure he will be up to it and I am sure he will make sure that he takes the argument to the government and makes sure that all the stakeholders involved in this bill are greatly represented in this chamber. I know Deputy Speaker Oakeshott is big on representation in this chamber.


The government's handling of this bill has been chaotic and shambolic—a debacle. As I said in my speech on the second reading speech, the bill had no proper detail and would have been better suited as a press release rather than a bill in this place. As we heard from the shadow minister yesterday, at five o'clock 71 pages of amendments were produced. The document is that large that we cannot even download it through ParlInfo.


Through that process, we have gone from a bill with no detail contained in it to a situation where the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is moving detailed and complex amendments to the bill at the eleventh hour—it is probably nearly the twelfth hour. It is good that the minister took the coalition's advice on board and introduced more content into the bill. But he should have done so from the start and not at this late stage of consideration. We now have these detailed amendments in front of us that the House has had very little time to consider. This means that coalition members have had no opportunity to talk with our local communities, to schools or with state governments about the amendments moved by the government.


It is particularly disappointing that I will not have the opportunity to speak with local schools in my electorate of Swan in Western Australia, about these changes because, as usual, with anything to do with this government, Western Australia comes out the worst. I know that parents and students at Lathlain Primary School will be disappointed that I have not had an opportunity to talk with them when they will lose, according to reports in the local papers, $466,316 in funding, thanks to the government's proposed changes. I hope that the minister will come to Western Australia, go to Lathlain Primary School and tell them why they are going to loss $466,316 out of their budget because of this bill.


These tactics are symptomatic of this government. It is always about politics rather than achieving well-thought through and lasting reforms to our education sector. When the minister treats the parliament like this, it is clear to schools, parents and students—like those at Lathlain Primary School—that they are the ones who lose. Parents and students at Wesley College, Penrhos College, Como Secondary College and the East Victoria Park Primary School are all reportedly under threat of losing large chunks of funding under these changes. I see the minister smiling; I am sure that they will not be happy about losing their funding under this particular system. I am sure that they would all like proper scrutiny of these changes, especially when it is their futures that are under threat. The government has still refused to hand over individual school information to the sector for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16, despite repeated requests.


There is simply no excuse for the chaos and no excuse for the government to be ramming through these changes without proper scrutiny from the parliament and all stakeholders. The only strategy here is getting through the election. There is still no notional agreement on these changes. This is important, as it is the states and territories that run our schools. But the federal government, which does not run any schools and does not employ one teacher, thinks that it is okay to ram through changes like this without the support of the states. That is farcical. The Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, said, 'Why would I want to hand over control of the schools in Western Australia to the federal government?' Victoria have allocated no money in their budget for these new measures. South Australia, a Labor state, have refused to confirm if they will allocated money in their budget today for these measures.


The budget papers give us an insight into Labor's true plans for education. What the government does not want the Australian public to work out is that most of the money being promised under this new model will not flow until two or three elections away. The new model is less transparent than the old model and, given the track record of the government when it comes to keeping their promises and telling the truth—especially when it comes to budget figures—the states and territories and the Australian public can be forgiven for being highly sceptical of the government's proposals. I repeat my invite to the minister to come to Western Australia and to Swan and talk to the schools in my electorate that are going to lose out.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:18):  The first thing to say is that this is a truly important day for the parliament in terms of education reform. It is a day when we will see enshrined in legislation a new needs-based funding model for schools and students across Australia. In relation to the debate that we are having here, it ought to be a debate that focuses on why it was that the Gonski panel made the recommendations that they did; how the government has responded to those recommendations after significant consultation and discussion with states, territories and non-government organisations; how crucial and critical it is that we put in place these funding arrangements to meet the needs of students and schools around Australia; and how urgent it is for other states and territories to work closely with the Commonwealth as we deliver this significant reform.


In relation to the spray that we just had from the member for Sturt, I remind the member that the amendments were circulated at 1.20 yesterday afternoon. If it is the case that your internal processes are so poorly organised that they do not get a single amendment to you then I do not think that you can come in and blame us for that particular issue. That responsibility lies with your party in this parliament. It should organise itself properly. Those amendments were circulated. I want to make clear that we have also now made available draft regulations for the bill for consideration at this time as well.


But we should not be surprised by the spray from the member for Sturt, because he has sprayed from day one. Not only did he walk out 22 or 23 minutes after the Gonski panel brought down its recommendations and its findings and dismissed them out of hand but, when the New South Wales government agreed with the approach that was taken by this government to work to those recommendations to deliver a new national plan for school improvement, he then went on to say that in fact the New South Wales Premier had been conned.


The use of colourful language by the member for Sturt is recognised both here and further afield; after all, he was the one who described the goal that is set and that we have enshrined in the National Plan for School Improvement, which is to be in the top five of education nations by 2025, as mad. At no point in the debate over a period of more than 12 months has he ever participated constructively in moving this reform through the parliaments of Australia through their budgets to be delivered to the 9,350 or so schools and 3½ million students or so for whom it is intended. There has not been a single instance on the record where we have had construction engagement from the opposition on education.


The shadow minister gets up and says, 'We're trying to reach agreement.' I will remind him that we have reached agreement with New South Wales. The Liberal Premier was very clear about it: he signed up to the deal because 'it provides additional resources, fairer distribution, to deliver higher standards and better outcomes in schools across New South Wales'. That is what he said. The education minister likewise said, 'It's wrong to suggest'—as the shadow minister on a couple of occasions—'that indexation under the present model would be high.'


The fact is that the New South Wales Premier and the New South Wales education minister looked at these propositions, spent the time—as we have with other states and territories and non-government school organisations—in working through what a new funding model would look like and then committed to it. They did that because there is more money, money that is provided in the budget to deliver this reform. It does not matter how many times the shadow minister runs his lines out, either here or outside, the fact is that it is in the budget. That is the offer that is on the table from the Prime Minister. And it is a two-for-one offer for states and territories.


I say to the member that this is an important piece of legislation and that these amendments not only reflect the discussion, consultation and consideration that we have had of this issue for a considerable period of time but also finally provide for once and for all the opportunity for schools around Australia to be funded on the basis of the needs of their students, whatever school they are in, wherever they live, however much money their parents earn.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:23):  The Greens are also working through the amendments that were tabled yesterday. We share the sense of disappointment that it is being debated in one of the final weeks of parliament. This is something that, as I said during my speech on the second reading, ideally we would have done years ago. The funding model of former Prime Minister John Howard was an unfair funding model. It grew the gap between public and private schools. As we know, public schools are where you find the most disadvantage being addressed, so that was a model that needed to be changed. To repeat the point that we made previously, someone who started primary school in the year that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was elected will have finished primary school under that unfair John Howard funding model, despite there being several years of a changed government. And they are probably going to finish high school before the full impact of this new package.


That leads to one of the concerns that we have had and that we will continue to pursue, which is reflected in an amendment that I circulated, which is that we are very concerned that, as we get closer to election time, we want to make sure that any model that finds its way into legislation is one where—especially if it is being back-ended for budgetary reasons—the money goes first of all to those who most need it, and that is the most disadvantaged public schools. In the light of the substantial amendments tabled by the government, it is not immediately clear how our proposed amendment in a technical sense would relate to the amendments proposed by the government, so I just want to indicate to the House and to the chair that the Greens will not be pursuing the amendment here. We will pursue the issue in the Senate after we have had a chance to digest how our amendment might relate to the proposed amendments of the government.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (10:25):  I am very pleased to rise to contribute briefly to this consideration-in-detail debate. The minister in his earlier remarks outlined a series of noble-sounding aspirations, and that is all very well. But I think it is perfectly reasonable for those of us on this side of the chamber to adopt the very sound principle that was articulated by former United States President Ronald Reagan when he said, 'Trust, but verify.' The purpose of a consideration-in-detail debate is to engage in that verification process, to see if the words and language of the bill before us give effect to the noble aspirations which have been stated by the minister and by the government. Based upon the experience of this government's performance in the time that it has been in office, you would be naive and credulous in the extreme if you took the government's representations at face value and failed to go through a detailed process of scrutiny of the actual provisions in the bill, consistent with the very purpose of a consideration-in-detail debate. So I hope the minister will not be offended if, while noting his statement of lofty aspirations, we on this side of the House insist on the opportunity to test the wording and detail of the bill so that we may understand its actual legal effect.


With that, I come first to amendment (1) on the government's list of amendments which has been circulated. That amendment would have the effect that, in the preamble on line 8, after the word 'succeed', we insert the words 'achieve his or her aspirations'. At the moment, as members would be aware, the relevant paragraph of the preamble reads:


All students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education, allowing each student to reach his or her full potential so that he or she can succeed and contribute fully to his or her community, now and in the future.


The amendment which has been proposed would insert after the word 'succeed' the words 'achieve his or her aspirations'. I am interested to understand the drafting intention behind the addition of the phrase 'achieve his or her aspirations'. I am interested to understand from the minister what the difference between 'succeed' and 'achieve his or her aspirations' is. I am interested to understand the government's thinking in the extent to which the preamble as presently worded is deficient in not including the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' and the benefit which is derived by adding the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' to the preamble. I am also interested to understand from the minister: what is the legal effect of including these words? On the other hand, what would the legal effect be if these words were not included?


I am also interested to understand the minister's perspective at perhaps a deeper level. I am interested to hear from the minister whether it is his view, underpinning the approach that has been taken in the drafting, that it is possible to succeed without achieving your aspirations.


I am interested also to understand, conversely, whether it is possible to 'achieve your aspirations' without 'succeeding', because I think it will assist the House in its assessment of the minister's drafting intentions in adding in the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' if we can understand the minister's view as to the difference between succeeding and achieving your aspirations.


I am also interested to understand from the minister the extent to which the present legislative and regulatory framework in the area of school education impedes students from, on the one hand, succeeding and, on the other hand, achieving their aspirations. I am also interested to understand from the minister—given that he is clearly a believer in legislation through the use of noble statements of intent—why he has not chosen to include such adverbs as, for example, 'fully succeeding' or 'comprehensively succeeding' or 'comprehensively achieving your aspirations' or, indeed, 'spectacularly'. Why has the minister not considered using the word 'spectacularly'?


Finally, I am interested to know why the minister thinks it makes sense to include these lofty aspirations in a bill. (Time expired)

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (10:31):  I want to raise some points with the minister about this matter because, even as I have been sitting here right now, I have received a letter emailed to me from a Catholic school principal in my electorate. I have not even had time to read it but I want to read the questions that Mrs Helen Kingsley from Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School in my electorate has raised about this matter in a letter to the Prime Minister that has just been sent to me.


Mrs Helen Kingsley asks for clarification about the following outstanding issues:


When will the final financial outcomes for each of the six years of the rollout, 2014 to 19 inclusive, for each of catholic school (both Catholic Education Commission and non-systemicly funded) be known?


Minister, can I have the answer. The second point she raises with the Prime Minister is:


Can you explain your claim on Sunday 19 May that the average non-government school in New South Wales will lose $800,000 if the new funding model is not at adopted?


I would like an explanation too, Minister. The third point Mrs Kingsley raises is:


What guarantees do we have that the full funding for the model will actually be found or delivered by 2019?


A very important question indeed, Minister. The final question Mrs Kingsley asks is:


How can the Commonwealth predict funding for 2016 at this stage given the 2015 review of indexation?


These are the concerns we are hearing all around the nation at the moment because of the lack of detail in this bill. I was on the inquiry into this bill and I want to record for the House that we had 10 pages in that bill to inquire into, which basically said, 'We believe that children are our future; teach them well and let them lead the way.' Minister, we all agree that is a great proposal for education in this country. But you have put forward 71 pages of amendments. All of the detail that matters to schools in this country is in that 71 pages. And you said 1 pm yesterday is enough time for Mrs Kingsley of the Catholic system in my electorate to consider the detail of your amendments. I can tell you, Minister, it was not.


My further question to you in this matter is: will you now allow the House to conduct a further inquiry into the actual detail of this bill, because every single witness that came before our inquiry said, 'We do not have sufficient detail'? You can read the dissenting report from our members here on this side, which explain to you that with 10 pages every single witness could not identify how the funding model would affect their system, their school or their sector. Every single witness said, 'We cannot talk to you about it because we are in confidential negotiations.' Every single witness came forward and said, 'Sorry, we do not have the detail about what will happen to school funding in Australia under this bill.' That is because they did not have the detail available to them. So that inquiry was a complete farce, and we were required to report before the 71 pages were made available. You required that inquiry to report to this House before we had seen the 71 pages of detail.


Minister, tell us: how can anyone in this chamber vote on this bill without having had a proper inquiry into the detail? I have already started to look through the 71 pages. I can tell you they are very complex. It would be unfair of me to ask you to explain the detail of your amendments, because I am sure at this stage you could not explain to this House the detail of those amendments on how the funding model works and how it affects each sector: the independent sector, the Catholic sector and all of the different education sectors affected by this bill.


Minister, if you cannot explain the amendments to this House and if we cannot explain then because we are just reading them for the first time today to understand what the loadings are, what the indexation is and how these affect each sector, and if the sector itself is writing to me as we speak in this chamber and asking serious questions about what the funding will mean for them—what these amendments will mean for them—how are we supposed to cast a vote on this bill? How are we supposed to cast a vote on this bill without a proper inquiry into its detail? You have provided significant detail on the funding, and we need the time to consider it. We need much more time to consider how it will impact on all the different schools in all of our electorates around the country.


Minister, if what you say is true and this is an important matter and it really means a lot to you—I noted in your second reading speech that you said 'right a moral wrong'—then certainly what you are doing is not the only goal. How you are going to do it is the purpose of legislation—how? And the 'how' you have not explained to this House. We have not had sufficient time to consider the amendments. The detail already appears to be quite complex. It is very complex for the schooling systems around Australia, and that complexity has been noted in media reports this morning. So, Minister, I have asked all of these questions, but will you allow for a further inquiry so that this House can consider the detail?

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:35):  I am mindful of the fact that we are hearing some commentary from coalition members on the other side of the House, and so I think it is useful for me to provide some context and information in relation to the matters that have been raised by members. I am happy to note the member for Melbourne's comments and to basically provide the assurance to him that the new schooling resource standard model, with the loadings that are identified in this legislation, provides the clearest possible commitment and delivery to students of need in our nation.


The fact is that the Gonski panel findings were an absolute challenge to us as Australians. They were a challenge because our school system was not in a position to deliver the best education to all students enrolled. It was a challenge because the gap between children from less well-off backgrounds and those from better backgrounds is very wide—in fact, it is the widest of equity gaps amongst comparative nations. For Australia, this is a crucial and important challenge, and the model which is identified clearly in these amendments goes to that very matter.


The member for Bradfield made an extremely confusing contribution around preambles and aspirations, and then asked me for my perspective on these matters. I am pretty happy to share my perspective with him, I have to say. The first thing I would share of my perspective is that the coalition, under the opposition leader and the member for Sturt, has shown no appreciable interest in, or commitment to, education reform by way of both investment or policy during the terms of the last two parliaments—and I include this parliament. Previously, we had commitments from them to cut education. They wanted to cut the teacher quality national partnership; they wanted to take $425 million away from it. They wanted to abandon the computers in schools program because that was a total waste of money. The program has been delivered by this government. In fact, this government has delivered more than the numbers originally contemplated. The coalition want to cut the trades training centre program. They want to take money from our neediest schools. We are in the process of delivering reforms like the national curriculum—which I know the member for Aston is aware of, although the opposition leader seems to think it has not been implemented. There is the My School website for greater transparency. There are the professional teaching standards and qualities. There has been nearly a doubling in appropriation investment by this parliament compared to the years when the coalition were in government. We have provided the resources, and they can be seen in schools right around the country and are no more than was provided during the Building the Education Revolution.


I go to many schools, so let me share my perspective of that with the members opposite. I have not been to a single school in this country where a principal or teacher has said to me anything other than, 'We are absolutely grateful for the fact that finally a federal Labor government has decided to invest in the infrastructure of our schools'—such as the covered outdoor learning areas and the improved science laboratories. With every single facility in those primary schools improvement has occurred. How many of you would go to those schools and gainsay that investment now? Very few, I would dare to suggest.


This was one of the most significant public infrastructure investments in education that we have ever seen, in record time, keeping this country from recession. That is what this government did, and at the same time delivering significant reforms, working with stakeholders, establishing an institute of teaching and school leadership, a curriculum and reporting authority whose rigour members opposite know delivers to students in this country the best possible curriculum that they can have. These are the sorts of commitments that this government has made and we have backed them up in the budget. We are willing to do the last and most important piece of work, which is a needs based funding system for students and schools around Australia.


The fact is that no school—no school—will be worse off as a consequence of our investment in A National Plan for School Improvement. Schools will be worse off only if the opposition leader tears up the agreements that we have already reached and seeks to block the agreements that we are currently engaged in and wanting to deliver for the good of students in states and territories right around Australia.




Mr Hawke:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. I seek leave to table a letter from Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School to the Prime Minister in relation to this education funding system model.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:41):  I now put on the record what a swindle these amendments are and this legislation is in attempting to pretend that it is introducing the recommendations of the Gonski report. The Gonski report required $6.5 billion of new spending each year to implement Mr Gonski's recommendations. Over the next four years, over the forward estimates, that would be $26 billion of new money. This government is delivering a $326 million cut to school funding alone in this budget over the forward estimates. This government is, in fact, taking money from schools over the forward estimates and in the never-never, in year 5 and in year 6, is attempting to get credit for apparently rivers of gold that will flow to schools in years 5 and 6 that are not even in the forward estimates.


To believe that, you have to suspend everything you know about the Prime Minister and this government. You have to suspend all the broken promises in the last six years to believe that in five or six years, outside the forward estimates, this government will be re-elected three times and will deliver rivers of gold to schools. What we do know is that in the next four years there is a $326 million cut to schools. That is not including cuts to universities, cuts to apprentices and traineeships and cuts to early childhood education. That all adds up to $4.7 billion. So the total cut to education in this budget is $5 billion. To claim that the government is trying to introduce Gonski reforms is a fraud and a swindle. That is the reason that David Gonski has been so silent on the government's legislation and amendments, because he does not want his good name to be associated with amendments that are not even close to, that are a pale imitation of, the Gonski reforms. If they were implementing the Gonski report they would be costing $26 billion over the forward estimates, but this government is delivering a $326 million cut to school funding over that time.


Do not just take my word for it. The whole sector is up in arms about the shemozzle that this minister is presiding over. Bishop Fisher, the chair of the Catholic Education Commission in New South Wales, wrote to the diocesan directors and principals of congregational schools, and he said:


This is a most unsatisfactory situation and this dissatisfaction has been strongly expressed by the National Catholic Education Commission to the Commonwealth government.


Further:


Compared to present funding mechanisms, the new model itself has become extremely complex and annually variable. It is made even more difficult for schools to predict future funding levels because so much of the model is based on loading which themselves involve poor or imprecise measures of student needs.


That is the Catholic Education Commission of New South Wales speaking on behalf of the National Catholic Education Commission.


The member for Mitchell has read into the Hansard record a letter from one of his local schools. I asked the minister last Thursday to answer a question that Mary MacKillop College in my electorate asked. It was a very simple question: how much in additional funds will Mary MacKillop College receive in 2014, 2015 and 2016? His answer was so vague that I gave him an extension of time that the parliament granted, over the objections of some of his colleagues, so that he could answer in the 4½ minutes he was given to answer that very simple question: how much money in additional funds will schools receive next year, when they have to pay their bills? They will not get to pay their bills in five years or six years. But this minister was entirely incapable of answering that question.



Hearing the minister answering that question was a little resonant of their pink batts disaster. It reminded me of his handling of the pink batts disaster. Now, 101 days from the election, he has his hand on the levers again. (Time expired)

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:46):  At the beginning of this debate about these amendments, the minister said that these 71 pages of amendments provide funding certainty for our schools. That is the claim that he made. I would like to put on the record that these amendments do no such thing. It is an extraordinary claim for the minister to make, because if these amendments did provide funding certainty, as he claims, then he would be able to tell every school in the nation exactly how much money they will receive next year and the year after and the year after and the year after that. But he cannot do that.


As the shadow minister, Christopher Pyne, pointed out, the minister was asked specifically in parliament only a few days ago, just in relation to one school, to inform the parliament what that one school would receive next year or the year after. Again, we do not know. When you look through these 71 pages of amendments, a framework is outlined and there are a lot of words. There are great complexities, formulas are introduced, but there is no detail for any school to determine how much money they will receive.


The reason for this is that there is so much complexity and there are so many loadings which have no consequential numbers attached to them. For example, there are supposed to be loadings in relation to location, in relation to the size of schools, in relation to disability and in relation to the capacity to pay. There are additional loadings for new and old per student amounts, but there is no detail. We do not know what those are. All we are given in these 71 pages of amendments are the base amounts. But for most schools that is just the beginning. If they were only to receive those base amounts then they would be significantly behind. That is particularly the case for the more remote schools. In your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, some of the remote schools will have per student funding of $50,000 or $60,000. There is no indication in these amendments that those schools will not have their funding slashed. All this document gives is an initial per student amount as base funding.


Perhaps we could be satisfied that there is not sufficient detail at this stage if it were the very beginning of the process towards school funding. But we are not at the beginning of the process. Far from it, we are 100 days from the next election, six months before the new school year and schools have to plan for their budgets. And, what is more, we have had a House of Representatives inquiry and we have had the Gonski inquiry going on for 18 months. But the most damning point in relation to this is that this has actually been a nine-year process, because nine years ago was the last time that the Labor government—that the Labor Party—had a school-funding model. Nine years ago!


We have waited nine years to get to this point. Nine years, so that schools would know what they would be entitled to under a Labor government. We know what the policy was nine years ago: that was laid out very clearly in election documents—incredibly clearly for everybody to see. It was known as the 'hit list'. But at least they were upfront and honest then in 2004. They said, very specifically—they were upfront and honest—that these schools would have their funding cut.


Now, nine years later, we are still waiting for what the policy will be. And in those nine years they have bagged the current policy up hill and down dale. Almost every year, every month, every week and every day they have criticised the SES funding model, but they have not come up with an alternative. And so we have been waiting.


And when the minister tabled the 71 pages of amendments yesterday, we thought, 'Finally, we will be able to see.' Finally! One hundred days before the election—six months before a new school year and 18 months after Gonski and our House of Representatives inquiry, we will finally get the details'. But there are no details here. Schools still do not know, and if the minister does know the answers then perhaps he can get up now and say how much money individual schools will get next year, and the year after and the year after that, because at the moment the only certainty we know is in the budget papers, and the budget papers say a funding cut of $345 million over four— (Time expired)

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:51):  I do want to take the opportunity to respond to some of the erroneous claims that have been made by the coalition in the course of this debate, and to reflect, as it were, on the fact that up to this point in time we have not seen any commitment from the coalition to education reform of any kind. Neither have we seen any commitment from the coalition to investment in schools.


In fact, what we do have is a commitment to a broken funding model—identified as broken by the Gonski panel itself. I was invited by one of those opposite to talk about where it is in the amendments that we give effect to the Gonski recommendations. Quite clearly, the amendments are about a schooling resource standard, plus loadings to be delivered to approved authorities—states and territories and non-government school bodies.


I will just read the recommendation of the Gonski panel itself. It is very straightforward and very clear in what it says—in particular:


The Australian Government and the states and territories, in consultation with the nongovernment sector, should develop and implement a schooling resource standard as the basis for general recurrent funding of government and non-government schools. The schooling resource standard should:


reflect the agreed outcomes and goals of schooling …


…   …   …


include amounts per primary and secondary student …


complement and help drive broader schooling reform to improve Australia’s overall performance and reduce inequity of outcomes.


That is absolutely what sits in these amendments to this bill. That is literally what it is about.


For the member for Sturt to come in here and say that, when in the budget papers there is quite clearly additional appropriation in the budget over time—considerable appropriation, that would see $14.5 billion delivered over six years on a two-for-one basis of effective partnership between the Commonwealth and the states—and to maintain that it is anything other than an increase in funding for schools is literally laughable. The shadow minister will say anything at all—that is true.


There is one other point that needs to be made here, and that is that we have, and we will continue, to be in constructive negotiations with states and territories and the non-government school sector, who stand to benefit considerably. For the independent school sector there is around $1 billion and for the Catholic system there is around $1.4 billion. My expectation is that as we reach agreements with those sectors over time, as we should, then we will be in a position to make clear what the benefits are for this National Plan for School Improvement.


When I hear those opposite assail the government on the basis of delivery in education, I think they must be living in a parallel universe where negativism is inherent and where no clear or rational thinking in a debate of this kind is actually delivered. I can see some students watching us here. I look for an example of how this legislation works. The example has been made public, but it is a useful one. Members have been shouting at us, asking, 'How does it work; what does it mean?' I am very happy to share it with them.


Let us look at an inner regional independent primary school of some 220 students. You take the school's characteristics, you look at the base SRS amount and you then see whether the loadings that are inherent in this model would be applied—loadings for low socioeconomic background, disability, the size of the school, its location and whether or not it has students who require additional support for English language proficiency. That is what is included in this legislation that is before the House and which we are now debating. But the fact is that the shadow minister just wants to oppose—that is all the coalition can do—for the sake of opposing. It does not go to the heart of what this will mean for schools and students around Australia.


If we as a nation lock in a funding model which meets the needs of students both now and into the future, we are not only locking in equity and fairness but driving the whole of the appropriation. Yes, there is additional investment, but it is about every single dollar and cent that we as governments spend on education, on a model that is focused on student need. The government have articulated those things which we think are necessary. We have reached agreement with the New South Wales government. We know that those bilateral agreements will reflect A National Plan for School Improvement and we know that those resources will be put to the best possible use they can.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:56):  Just to continue the theme of the government trying to swindle the Australian public on this so-called national agreement, we are debating 71 pages of amendments in the House today on the basis that two jurisdictions out of eight—New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory—have apparently agreed to this national agreement. Before the parliament rises, we will be passing these bills because the government, I assume, has the numbers. We rise on 27 June and, by 30 June, other states and territories may sign up. But there is no national agreement. We are being asked to pass bills on the basis that the minister is claiming that there is a national agreement to introduce a new school funding model. There is not. The non-government schools have not come out and said that they want this new school funding model. The Catholic schools in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and elsewhere have all raised specific concerns. The Independent Schools Council, the AISs in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and other states have all come out and raised concerns. Western Australia has indicated that they will not sign. Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory have all indicated that they will not sign. The South Australian budget is being handed down today. It will be very interesting to see whether there is any money in the South Australian budget to meet the expectations of the federal government of signing this national agreement. My hunch is that there will not be. So there will not be a national agreement. The non-government schools are not on board; the states and territories are not on board. Yet the government intends to ram these bills through the House and gag the debate today, when we have only had since yesterday to consider 71 pages of amendments.


It is no surprise that the government would want to do that, because what is hidden in this new school funding model? It is referred to in part 7 of the amendments that we received yesterday, under the heading 'Implementation plans,' and it is also explained more clearly in the explanatory memorandum:


The amendments also provide the Minister with a residual power to give approved authorities directions in relation to their implementation plans, for example, where an approved authority is not undertaking the activities it has committed to. In deciding whether to give such a direction the Minister must have regard to any relevant education agreement that the approved authority is a party to such as the National Education Reform Agreement or the National Education Agreement.


What does that mean in layman's language? It means that any state or territory or non-government school sector that signs up to this national agreement, and which is implemented, will be handing over the most unprecedented powers to the federal minister for education in Australia's education history.


No wonder the Labor government wants this bill to go through, because then the federal minister for education would love to be able to tell the states and territories how to run their schools. He would love to be able to say to the Catholic systems, which Labor has always hated and opposed violently since 1963. They did not introduce the funding of non-government schools, the Menzies government did. And ever since then, ever since 1963, every bit of Labor government policy when it has been in power has been to try to undermine the funding of non-government schools, particularly Catholic schools.


This legislation, these amendments, will allow the minister for education to say to the Catholic systems: 'If you intend to vary the national model we have established, you need to get agreement from the federal minister for education.' So if the Catholic systems want to say that St Ignatius' Riverview will cross-subsidise St Monica's down the road in their system, they will have to get agreement from the federal minister for education. And every time they vary their system, they will have to go to the federal government to get agreement to do that. If I was a Catholic principal, if I was a Catholic educator in one of the Catholic education commissions, I would not be handing over my power to the federal minister to distribute amongst the Catholic schools in the way they have done for decades so that local parish schools can be cross-subsidised by wealthier, high-end Catholic schools.


It is not just for the Catholic schools though, of course. Every independent school is handing over this power to the federal minister for education, and every state and territory. And that is one of the reasons they will not sign up. (Time expired)

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:01):  I see the minister for education sitting at the table. Minister, I am the member for Forrest, and that is in the south-west of Western Australia. My schools today would be looking at these amendments, if they can download them, and they would find, like so many in this chamber, that basically this group of amendments to them is as clear as mud. It is as clear as mud for them. This does not give them any certainty at all. In fact I repeat: this gives my schools in the south-west of Western Australia no clear idea of what you are intending; this is as clear as mud for them.


We have had these amendments for such a short time. Bunbury Catholic College would be really interested; they would be flipping through this saying, 'You know, what does this actually mean for Bunbury Catholic College?' I defy them to be able to send me an email right now and tell me exactly what this means for them. At the Georgiana Molloy Anglican School, a very good school in my electorate, I know the principal there, Ted Kosicki, would be looking through this and he would be saying, 'What does this actually mean for Georgiana Molloy Anglican School?' I am sure that is what he would be thinking—well, I am not really sure, according to this. I cannot find a list that says this is what GMAS is going to receive. There is nothing in here for my schools.


And yet—after what is an absolutely shambolic process that we have seen here—let us face it, Minister: government is supposed to be about process. That is what we understand on this side—that is, that good government is about good process. But we have had six years of a shambles and a circus, a circus and a shambles, and it is almost, to me, as though this is just a dreadful indictment on a very serious issue. We on this side take education extremely seriously, but in dropping these amendments on the table just yesterday, a short time away from an election, I ask: how important is education really to this government? They come in here and make incredible statements, but when you look at the facts the opposite is the case. The government could have done this, as we know, such a long time ago. Gonski, that they talk about so much: we hear that it has gone from a noun to a verb and back—that is interesting for schools—but what we do know—



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




Ms MARINO:
  Yes, it is an interesting thing for schools to debate about Gonski: is it a noun, is it a verb? And that seems about the extent of the government's concern about education in this nation. To introduce this at this point shows contempt, as does throwing 71 pages of amendments at us, the opposition, and saying, 'You have to pass this.' I would liken it to this: what is our duty of care to our schools? It is to actually scrutinise this in detail, as the shadow minister needs to do; to look at this and say, 'What exactly does this mean for every school in our country?' But we are not being given the opportunity to do so. Clearly this government does not place that value on our schools, and certainly not on the schools in my electorate.


There has been such a complete lack of detail and it is truly, as we have heard from the shadow minister, a swindle. We know that the funding is not in the forward estimates. The funding is simply not there. The Australian people, they understand this government; they understand that you cannot believe a thing that this government says. So why on earth would you believe anything that they would say about education—particularly when you look at the process the government has used? Gonski was delivered at the end of 2011. Here we are, almost two years later, on the eve of an election with a couple of weeks left of parliament, and the minister comes in and says, 'There's 71 pages and we want you to pass them now.' But for my own schools in the south-west of Western Australia—and I suspect some of them will be watching this debate with no idea what any of this mean for them—it is as I said: when my principals in my schools read these documents they are as clear as mud, and yet here we have a minister who is saying to us, 'Tick and flick.' That is not how the schools in this nation work, and it certainly is not the way that we as an opposition work, Minister. We do not tick and flick because we know there is nothing that this government says that can be trusted, and we certainly know, in looking at the budget figures, there is no money in the budget for what you are proposing.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (11:07):  I respond to the comments made by the minister who dismissed my previous contribution in relation to the first amendment to this bill, the Australian Education Bill 2012, that the government has moved and who, in a hand-waving way, described it as 'confusing' and had nothing more to say. The point that I am making is that the minister has included, within both the bill and now the amendments, many pages of worthy aspirations. It would seem from the amendments that the government is moving that it was not satisfied with the first several pages of worthy aspirations and wanted to add some more.


In my view, this is a meaningless exercise with no legal validity. The inclusion of these many pages of statements will not affect one iota the way that a court interprets the substantive provisions of the legislation. As I read the bill I see that is also the government's view, because proposed section 10 of the bill—prior to the amendments being moved—states:


This Act does not create rights or duties that are legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.


I have two specific questions for the minister, because I have not been able to work them out myself in the time available. Will proposed section 10 still stand after the amendments are moved, assuming they are accepted? Will proposed section 10 stand in relation to every provision of the bill or, as I presume is more likely, in relation to the preamble and some other clauses? I would like an answer to those questions. More broadly, the question I am asking the minister to address, which to date he has simply dismissed by describing my contribution as 'confusing', is: what is the substantive point of the many pages of wafty and lofty statements of aspiration contained in the original bill which are expanded upon, in ways I have already commented on, in the amendments? Also, what is the work which is done by the further amendments to these statements of high-minded and desirable aspirations?


To put the question another way, in language that lawyers often use, what work do these words do? If you put language into a contract, if you put language into a bill, you do so because it is intended to have a legal effect. The words are intended to do some work. I do not know whether the minister practised as a lawyer but I know that he has a law degree, so I assume he will understand the point I am making. What is the work which these words do? Could the minister explain it to the House and could he explain further the effect of the amendments? If the government has moved amendments it presumably thinks they are intended to have a purpose. Therefore, in a consideration in detail stage the minister ought to be able to explain to the House what that purpose is. He ought to be able to explain to the House why he considers it is appropriate that the parliament should pass into law a bill which contains these words.


There are many serious concerns we on this side of the House have about the bill and the 70-plus pages of amendments which are before the House. We have very serious questions about process; we have very serious questions about the government's bona fides; we have very serious questions about whether this bill does what the government claims it does. Our concerns are only heightened by the appalling process in which the government has dropped 70 pages of amendments on us with only a few hours to analyse them. I also have—as I am sure my colleagues have—other serious questions, and one of my serious questions is: what is the purpose of this high-minded statement of aspirations when proposed section 10 of the original bill says this act does not create legally enforceable obligations? Could the minister please explain how that clause will now apply in relation to the preamble and other parts of the bill? Could the minister please explain the purpose of these high-minded provisions and how precisely the government expects the court to interpret them?

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:12):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill. This is what it has come to with this government. All that time telling the people of Australia about the education revolution has come down to a nine-page bill and a 71-page amendment. The sum total of consultation or committee for this series of amendments is zero. After six years in government, with education at the core of what our current Prime Minister said was at her heart, this is what the government has given us. This government should hang its head in shame.


Education funding is already very complex, and this makes it ridiculous. I always found in sales meetings that the sales guy who had not made a sale or who had nothing to add always went on with the most detail. These amendments show that this minister has not been across the detail. He has not made the sale. Otherwise, he would be able to come in here and explain these things to us. His legacy will be one of failure.


I have some questions for the minister. Can the minister tell me what additional funds individual schools will get in 2014 as compared to 2013? If so, can he supply a list of my schools and get me those numbers? If not, why not, and how can any school budget for anything next year? What does the National Plan for School Improvement do that the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority could not do or does not already do? In an era of quality control and best practice, how does this bill address the issue of teacher performance in areas of: (1) classroom management; (2) content delivery; and (3) monitoring and feedback of student progress given that research identifies that the teacher—that is, teacher quality—is a key factor for student success?


Should my son's school principal or the Principal of Mundingburra State School apply for a loan now on the strength of this funding model for the dollars the minister says will come after three more elections? If the government were a bank would it take on the loan on the proviso that the principal and interest will become payable only if the government comes good with its funding? If not, why not?


As an organisation, how much extra funding can the Townsville diocese of Catholic education expect in funding from this government each year from 2014? If a teacher is performing above and beyond what is reasonably expected, how does a principal in this model reward that teacher? If a teacher is not performing anywhere near the standard required, how does a principal in this model counsel that teacher? And, inevitably, how does he get rid of that teacher if they are not suited to the work? Does this bill make that easier?


The minister before raised the issue of computers in schools. I would also like to ask the minister what provision in the budget has come for the replacement of those schools that were bought out? What provision has come for the replacement of all those computers that you put into high schools in Queensland—or have you just passed that on to the state government for them to pick up? What should you do?


We have seen what they have done to the home insulation business. We see what they are doing to the telecommunications industry at present. Please: let's pull back from here, because this is folly. This is untested. This is partisan politics at its worst. Not one state education minister has seen this document. The private, Catholic, Christian and independent schools have not seen this document, and neither have their concerns been answered by this increasingly erratic and desperate minister.


We should be building communities of learning. Instead you are ripping $2.8 billion out of the university sector and you cannot tell me if the money raised by the parents at St Joseph's The Strand's Beach-A-Thon will count against them in this rubbish amendment. The problem we have here is that you are not giving any certainty. Schools are not the place for an experiment. Schools are not the place to experiment with funding models. We must have certainty. Schools must have certainty. Go into my son's school or Mundingburra State School and explain to the teacher's aide that their funding next year or the year after has been cut, because that is what the principal has to do. Of course when you go to a school everyone is telling you what a good job you have done. Bloody hell! You have to look beyond that to what is actually happening out there. This minister should hang his head in shame.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (11:16):  I have spent three months on an inquiry with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment looking at the Australian Education Bill 2012—the first version, or the version without amendments, it must be said; the 1,400 words, the aspirational bill—and I have not come across one person, including the members of the coalition, who seriously disliked the bill. But, of course, it was an aspirational bill, and largely there is nothing in it. So we have had three months looking at a bill that said nothing, and now, at the eleventh hour of this parliament—some could say, in fact, five minutes to midnight for this parliament—the government brings in 71 pages of amendments to that bill, still with no clarity about what it means in individual dollars for individual schools. It does have funding formulas in there; but, of course, we cannot fill out the Xs and Ys in an algebraic fashion to know exactly what that funding means. We are given no time at all to discuss, to discover, to explore what these amendments mean for Australian schools.


I consider it my responsibility as deputy chair of that committee to make sure that legislation we do not fully understand is not passed through this place. It is the committee's job to explore the bills so they can explain to the parliament what it is that changes markedly, that changes the way we do business in Australia—in this case, the way we do business in the education sector. Quite seriously I cannot give that advice to the parliament. Our dissenting members' report, for instance, highlighted the lack of detail and lack of good process where the government seem to be virtually thumbing their nose at the parliament, saying, 'We have the numbers.' That is the only thing that matters at the end of the day. 'We have the numbers,' and we presume that sometime today the government are going shut off the debate on this bill and use those numbers to push the bill through the parliament when we do not know what it means and neither does any school in Australia.


It has been a great frustration to the committee throughout that inquiry that, while some of the leading educators in Australia have come to speak to us, those very few that were inside the beltway and had some idea of where the negotiations were going were not at liberty to discuss those negotiations with the committee that is supposed to report to the parliament and give advice on how this bill is going to affect their everyday lives. The rest of the contributors just do not know. They do not have any idea. There is absolute confusion out there. Most of those in the education sector are being asked to take the government at trust. If the last three years have taught us anything about this government, it is that you cannot trust them. You cannot trust their word. They say not only 'Trust us on this bill, and it will be alright on 1 January next year' but also 'Trust us; we're going to take $300 million out of education, but you're going to be better off in five years time.' That is the kind of trust the government is asking schools and the education sector to take them on. Quite clearly the members of the coalition on the education and employment committee could not recommend that this bill be passed on that basis.


We asked that the bill lie on the table until the detail is provided. Apparently about 12 hours ago the minister provided the detail, but we have not yet had the opportunity to have a look at that detail. As we expressed in our dissenting report, we believe strongly that, once that detail is provided, it should come back to the education and employment committee to reconsider and not have a 24-hour, 48-hour or three-day inquiry as many of the bills in the education and employment sector that are being referred back to that committee in this time are. It should have a genuine inquiry that will give the educators and the schooling systems of Australia the opportunity to fully explore what this legislation means for them—what these amendments mean. As of today, as far as I know, they do not know, and that is a very serious concern for all educators in Australia.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (11:21):  All of us in this place would agree that the greatest asset of our nation is our young people. The current generation and future generations deserve nothing but the best. We would all agree that their future and reaching their fullest potential will depend on many factors and one of these factors is their education. We all agree on the significance of education for their future, but it is about priorities. It is about how money is spent. The focus ought to be on teacher quality. It ought to be on pedagogy. Teachers and educators in my community in the electorate of Macquarie are telling me on a daily basis that it is how teachers are trained and mentored and how they are connected with the teaching environment once they are trained.


The minister is saying that drawing out the best of future generations—the gifts, the talents, the abilities and the strengths—is about more money. Well, all of us in this place, having looked at the budget closely, understand that that there is no additional money in the budget; in fact there is less. So how can the minister come into this place and claim that he is committed to the future education of our people? I do not think so. The current bill does not cater for the diversity in the non-government sector. We have moved an amendment to supplement the definitions in this bill, to define both systemic and non-systemic schools. We have not seen the minister respond to these issues adequately.


Looking at these amendments, there are some more questions. The 71 pages of amendments to this bill actually raise more questions than they give us answers. The minister talks today about buildings. He mentioned how significant the buildings revolution, as he called it, was. However, again let me focus on what the educators in my community are telling me. While buildings may be of assistance, they do not really bring change. It is the people inside the buildings that bring change, and that is where the investment ought to go.


What is deeply concerning about the bill here is that there are a number of sections that give power to the minister in a way that we have never seen before—power for the minister to intervene in school systems that distribute money according to the various needs of their students and their schools. The minister again says today that he is concerned about meeting the needs of students, but how can a minister in Canberra really know what is needed across a particular system? The Parramatta diocese, which looks after the students in the Catholic schools in my electorate, understands the needs of all its communities. It has new schools, large schools, smaller schools, isolated schools—the list goes on. But there are some sections about giving the minister power that are deeply concerning. Proposed section 81 in division 2 talks about variation or revocation of approval on a minister's own initiative, and this is very deeply concerning. I will just read proposed subsection (2) of that, because I think the minister needs to answer questions about what this means for individual schools and individual systems:


Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister may vary an approved authority’s approval by making the approval subject to one or more conditions, and the approved authority must comply with those conditions.


Please clarify all the conditions that could be imposed or removed.


What is important here is that there needs to be a level of trust, firstly, in the government—well, there is none. With all due respect to the minister, we do not trust what you or your government say, and the people of my electorate, the electorate of Macquarie, do not either. You have broken so many promises. Dollars have not added up, and this is no different. Then you introduce a bill with no transparency, no consultation and no opportunity for us to consult with our local schools and our local communities. You expect us to read it in a brief period of time while we are standing here about to debate, and then you want to interfere in schools' autonomy and their ability to make decisions. (Time expired)

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:26):  I just want to take the opportunity to respond briefly to some of the contributions that we have heard from the coalition and to clarify some matters for them, as it is clear that they have not been paying attention closely. That is a pity, because this is a very important piece of legislation which is an expression of the desire of this government to see students funded on the basis of need across our schooling sectors.


Very quickly, I say to the member for Bradfield, who raised the question about the legal capacity that we might have to understand those matters that are in front of us: I assure you that we do. It is a great pity that the member for Bradfield did not take more time to read these amendments carefully before he started producing spurious and slightly dubious legalistic arguments from the other side of the House. But I just take him to amendment (12) on page 21 of the amendments that have been delivered to him, where the omission of clause 10, the 'not legally enforceable clause', is provided for. I am sorry to point this out in such a basic way to the member, but if he is going to stand up in the federal parliament and start playing bush lawyer then he had better be across those matters to which he is referring. He clearly was not in this case.


In relation to the questions that were put by the member for Macquarie and others, on the issue of ministerial discretion and direction under the bill, I just make the point that, firstly, similar to the Schools Assistance Act, the Australian Education Bill does give the minister power to make decisions and determinations and give direction, and they are necessary powers to give full effect to the legislation. But as a safeguard, where the minister has these powers, decisions are not made without regard to what is defined in the bill as relevant arrangements. The point is that that is defined in the bill. It is a written arrangement between the Commonwealth and an authority. It relates to the grants of financial assistance provided in accordance with the act. For a participating government school, it is the National Education Reform Agreement, and that is absolutely straightforward. For non-participating governments, it is the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. For the Catholic sector, for example, it would be a memorandum of understanding agreed with the state-based Catholic education commission. Remember that states and the non-government sector are afforded added protection through the appeals and review process in the legislation. It is considerably more robust than existing arrangements, so you actually have more safeguards in this bill.


So I really query the point that is being made by those opposite. It may be that we have a bunch of political cliches searching for a solution here, but you have to read the amendments to understand that and look at it closely. This is a consequence of stakeholder engagement. I say this to the shadow minister: significant additional concessions have been given to address the concerns that stakeholders had by adding the requirement for the minister to have regard for relevant arrangements when exercising certain powers. By the time we went through the second consultation process, the reference to the requirements had been made more extensively and now appear at section 22, section 58, section 59, section 65, section 73, section 81, section 106 and section 110. 


The fact is that in this legislation the powers of the minister are now clearly set out in the legislation as opposed to the current arrangements where the minister has broad discretions under various of funding arrangements. So, these new arrangements, I say to those opposite, increase transparency and give stronger legal protections for the funding recipients, and that is as it should be.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (11:30):  There are a few more issues that need to be ventilated before the government attempts to gag this debate. I have heard that they intend to gag it in about four or five minutes from now. It would be an absolutely extraordinary act to gag a debate on 71 pages of amendments that the opposition and the Independents received yesterday after less than an hour and a half's debate. I hope that rumour is not true. 


In the agreement that the government has signed and has proposed that other states sign, the National Education Reform Agreement—in schedule H—there is a very interesting measure that is called the capacity to contribute. It says:


The anticipated level of private contribution will be based on a school’s SES score until a new, individual measure of parental capacity to contribute is developed.


We know that this is to be developed by 2017 for implementation in 2017, so an individual measure of parental capacity to contribute will replace the SES score in 2017. And individual parental capacity to contribute can only mean one thing—that is, that parents of children in non-government schools will be means-tested to see what their capacity to contribute is to their local school. 


When I raised this issue, the minister said that what that meant is an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute. But if it is an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute, why doesn't it say an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute? It does not say aggregate, because it is not aggregate; it is individual, and individual parental capacity to contribute can only be a means test on parents of non-government schools. 


The minister can duck and weave and spin his wheels as much as he likes. Parents, when they hear 'individual parental capacity to contribute', hear means test. So I say to the Independents and the Labor members who intend to support this new school funding model and I say to the states and territories who have signed up to it or are thinking of signing up to it: understand you are signing up to a national reform agreement on schools that requires you to be a party to means-testing parents in non-government schools. No amount of spin and obfuscation from the minister can deny the fact that, if this was meant to be an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute to the schooling of their children, then it would say aggregate. It says individual because that is what the government means to implement—a means test from 2017. 


I know there are members of the Labor caucus who support Catholic schooling, in spite of their party's longstanding opposition to non-government schooling, because they believe in choice for parents. They are signing up—John Murphy in Reid would be one of them; he is being asked to sign up to a new reform agreement that will introduce means tests on his parents in non-government schools. 


The sector is so concerned about what the government is proposing that in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald on 5 June, Geoff Newcombe, the executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales said: 


The data is so rubbery. We're going to do a quality assurance on the data with the government to try and fix where it's obviously incorrect


This is six months from when the new system is designed to be implemented. 


I have already talked about the National Catholic Education Commission and Mary McKillop College in my own electorate, and most members would have letters from Catholic schools. The Australian Parents Council have expressed their concern. The Independent Education Union have expressed their concern, and we have the Catholics, independents, the Independent Education Union, the Australian Parents Council and individual principals all asking for more information, all asking to delay the process so they can get it right. But the government is deaf to them, and the minister has said in his rebuttal to my points that the argument that they are cutting is not true. 


I asked a question three weeks ago about this particular chart. It shows that the cuts to education—

 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:37):  I want to finally respond to some of the additional misplaced and incorrect contributions that we have heard from the coalition, and in particular from a very heated member for Sturt.


The first thing to say is that the preamble expressly identifies, recognises and acknowledges non-government school systems. So those views that have been put by members opposite on that matter are incorrect. The fact is that, if there is any risk or threat to funding for government and non-government schools, it lies in a continuation with the current broken funding model that would see $16.2 billion less going to schools over time. That was recognised by Minister Piccoli when he said specifically—and after all he is a National Party education minister—that the status quo would see New South Wales worse off.


In the absence of any real policy for the future, what we have now is very clearly in front of us a bill that enshrines what we have been talking about and working on with state governments, territory governments and the non-government school sector for a considerable period of time. The fact is that the community has moved on from sectoral debates; it has moved on from the kind of half-hearted scare campaign about alleged means-testing in the model—which is not there at all. The community has moved on, and this bill enshrines what we have been talking about as a government; making sure that every student gets the support in their education that they need and deserve. And we have been prepared to back it in the budget with over $9 billion of investment. If you add that to the states, who want to see this National Plan for School Improvement, we would see $14.5 billion in investment going to schools in the future.


I note that even today Mr Innes Willox of the Australian Industry Group is reported as recommending the principles of the National Plan for School Improvement, the Gonski recommendations. He said that they are fundamentally sound and he wants to see governments deliver them. That is a rational response; not like the constant cavilling, carry-on and caterwauling that we have heard from those opposite.


This bill is about better schools for all Australians. That is what we want to see happen right now. That is what the parliament will vote on, and that is what the parliament will deliver.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:40):  Equity in education matters. And this is a really important contribution to that principle of equity. I have been chased up hill and down dale about a certain 17-minute speech, but anyone who listened beyond about the 10-minute mark would have heard me talking about the importance of equity in education and the clear failures in the education data around rural students, Aboriginal students and low-SES families. So I am thrilled that we are actually seeing that education data being addressed in a substantive way. That is why this legislation does need to progress through this chamber. That is why state sovereignty as promoted in the budget in reply should be protected and endorsed in an agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and that is why my judgement call is that this should progress through this chamber relatively swiftly this morning.


I am listening to this debate and I am seeing people get up for a second and a third time and in many ways repeating messages of a political kind rather than drilling down on the detail. It is a pretty simple proposal before the House. We either accept the education data or we do not. If we do accept the education data, we are accepting a massive failure of public policy. So, righto; if we accept there is a problem, what is the solution? The Gonski process identified an 'intolerable link' between the education data and the funding formula. So either we accept that link or we do not. We accept that it is tolerable or intolerable. Once we have got across that very simple hurdle, we accept loadings and a new funding formula or we do not.


We can complain about 70 pages and we can complain about what schools know what level of detail, but in the end it is a pretty simple question before the House: is there a problem in our education data? Yes. Is there an intolerable link that has been identified? Yes. Is the solution to put in place loadings specific to regionality, Aboriginality and to socioeconomic status? That is the question before the House. I think everyone has had a crack at second reads; everyone has had a crack in this debate this morning. And I know I am going to get a bucketful from the shadow minister in the chair—




Mr Pyne:
  We only got the amendments yesterday, you fool.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt is warned.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  but we have a backlog over the next two weeks of 50 bills. We have been around the buoy of arguments in this debate on numerous occasions. It is a pretty simple question before the House. Rather than the government moving a gag motion, I am going to do it myself. I am going to express my no confidence in the shadow minister in the chair and I move:

The SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt has been warned. The doors are open. I remind the member for Sturt of something which he should know by now: he is not covered by privilege in that time. I only came into the chair because I was appalled at his behaviour to one of the deputies before me. And the member for Higgins can show some respect.




Mr Tudge:

The SPEAKER:  The member for Aston should have been listening to my warning to the member for Sturt, if he wants to be here for a vote. I can assure him he will not be if he continues the way he is going. The question is that the question be now put.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:08):  Now begins a long a process in the House of considering in detail the 71 pages of amendments the government dropped into the parliament yesterday. I say at the outset that the sheer incompetence of this government in trying to implement a new school funding model has been quite breathtaking. It has been like watching a passenger jet slamming into the deck of an aircraft carrier which has just hit an iceberg.


The Gonski report was handed to the government in late 2011. It was published in February 2012. We are now in parliament in June 2013 with the school funding model due to run out on 31 December this year, yet the government is still trying to get agreement to a new school funding model—six months before it is supposed to take effect.


It is quite impossible for this government to implement a new school-funding model competently in the time that it has given itself. If this government were competent, if it understood good public policy, if it were not obsessively inwardly focused, it would have been doing this last year. It would have been going through the process methodically and calmly like adults in the room, rather than threatening and shouting with megaphone diplomacy to the states and the non-government sector.


In this particular instance, late last year the government introduced a nine-page bill, a bill full of platitudes, called the Australian Education Bill—a nine-page bill with no detail—which they expected the parliament to debate and which we have been dutifully debating. Yesterday, without any notice to me as the shadow minister, without giving me the courtesy of delivering these amendments to my office, they dropped 71 pages of detailed amendments into the parliament which they expected to debate and pass at five o'clock last night. The minister insists that my office had these amendments delivered to it. It did not. There is no record in my office of these amendments appearing at any point yesterday. In fact, to get access to these amendments, my office had to download them from ParlInfo so that I had access to them. So, whatever the department or his office is telling the minister, I have no record of ever receiving these amendments.


There are 71 pages of detailed amendments introducing a complicated new funding model—much more complicated than the model we have had since the year 2000. There is so much detail in these amendments that it is utterly outrageous for the government to expect the parliament to consider them and pass them in a matter of hours. The normal process, if this government had not given up governing already, would have been to have introduced these amendments, to have consulted with the shadow minister and to have given at least a week or two for the Independents and the coalition to consider these amendments and come to a position. Instead, this government has given up governing. It is just trying to tick boxes and it thinks that an asinine debate about a new school-funding model rushed through this chamber will somehow repair its stocks with the public. What would repair its stocks with the public is a government of adults that actually governed for the good of the country rather than an inwardly obsessive government worried about its own political survival.


I will over the course of this debate go through in detail many of the concerns that the coalition has about this new school-funding model. But, before I get to the detail of the amendments, which I will go through, I will mention another part of the process, and that is that the sector itself has been shut down with confidentiality agreements that would make the Committee of Public Safety in revolutionary France blush with its heavy-handedness and its draconian measures. The non-government sector has not had the opportunity to speak to its sector, as any government would expect it to do, because of those confidentiality agreements.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:13):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 consideration in detail. We have just heard from the shadow minister about process. There is no process in this particular bill, as we have seen since it was first brought to the chamber back in late 2012. Since then we have been preparing speeches, and I finally got to speak on it on Monday. I am seriously concerned about the shadow minister's health. I know he has been running around trying to deal with this bill, deal with the minister and deal with all the schools and the stakeholders involved in this, and I am seriously concerned about the process that he has had to deal with. I am sure he will be up to it and I am sure he will make sure that he takes the argument to the government and makes sure that all the stakeholders involved in this bill are greatly represented in this chamber. I know Deputy Speaker Oakeshott is big on representation in this chamber.


The government's handling of this bill has been chaotic and shambolic—a debacle. As I said in my speech on the second reading speech, the bill had no proper detail and would have been better suited as a press release rather than a bill in this place. As we heard from the shadow minister yesterday, at five o'clock 71 pages of amendments were produced. The document is that large that we cannot even download it through ParlInfo.


Through that process, we have gone from a bill with no detail contained in it to a situation where the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is moving detailed and complex amendments to the bill at the eleventh hour—it is probably nearly the twelfth hour. It is good that the minister took the coalition's advice on board and introduced more content into the bill. But he should have done so from the start and not at this late stage of consideration. We now have these detailed amendments in front of us that the House has had very little time to consider. This means that coalition members have had no opportunity to talk with our local communities, to schools or with state governments about the amendments moved by the government.


It is particularly disappointing that I will not have the opportunity to speak with local schools in my electorate of Swan in Western Australia, about these changes because, as usual, with anything to do with this government, Western Australia comes out the worst. I know that parents and students at Lathlain Primary School will be disappointed that I have not had an opportunity to talk with them when they will lose, according to reports in the local papers, $466,316 in funding, thanks to the government's proposed changes. I hope that the minister will come to Western Australia, go to Lathlain Primary School and tell them why they are going to loss $466,316 out of their budget because of this bill.


These tactics are symptomatic of this government. It is always about politics rather than achieving well-thought through and lasting reforms to our education sector. When the minister treats the parliament like this, it is clear to schools, parents and students—like those at Lathlain Primary School—that they are the ones who lose. Parents and students at Wesley College, Penrhos College, Como Secondary College and the East Victoria Park Primary School are all reportedly under threat of losing large chunks of funding under these changes. I see the minister smiling; I am sure that they will not be happy about losing their funding under this particular system. I am sure that they would all like proper scrutiny of these changes, especially when it is their futures that are under threat. The government has still refused to hand over individual school information to the sector for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16, despite repeated requests.


There is simply no excuse for the chaos and no excuse for the government to be ramming through these changes without proper scrutiny from the parliament and all stakeholders. The only strategy here is getting through the election. There is still no notional agreement on these changes. This is important, as it is the states and territories that run our schools. But the federal government, which does not run any schools and does not employ one teacher, thinks that it is okay to ram through changes like this without the support of the states. That is farcical. The Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, said, 'Why would I want to hand over control of the schools in Western Australia to the federal government?' Victoria have allocated no money in their budget for these new measures. South Australia, a Labor state, have refused to confirm if they will allocated money in their budget today for these measures.


The budget papers give us an insight into Labor's true plans for education. What the government does not want the Australian public to work out is that most of the money being promised under this new model will not flow until two or three elections away. The new model is less transparent than the old model and, given the track record of the government when it comes to keeping their promises and telling the truth—especially when it comes to budget figures—the states and territories and the Australian public can be forgiven for being highly sceptical of the government's proposals. I repeat my invite to the minister to come to Western Australia and to Swan and talk to the schools in my electorate that are going to lose out.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:18):  The first thing to say is that this is a truly important day for the parliament in terms of education reform. It is a day when we will see enshrined in legislation a new needs-based funding model for schools and students across Australia. In relation to the debate that we are having here, it ought to be a debate that focuses on why it was that the Gonski panel made the recommendations that they did; how the government has responded to those recommendations after significant consultation and discussion with states, territories and non-government organisations; how crucial and critical it is that we put in place these funding arrangements to meet the needs of students and schools around Australia; and how urgent it is for other states and territories to work closely with the Commonwealth as we deliver this significant reform.


In relation to the spray that we just had from the member for Sturt, I remind the member that the amendments were circulated at 1.20 yesterday afternoon. If it is the case that your internal processes are so poorly organised that they do not get a single amendment to you then I do not think that you can come in and blame us for that particular issue. That responsibility lies with your party in this parliament. It should organise itself properly. Those amendments were circulated. I want to make clear that we have also now made available draft regulations for the bill for consideration at this time as well.


But we should not be surprised by the spray from the member for Sturt, because he has sprayed from day one. Not only did he walk out 22 or 23 minutes after the Gonski panel brought down its recommendations and its findings and dismissed them out of hand but, when the New South Wales government agreed with the approach that was taken by this government to work to those recommendations to deliver a new national plan for school improvement, he then went on to say that in fact the New South Wales Premier had been conned.


The use of colourful language by the member for Sturt is recognised both here and further afield; after all, he was the one who described the goal that is set and that we have enshrined in the National Plan for School Improvement, which is to be in the top five of education nations by 2025, as mad. At no point in the debate over a period of more than 12 months has he ever participated constructively in moving this reform through the parliaments of Australia through their budgets to be delivered to the 9,350 or so schools and 3½ million students or so for whom it is intended. There has not been a single instance on the record where we have had construction engagement from the opposition on education.


The shadow minister gets up and says, 'We're trying to reach agreement.' I will remind him that we have reached agreement with New South Wales. The Liberal Premier was very clear about it: he signed up to the deal because 'it provides additional resources, fairer distribution, to deliver higher standards and better outcomes in schools across New South Wales'. That is what he said. The education minister likewise said, 'It's wrong to suggest'—as the shadow minister on a couple of occasions—'that indexation under the present model would be high.'


The fact is that the New South Wales Premier and the New South Wales education minister looked at these propositions, spent the time—as we have with other states and territories and non-government school organisations—in working through what a new funding model would look like and then committed to it. They did that because there is more money, money that is provided in the budget to deliver this reform. It does not matter how many times the shadow minister runs his lines out, either here or outside, the fact is that it is in the budget. That is the offer that is on the table from the Prime Minister. And it is a two-for-one offer for states and territories.


I say to the member that this is an important piece of legislation and that these amendments not only reflect the discussion, consultation and consideration that we have had of this issue for a considerable period of time but also finally provide for once and for all the opportunity for schools around Australia to be funded on the basis of the needs of their students, whatever school they are in, wherever they live, however much money their parents earn.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-06-05,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:23):  The Greens are also working through the amendments that were tabled yesterday. We share the sense of disappointment that it is being debated in one of the final weeks of parliament. This is something that, as I said during my speech on the second reading, ideally we would have done years ago. The funding model of former Prime Minister John Howard was an unfair funding model. It grew the gap between public and private schools. As we know, public schools are where you find the most disadvantage being addressed, so that was a model that needed to be changed. To repeat the point that we made previously, someone who started primary school in the year that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was elected will have finished primary school under that unfair John Howard funding model, despite there being several years of a changed government. And they are probably going to finish high school before the full impact of this new package.


That leads to one of the concerns that we have had and that we will continue to pursue, which is reflected in an amendment that I circulated, which is that we are very concerned that, as we get closer to election time, we want to make sure that any model that finds its way into legislation is one where—especially if it is being back-ended for budgetary reasons—the money goes first of all to those who most need it, and that is the most disadvantaged public schools. In the light of the substantial amendments tabled by the government, it is not immediately clear how our proposed amendment in a technical sense would relate to the amendments proposed by the government, so I just want to indicate to the House and to the chair that the Greens will not be pursuing the amendment here. We will pursue the issue in the Senate after we have had a chance to digest how our amendment might relate to the proposed amendments of the government.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (10:25):  I am very pleased to rise to contribute briefly to this consideration-in-detail debate. The minister in his earlier remarks outlined a series of noble-sounding aspirations, and that is all very well. But I think it is perfectly reasonable for those of us on this side of the chamber to adopt the very sound principle that was articulated by former United States President Ronald Reagan when he said, 'Trust, but verify.' The purpose of a consideration-in-detail debate is to engage in that verification process, to see if the words and language of the bill before us give effect to the noble aspirations which have been stated by the minister and by the government. Based upon the experience of this government's performance in the time that it has been in office, you would be naive and credulous in the extreme if you took the government's representations at face value and failed to go through a detailed process of scrutiny of the actual provisions in the bill, consistent with the very purpose of a consideration-in-detail debate. So I hope the minister will not be offended if, while noting his statement of lofty aspirations, we on this side of the House insist on the opportunity to test the wording and detail of the bill so that we may understand its actual legal effect.


With that, I come first to amendment (1) on the government's list of amendments which has been circulated. That amendment would have the effect that, in the preamble on line 8, after the word 'succeed', we insert the words 'achieve his or her aspirations'. At the moment, as members would be aware, the relevant paragraph of the preamble reads:


All students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education, allowing each student to reach his or her full potential so that he or she can succeed and contribute fully to his or her community, now and in the future.


The amendment which has been proposed would insert after the word 'succeed' the words 'achieve his or her aspirations'. I am interested to understand the drafting intention behind the addition of the phrase 'achieve his or her aspirations'. I am interested to understand from the minister what the difference between 'succeed' and 'achieve his or her aspirations' is. I am interested to understand the government's thinking in the extent to which the preamble as presently worded is deficient in not including the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' and the benefit which is derived by adding the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' to the preamble. I am also interested to understand from the minister: what is the legal effect of including these words? On the other hand, what would the legal effect be if these words were not included?


I am also interested to understand the minister's perspective at perhaps a deeper level. I am interested to hear from the minister whether it is his view, underpinning the approach that has been taken in the drafting, that it is possible to succeed without achieving your aspirations.


I am interested also to understand, conversely, whether it is possible to 'achieve your aspirations' without 'succeeding', because I think it will assist the House in its assessment of the minister's drafting intentions in adding in the words 'achieve his or her aspirations' if we can understand the minister's view as to the difference between succeeding and achieving your aspirations.


I am also interested to understand from the minister the extent to which the present legislative and regulatory framework in the area of school education impedes students from, on the one hand, succeeding and, on the other hand, achieving their aspirations. I am also interested to understand from the minister—given that he is clearly a believer in legislation through the use of noble statements of intent—why he has not chosen to include such adverbs as, for example, 'fully succeeding' or 'comprehensively succeeding' or 'comprehensively achieving your aspirations' or, indeed, 'spectacularly'. Why has the minister not considered using the word 'spectacularly'?


Finally, I am interested to know why the minister thinks it makes sense to include these lofty aspirations in a bill. (Time expired)

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (10:31):  I want to raise some points with the minister about this matter because, even as I have been sitting here right now, I have received a letter emailed to me from a Catholic school principal in my electorate. I have not even had time to read it but I want to read the questions that Mrs Helen Kingsley from Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School in my electorate has raised about this matter in a letter to the Prime Minister that has just been sent to me.


Mrs Helen Kingsley asks for clarification about the following outstanding issues:


When will the final financial outcomes for each of the six years of the rollout, 2014 to 19 inclusive, for each of catholic school (both Catholic Education Commission and non-systemicly funded) be known?


Minister, can I have the answer. The second point she raises with the Prime Minister is:


Can you explain your claim on Sunday 19 May that the average non-government school in New South Wales will lose $800,000 if the new funding model is not at adopted?


I would like an explanation too, Minister. The third point Mrs Kingsley raises is:


What guarantees do we have that the full funding for the model will actually be found or delivered by 2019?


A very important question indeed, Minister. The final question Mrs Kingsley asks is:


How can the Commonwealth predict funding for 2016 at this stage given the 2015 review of indexation?


These are the concerns we are hearing all around the nation at the moment because of the lack of detail in this bill. I was on the inquiry into this bill and I want to record for the House that we had 10 pages in that bill to inquire into, which basically said, 'We believe that children are our future; teach them well and let them lead the way.' Minister, we all agree that is a great proposal for education in this country. But you have put forward 71 pages of amendments. All of the detail that matters to schools in this country is in that 71 pages. And you said 1 pm yesterday is enough time for Mrs Kingsley of the Catholic system in my electorate to consider the detail of your amendments. I can tell you, Minister, it was not.


My further question to you in this matter is: will you now allow the House to conduct a further inquiry into the actual detail of this bill, because every single witness that came before our inquiry said, 'We do not have sufficient detail'? You can read the dissenting report from our members here on this side, which explain to you that with 10 pages every single witness could not identify how the funding model would affect their system, their school or their sector. Every single witness said, 'We cannot talk to you about it because we are in confidential negotiations.' Every single witness came forward and said, 'Sorry, we do not have the detail about what will happen to school funding in Australia under this bill.' That is because they did not have the detail available to them. So that inquiry was a complete farce, and we were required to report before the 71 pages were made available. You required that inquiry to report to this House before we had seen the 71 pages of detail.


Minister, tell us: how can anyone in this chamber vote on this bill without having had a proper inquiry into the detail? I have already started to look through the 71 pages. I can tell you they are very complex. It would be unfair of me to ask you to explain the detail of your amendments, because I am sure at this stage you could not explain to this House the detail of those amendments on how the funding model works and how it affects each sector: the independent sector, the Catholic sector and all of the different education sectors affected by this bill.


Minister, if you cannot explain the amendments to this House and if we cannot explain then because we are just reading them for the first time today to understand what the loadings are, what the indexation is and how these affect each sector, and if the sector itself is writing to me as we speak in this chamber and asking serious questions about what the funding will mean for them—what these amendments will mean for them—how are we supposed to cast a vote on this bill? How are we supposed to cast a vote on this bill without a proper inquiry into its detail? You have provided significant detail on the funding, and we need the time to consider it. We need much more time to consider how it will impact on all the different schools in all of our electorates around the country.


Minister, if what you say is true and this is an important matter and it really means a lot to you—I noted in your second reading speech that you said 'right a moral wrong'—then certainly what you are doing is not the only goal. How you are going to do it is the purpose of legislation—how? And the 'how' you have not explained to this House. We have not had sufficient time to consider the amendments. The detail already appears to be quite complex. It is very complex for the schooling systems around Australia, and that complexity has been noted in media reports this morning. So, Minister, I have asked all of these questions, but will you allow for a further inquiry so that this House can consider the detail?

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:35):  I am mindful of the fact that we are hearing some commentary from coalition members on the other side of the House, and so I think it is useful for me to provide some context and information in relation to the matters that have been raised by members. I am happy to note the member for Melbourne's comments and to basically provide the assurance to him that the new schooling resource standard model, with the loadings that are identified in this legislation, provides the clearest possible commitment and delivery to students of need in our nation.


The fact is that the Gonski panel findings were an absolute challenge to us as Australians. They were a challenge because our school system was not in a position to deliver the best education to all students enrolled. It was a challenge because the gap between children from less well-off backgrounds and those from better backgrounds is very wide—in fact, it is the widest of equity gaps amongst comparative nations. For Australia, this is a crucial and important challenge, and the model which is identified clearly in these amendments goes to that very matter.


The member for Bradfield made an extremely confusing contribution around preambles and aspirations, and then asked me for my perspective on these matters. I am pretty happy to share my perspective with him, I have to say. The first thing I would share of my perspective is that the coalition, under the opposition leader and the member for Sturt, has shown no appreciable interest in, or commitment to, education reform by way of both investment or policy during the terms of the last two parliaments—and I include this parliament. Previously, we had commitments from them to cut education. They wanted to cut the teacher quality national partnership; they wanted to take $425 million away from it. They wanted to abandon the computers in schools program because that was a total waste of money. The program has been delivered by this government. In fact, this government has delivered more than the numbers originally contemplated. The coalition want to cut the trades training centre program. They want to take money from our neediest schools. We are in the process of delivering reforms like the national curriculum—which I know the member for Aston is aware of, although the opposition leader seems to think it has not been implemented. There is the My School website for greater transparency. There are the professional teaching standards and qualities. There has been nearly a doubling in appropriation investment by this parliament compared to the years when the coalition were in government. We have provided the resources, and they can be seen in schools right around the country and are no more than was provided during the Building the Education Revolution.


I go to many schools, so let me share my perspective of that with the members opposite. I have not been to a single school in this country where a principal or teacher has said to me anything other than, 'We are absolutely grateful for the fact that finally a federal Labor government has decided to invest in the infrastructure of our schools'—such as the covered outdoor learning areas and the improved science laboratories. With every single facility in those primary schools improvement has occurred. How many of you would go to those schools and gainsay that investment now? Very few, I would dare to suggest.


This was one of the most significant public infrastructure investments in education that we have ever seen, in record time, keeping this country from recession. That is what this government did, and at the same time delivering significant reforms, working with stakeholders, establishing an institute of teaching and school leadership, a curriculum and reporting authority whose rigour members opposite know delivers to students in this country the best possible curriculum that they can have. These are the sorts of commitments that this government has made and we have backed them up in the budget. We are willing to do the last and most important piece of work, which is a needs based funding system for students and schools around Australia.


The fact is that no school—no school—will be worse off as a consequence of our investment in A National Plan for School Improvement. Schools will be worse off only if the opposition leader tears up the agreements that we have already reached and seeks to block the agreements that we are currently engaged in and wanting to deliver for the good of students in states and territories right around Australia.




Mr Hawke:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. I seek leave to table a letter from Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School to the Prime Minister in relation to this education funding system model.


Leave not granted.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:41):  I now put on the record what a swindle these amendments are and this legislation is in attempting to pretend that it is introducing the recommendations of the Gonski report. The Gonski report required $6.5 billion of new spending each year to implement Mr Gonski's recommendations. Over the next four years, over the forward estimates, that would be $26 billion of new money. This government is delivering a $326 million cut to school funding alone in this budget over the forward estimates. This government is, in fact, taking money from schools over the forward estimates and in the never-never, in year 5 and in year 6, is attempting to get credit for apparently rivers of gold that will flow to schools in years 5 and 6 that are not even in the forward estimates.


To believe that, you have to suspend everything you know about the Prime Minister and this government. You have to suspend all the broken promises in the last six years to believe that in five or six years, outside the forward estimates, this government will be re-elected three times and will deliver rivers of gold to schools. What we do know is that in the next four years there is a $326 million cut to schools. That is not including cuts to universities, cuts to apprentices and traineeships and cuts to early childhood education. That all adds up to $4.7 billion. So the total cut to education in this budget is $5 billion. To claim that the government is trying to introduce Gonski reforms is a fraud and a swindle. That is the reason that David Gonski has been so silent on the government's legislation and amendments, because he does not want his good name to be associated with amendments that are not even close to, that are a pale imitation of, the Gonski reforms. If they were implementing the Gonski report they would be costing $26 billion over the forward estimates, but this government is delivering a $326 million cut to school funding over that time.


Do not just take my word for it. The whole sector is up in arms about the shemozzle that this minister is presiding over. Bishop Fisher, the chair of the Catholic Education Commission in New South Wales, wrote to the diocesan directors and principals of congregational schools, and he said:


This is a most unsatisfactory situation and this dissatisfaction has been strongly expressed by the National Catholic Education Commission to the Commonwealth government.


Further:


Compared to present funding mechanisms, the new model itself has become extremely complex and annually variable. It is made even more difficult for schools to predict future funding levels because so much of the model is based on loading which themselves involve poor or imprecise measures of student needs.


That is the Catholic Education Commission of New South Wales speaking on behalf of the National Catholic Education Commission.


The member for Mitchell has read into the Hansard record a letter from one of his local schools. I asked the minister last Thursday to answer a question that Mary MacKillop College in my electorate asked. It was a very simple question: how much in additional funds will Mary MacKillop College receive in 2014, 2015 and 2016? His answer was so vague that I gave him an extension of time that the parliament granted, over the objections of some of his colleagues, so that he could answer in the 4½ minutes he was given to answer that very simple question: how much money in additional funds will schools receive next year, when they have to pay their bills? They will not get to pay their bills in five years or six years. But this minister was entirely incapable of answering that question.



Hearing the minister answering that question was a little resonant of their pink batts disaster. It reminded me of his handling of the pink batts disaster. Now, 101 days from the election, he has his hand on the levers again. (Time expired)

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:46):  At the beginning of this debate about these amendments, the minister said that these 71 pages of amendments provide funding certainty for our schools. That is the claim that he made. I would like to put on the record that these amendments do no such thing. It is an extraordinary claim for the minister to make, because if these amendments did provide funding certainty, as he claims, then he would be able to tell every school in the nation exactly how much money they will receive next year and the year after and the year after and the year after that. But he cannot do that.


As the shadow minister, Christopher Pyne, pointed out, the minister was asked specifically in parliament only a few days ago, just in relation to one school, to inform the parliament what that one school would receive next year or the year after. Again, we do not know. When you look through these 71 pages of amendments, a framework is outlined and there are a lot of words. There are great complexities, formulas are introduced, but there is no detail for any school to determine how much money they will receive.


The reason for this is that there is so much complexity and there are so many loadings which have no consequential numbers attached to them. For example, there are supposed to be loadings in relation to location, in relation to the size of schools, in relation to disability and in relation to the capacity to pay. There are additional loadings for new and old per student amounts, but there is no detail. We do not know what those are. All we are given in these 71 pages of amendments are the base amounts. But for most schools that is just the beginning. If they were only to receive those base amounts then they would be significantly behind. That is particularly the case for the more remote schools. In your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, some of the remote schools will have per student funding of $50,000 or $60,000. There is no indication in these amendments that those schools will not have their funding slashed. All this document gives is an initial per student amount as base funding.


Perhaps we could be satisfied that there is not sufficient detail at this stage if it were the very beginning of the process towards school funding. But we are not at the beginning of the process. Far from it, we are 100 days from the next election, six months before the new school year and schools have to plan for their budgets. And, what is more, we have had a House of Representatives inquiry and we have had the Gonski inquiry going on for 18 months. But the most damning point in relation to this is that this has actually been a nine-year process, because nine years ago was the last time that the Labor government—that the Labor Party—had a school-funding model. Nine years ago!


We have waited nine years to get to this point. Nine years, so that schools would know what they would be entitled to under a Labor government. We know what the policy was nine years ago: that was laid out very clearly in election documents—incredibly clearly for everybody to see. It was known as the 'hit list'. But at least they were upfront and honest then in 2004. They said, very specifically—they were upfront and honest—that these schools would have their funding cut.


Now, nine years later, we are still waiting for what the policy will be. And in those nine years they have bagged the current policy up hill and down dale. Almost every year, every month, every week and every day they have criticised the SES funding model, but they have not come up with an alternative. And so we have been waiting.


And when the minister tabled the 71 pages of amendments yesterday, we thought, 'Finally, we will be able to see.' Finally! One hundred days before the election—six months before a new school year and 18 months after Gonski and our House of Representatives inquiry, we will finally get the details'. But there are no details here. Schools still do not know, and if the minister does know the answers then perhaps he can get up now and say how much money individual schools will get next year, and the year after and the year after that, because at the moment the only certainty we know is in the budget papers, and the budget papers say a funding cut of $345 million over four— (Time expired)

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:51):  I do want to take the opportunity to respond to some of the erroneous claims that have been made by the coalition in the course of this debate, and to reflect, as it were, on the fact that up to this point in time we have not seen any commitment from the coalition to education reform of any kind. Neither have we seen any commitment from the coalition to investment in schools.


In fact, what we do have is a commitment to a broken funding model—identified as broken by the Gonski panel itself. I was invited by one of those opposite to talk about where it is in the amendments that we give effect to the Gonski recommendations. Quite clearly, the amendments are about a schooling resource standard, plus loadings to be delivered to approved authorities—states and territories and non-government school bodies.


I will just read the recommendation of the Gonski panel itself. It is very straightforward and very clear in what it says—in particular:


The Australian Government and the states and territories, in consultation with the nongovernment sector, should develop and implement a schooling resource standard as the basis for general recurrent funding of government and non-government schools. The schooling resource standard should:


reflect the agreed outcomes and goals of schooling …


…   …   …


include amounts per primary and secondary student …


complement and help drive broader schooling reform to improve Australia’s overall performance and reduce inequity of outcomes.


That is absolutely what sits in these amendments to this bill. That is literally what it is about.


For the member for Sturt to come in here and say that, when in the budget papers there is quite clearly additional appropriation in the budget over time—considerable appropriation, that would see $14.5 billion delivered over six years on a two-for-one basis of effective partnership between the Commonwealth and the states—and to maintain that it is anything other than an increase in funding for schools is literally laughable. The shadow minister will say anything at all—that is true.


There is one other point that needs to be made here, and that is that we have, and we will continue, to be in constructive negotiations with states and territories and the non-government school sector, who stand to benefit considerably. For the independent school sector there is around $1 billion and for the Catholic system there is around $1.4 billion. My expectation is that as we reach agreements with those sectors over time, as we should, then we will be in a position to make clear what the benefits are for this National Plan for School Improvement.


When I hear those opposite assail the government on the basis of delivery in education, I think they must be living in a parallel universe where negativism is inherent and where no clear or rational thinking in a debate of this kind is actually delivered. I can see some students watching us here. I look for an example of how this legislation works. The example has been made public, but it is a useful one. Members have been shouting at us, asking, 'How does it work; what does it mean?' I am very happy to share it with them.


Let us look at an inner regional independent primary school of some 220 students. You take the school's characteristics, you look at the base SRS amount and you then see whether the loadings that are inherent in this model would be applied—loadings for low socioeconomic background, disability, the size of the school, its location and whether or not it has students who require additional support for English language proficiency. That is what is included in this legislation that is before the House and which we are now debating. But the fact is that the shadow minister just wants to oppose—that is all the coalition can do—for the sake of opposing. It does not go to the heart of what this will mean for schools and students around Australia.


If we as a nation lock in a funding model which meets the needs of students both now and into the future, we are not only locking in equity and fairness but driving the whole of the appropriation. Yes, there is additional investment, but it is about every single dollar and cent that we as governments spend on education, on a model that is focused on student need. The government have articulated those things which we think are necessary. We have reached agreement with the New South Wales government. We know that those bilateral agreements will reflect A National Plan for School Improvement and we know that those resources will be put to the best possible use they can.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:56):  Just to continue the theme of the government trying to swindle the Australian public on this so-called national agreement, we are debating 71 pages of amendments in the House today on the basis that two jurisdictions out of eight—New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory—have apparently agreed to this national agreement. Before the parliament rises, we will be passing these bills because the government, I assume, has the numbers. We rise on 27 June and, by 30 June, other states and territories may sign up. But there is no national agreement. We are being asked to pass bills on the basis that the minister is claiming that there is a national agreement to introduce a new school funding model. There is not. The non-government schools have not come out and said that they want this new school funding model. The Catholic schools in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and elsewhere have all raised specific concerns. The Independent Schools Council, the AISs in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and other states have all come out and raised concerns. Western Australia has indicated that they will not sign. Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory have all indicated that they will not sign. The South Australian budget is being handed down today. It will be very interesting to see whether there is any money in the South Australian budget to meet the expectations of the federal government of signing this national agreement. My hunch is that there will not be. So there will not be a national agreement. The non-government schools are not on board; the states and territories are not on board. Yet the government intends to ram these bills through the House and gag the debate today, when we have only had since yesterday to consider 71 pages of amendments.


It is no surprise that the government would want to do that, because what is hidden in this new school funding model? It is referred to in part 7 of the amendments that we received yesterday, under the heading 'Implementation plans,' and it is also explained more clearly in the explanatory memorandum:


The amendments also provide the Minister with a residual power to give approved authorities directions in relation to their implementation plans, for example, where an approved authority is not undertaking the activities it has committed to. In deciding whether to give such a direction the Minister must have regard to any relevant education agreement that the approved authority is a party to such as the National Education Reform Agreement or the National Education Agreement.


What does that mean in layman's language? It means that any state or territory or non-government school sector that signs up to this national agreement, and which is implemented, will be handing over the most unprecedented powers to the federal minister for education in Australia's education history.


No wonder the Labor government wants this bill to go through, because then the federal minister for education would love to be able to tell the states and territories how to run their schools. He would love to be able to say to the Catholic systems, which Labor has always hated and opposed violently since 1963. They did not introduce the funding of non-government schools, the Menzies government did. And ever since then, ever since 1963, every bit of Labor government policy when it has been in power has been to try to undermine the funding of non-government schools, particularly Catholic schools.


This legislation, these amendments, will allow the minister for education to say to the Catholic systems: 'If you intend to vary the national model we have established, you need to get agreement from the federal minister for education.' So if the Catholic systems want to say that St Ignatius' Riverview will cross-subsidise St Monica's down the road in their system, they will have to get agreement from the federal minister for education. And every time they vary their system, they will have to go to the federal government to get agreement to do that. If I was a Catholic principal, if I was a Catholic educator in one of the Catholic education commissions, I would not be handing over my power to the federal minister to distribute amongst the Catholic schools in the way they have done for decades so that local parish schools can be cross-subsidised by wealthier, high-end Catholic schools.


It is not just for the Catholic schools though, of course. Every independent school is handing over this power to the federal minister for education, and every state and territory. And that is one of the reasons they will not sign up. (Time expired)

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:01):  I see the minister for education sitting at the table. Minister, I am the member for Forrest, and that is in the south-west of Western Australia. My schools today would be looking at these amendments, if they can download them, and they would find, like so many in this chamber, that basically this group of amendments to them is as clear as mud. It is as clear as mud for them. This does not give them any certainty at all. In fact I repeat: this gives my schools in the south-west of Western Australia no clear idea of what you are intending; this is as clear as mud for them.


We have had these amendments for such a short time. Bunbury Catholic College would be really interested; they would be flipping through this saying, 'You know, what does this actually mean for Bunbury Catholic College?' I defy them to be able to send me an email right now and tell me exactly what this means for them. At the Georgiana Molloy Anglican School, a very good school in my electorate, I know the principal there, Ted Kosicki, would be looking through this and he would be saying, 'What does this actually mean for Georgiana Molloy Anglican School?' I am sure that is what he would be thinking—well, I am not really sure, according to this. I cannot find a list that says this is what GMAS is going to receive. There is nothing in here for my schools.


And yet—after what is an absolutely shambolic process that we have seen here—let us face it, Minister: government is supposed to be about process. That is what we understand on this side—that is, that good government is about good process. But we have had six years of a shambles and a circus, a circus and a shambles, and it is almost, to me, as though this is just a dreadful indictment on a very serious issue. We on this side take education extremely seriously, but in dropping these amendments on the table just yesterday, a short time away from an election, I ask: how important is education really to this government? They come in here and make incredible statements, but when you look at the facts the opposite is the case. The government could have done this, as we know, such a long time ago. Gonski, that they talk about so much: we hear that it has gone from a noun to a verb and back—that is interesting for schools—but what we do know—



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




Ms MARINO:
  Yes, it is an interesting thing for schools to debate about Gonski: is it a noun, is it a verb? And that seems about the extent of the government's concern about education in this nation. To introduce this at this point shows contempt, as does throwing 71 pages of amendments at us, the opposition, and saying, 'You have to pass this.' I would liken it to this: what is our duty of care to our schools? It is to actually scrutinise this in detail, as the shadow minister needs to do; to look at this and say, 'What exactly does this mean for every school in our country?' But we are not being given the opportunity to do so. Clearly this government does not place that value on our schools, and certainly not on the schools in my electorate.


There has been such a complete lack of detail and it is truly, as we have heard from the shadow minister, a swindle. We know that the funding is not in the forward estimates. The funding is simply not there. The Australian people, they understand this government; they understand that you cannot believe a thing that this government says. So why on earth would you believe anything that they would say about education—particularly when you look at the process the government has used? Gonski was delivered at the end of 2011. Here we are, almost two years later, on the eve of an election with a couple of weeks left of parliament, and the minister comes in and says, 'There's 71 pages and we want you to pass them now.' But for my own schools in the south-west of Western Australia—and I suspect some of them will be watching this debate with no idea what any of this mean for them—it is as I said: when my principals in my schools read these documents they are as clear as mud, and yet here we have a minister who is saying to us, 'Tick and flick.' That is not how the schools in this nation work, and it certainly is not the way that we as an opposition work, Minister. We do not tick and flick because we know there is nothing that this government says that can be trusted, and we certainly know, in looking at the budget figures, there is no money in the budget for what you are proposing.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (11:07):  I respond to the comments made by the minister who dismissed my previous contribution in relation to the first amendment to this bill, the Australian Education Bill 2012, that the government has moved and who, in a hand-waving way, described it as 'confusing' and had nothing more to say. The point that I am making is that the minister has included, within both the bill and now the amendments, many pages of worthy aspirations. It would seem from the amendments that the government is moving that it was not satisfied with the first several pages of worthy aspirations and wanted to add some more.


In my view, this is a meaningless exercise with no legal validity. The inclusion of these many pages of statements will not affect one iota the way that a court interprets the substantive provisions of the legislation. As I read the bill I see that is also the government's view, because proposed section 10 of the bill—prior to the amendments being moved—states:


This Act does not create rights or duties that are legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.


I have two specific questions for the minister, because I have not been able to work them out myself in the time available. Will proposed section 10 still stand after the amendments are moved, assuming they are accepted? Will proposed section 10 stand in relation to every provision of the bill or, as I presume is more likely, in relation to the preamble and some other clauses? I would like an answer to those questions. More broadly, the question I am asking the minister to address, which to date he has simply dismissed by describing my contribution as 'confusing', is: what is the substantive point of the many pages of wafty and lofty statements of aspiration contained in the original bill which are expanded upon, in ways I have already commented on, in the amendments? Also, what is the work which is done by the further amendments to these statements of high-minded and desirable aspirations?


To put the question another way, in language that lawyers often use, what work do these words do? If you put language into a contract, if you put language into a bill, you do so because it is intended to have a legal effect. The words are intended to do some work. I do not know whether the minister practised as a lawyer but I know that he has a law degree, so I assume he will understand the point I am making. What is the work which these words do? Could the minister explain it to the House and could he explain further the effect of the amendments? If the government has moved amendments it presumably thinks they are intended to have a purpose. Therefore, in a consideration in detail stage the minister ought to be able to explain to the House what that purpose is. He ought to be able to explain to the House why he considers it is appropriate that the parliament should pass into law a bill which contains these words.


There are many serious concerns we on this side of the House have about the bill and the 70-plus pages of amendments which are before the House. We have very serious questions about process; we have very serious questions about the government's bona fides; we have very serious questions about whether this bill does what the government claims it does. Our concerns are only heightened by the appalling process in which the government has dropped 70 pages of amendments on us with only a few hours to analyse them. I also have—as I am sure my colleagues have—other serious questions, and one of my serious questions is: what is the purpose of this high-minded statement of aspirations when proposed section 10 of the original bill says this act does not create legally enforceable obligations? Could the minister please explain how that clause will now apply in relation to the preamble and other parts of the bill? Could the minister please explain the purpose of these high-minded provisions and how precisely the government expects the court to interpret them?

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:12):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill. This is what it has come to with this government. All that time telling the people of Australia about the education revolution has come down to a nine-page bill and a 71-page amendment. The sum total of consultation or committee for this series of amendments is zero. After six years in government, with education at the core of what our current Prime Minister said was at her heart, this is what the government has given us. This government should hang its head in shame.


Education funding is already very complex, and this makes it ridiculous. I always found in sales meetings that the sales guy who had not made a sale or who had nothing to add always went on with the most detail. These amendments show that this minister has not been across the detail. He has not made the sale. Otherwise, he would be able to come in here and explain these things to us. His legacy will be one of failure.


I have some questions for the minister. Can the minister tell me what additional funds individual schools will get in 2014 as compared to 2013? If so, can he supply a list of my schools and get me those numbers? If not, why not, and how can any school budget for anything next year? What does the National Plan for School Improvement do that the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority could not do or does not already do? In an era of quality control and best practice, how does this bill address the issue of teacher performance in areas of: (1) classroom management; (2) content delivery; and (3) monitoring and feedback of student progress given that research identifies that the teacher—that is, teacher quality—is a key factor for student success?


Should my son's school principal or the Principal of Mundingburra State School apply for a loan now on the strength of this funding model for the dollars the minister says will come after three more elections? If the government were a bank would it take on the loan on the proviso that the principal and interest will become payable only if the government comes good with its funding? If not, why not?


As an organisation, how much extra funding can the Townsville diocese of Catholic education expect in funding from this government each year from 2014? If a teacher is performing above and beyond what is reasonably expected, how does a principal in this model reward that teacher? If a teacher is not performing anywhere near the standard required, how does a principal in this model counsel that teacher? And, inevitably, how does he get rid of that teacher if they are not suited to the work? Does this bill make that easier?


The minister before raised the issue of computers in schools. I would also like to ask the minister what provision in the budget has come for the replacement of those schools that were bought out? What provision has come for the replacement of all those computers that you put into high schools in Queensland—or have you just passed that on to the state government for them to pick up? What should you do?


We have seen what they have done to the home insulation business. We see what they are doing to the telecommunications industry at present. Please: let's pull back from here, because this is folly. This is untested. This is partisan politics at its worst. Not one state education minister has seen this document. The private, Catholic, Christian and independent schools have not seen this document, and neither have their concerns been answered by this increasingly erratic and desperate minister.


We should be building communities of learning. Instead you are ripping $2.8 billion out of the university sector and you cannot tell me if the money raised by the parents at St Joseph's The Strand's Beach-A-Thon will count against them in this rubbish amendment. The problem we have here is that you are not giving any certainty. Schools are not the place for an experiment. Schools are not the place to experiment with funding models. We must have certainty. Schools must have certainty. Go into my son's school or Mundingburra State School and explain to the teacher's aide that their funding next year or the year after has been cut, because that is what the principal has to do. Of course when you go to a school everyone is telling you what a good job you have done. Bloody hell! You have to look beyond that to what is actually happening out there. This minister should hang his head in shame.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (11:16):  I have spent three months on an inquiry with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment looking at the Australian Education Bill 2012—the first version, or the version without amendments, it must be said; the 1,400 words, the aspirational bill—and I have not come across one person, including the members of the coalition, who seriously disliked the bill. But, of course, it was an aspirational bill, and largely there is nothing in it. So we have had three months looking at a bill that said nothing, and now, at the eleventh hour of this parliament—some could say, in fact, five minutes to midnight for this parliament—the government brings in 71 pages of amendments to that bill, still with no clarity about what it means in individual dollars for individual schools. It does have funding formulas in there; but, of course, we cannot fill out the Xs and Ys in an algebraic fashion to know exactly what that funding means. We are given no time at all to discuss, to discover, to explore what these amendments mean for Australian schools.


I consider it my responsibility as deputy chair of that committee to make sure that legislation we do not fully understand is not passed through this place. It is the committee's job to explore the bills so they can explain to the parliament what it is that changes markedly, that changes the way we do business in Australia—in this case, the way we do business in the education sector. Quite seriously I cannot give that advice to the parliament. Our dissenting members' report, for instance, highlighted the lack of detail and lack of good process where the government seem to be virtually thumbing their nose at the parliament, saying, 'We have the numbers.' That is the only thing that matters at the end of the day. 'We have the numbers,' and we presume that sometime today the government are going shut off the debate on this bill and use those numbers to push the bill through the parliament when we do not know what it means and neither does any school in Australia.


It has been a great frustration to the committee throughout that inquiry that, while some of the leading educators in Australia have come to speak to us, those very few that were inside the beltway and had some idea of where the negotiations were going were not at liberty to discuss those negotiations with the committee that is supposed to report to the parliament and give advice on how this bill is going to affect their everyday lives. The rest of the contributors just do not know. They do not have any idea. There is absolute confusion out there. Most of those in the education sector are being asked to take the government at trust. If the last three years have taught us anything about this government, it is that you cannot trust them. You cannot trust their word. They say not only 'Trust us on this bill, and it will be alright on 1 January next year' but also 'Trust us; we're going to take $300 million out of education, but you're going to be better off in five years time.' That is the kind of trust the government is asking schools and the education sector to take them on. Quite clearly the members of the coalition on the education and employment committee could not recommend that this bill be passed on that basis.


We asked that the bill lie on the table until the detail is provided. Apparently about 12 hours ago the minister provided the detail, but we have not yet had the opportunity to have a look at that detail. As we expressed in our dissenting report, we believe strongly that, once that detail is provided, it should come back to the education and employment committee to reconsider and not have a 24-hour, 48-hour or three-day inquiry as many of the bills in the education and employment sector that are being referred back to that committee in this time are. It should have a genuine inquiry that will give the educators and the schooling systems of Australia the opportunity to fully explore what this legislation means for them—what these amendments mean. As of today, as far as I know, they do not know, and that is a very serious concern for all educators in Australia.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (11:21):  All of us in this place would agree that the greatest asset of our nation is our young people. The current generation and future generations deserve nothing but the best. We would all agree that their future and reaching their fullest potential will depend on many factors and one of these factors is their education. We all agree on the significance of education for their future, but it is about priorities. It is about how money is spent. The focus ought to be on teacher quality. It ought to be on pedagogy. Teachers and educators in my community in the electorate of Macquarie are telling me on a daily basis that it is how teachers are trained and mentored and how they are connected with the teaching environment once they are trained.


The minister is saying that drawing out the best of future generations—the gifts, the talents, the abilities and the strengths—is about more money. Well, all of us in this place, having looked at the budget closely, understand that that there is no additional money in the budget; in fact there is less. So how can the minister come into this place and claim that he is committed to the future education of our people? I do not think so. The current bill does not cater for the diversity in the non-government sector. We have moved an amendment to supplement the definitions in this bill, to define both systemic and non-systemic schools. We have not seen the minister respond to these issues adequately.


Looking at these amendments, there are some more questions. The 71 pages of amendments to this bill actually raise more questions than they give us answers. The minister talks today about buildings. He mentioned how significant the buildings revolution, as he called it, was. However, again let me focus on what the educators in my community are telling me. While buildings may be of assistance, they do not really bring change. It is the people inside the buildings that bring change, and that is where the investment ought to go.


What is deeply concerning about the bill here is that there are a number of sections that give power to the minister in a way that we have never seen before—power for the minister to intervene in school systems that distribute money according to the various needs of their students and their schools. The minister again says today that he is concerned about meeting the needs of students, but how can a minister in Canberra really know what is needed across a particular system? The Parramatta diocese, which looks after the students in the Catholic schools in my electorate, understands the needs of all its communities. It has new schools, large schools, smaller schools, isolated schools—the list goes on. But there are some sections about giving the minister power that are deeply concerning. Proposed section 81 in division 2 talks about variation or revocation of approval on a minister's own initiative, and this is very deeply concerning. I will just read proposed subsection (2) of that, because I think the minister needs to answer questions about what this means for individual schools and individual systems:


Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister may vary an approved authority’s approval by making the approval subject to one or more conditions, and the approved authority must comply with those conditions.


Please clarify all the conditions that could be imposed or removed.


What is important here is that there needs to be a level of trust, firstly, in the government—well, there is none. With all due respect to the minister, we do not trust what you or your government say, and the people of my electorate, the electorate of Macquarie, do not either. You have broken so many promises. Dollars have not added up, and this is no different. Then you introduce a bill with no transparency, no consultation and no opportunity for us to consult with our local schools and our local communities. You expect us to read it in a brief period of time while we are standing here about to debate, and then you want to interfere in schools' autonomy and their ability to make decisions. (Time expired)

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:26):  I just want to take the opportunity to respond briefly to some of the contributions that we have heard from the coalition and to clarify some matters for them, as it is clear that they have not been paying attention closely. That is a pity, because this is a very important piece of legislation which is an expression of the desire of this government to see students funded on the basis of need across our schooling sectors.


Very quickly, I say to the member for Bradfield, who raised the question about the legal capacity that we might have to understand those matters that are in front of us: I assure you that we do. It is a great pity that the member for Bradfield did not take more time to read these amendments carefully before he started producing spurious and slightly dubious legalistic arguments from the other side of the House. But I just take him to amendment (12) on page 21 of the amendments that have been delivered to him, where the omission of clause 10, the 'not legally enforceable clause', is provided for. I am sorry to point this out in such a basic way to the member, but if he is going to stand up in the federal parliament and start playing bush lawyer then he had better be across those matters to which he is referring. He clearly was not in this case.


In relation to the questions that were put by the member for Macquarie and others, on the issue of ministerial discretion and direction under the bill, I just make the point that, firstly, similar to the Schools Assistance Act, the Australian Education Bill does give the minister power to make decisions and determinations and give direction, and they are necessary powers to give full effect to the legislation. But as a safeguard, where the minister has these powers, decisions are not made without regard to what is defined in the bill as relevant arrangements. The point is that that is defined in the bill. It is a written arrangement between the Commonwealth and an authority. It relates to the grants of financial assistance provided in accordance with the act. For a participating government school, it is the National Education Reform Agreement, and that is absolutely straightforward. For non-participating governments, it is the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. For the Catholic sector, for example, it would be a memorandum of understanding agreed with the state-based Catholic education commission. Remember that states and the non-government sector are afforded added protection through the appeals and review process in the legislation. It is considerably more robust than existing arrangements, so you actually have more safeguards in this bill.


So I really query the point that is being made by those opposite. It may be that we have a bunch of political cliches searching for a solution here, but you have to read the amendments to understand that and look at it closely. This is a consequence of stakeholder engagement. I say this to the shadow minister: significant additional concessions have been given to address the concerns that stakeholders had by adding the requirement for the minister to have regard for relevant arrangements when exercising certain powers. By the time we went through the second consultation process, the reference to the requirements had been made more extensively and now appear at section 22, section 58, section 59, section 65, section 73, section 81, section 106 and section 110. 


The fact is that in this legislation the powers of the minister are now clearly set out in the legislation as opposed to the current arrangements where the minister has broad discretions under various of funding arrangements. So, these new arrangements, I say to those opposite, increase transparency and give stronger legal protections for the funding recipients, and that is as it should be.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (11:30):  There are a few more issues that need to be ventilated before the government attempts to gag this debate. I have heard that they intend to gag it in about four or five minutes from now. It would be an absolutely extraordinary act to gag a debate on 71 pages of amendments that the opposition and the Independents received yesterday after less than an hour and a half's debate. I hope that rumour is not true. 


In the agreement that the government has signed and has proposed that other states sign, the National Education Reform Agreement—in schedule H—there is a very interesting measure that is called the capacity to contribute. It says:


The anticipated level of private contribution will be based on a school’s SES score until a new, individual measure of parental capacity to contribute is developed.


We know that this is to be developed by 2017 for implementation in 2017, so an individual measure of parental capacity to contribute will replace the SES score in 2017. And individual parental capacity to contribute can only mean one thing—that is, that parents of children in non-government schools will be means-tested to see what their capacity to contribute is to their local school. 


When I raised this issue, the minister said that what that meant is an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute. But if it is an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute, why doesn't it say an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute? It does not say aggregate, because it is not aggregate; it is individual, and individual parental capacity to contribute can only be a means test on parents of non-government schools. 


The minister can duck and weave and spin his wheels as much as he likes. Parents, when they hear 'individual parental capacity to contribute', hear means test. So I say to the Independents and the Labor members who intend to support this new school funding model and I say to the states and territories who have signed up to it or are thinking of signing up to it: understand you are signing up to a national reform agreement on schools that requires you to be a party to means-testing parents in non-government schools. No amount of spin and obfuscation from the minister can deny the fact that, if this was meant to be an aggregate of parents' capacity to contribute to the schooling of their children, then it would say aggregate. It says individual because that is what the government means to implement—a means test from 2017. 


I know there are members of the Labor caucus who support Catholic schooling, in spite of their party's longstanding opposition to non-government schooling, because they believe in choice for parents. They are signing up—John Murphy in Reid would be one of them; he is being asked to sign up to a new reform agreement that will introduce means tests on his parents in non-government schools. 


The sector is so concerned about what the government is proposing that in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald on 5 June, Geoff Newcombe, the executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales said: 


The data is so rubbery. We're going to do a quality assurance on the data with the government to try and fix where it's obviously incorrect


This is six months from when the new system is designed to be implemented. 


I have already talked about the National Catholic Education Commission and Mary McKillop College in my own electorate, and most members would have letters from Catholic schools. The Australian Parents Council have expressed their concern. The Independent Education Union have expressed their concern, and we have the Catholics, independents, the Independent Education Union, the Australian Parents Council and individual principals all asking for more information, all asking to delay the process so they can get it right. But the government is deaf to them, and the minister has said in his rebuttal to my points that the argument that they are cutting is not true. 


I asked a question three weeks ago about this particular chart. It shows that the cuts to education—

  Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, it is not possible for you to ask whether leave is granted until the documents that I am asking to have tabled are heard by the minister. I could be asking to table one of his own speeches for which he might be prepared to give leave. Until I have finished going through this list, which is short, it is impossible to sit a member of the opposition down and put that question to the minister. I seek leave to table—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  If the Manager of Opposition Business would like to name the documents please go ahead.




Mr PYNE:
  Thank you, I would like to do that. That is the correct process: a letter from Mary McKillop College; the newsletter of the Australian Catholic Education Commission of New South Wales; schedule H of the National Education Reform Agreement; the Australian Parents Council letter; NewsExtra of the Independent Education Union; and the graph that I talked about before. They are the documents I seek leave to table.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (11:37):  I want to finally respond to some of the additional misplaced and incorrect contributions that we have heard from the coalition, and in particular from a very heated member for Sturt.


The first thing to say is that the preamble expressly identifies, recognises and acknowledges non-government school systems. So those views that have been put by members opposite on that matter are incorrect. The fact is that, if there is any risk or threat to funding for government and non-government schools, it lies in a continuation with the current broken funding model that would see $16.2 billion less going to schools over time. That was recognised by Minister Piccoli when he said specifically—and after all he is a National Party education minister—that the status quo would see New South Wales worse off.


In the absence of any real policy for the future, what we have now is very clearly in front of us a bill that enshrines what we have been talking about and working on with state governments, territory governments and the non-government school sector for a considerable period of time. The fact is that the community has moved on from sectoral debates; it has moved on from the kind of half-hearted scare campaign about alleged means-testing in the model—which is not there at all. The community has moved on, and this bill enshrines what we have been talking about as a government; making sure that every student gets the support in their education that they need and deserve. And we have been prepared to back it in the budget with over $9 billion of investment. If you add that to the states, who want to see this National Plan for School Improvement, we would see $14.5 billion in investment going to schools in the future.


I note that even today Mr Innes Willox of the Australian Industry Group is reported as recommending the principles of the National Plan for School Improvement, the Gonski recommendations. He said that they are fundamentally sound and he wants to see governments deliver them. That is a rational response; not like the constant cavilling, carry-on and caterwauling that we have heard from those opposite.


This bill is about better schools for all Australians. That is what we want to see happen right now. That is what the parliament will vote on, and that is what the parliament will deliver.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:40):  Equity in education matters. And this is a really important contribution to that principle of equity. I have been chased up hill and down dale about a certain 17-minute speech, but anyone who listened beyond about the 10-minute mark would have heard me talking about the importance of equity in education and the clear failures in the education data around rural students, Aboriginal students and low-SES families. So I am thrilled that we are actually seeing that education data being addressed in a substantive way. That is why this legislation does need to progress through this chamber. That is why state sovereignty as promoted in the budget in reply should be protected and endorsed in an agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and that is why my judgement call is that this should progress through this chamber relatively swiftly this morning.


I am listening to this debate and I am seeing people get up for a second and a third time and in many ways repeating messages of a political kind rather than drilling down on the detail. It is a pretty simple proposal before the House. We either accept the education data or we do not. If we do accept the education data, we are accepting a massive failure of public policy. So, righto; if we accept there is a problem, what is the solution? The Gonski process identified an 'intolerable link' between the education data and the funding formula. So either we accept that link or we do not. We accept that it is tolerable or intolerable. Once we have got across that very simple hurdle, we accept loadings and a new funding formula or we do not.


We can complain about 70 pages and we can complain about what schools know what level of detail, but in the end it is a pretty simple question before the House: is there a problem in our education data? Yes. Is there an intolerable link that has been identified? Yes. Is the solution to put in place loadings specific to regionality, Aboriginality and to socioeconomic status? That is the question before the House. I think everyone has had a crack at second reads; everyone has had a crack in this debate this morning. And I know I am going to get a bucketful from the shadow minister in the chair—




Mr Pyne:

 (Gorton—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (13:45): I seek indulgence to advise the House of additional information that has been drawn to my attention following an answer I gave in the Federation Chamber during consideration in detail last night. I was advised that the former minister for immigration was not briefed on the matter of the Egyptian detainee. I was subsequently advised that the former minister's office received a submission relating to this matter on 28 September 2012. The submission was not signed by the minister.


This submission related to the complex issues surrounding the detainee's capacity to apply for a protection visa. The department has advised me that the submission held by the former minister's office was not returned to the department by the then minister's office. I can confirm that this submission was not provided to me or my office upon appointment as Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The department has also advised that this submission relating to this detainee's capacity to apply for a protection visa has not been resubmitted to me.


No matters relating to the detainee were raised with me or my office prior to 17 April 2013, as I advised the parliament last night. The brief of 17 April 2013 related to the movement of this detainee from Inverbrackie to Villawood detention facility.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:00):  Once again we have had more fiction from the shadow Treasurer about debt. I want to go through all of the facts. The first fact is that net debt at 11.4 per cent is a fraction of debt levels of other countries right around the world. In fact, it is one-eighth the level of major advanced economies. I make that point because those opposite are on this fiscal fear campaign that somehow our debt levels are not responsible and not sustainable. We have very low debt and sustainable debt in this country and it performs a very important role. When events occur in the international economy, we support jobs and growth, and that is what this government is doing. Of course, those opposite do not want to do that.


I was questioned by the shadow Treasurer on those matters in the House only a few weeks ago, the week after the budget, and I made a number of important points. I said that the borrowing limit did not need to be lifted in either this financial year, 2012-13, or next financial year, 2013-14. I did that in the face of the shadow Treasurer running around mixing up market value and face value—he did not know what he was doing at all.



Mr Hockey interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney has asked his question.




Mr SWAN:
  I said we will also review that in the usual way and amend it as required. Face value was never provided by those opposite when they were in government; it was never published. But today face value was provided to Senate estimates. I talked with the Treasury. It was the most open and transparent thing to do and it was provided to the opposition today. So the government has been completely open and transparent in providing the face value figures, which have never been provided by those opposite. The face value in 2012-13 and 2013-14 is below the debt cap. I also made the point that these matters are considered on a budget to budget basis in the usual way and we would review it in the usual way and amend it as required. That is actually what I told the parliament when these matters were raised with me in budget week.



But what is this all about? What this is really all about is that debt is the Trojan Horse that those opposite are trying to use, trying to exaggerate its impact so that they will be able to justify if elected savage cuts to the bone when it comes to health and education and a massive impact on jobs and growth in our community. Debt in this country is low. Our public finances are in great shape, and the problem that those opposite have got is that this is what the rating agencies say about these matters. This demonstrates how those opposite want to talk down our economy day in, day out. This is what Standard & Poor's says about Australia: 'The government continues to demonstrate a commitment to prudent fiscal policy over the medium term given the low level of public debt in Australia.' This is what Moody's says about it: 'Australia's relatively low level of government debt has been one of the factors supporting the AAA rating.' (Time expired)

That the Prime Minister immediately commission a cross government review into the Government’s incompetent handling of the circumstances surrounding the placing of a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist in a low security family detention facility in the Adelaide Hills including:


(1) when was the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Home Affairs Minister first made aware of the presence of the Egyptian terrorist in the detention network and when did each responsible department or agency brief their Minister and the Prime Minister;


(2) the adequacy of communication arrangements and intelligence sharing between the relevant departments and agencies on matters of national security;


(3) the effects of the Governments budget cuts on our national security agencies ability to detect such cases particularly the $6.9 million cut to ASIO’s budget for security screening of asylum seekers; and


(4) a review of any similar cases including those of a Sri Lankan man accused of murder who was released into the community on a bridging visa and an accused Iranian drug smuggler.


This is like government by Sergeant Schultz: nobody knows anything on national security. The Prime Minister—




Mr Albanese:
  I rise on a point of order, Speaker. It goes to whether this motion would be in order given that the Prime Minister has already announced an inquiry by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and therefore this motion is redundant.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on the point of order: the Leader of the House is simply time wasting, and I hate to add to it, but the point of this motion is that the House and the parliament should be able to debate the need for a cross-government inquiry into this fiasco. Yes, the Prime Minister has announced that she will ask the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The member for Stirling has the call.




Mr KEENAN:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We have heard in question time today that nobody within this government knows anything about national security.




Mr Albanese:
  Speaker, on a point of order: the member should withdraw that accusation, which is simply false and goes to national security.



Mr Dutton interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order, the member for Dickson! The member for Stirling will withdraw and has the call.




Mr KEENAN:
  I am happy to substantiate it, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  No, the member for Stirling has been asked to withdraw.




Mr KEENAN:
  I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the member.




Mr KEENAN:
  What we have heard in question time today on this serious breach of national security is that the immigration minister does not know anything, the Minister for Home Affairs does not think he should know anything—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Stirling will resume his seat. The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Stirling is moving a suspension. If he continues along this line, I will sit him down. The member for Stirling can argue his case. He should do so within the suspension and the issue before the chair, without the imputation. The member for Stirling has the call.




Mr KEENAN:
  Standing orders must be suspended because this is an urgent matter, and it is an urgent matter because we are dealing with a grave breach of national security, and nobody in the government will take responsibility for it.




Mr Albanese:
  Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Stirling continues to abuse what should be the processes of standing orders and continues to argue the case as if the suspension had been carried. It has not. He has to refer to a suspension of standing orders—



Ms Julie Bishop interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  as he is being instructed by the deputy leader now.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat.



Ms Julie Bishop interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  I ask that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  Could the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for the assistance of the House, withdraw.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The member for Stirling has the call on the suspension of standing orders.




Mr KEENAN:
  Standing orders need to be suspended because nothing is more important than national security, and we have heard in question time today that we do not have a government that is prepared to take responsibility for it even when it has been breached in such a grievous way.

 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (15:25):  We will not be lectured on national security and these matters by the party of 'wheat for weapons' and the party that gave us the Haneef scandal—




Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will refer to the suspension motion before the House.




Mr ALBANESE:
  and that is why standing orders should not be suspended.



Mr Morrison interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am happy to have a point of order from you, Member for Cook. We should not suspend standing orders because what we have before this parliament over the next week and the week after that is nine days of sittings left. We have approaches from the opposition saying: 'Please, Leader of the House, can you make time for us to deal with a range of issues? Can you make time for us to deal with valedictories? Can you make time for us so that we can filibuster on the Education Bill?' That is why we should not suspend standing orders.




Mr Morrison:
  Still filibustering.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Cook is not amusing.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Earlier on today, we had about five contributions from the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Pyne:
  Four.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Four? I stand corrected by the Manager of Opposition Business. We had four contributions from the Manager of Opposition Business, and the usual suspects that they line up when they are filibustering. The member for Bradfield is a special. There are others who come in here regularly to filibuster—



Mr Hawke interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  including the member for Mitchell. What they said was that the Education Bill was the priority. They said that was the priority and now they seek to suspend standing orders so that they can speak about an inquiry when the Prime Minister has already announced an inquiry by the appropriate inspector general. The Prime Minister has very clearly set an appropriate course of action, which is why we should not be suspending standing orders. It contradicts the behaviour of those opposite throughout not just today but the entire week. We had earlier on today the member for Lyne—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



Mr Keenan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The members for Sturt and Stirling might be struggling to stay in the chamber for the vote.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The member for Lyne had to indeed move that the question be put on the Education Bill, because they wanted to continue to debate education. And we were happy with debating education. But they stood up and gave the same speech as the member for Sturt did, not once, not twice, not three times, but—on his own account—four separate occasions. Members of the opposition come in here in order to filibuster just to delay them putting on the record their opposition to opportunity being given to Australian kids, regardless of their background and regardless of whether they went to a public school, a private school, an independent school or a Catholic school. They tried to delay that process.


At the same time they come to me and they ask for discussions to be held about the way that parliament will proceed over the remaining days of the 43rd Parliament. I am always happy, as you are aware, Speaker, to accommodate the opposition whenever I can, because that is the kind of Leader of the House that I am; I am inclusive and always happy to take on board any reasonable request from the opposition or the crossbenchers, as the crossbenchers are indicating right now.


So we have had a specific request from a number of members opposite. I will not embarrass them by putting it on the record because I can actually keep a secret between members of parliament when it is appropriate that it be kept. They have come to me and they have asked for particular times. Also collectively earlier on today I had a discussion with the Manager of Opposition Business about what the priorities would be over the next 10 days.




Mr Fletcher:
  Name them.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Bradfield might be named in a moment.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I think the member for Bradfield should stick to those little five-minute contributions. What they have done when they came before this chamber is say that they want all of their priorities, but whenever the opportunity arises from those opposite, what they do is delay, move suspensions of standing orders.


You might take their suspensions remotely seriously had they not done it day after day after day. Indeed, they have proposed more suspensions of standing orders in the 43rd Parliament than were proposed in the previous 42 parliaments put together. It is a strategy that they have. We have all had to engage in what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition: the longest dummy spit in Australian political history. They have had one strategy, which is to not engage in serious debate, in spite of the fact that this parliament has presented unique opportunities not seen since the period during the Second World War, because a government that does not have a majority on its benches has to engage by definition with the whole parliament in order to secure the passage of legislation. But those opposite, rather than put up alternative pieces of legislation, rather than ask serious questions during question time, rather than engage in serious issues and put forward an alternative vision for this nation, have chosen instead relentless negativity day after day.


If anything symbolises the relentless negativity of those opposite it is the day-after-day suspensions of standing orders. How do I know it is Wednesday? Because this is the third suspension of standing orders this week. How will I know it is Thursday? Because tomorrow will be the fourth. Every day they come in here like clockwork. It has changed a little bit; it used to be that they did it at 10 to three, just before Playschool came on at three o'clock, so that the Leader of the Opposition got the 10 minutes prior to three o'clock in terms of broadcast time. We have had a slight change in the timing but no change in the strategy. Why? Because, in spite of the fact that we have a minority government dependent upon winning the arguments, the intellectual arguments, for our program of action, whether it be the education reforms that have gone through this week, whether it be DisabilityCare, whether it be the mental health package, whether it be the jobs bill, whether it be the infrastructure legislation—



The SPEAKER:  The time for the debate has expired. The question is that the motion be agreed to.

3. The committee recommends that the following items of private Members' business listed on the notice paper be voted on:




Orders of the Day—



Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013 (Mr Wilkie);


Christian Assyrians (Mr Ruddock);


Cyber-safety (Ms Marino); and


Australian sugar industry (Mr Christensen).

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,12,2,speech
"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2013-06-05,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (15:44):  I seek leave to move a motion, directing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to seek a report from the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security on the circumstances surrounding the detention of the convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist.


Leave not granted.




Mr WILKIE:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Denison moving the following motion forthwith:


That the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security be directed by the Minister to report by 20 June 2013 on the following:


(1) to establish all facts in relation to allegations that a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist was in a detention centre in full knowledge of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, without passing this information to the Minister; and


(2) whether processes and/or resources need to change to address any issues raised, and if so, in detail, to recommend where.


I will just speak briefly to this effort to suspend standing orders and to bring this motion on. I think everyone in this House would agree that the possibility that a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist was improperly processed and/or improperly held in detention is a cause for very serious concern. I would hope that every person in this place would agree that it is important that someone or some body get to the bottom of it, ensure that any errors are corrected and that this sort of thing does not happen again. That would certainly be in line with the public's expectations.


I note that the Prime Minister has announced today that the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security will look into these matters. I have the utmost respect for the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and I do not doubt that officer's competency and independence, but I really think this is a matter for the parliament to consider. We have in the parliament a very capable and well-regarded body to look into these matters—that is, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS is a highly regarded body; it is populated with well-regarded members of the parliament and with, I think I can say with some confidence, members of parliament who have a high standing in the community—with the possible exception of me. Crucially, it is a competent organisation and well regarded and familiar with security matters. It is the one parliamentary committee which has the competency and the skills and familiarity with the intelligence community, and which could ramp up and undertake an inquiry very quickly. Crucially, the PJCIS also has a track record of working cooperatively—of achieving consensus wherever consensus can possibly be found and making recommendations that would have the support of the whole parliament and, I think, the confidence of the whole community.


I ask the parliament to support my attempt to suspend standing orders and to bring this motion on for a decision.




Mr Oakeshott:
  I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the motion be agreed to.

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,MOTIONS,14,1,speech
"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:58):  Under standing order 132(b) I believe that through misadventure at least one member missed the division, and therefore I move:


That in accordance with standing order 132, standing and sessional orders be suspended to enable the House to divide again on the question: That the suspension of standing and sessional orders moved by Mr Wilkie be agreed to.


During the timing of the division, the four-minute spell, one of the opposition's members, the member for Flinders, was seen very clearly at the glass doors of the chamber. He was seconds away from voting. The reason why standing order 132(b) is in the standing orders is so that, if a vote could have been materially affected in a different direction by a member not being able to be present, the vote can be recommitted. In a parliament such as this, there are two members who were not present, Leader of the House, who may have wanted to vote, one of whom we know was standing outside the glass doors—the member for Flinders. The other was the member for Fisher, who did not vote. He did vote in a previous division and he should be given the opportunity to come into the House and vote.


There was great confusion, given the member for Denison moved the motion and many members of the House—I would say a good 142—probably did not know that that motion was going to be about the suspension of standing orders to refer this matter, the matter of the holding of a jihadist terrorist in a detention centre in the Adelaide Hills, to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. It was a very good motion of the member for Denison. The opposition supports it. We believe that national security is one of the most important requirements of a government to get right. We saw in question time today, and have seen all week, that ministers have failed to take responsibility for the fact that a convicted jihadist terrorist was held in detention in the Adelaide Hills behind a pool fence. So we support the member for Denison's motion and I believe the member for Flinders would have supported it. That would have meant 75 votes would have been on the side of the House to achieve the suspension of standing orders—and one other member, the member for Fisher, did not come into the House.


I will not delay the House any longer. Standing order 132(b) exists so that, if there is a misadventure and a member is not entitled to come in and vote because they were inconvenienced for whatever reason, the House be given the opportunity to vote again. I put it to the House that this is such an occasion and that therefore the House should vote on it.

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,MOTIONS,14,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (16:03):  What an extraordinarily short memory the member for Sturt has got. During the last sitting week of this parliament there was a genuine misadventure where people put their hand up, stated why they had missed the division and put it on the record—as was provided for when we negotiated the changes to standing orders at the beginning of the 43rd Parliament—and the Manager of Opposition Business opposed it. He opposed it and made this side of the House get an absolute majority in order to allow the recommittal of that vote. You cannot have it both ways. The member for Flinders has finally made it into the chamber.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kooyong wouldn't want the statute majority to fall over, I should suspect.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The fact is this: the opposition was two votes short of a majority. If it is the case that two members come in here, give an explanation and say they wish to vote, and there was a change, therefore, in the outcome as a result of misadventure, I will support the Manager of Opposition Business's motion. That is what we determined collectively—government, opposition and crossbenchers—after the last parliament.


I will not play the games that the member for Sturt played during the last sitting week. But if you want an example of playing absurd politics with national security, it is this. The Manager of Opposition Business should also know—he might not, but he should—that the suspension of standing orders, if it were carried, and if the motion were moved by the member for Denison, would be out of order. Because you cannot have an inquiry into specific national security matters concerning individuals by this committee. It is expressly outlawed by the standing orders—by House of Representatives Practice. I say to the crossbenchers: have a bit of common sense and think about the implications of why the standing orders are addressed that way—why House of Representatives Practice is addressed that way. If we are going to have national security matters dealing with individuals dealt with by parliamentary committees based upon votes we endanger our national security.


I say to this parliament and the member for Denison—and the member for Lyne, who I have every respect for—withdraw your motion. It should not be proceeded with. If it were the case that the suspension had been carried—and it will not be carried, because there isn't an absolute majority—it is very clear that it is not—




Ms Julie Bishop:
  You already know?




Mr ALBANESE:
  Yes, funnily enough, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I have got a fair idea of how people are going to vote. That is why you have not won one yet. I have got a fair idea—and I do talk to people and treat them with respect. I am treating the crossbenchers with respect now, because I say to you that the motion moved by the member for Denison would clearly be out of order had the suspension been carried. The Speaker would have had to rule that way and if it then came to the point of the Speaker's ruling, upon advice from the clerks being dissented from, we would have had an issue that went beyond the issues of substance on national security before us today.


Common sense tells you that while an issue about an individual is being dealt with, it was not appropriate for this resolution to have been moved. Had there been some consultation with the clerks or with appropriate parliamentary practice, I am absolutely certain that common sense would have prevailed. But I do expect the Manager of Opposition Business to act with some responsibility on this matter and not seek, at each and every opportunity, to gain opportunistic political advantage over an issue that should be above opportunistic politics.


National security cannot be a plaything. That is why I objected to questions being raised about what happened at the National Security Committee of the cabinet. That is why we objected to the track of a number of the questions that went down before the parliament today.


The Prime Minister has acted absolutely responsibly and appropriately in asking the appropriate authority, the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, to undertake the action as requested by the Prime Minister. So I say to the crossbenchers and to everyone else: don't play politics with national security—act responsibly and think about the consequences and implications behind this motion that was attempted before the chair. This is why the suspension should certainly not have been granted.


With regard to the member for Sturt's motion, I say to him that if it is the case that the member for Flinders missed a vote through misadventure then, of course, in terms of it making a difference to an outcome, if the member for Flinders—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order. The member for Sturt might want to stay in the chamber for the vote. I thought he might. The Leader of the House has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The member for Flinders and the member for Fisher, both, did not vote in that last division. It is the case that, were that to have occurred through misadventure, I would support a recommittal of the vote. But it is not the case, and what we have here is a motion for the suspension of standing orders, in order to put this motion by the member for Sturt, in spite of his own actions in trying to block this last time. As Leader of the House, I do not engage under the same standards—or lack of standards—that he exhibits as Manager of Opposition Business. I will do the appropriate thing as Leader of the House. People have missed divisions before. What you do is you have a recommittal. That was the agreement where an outcome was altered. If it is the case that the outcome would be altered, then I will agree to a recommittal under the suspension of standing orders. If it is the case that the suspension is carried, I give notice that, if the member for Denison chooses to proceed with his motion and if the member for Lyne chooses to proceed with his seconding of that motion, I will be pointing to the standing orders and House of Representatives Practice which clearly indicate—notwithstanding the good intentions and motivations of the member for Denison and the member for Lyne—that it is highly inappropriate for a very good reason.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:12):  Speaker, may I very briefly offer my apologies to the House. Let me make it clear that I was in an interview with Mr David Speers from Sky Television in a soundproof room. As soon as I was aware I took leave. It is my fault and my responsibility. I am the person responsible. I offer my apologies to the House. I will learn to run faster next time.


On the issue in particular, however, of a recommittal, let me say this to the Leader of the House: I can guarantee that my vote will be with the opposition on this. That of itself guarantees that there will be a different numerical outcome. I cannot speak for the member for Fisher but I can guarantee that, automatically, we will be in a one-vote-better position. As to the member for Fisher's position, I will not of course speak for another member of parliament, but the vote will be different. More importantly, in line with the practice, the procedure, the history and the principle of this parliament, and of the very rules and procedures which the Leader of the House agreed to, it would be right and proper and reasonable to follow that practice and allow this recommittal.


The last thing I would say is that on this particular topic, of all topics, it would be right and proper to allow the vote to proceed. This is about a matter of national security. I have had some experience in this space and we have grave issues which need to be addressed. The government should have nothing to be afraid of if it has done nothing wrong. This is about sensible, prudent oversight of the way in which the government has gone about managing national security and the simple message is this: if you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear from what has been proposed today.


My response to the Leader of the House is very clear. I am responsible for having made the error and I offer my apologies to the House. The Leader of the House is responsible for the tone, tenor and conduct of the House on their side. This is your chance to live up to the principles which you proclaim. This is your chance and your responsibility. Beyond that, on this matter of all matters of the highest national security, in relation to how we treat those with a jihadist background on the government's watch in the government's time, it is absolutely clear this matter would be different if a vote is taken again. This matter should be different and a vote should be allowed.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that standing orders be suspended to enable the House to divide again.

The failure of the Government to appropriately manage the nation's economy.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:25):  Today the National Accounts for the March quarter presented a more sobering picture of the Australian economy than the Treasurer would have us believe. I have three observations. Firstly, it is clear that economic growth is slowing. Growth in the quarter was just 0.6 of one per cent, half of what it was a year ago. A year ago the Treasurer described the 1.2 per cent result for the March quarter:


I think the country should have a bounce in its step today. What a great day for Australia and what a stunning set of figures.


Today he said, 'The Australian economy continues to expand at a solid pace …' I seem to recall he was a little more graphic than that. He described it as 'an incredible achievement'. It is an incredible achievement to have 1.2 per cent growth in the March quarter last year and 0.6 per cent this year. That is an incredible achievement from a Treasurer who is never short of praising himself.


The second thing about today's numbers is that when you look at them you see that all of the growth was in net exports, which contributed one per cent to growth. This is due to rising exports but weak imports. Of the 0.6 per cent in economy growth in the quarter, a full one per cent came from the improvement in net exports. What is concerning is that domestic activity went backwards, with domestic final demand falling by 0.3 of a per cent. This was the first fall in domestic demand since the darkest days of the financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009. That is a significant issue. Domestic activity went backwards in the March quarter of this year for the first time since the financial crisis.


The third issue to be aware of is that it is clear that households are cautious. Consumption growth was modest, increasing by only two per cent over the year. Dwelling activity remained muted, increasing by just 2.7 per cent over the year, and household savings continued to rise to 10.6 per cent. What is happening is that people are hibernating—and what a surprise! We have a government that cannot hold policies from budget to budget, week to week or day to day, and that is creating this massive unease in the community which came through in rising household savings and the overall deterioration in domestic activity.


What is clear is that since the March quarter consumer confidence has remained fragile at best. The Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment fell by seven per cent in May to 97.6 per cent, below the break-even 100-point line, and now the number of pessimists in Australia outnumbers the number of optimists for the first time since October last year. Two-thirds of the survey was conducted after the federal government released its budget. Bill Evans, the Chief Economist at Westpac, said:


Of course, the remarkable aspect of this result is that it is the first read of the index since the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate by 0.25% on May 7. Absent any other major influences, we would have expected a solid boost to the Index following that rate cut.


We have had the extraordinary situation where the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates to record lows and consumer confidence falls. And why? Because consumers have been spooked by Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, previously describing three per cent as an emergency level. Now that it has gone beyond three per cent, they are alarmed. Well, why wouldn't they be? The narrative from this government is totally confused. The narrative is, on the one hand: 'Aren't we good? We've got a AAA rating. We're doing really well. The rest of the world wishes they had the Australian economy,' but, on the other hand: 'Oh, the budget's hit by terrible circumstances beyond our control, and it's so bad out there, we can't balance the budget. It's so bad with an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. It's so bad with growth around trend. It's so bad with the best terms of trade in 100 years. We can't get our budget back to surplus—and, by the way, aren't we good?'


The Treasurer is proud of mediocrity. That says everything about this Treasurer. He is proud of mediocrity but, what is more, boastful of mediocrity. There is no grand word in the Oxford English Dictionary that the government have not used as a superlative to describe their own performance. 'The biggest reforms', 'the grandest reforms', 'the most significant reforms in a generation', 'the most significant reforms in history', 'the biggest change'—all these big superlatives. They are never short of patting themselves on the back—when they're not stabbing each other in the back! They are not short of patting themselves on the back, but the Australian people are not prepared to pat them on the back, and they cannot understand why. It is because their narrative and their words do not match their actions. That is the fundamental point. Their words and their actions are at odds.


Bill Evans, Westpac chief economist—so it is not just me; this is Bill Evans—went on to say:


… weakness in confidence is being driven by a sharply negative response to the Budget—


and—


… the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position, indicating renewed fears about the overall state of the economy.


Finally he said:


… the budget and the associated fiscal deterioration have been the dominant drivers of this sharp drop in confidence.


This is a government that on more than 500 occasions promised to deliver a surplus. This is a government that on more than 500 occasions said that the test of economic success is whether they can deliver a surplus. This is a government that said that pensioners would be worse off if they meandered back to surplus. This is a government that said the measure of its economic performance would be whether it gets the budget back to surplus and starts paying down the debt. That was the benchmark they set.


And they boasted of it. They did not just boast about promising it; they even had the hide to boast they had actually delivered it. The Prime Minister herself in her own words claimed credit for having delivered a surplus.




Mr Tony Smith:
  And the Assistant Treasurer in his newsletter.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The member for Casey reminds me the Assistant Treasurer boasted to his electorate of Lindsay—Western Sydney—that he had delivered a surplus. Not only that; he promised to give them further tax cuts. And they were legislated tax cuts. We thought the whole tax cut promise hit rock bottom when Paul Keating said back in 1993: 'Don't worry, Australia. We're delivering you tax cuts that are l-a-w.' He said they were in law. But, going beyond that, this mob, not pleased to have that great legacy of Paul Keating and the l-a-w tax cuts, not only puts them in l-a-w law but then reverses them.


We used to joke that Labor could not hold a policy from Lateline until lunchtime; now they cannot hold a budget cut from budget to budget. And you know what? There is no intervening election. It is simply their incompetence. So Australians, who were told by the government they should plan with confidence for the tax cuts, compensation, pension increases and increases in the family tax benefit, now have this mob not only taking those away, reversing the legislation and repealing it for tax cuts but again breaking their word.


Nothing illustrates it more than what Labor has said about government debt. In this place on numerous occasions we asked the Treasurer, 'What is going to be the limit on the amount of money you are going to have to borrow on behalf of the Australian people?' After in previous years giving us a fair dinkum answer and saying, 'We believe peak debt will be at X,' this year he obfuscated. He twisted and turned. He tried to have different definitions of debt. He went from net debt to gross debt to the debt subject to the debt limit. He tried every twist and turn. Clearly he did not want to answer. Then in estimates the question was asked, and the Treasury, clearly embarrassed by the failure of the Treasurer to provide an answer, decided that they were going to do it.


Today in Senate estimates the Treasury revealed the true peak in Commonwealth government issuance. Bear in mind that this goes to trust. It was the Labor Party that said we need to have a debt limit of $75 billion. They broke that. Then they said there would be a debt limit of $200 billion. They broke that. Then they said it would be $250 billion and they broke that. Then they said, 'We need to increase the debt limit to $300 billion.' They said they would never break $250 billion: 'Don't worry. We only need to go to $300 billion because we might, somewhere in the middle of the year, creep a little bit above $250 billion—a week here, a week there. It's really all about issuance, but don't worry, because at the end of the year we won't be above $250 billion, because we're going to deliver a surplus.' Well, one broken promise leads to another broken promise, which leads to another broken promise. What a surprise!


So now we find out, as if dragging teeth from a crocodile, that Labor, which has a $300 billion debt limit, now is going to go to $290 billion before Christmas this year, and next year to $330 billion, and the year after that to $340 billion. Then, for the year after that, it says 'not available'. Well, I am kind of hoping you are not going to be available on 15 September. But for some odd reason the debt keeps going up and up and up and up. It is good enough for the government to be able to forecast in 2016-17 that it is going to spend so much on chasing orange roughies down a river or on education or health. In fact, it is boasting about how much money it is going to spend on education in 2022, but it cannot tell us how much it is going to borrow in four years time. You know why, Mr Deputy Speaker? Because it keeps going up and up and up, and at the same time Labor's credibility is going down, down, down.


You know what is worse? A Treasurer who is proud of mediocrity and proud of his legacy of gargantuan debt and deficits compared to his predecessor. You know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? He does not have the guts to come in here and front the Australian people and say, 'I need to increase the credit limit again.' He sent someone else to the bank. He does not have the guts to front the bank manager and say, 'I need to increase my credit card limit for the fifth time.' Instead he comes into this place and says, 'We've delivered the information on the debt limit that the Liberals never did.' We never had the debt. We paid off your debt last time. Now you are leaving us—or 'someone else', as he said to Neil Mitchell on Melbourne radio—after 14 September to clean up your mess. Shame, Labor, shame! This is the second time in my lifetime in this parliament that we have had to step up to the plate and clean up your damn mess. But the problem is that it is the taxpayers of Australia that do the heavy lifting. It is the taxpayers of Australia that have to find the extra taxes to pay down the debt, because Labor is addicted to debt. Labor is addicted to spending other people's money, and the problem for Labor is that it has run out of other people's money, and that is typical of the socialist way.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (16:40):  Sometimes, in moments of rage and excess, the truth comes out, and we saw it there from the member for North Sydney. They have been trying to conceal exactly what their true plan is, but we saw it in all its glory. The member for North Sydney just said, 'We're going to have to come in and fix up the mess.' Well, we refute the suggestion there is a mess, but I will come to that in a minute. But what he also said was, 'We are going to jack up taxes.' That is what he said. It is on the Hansard. He has finally come clean. Maybe he did not put that in the memo that he sent out to each and every one of you, when he said: 'Listen, guys. Whatever you do, don't have any contact with the Parliamentary Budget Office, because this time round they might actually record it and they might hold us to account for the unaffordable spending promises that we make.' You heard it there from the member for North Sydney: they are going to jack up taxes if they get elected. You do not have to be Einstein to figure this one out.


The Leader of the Opposition got up and said in his budget-in-reply speech, 'We're going to set up a tax review committee.' Here I was thinking that they are so single-minded in their determination to jack up the GST and broaden the base of the GST. We know how determined they are to do that, because it is in their DNA. They were the ones that came into this place years ago and put the GST in place. In fact, they did not go nearly as far as they wanted to go. They had to compromise at the time, and in compromising they did not put the GST on fresh food or health and education services. And you know what? They did not even get the rate that they were really looking for, so they had to settle for 10 per cent. Now they see the great opportunity to come back, have a second crack at it and finish off the job—to broaden the base of the GST and slug Australian families by hitting people with higher costs and higher taxes on their health, their education services, their school fees, their private health insurance, their medicines and their medical aids. These are the things that they want to slug Australian families with.


They come into this place day after day and say, 'We are going to save this country money by reducing red tape on small business.' Well, I will give you a tip: never before was there a government that strangled small businesses across this country quite like the Howard government when they introduced the GST. They strangled small businesses.




Ms O'Dwyer:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. I would ask the minister to actually speak on the matter that is before this House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The Assistant Treasurer has the call.




Mr BRADBURY:
  Thanks, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know it hurts. It hurts her in particular, because she contributed to the office of the former Treasurer, the man who writes in the Telegraph to tell us how wonderful he was but never, ever received a gong. I will tell you what he did not receive. Forget about the gongs. We are not here for the gongs—even though I might add that there were two Labor Treasurers that were named the world's best finance minister but that is not a gong that her former boss got. But I will tell you what really matters to the Australian people: it was the fact that we have delivered a AAA credit rating from all of the three major global ratings agencies, something they never, ever achieved.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  All of the heckling from the former staff member of the former member for Higgins will never change the record or overcome the fact that they never, ever achieved that. They come into this place and say, 'Oh, the economy is terrible.' The member for North Sydney says, 'The Treasurer's messages are confused.' I tell you what: his message has not been confused; he has been out there day after day for the last six years talking down the economy at every opportunity, trying to scare people. If there is any impact on confidence, it has to be, clearly, the fact that there are too many people out there that might actually be listening to the member for North Sydney. I remind the House that, if you want to understand—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Assistant Treasurer will resume his seat. I point out to the member for Higgins that an MPI is a discussion and members may talk on the topic. It is very difficult to get a—




Ms O'Dwyer:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: that the government ought to be—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  There is no point of order. The member for Higgins will resume her seat and will not make frivolous point of orders as I have just explained the standing orders. The Assistant Treasurer.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I have three letters for you: AAA. That is what we have got, a AAA credit rating from the three major ratings agencies—that is our record. That is what we delivered; that is what you never could deliver in office.


On top of that I hear the Leader of the Opposition out there saying, 'We're going to create jobs. In the first five years we will create a million jobs.' That is what we have already done. We delivered it—just under a million jobs in the time we have been in office, no thanks to the Leader of the Opposition. We all remember—he might not remember—when the global financial crisis struck. Talk about stepping up to the plate, as the member for North Sydney says—that is what we did. We came into this place and we voted for the stimulus package. The Leader of the Opposition—I know people say he is asleep at the wheel; he was asleep on the lounge in his office after having a few drinks up at the parliamentary dining room.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Assistant Treasurer will withdraw.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I withdraw; I was merely reflecting upon statements in The Daily Telegraph.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will withdraw unequivocally.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I withdraw, but what I do not withdraw is the fact that Leader of the Opposition slept through our response to the global financial crisis. This is the bloke whose former employer said was an economic illiterate. He is asking the Australian people to trust him with their finances.


Let us have a look at what some other third parties might have said about the strength of the Australian economy. Who was it that said:


When the current prime minister and the treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most—they are right.


From which oracle did these words of wisdom, these pearls of wisdom, emanate? None other than the former member for Bennelong, the former Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard.


Silence—absolute silence. He still carries some authority and some weight—and I know the member for Higgins in her former job no doubt spent half of her time trying to white-ant him in pursuit of her former employer's aspirations. Notwithstanding that, whenever they are in need of injecting a little credibility into their argument, they have got a few strategies. I spoke in question time the other day about the little pamphlet that the Leader of the Opposition wheels out. He stands in front of the camera and positions this little pamphlet under his chin. It is like a bib—and he needs a bib because of the rubbish that spews out on occasions. There he is with his little pamphlet under his chin. That is one of his attempts to generate a little credibility.


When they are really pushed and really desperate, what they say is: 'We hark back to the great record of the Howard government.' We do not want to go too far back, because then you might have to acknowledge the Howard deficit that was left behind in 1983, the Howard deficit that was left behind for Labor to come in and clean up. If you assume that these people in 1983—




Mr Tony Smith:
  What?




Mr BRADBURY:
  Go and read some history books—you are not that young, member for Casey—about how the then member for Bennelong, who was the Treasurer, left this country in serious deficit. It was up to a Labor government to restore the finances. Go and read the history books.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! There is too much chatter across the chambers. I ask members to cease interjecting.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I can understand why they are so sensitive, because the man who they hold up—



Mr Tony Smith interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Casey, I just asked you to refrain from interjecting.




Mr BRADBURY:
  They hide behind the myth of the Howard government. They wheel out John Howard at every opportunity to give them some credibility on economic policy, because the Leader of the Opposition, whose former employer said he was an economic illiterate, is bored by economics. That is what the member for Higgins' former employer said. So what they do is they wheel out John Howard, but John Howard was out there and he was speaking the truth. He was talking about the strength of the Australian economy. He also said:


We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it.


When the member for North Sydney is out there talking the Australian economy down, he should remember that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. He goes on and he says:


I wouldn’t have thought that was going to be possible a couple of years ago—


this is from John Howard.


I wouldn't have thought that was possible—


I tell you what: under a Labor government, it has been delivered. He goes on:


… and I do not think many people would have.


He went on to say:


And our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money we owe to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries.


There you have it. Every time those characters come into this place and jump up and start talking about debt and deficit, the words of John Howard should be ringing in their ears. For all of the fraudulence that they come forward with, there is an utterance of truth that comes from the Liberal Party spoken by their elder statesman John Howard.


They are the facts: an economy that is 14 per cent larger than it was before the GFC, unmatched by any advanced economy, and an unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent. We have delivered 960,000 jobs in our economy. We have a record pipeline of investment coming into this country, and it continues to be the case. We have contained inflation. Families are paying less on their interest rates than they paid before.


Those opposite went to an election—we all remember it well; the member for Casey has a pretty poor memory but he might want to go back and have a look—and they said: 'Interest rates will always be lower under the Liberal Party.' Now, all of a sudden, low interest rates are something to lament. The families that I represent, the families that the people on this side of the chamber represent and small businesses like low interest rates. For someone with a mortgage of $300,000, they are paying $5,500 less in repayments every year. That is in their pocket.


It is true, as the member for North Sydney said, people are saving more. That of itself is not such a bad thing. That is about having a little bit more sustainability in the way we conduct ourselves. Go and have a look at the Parliamentary Budget Office's review and the Treasury's review of the structural position of the budget and you will see that they point to the fact that some of the excesses built into the system back in the days of the Howard and Costello governments—no doubt some of the poor policy decisions that the member for Higgins advised her boss about—were put in place and have ensured the structural position of the budget was not as sound as it could have been. We have been making some massive moves to improve that, and that has been recognised by the PBO and by the Treasury. They go quiet when you talk about the PBO because—




Ms O'Neill:
  They don't know where it is.




Mr BRADBURY:
  They don't like to talk about costings.




Ms O'Dwyer:
  That was our policy.




Mr BRADBURY:
  You came into this place and voted against it. How often is it that you come into this place and vote against your own policy?


And they talk about the taxes. I started this speech with reference to what the member for North Sydney said about their new taxes. Let us just talk about their new taxes. We already know that low-income earners are going to get a tax hike on their superannuation from these people. They talk about raiding superannuation, as long as it is the superannuation of some of the poorest people in this country. 'We don't want to touch those who are on the superlarge incomes. We don't want to touch them. They vote for us. We won't touch them.' But they are never, ever afraid to take a meat axe to those people on low and middle incomes; jacking up taxes on their superannuation.


Then there is paid parental leave tax. Even the member for Mitchell—once again just a moment of clarity and truth coming from these people—said, 'unfair, unaffordable'. They say there is a budget emergency. Rubbish! But, if there were a budget emergency, this would be precisely the worst possible time. It is a flawed policy, but this would be the worst time to introduce a $20 billion new tax on business.


Then there is the GST. They cannot go away from it. They just keep coming back to it. The state Liberal premiers are out there saying: 'We want more. We want more. We want more.' Well, we know you never stand between a state premier and a bucket of money. But the bucket of money is actually the money in the pockets of Australians all around this country.


They want to jack up the GST; they want to broaden the base of the GST. The Leader of the Opposition has been given plenty of opportunity to say, 'I will rule it out,' and he will not rule it out. The reason he will not rule it out is that is exactly what he intends to do. They want to jack up the GST. They want to slug health. They want to slug education. They are going to slug business with their paid parental leave tax. They are going to jack up taxes. And that is just the start of it; I have not even got to talk about the secret commission of cuts, where they want to hack away at government services and the support that families are getting.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:55):  It is a sad day in the parliament when you witness, as this House just has, such a rambling, incoherent speech—I was about to say 'contribution' but I corrected myself; that would be an exaggeration—from a chaotic Assistant Treasurer. I want to start by apologising to the Assistant Treasurer. Yesterday in the Federation Chamber, I accused the Assistant Treasurer of deliberately, coldly and in a calculated way, knowingly deceiving his electors, when he issued a newsletter this time last year declaring that the budget had been returned to surplus.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  It already had.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  On hearing the Assistant Treasurer's 15 minutes of rambling, I am starting to wonder whether he believed it or not; perhaps he had been told it and he did not know the difference. Perhaps I ascribed to him a motive that would have required competence, because what we have just heard, in summation, is a litany of personal attacks on the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Higgins—a list of inventions across the policy spectrum—and the basic message: 'Everything is fine. What are you complaining about?'


He tried to speak a bit about history. Just before the 1996 election, as net debt was approaching $96 billion—but we did not know the extent of it then, because Labor used to conceal the figures before the Charter of Budget Honesty—former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who I have to say was a lot more articulate than the current Assistant Treasurer, let fly on radio one day and said, 'What are people going on about?' That would sum up the Treasurer's approach and this Assistant Treasurer's speech that we have just heard in this chamber. He said the budget is all fine. He said that debt is fine and the economy is completely fine. As the shadow Treasurer said, Wayne Swan prides himself on mediocrity. If you listened to the Treasurer's press conference today, you would think that the figures that were released made his day.


You do not need to take our word for it; the shadow Treasurer very eloquently went through a breakdown of the figures: the growth in the quarter of just 0.6 per cent, what comprised it, and what that means for average families and small businesses across Australia. But the Assistant Treasurer appears to live in a world where, provided he has the script, he will keep repeating it. I say to those opposite: this is just more and more confirmation that a government that ignores reality will always ignore families and small business in Australia.


I accept that those opposite, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, will never take our word for anything, including the day of the week. At least see what some economists say, and this is just in the period since the figures were released. Jacob Greber, economics correspondent, says: 'Australia's economic growth slowed to the weakest annual pace in seven quarters.' Have a look at the Age online and you will see UBS chief economist Scott Haslem said: 'The overall tone of the release is pretty soft. When you take away the net export contribution of about one per cent in the quarter, the domestic economy was clearly negative.' Australian Industry Group has said: 'Services sector sinks further in May.' Then from the AAP economics correspondent the headline was 'GDP figures confirm subnormal growth' and the first line stated, 'The economy is just not making the grade.' That is just in the hours since the figures have been released. But no, according to the Assistant Treasurer, they are all scaremongering.


As the member for Higgins tried to point out during the Assistant Treasurer's contribution, at no point did he seek to address the release of those figures today. For this government to continue its denial of its failed approach and failed policy is further confirmation to the Australian people that it has no solutions to the problems it has created. We heard the Assistant Treasurer say that he thought the savings result was something to rejoice in because more saving is a good thing, without any awareness of why people are saving. The parliamentary secretary knows, because he knows a bit more than the Assistant Treasurer. People are saving in record numbers as a hedge against your chaos. That is what Australian families are doing: they are looking at the incompetence here in Canberra, they can see it spreading a lack of confidence throughout the electorate and they are saving because of the uncertainty, because of the chaotic policy approach and because they do not know what is around the corner with this government.


They are promised a surplus on more than 500 occasions and in the space of six months a promised surplus of a little over $1 billion misses by $19 billion. They see a government that has become incapable of honesty. There is no better illustration than its approach to the gross debt ceiling. The ceiling has been lifted from $75 billion to $250 billion to $300 billion, and on each occasion the Treasurer of the country has said, 'I will never need the full limit,' like someone who overspends on their credit card. And we hear today from the Treasury officials in Senate estimates that that level is expected to go to $290 billion by Christmas.




Mr Matheson:
  How much?




Mr TONY SMITH:
  $290 billion by Christmas. And the Treasurer comes in to question time and says it is not a problem. He expects the Australian people and every business to look back at his track record of utter failure to hit a target and see a miss on the budget outcome by $20 billion in six months and believe, '$290 billion, we are getting close to the 300,' and we got confirmation it will go over $300 billion next year. That is why the Australian people have lost confidence in the honesty and the competency of this government.


The Treasurer likes to compare Australia to Europe on economic growth, on jobs and particularly on debt. But we on this side of the House say to the Treasurer: do not compare us with the worst runners. If you are competing against sprinters on crutches, that does not make you Usain Bolt, it really doesn't. The Treasurer knows that. As we have seen, the Assistant Treasurer does not know that. The Treasurer knows in his heart of hearts, the Assistant Treasurer does not know, and we will see whether the parliamentary secretary can inject a bit of substance and a bit of honesty into the debate where the Assistant Treasurer failed so dismally.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business) (17:05):  Doom and gloom—that is the story of the opposition. It is doom and gloom every single day. Not a day has passed without doom and gloom since 2010. They are economical with the facts, economical with reality and economical with working Australians' and ordinary Australians' future. That is what the opposition represent every single day they come into this parliament and every single day since Labor was returned to government. They are merchants of doom, merchants of despair. Every time there is bad news, good news, not so good news or any news at all, they want to turn that into doom and despair, but they particularly love it if there is any bad global news. Anything that could possibly reflect on the Australian economy in some way, you can hear another champagne cork popping in one of their offices because it is the best news they have ever heard. When people suffer it is the best news they have ever heard.


The government comes into this place and tries to introduce policies and laws to assist ordinary families with the cost of living and with kids' education, and to build the nation at a time when the whole world—every single economy, every single country—is going through one of the toughest global economic periods in modern history. But somehow none of that factors into their economic reality. There is the fact that ordinary people who work every single day—because they still have a job, by the way: they still have a job!—and work harder and save harder understand much better than this opposition the economic reality as well as the economic fact that when the world is going through a period of global recession—a global financial crisis—it is a time when people have to readjust the way they work, the way they live and the way they consume. We have seen that right across our economy and we have seen it right across every sector, and it is acknowledged widely.


So what should a good government do? A good government should put its shoulder to the wheel and it should make the toughest of decisions—the hard decisions. It should spend where spending is required; it should protect jobs where protection is required; it should work with global markets to ensure that we still have a global economy in Australia; it should make sure that we keep interest rates low; it should make sure that we keep inflation under control at the same time; and—lo!—it should make sure that we keep a AAA rating across all three rating agencies. This is something that the economic geniuses across the aisle have never achieved in government while the rivers of gold flowed into this place. It is unprecedented in Australian history: unseen before. But while they had that great economic boom they just did not do enough with it or did not do anything with it. There were no great reforms. The only great reform that came out of that era when the rivers of gold flowed into Canberra was the GST.


Let us just call their strategy from day one for what it is. Let us just put it on the table. On day one Tony Abbott, shadow Treasurer Hockey and others had a meeting and said: 'Our strategy is simple: blow the place up every day. Make it impossible not just for the government but for everybody. Let's just blow the place up. Let's lower confidence. Let's call for an election every day.' Every single day they come into this place they call for an election and every single day out in the community they call for an election because it is about destroying confidence. It is about being negative. Negativity breeds negativity. 'Let's just go out there and poison people's minds. Let's tell them that they're all vulnerable. It is not as if they do not get enough of it on the six o'clock news with what is happening in Europe. It is not as if it is enough to see what happens in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and France and what is happening to the US economy and all around the world. It is not enough that they get this every single day at six o'clock at night on the news. We have to make it as bad as possible,' the opposition says, 'for Australia as well. Let's make them suffer!'


That is their strategy: blow the place up, call for an election every day and be negative every single day—and they have been good at it, I have to say—'Let's throw enough mud, because everyone knows the theory of throwing enough mud. Let's just keep throwing mud every single day. Let's go the low road and let's go personal.' That is what they have done. They have done it every single day. And let me tell you: they have been stellar at doing that. That is one thing they are really, really good at doing. Every time there is bad news another champagne bottle gets uncorked over at the Liberal Party headquarters. I have never seen smiles larger and more vivid than when there is one little piece of bad economic news. It is at complete odds with the real economy—real people and what is really happening out there in the world. The fact is that we have managed to keep interest rates low, saving people an enormous amount on their mortgages. That is much better than the Liberal Party ever did in government.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  That is one thing that you cannot deny: it is just a fact. John Howard always used to say, 'You will always have lower interest rates under a Liberal government.' Wrong! Not just wrong; completely wrong, and proved wrong year after year. Every time there is a Reserve Bank decision: wrong again. Any good news on the economy is shot down.


But look at the unemployment numbers. It is not just the case that there are low interest rates and that people who have mortgages are paying less. They have actually made a really smart decision. They have said: 'Times are tough. We all acknowledge that. The world has gone through a GFC.' The Liberals would actually have you believe, had they been in government, that the GFC would not have even happened. There would not have even been one. They would not have had to deal with it because we know their response to the GFC: you oppose everything. You oppose the stimulus package. You oppose the fact that we want to continue the building and construction industry in this country by investing in schools and school infrastructure: investing in classrooms, investing in science labs, investing in kids, investing in technology and investing in teachers. What could—




Mr Tony Smith:
  You missed out pink batts!




Mr RIPOLL:
  Well, let me talk about pink batts. There is nothing wrong—it is still acknowledged that the best single most cost-effective method to save money on electricity bills is to insulate your home. That is still the case today, and it has always been the case. Good insulation helps you to reduce your costs in summer and in winter. This government went out there, and the majority of people who took up that great benefit were older people. Older people understood that because in one way they do not necessarily have revenue coming in. Older people actually took up this opportunity because it was good for their bottom line.


We invested in universities. Since we got to government there has been an incredible increase in university investment. There is less personal debt. People are paying off their credit cards and actually keeping their equity. And about time! What we were seeing in the hedonistic years, right through the Howard years, was that people actually went a little bit too far in some of the borrowings. We saw all sorts of problems, and when the GFC hit we saw the damage it did. So I am all for people keeping more of their equity, reducing their credit card debt and increasing their savings, because that is a good thing. This is unlike the members opposite in the Liberal Party.


Government took on the difficult decisions. It took on more debt to ensure that we have a strong and resilient economy and make sure that if anyone is going to cop the burden of debt and the political cost that it would be us. Let it be us! Let it be us who stand up for the ordinary people in the street who cannot bear that burden. They have less of a burden, as was said just before: they are saving more. True—less of a burden. They are actually paying off their houses: absolutely they are—less of a burden. Do they owe less on their mortgages? Yes—less of a burden. This government has made sure that we will cop the blame and we will cop the burden, but ordinary people—householders and mortgage holders—are the ones who are actually getting the benefit.


That is why I say the 'real economy'. Let us have a look at what is actually happening in the real economy and with real people. I will go to the comments of the member for Casey, because he was right: they are saving more. Good on them! And they ought to. They are paying off their credit cards more. Good on them! They ought to keep doing that. And if the banks complain because they are not getting as much revenue from that, then bad luck for them.


So there is plenty of good news. The fact is that our economy has grown 14 per cent—14 per cent!—since we came to government. Compare that to any other economy. Pick any other economy and compare ours. Those other economies shrank. That means they lost jobs.


Importantly, there is one other thing that I want to raise in talking about the real economy, real people and what is actually happening out on the ground, and that is that you have to look beyond where we are today. Where will we be in 20 years time? You have to look not just at this budget or the next, or at the fact that these guys promised there would be a budget surplus in their first year and every year after that and then walked away from it. They are not going to manage it any better than anyone else because they will still have the same issues, the same global economy and the same write-downs in revenue.


But we are determined to continue growth, jobs and productivity, and there is only one way you can do that: to invest through innovation. That is why this government has taken the bold step of putting together 10 innovation precincts. I am very hopeful one of them is close to my electorate, but that is not going to matter because those innovation precincts are the way we get to productivity, growth and jobs—the high-paying jobs that Australians expect and the standard of living that we have got used to in this country. If we do not achieve that in the future then our standard of living will fall. It will not fall because of a budget deficit. It will fall because our productivity and innovative capacity fails us and our competitors are running faster than we are. If we are to exploit the intelligence that exists in this country it will be through innovation and productivity. We have understood that. The Liberal Party have no idea what I am talking about.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (17:15):  I rise to speak on this important MPI to critique the government's economic performance. Margaret Thatcher, a great hero to those on this side, once said, 'The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.' That is what is happening with this government: it is using other people's money to spend recklessly and, as a result, burden future generations, shackling today's children and the leaders of tomorrow.


We know from testimony at Senate estimates just yesterday that the gross debt for the Commonwealth will hit $270 billion next month. By Christmas it will rise to $290 billion and break through the $300 billion debt ceiling to hit $340 billion soon after that. Those on the other side have lifted the debt ceiling four times: first to $75 billion, then to $200 billion, then to $250 billion and now to $300 billion—and we know that is not enough. This is the party that has delivered us pink batts, overpriced school halls, green loans, cash for clunkers, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch—and do we all remember the 2020 summit? These are all the creations of those on the other side. As a result, their economic mismanagement has seen this country go into greater and greater debt. We also know from the March quarter National Accounts that growth is only 0.6 per cent. Why that is important is because that is half of what it was last year. Perhaps more worryingly, consumer sentiment is down seven per cent in May. That is as a result of the people of Australia losing confidence in the economic management of those opposite.


We have just had a budget which would normally be released with great fanfare to the Australian people. The galleries were half full, whereas for the Leader of the Opposition's budget-in-reply speech they were overflowing. What did we learn in this budget? We learnt that economic growth was going downwards, down to 2.75 per cent from three per cent. We also knew from this budget that unemployment was going up to 5.75 per cent. That is as a result of this government's economic mismanagement. We also learnt that there were great broken promises in this budget. Remember those opposite writing to their constituents and telling them that there would be an increase to family tax benefit A? None of that was delivered in this budget.


What about their holier-than-thou commitment to spending more on education? In fact, there was a $300 million cut to education in the budget, and billions of dollars cut over the forward estimates. And they are robbing Peter to pay Paul by going to the tertiary education sector, which is supposed to be the hub of productivity and a great export earner for our country, and ripping money out of the higher education budget. Fred Hilmer, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, has said that the government's commitments in the Asian century white paper are now such a joke as a result of these cuts to higher education.


Then there is the greatest broken promise over the carbon tax: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' There it is in this budget, with a promise that the carbon price will be $12 a tonne in the coming years when we move to a floating price. Twelve dollars a tonne? If you go to New Zealand it is trading at 85c, if you go to the European Union it is trading around $3 to $4—and the government would have us believe that the carbon price will be $12 a tonne in just a couple of years.


Again there were great predictions about what the mining tax revenue would be producing for the Commonwealth. Currently the mining tax produces just $200 million of revenue for the Commonwealth, but the government in the budget has promised that the revenue coming in from the mining tax will be $2 billion, a 1,000 per cent increase on where it is currently. If you take into account the high Australian dollar, or changes to the dollar, and if you take into account moving commodity prices—which, by the way, are 15 per cent higher than they were at their highest point under the Howard era—then we cannot take this government's funding commitments and revenue promises at face value. In fact, it is another multibillion dollar black hole.


But the best evidence of why you cannot take this government's commitments at face value is that the Treasurer of Australia—the greatest Treasurer in the history of the world, he would have us believe—started his budget last year by saying, 'Tonight I announce four years of budget surpluses.' Well, there has not been a Labor budget surplus since 1989. Do you know what the No. 1 movie was in 1989? Indiana Jones. Why is that interesting? Because Graham Perrett, the member for Moreton, said that this government is in more trouble than Indiana Jones—and Indiana Jones was the No. 1 grossing movie in 1989, the last year that the Labor Party delivered a budget surplus. So when we had Wayne Swan come into this place last year and say, 'Tonight I deliver four years of surpluses,' we did not believe him. And now the Australian people know why we did not believe him, because they have announced the fifth biggest budget deficit in the history of the Commonwealth—$19½ billion, with another $18 billion the year after that. They will never, ever deliver a budget surplus.


Those on the other side go on about the AAA credit ratings that they have been able to manage to achieve. I can tell the House that we had AAA credit ratings when the economy was managed by Peter Costello and John Howard. In fact we inherited in 1996 a AA credit rating and we lifted it to AAA. Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the two key agencies, gave us that AAA credit rating. The downgrades had come under the Labor government, so do not lecture us about AAA ratings. The record of the Costello-Howard years was not only getting back that AAA rating which Labor had lost, it was also paying back the $96 billion of government debt and leaving $70 billion in the bank.


It was also about creating more than two million new jobs and getting the lowest unemployment and inflation in three decades. It was also about a 22 per cent increase in real wages. That is what people are interested in—real wages growth. It was about getting industrial relations disputes down to record low levels. I will tell you this fact: in 2012, 301,000 days were lost to industrial disputes in Australia, but in the last year of the Howard government, what was that number? It was 49,700. That is the difference between us and them. We delivered real wage increases. We delivered two million new jobs. We delivered the lowest unemployment and inflation in three decades. We have delivered a AAA credit rating, and we obviously paid back all that debt.


What we are seeing now, through the economic mismanagement of those opposite, is 20,000-plus new regulations and 30 new taxes. We are seeing a budget deficit year after year and we are seeing gross debt 'quickly approach the $300 billion debt ceiling', which soon will be breached. We are seeing more than 250,000 jobs being lost in small business; we are seeing more than 100,000 jobs being lost in manufacturing; we have seen major financial decisions by companies to abandon big projects like the Port Hedland extension, Olympic Dam, and obviously there has been the sad news coming out of Ford for Broadmeadows and Geelong.


This is a really serious debate that the Australian people need to have. This government, when it came to power in 2007, had Kevin Rudd promising to be an economic conservative. He has been anything but that, and Julia Gillard has just driven debt higher and higher to the cost of the Australian public. (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:25):  I have to confess that as I was listening to that contribution from the member for Kooyong, who I know does care about his electorate and does his very best in this place, I was conjuring a visual image of a balloon that was getting bigger and bigger and filling with more and more hot air. I just want to puncture the bubble and pop that balloon and get some facts on the record for a change.


The reality is that the criticisms offered by others, the day-in day-out weekly dirge, the negativity, the ongoing decrying of Australia's economy and, indeed, of the challenges that are risen to every day by the Australian people, are just plain wrong. No matter how many times you tell the wrong thing over and over, it will never become the truth. That is a strategy upon which they are relying.


Let us just look to some people who are outside this place, who are making judgements and who have some credibility in terms of making judgements about the Australian economy. Let us look at the ANZ. Their assessment is that:


… substantial tightening of fiscal policy that would have been required to return the budget to surplus any earlier than outlined tonight would be too damaging.


They think we are doing a good job. Westpac said:


The Commonwealth Government's net debt position remains extremely manageable.


The CBA said:


The Australian economy is not one that needs aggressive fiscal consolidation.


And S&P said:


We continue to consider the Australian government's fiscal position to be a key rating strength ...


These third-party endorsements by people who stand outside this place—the ANZ, Westpac, CBA and S&P—are from very valuable commentators who are actually managing money, not just coming in here and playing with words and filling the air with noise and sound and very little truth—and certainly not the sort of truth that is going to inspire any Australian business to pick itself up and push on forward, which is the great strength of Australian businesses that I know from my own family experience and also from working with businesses in my economy.


I want to speak briefly to the budget that was delivered last night in Queensland, because I think that it is a bit of an interesting point of reflection right now. The Queensland Treasurer, Tim Nicholls, has just handed down his state's budget and he said that in the face of falling revenues he had constructed his budget in a particular way. He went on to say that Australia as a whole is facing the same issue. This is something that we have been trying to tell those opposite for years. Treasurer Nicholls acknowledged that out there, there has been a battered world economy. It is a sad thing for the member for North Sydney that Treasurer Nicholls might be more qualified to be the Commonwealth Treasurer than him, because at least he is acknowledging the reality that is out there in the real world. Treasurer Nicholls recognises that across this great nation government revenues are down. The member for North Sydney cannot. Even Treasurer Nicholls can see that returning to surplus too early is going to hurt Queenslanders, but the member for North Sydney cannot. Or can he? Something seems to have happened to him between 28 January and 18 April. This is what the member for North Sydney had to say on AMon 28 January this year:


Our commitment is emphatic. Based on the numbers published today, we will deliver a surplus in our first year and every year after that.


'There will be a surplus under the government I lead.' I am pretty sure that is what he is saying. But things are changing. In his speech on 18 April he said:


We are not going to go down the path of austerity simply to bring the budget back to surplus because it would end up being a temporary surplus …


This is incredible back-pedalling from a man who thinks he is fit to be the Treasurer of this country.


But there are similarities between the Treasurer of Queensland and the opposition's shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney. They share a vision of the world, a very different vision from the one we on this side have. Both of these Liberals—a Treasurer and a potential Treasurer—see a path back to surplus paved with job cuts. They see a path ahead where workers' rights are fair game for stripping back. Both see a path ahead where the future of our kids is just a casualty—thrown aside. Unlike our side, Treasurer Nicholls and the member for North Sydney see investment in education as money ill spent. They cannot understand the concept of investment—investment for the enhancement of this country, investment for the enhancement of our people and investment for the enhancement of our economy.


That observation brings us back to the crux of today's MPI—the appropriate management of the economy. This is not just a conversation about numbers; it is about appropriateness. We as a Labor government have managed the Australian economy through terrible economic circumstances since 2008. The Labor Party is the only party you can trust to ensure that sensible and appropriate action is taken to deal with challenges of magnitude, challenges such as the GFC. We responded to that challenge and we kept Australia working. On this side of parliament, we know what we have to do to keep Australia working.


I did not hear anything about that from the member for Kooyong. I did not hear anything about jobs, I did not hear anything about education, I did not hear anything about health, I did not hear anything about disability and I did not hear anything about investment. All I heard was fear, alarm and a disgraceful talking down of the Australian economy.


We do not believe it is appropriate to cut wages. We do not believe it is appropriate to take money out of education. It is not appropriate to cut superannuation. But this is what the Liberal Party plan to do if they get onto the Treasury benches. That is how they think they are going to strengthen the economy. That will not strengthen the economy; that will rip the guts out of the economy.


Labor has appropriately managed this economy. Through that appropriate management, we have kept Australia working. No amount of screaming, interjection or talking the place down can undo the fact that we have seen 14 per cent growth in the economy and the addition of almost a million jobs—960,000 jobs. I know it was cause for some sorrow amongst those on the other side to get the most recent data of 0.6 per cent growth in our economy this quarter and 2.5 per cent over the last year. The fact is that, unlike the very sad story those opposite want to tell every day—talking down the Australian economy and taking away hope—we have seen this economy grow at three times the OECD average. That is a fact.


We have given tax cuts to millions of Australian workers, leaving more money in their pockets, because we believe they deserve it. We are increasing Australia's retirement savings through an increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent, something those opposite are dedicated to blocking. If those opposite are allowed to implement their approach to managing the economy, an average 30-year-old working in my electorate will, upon reaching retirement, be $127,000 less well off. That is the kind of management of the economy that people in Robertson do not need and that people across the entire country do not need.


We made sure that we kept Australia working. We doubled investment in school education. We have upgraded facilities at every school and we have provided more information for parents than ever before. We are delivering skills. We have 190,000 extra students studying in this country. We have been able to do this by managing the economy and putting investment into things that will grow our wealth, that will grow the capacity of the community, that will grow the talents and capacities of our individuals whether they be in the field of business, music, arts or literature—any field of endeavour.


These things are possible only because we have appropriately managed the Australian economy. This country has not had a recession for 21 years, but I can tell you that 21 years ago when there was a recession, if you were an apprentice and you lost your job you lost your apprenticeship and it was eight years before you got it back. When we talk about the economy people's eyes glaze over and it is all about numbers, but the fact is that the economy is the thing that enables us to govern in a particular way. Managing it is a revelation of our values. We have invested in Australian people—we have made sure apprentices have kept jobs—and we will continue to do that. (Time expired)

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2013-06-05,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (17:36):  The subject of today's matter of public importance is this government's failure to appropriately manage the nation's economy. Boy, how much evidence do we have of that? On the night that Wayne Swan brought down last year's budget a few of us, including the members for Kooyong, Macarthur and Durack, went out the back and we shook our heads—how could the Treasurer say he was going to bring down a surplus budget? At that time, the consensus of opinion was that in this budget there would be a $20 billion to $25 billion deficit. We just plucked that figure out of the air, but how close we were to the real mark of $19.4 billion.


The Treasurer had a growth rate in last year's budget of 3.5 per cent. You do not have to be Einstein to go and talk to people who have jobs, who have small businesses or who have big businesses, or to those people who are in the mining industry or who are exporting into Asia—China, Japan, Korea and Indonesia. You just had to talk to them and they would have told you that things were not too good. Since 13 months ago, things have only got worse. What is more, the Treasurer in his wisdom still maintained, until November 2012, that he was on track—everything was rosy in the House, everything was rosy in the government, everything was rosy in the country. In December he changed his mind—'It might be hard to reach the surplus; we might get there but we might not.' Come April, in an outlandish statement he said, 'Bad news—we might have a deficit of about $7 billion.' That was for all of one week. The next week the Prime Minister herself said, 'No Wayne, you are wrong—it is going to be $12 billion.' Holy mackerel, Senator Penny Wong trumped them all with a $17 billion estimate. And she wasn't right! So much for forward projections. They cannot get their projections right for a week's time, so how can they get them right for four years or until 2019? How can they possibly get it right? It is amazing.


In the meantime there have been 30 new taxes brought on by this Labor government and 22,000 new regulations that small business and big business have to interpret and put up with. It is unbelievable. It was supposed to be one in, one out. There were approximately 200 out.


Their notion is power at any cost: 'Keep us in government at any cost. Too bad about our grandkids. Too bad about our kids. Let them pay the debt off.' What a great philosophy to have! They are not thinking ahead at all. They are thinking to the next election, and I hope they can work the odds that the bookmakers are offering at the moment. Our Treasurer talks about a $1.5 trillion economy, but that is mainly tied up in superannuation funds. And who puts the money in the superannuation funds? The Australian people, not the Australian government. So that is his trickery. He compares us with Greece, Italy, Cyprus, my old country of Ireland, Spain and Portugal but does not mention anything about our Asian neighbours China, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore, who are doing very well, with growth rates around five to eight per cent in all those countries.




Mr Christensen:
  They haven't got a carbon tax.




Mr O'DOWD:
  Yes, they have not got a carbon tax in those countries, and some of their emissions are coming down also.


Our credit card level went from $75 billion to $200 billion to $250 billion, and now she is raring up towards $300 billion. On the forward estimates, it is going to end up at nearly $400 billion. So where do we go? The member for Oxley said, 'We'd like to be here for another 20 years.' At this rate, there would not be many Australians left, that is for sure. We would all have to be overseas looking for work. Since 2007 electricity costs have gone up by 93 per cent, water and sewerage costs 63 per cent, utilities 79 per cent, gas 61 per cent, insurance 45 per cent, education 38 per cent, health services 40 per cent and rents 30 per cent. We talk about a low interest rate of 2.75 per cent, but I know a guy in my electorate who went to a bank yesterday for a loan for a small business and was quoted an interest rate of 14 per cent. So the 2.75 per cent is the cash rate but in reality, if you want to try and borrow money, do not expect 2.75 per cent. In fact, do not expect 4.75 per cent; expect a lot more.


If this country needs to kick-start our economy, there are a lot of things that we can do. This is what you do not do: there is an immigration budget blow-out of $6.6 billion and an NBN blow-out of $44.1 billion, and nearly $70 million has been spent on advertising the carbon tax, including $100,000 on three fake kitchens for the carbon tax ads. They could not just pick an ordinary kitchen. No, they had to go and build three kitchens for $100,000. A hundred million dollars was spent on compensation for the live export fiasco. A hundred and fifty million a year is being spent on spin doctors to sell Labor's policies. Wait for this: the knifing of Kevin Rudd cost $1.3 million in staff redundancy packages. Unbelievable! Furthermore, $10 million was donated to the trade unions in the last year's budget. The failed Malaysian solution cost $5 million. The list goes on and on and on.


I have a lot more to say, but I should read out this unprompted email I received today from an Emerald businessman:


Now about the IR laws Government need to know this company Western Gateway Motel—


that is his motel—


has chosen to close the restaurants on Sunday nights and all public holidays because of the high cost of employment with penalty rates [that no other country in the world pays] in these economic times. It's very noticeable when you get backpackers offering to work for no penalty rates just to get a job and they can't understand if they sign a piece of paper with that offer, if accepted, and the company got caught, the person responsible could go to jail with a heavy fine.


…   …   …


It's alright for Shorten to say that he wants Australians to be the best paid in the world, lets hope there is a job at the end of it. We are competing against America at $17.00 per hour.


The Rudd government has definitely failed to appropriately manage this economy. There are several more examples I do not have time to go into—with 30 seconds left on the clock. Needless to say, we have to get our country going: our mining industry is in a state of flux, our manufacturing industry is in a state of flux, our cement industry is in a state of flux and our dairy industry in Queensland is nearly gone. We need to get in and give them the incentives they need. Cut the red tape and cut it quick. Bring on September 14 as quickly as possible, because people are out there suffering and they need help.

Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013.



REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:



To ensure scrutiny of legislation associated with the Australian Education Bill.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,17,2,speech
"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (19:20):  As shadow minister for education I firmly believe that there is no shame in a learning disability; the only shame is if it is not recognised and treated. Dyslexia is a learning disability that can hinder a person's ability to read, write, spell and sometimes even speak and is a major challenge for many children and their parents. Dyslexia affects between three and 10 per cent of the population and can cause great difficulties for children in their early years of schooling if not diagnosed and treated properly. Dyslexia is not a sign that children are lazy or unintelligent. It is a genuine disability, and it is crucial for children who suffer from dyslexia that they receive the appropriate diagnosis, treatment and support in their school.


For parents of children with a disability choices are limited. They want what every parent wants for their child—the right to choose an education that will allow their child to reach their full potential. Currently, students with a disability can expect vastly different treatment depending on which state they live in, what type of school they go to and how their disability is classified. Proper support for children with dyslexia has not always been available. Although attitudes are changing as people come to understand the condition more, there is still much work to be done. We need to ensure that all Australian children with dyslexia get the support they need. It is imperative that dyslexia is recognised for what it is—a disability.


I have been working with Specific Learning Difficulties SA, SPELD, from my electorate of Sturt to raise awareness of this by asking the parliament to formally recognise dyslexia as a disability and to provide funding to ensure that students with dyslexia receive high-quality intervention as soon as diagnosis has been confirmed. Funding to meet the particular needs of students with dyslexia should be regarded as a basic entitlement for that child and should therefore be portable. I am also calling for the use of modified curricula and instruction, appropriate assistive technology and extra time for learning as students with dyslexia progress through school.


Recently I presented over 10,000 signatures on petitions advocating for the recognition of dyslexia as a disability to the Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition asks the House of Representatives to endorse the use of modified curricula and instruction, appropriate assistive technology and extra time for learning as students with dyslexia progress through school. I am pleased to present to the parliament the signed petition and ask that it is tabled at the end of my contribution.


I would like to use this forum to acknowledge the hard work of Angela Weeks and her team at SPELD SA. This was a tremendous community effort by all involved and I am extremely proud of everyone who signed this petition and circulated it. Recognition of dyslexia as a genuine disability and the provision of appropriate support will ensure that students with dyslexia are no longer discriminated against by our education systems.


On a personal note, can I say that my father, who was an ophthalmologist, was the first vice-president of SPELD in South Australia in the early 1970s and was known for his work in trying to break ground in using assistance through ophthalmology through optometry for children with dyslexia. He was acknowledged for his work by being named Father of the Year in South Australia in 1975 for his work with children with dyslexia. I table the petitions.




The petition
s
 read as follows—



To the honourable speaker and members of the House of Representatives:


This petition draws to the attention of the House concerns about the lack of recognition given to students with dyslexia in Australia.


Education systems and schools need to accept the clinical diagnosis of dyslexia and recognise that diagnosis indicates a genuine learning disability.


We therefore ask the House to recognise dyslexia as a disability and to provide funding to ensure that students with dyslexia receive high-quality intervention as soon as diagnosis has been confirmed.


This petition asks the House to endorse the use of modified curricula and instruction, appropriate assistive technology, and extra time for learning as students with dyslexia progress through school.


So that high-stakes tests and examinations assess ability and not disability, it is essential that students with dyslexia be offered access to accommodations, additional time, and the use of a computer.


Recognition of dyslexia as a genuine disability and the provision of appropriate support will ensure that students with dyslexia are no longer discriminated against by our education systems.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (09:30):  On Thursday, 23 May I had the pleasure of attending two Biggest Morning Teas, where dedicated members of the local community in the electorate of Casey raised money for the Cancer Council. The first was at Arrabri Community House, in Bayswater North, where Jackie Warren and the team from the house worked very hard selling tickets as well as cookbooks from the centre. The guests there included David Watt, the senior manager of the Mount Evelyn Community Bank; Councillor Tony Dib; and former councillor and mayor Peter Gurr.


Later in the morning I attended the Biggest Morning Tea in Mount Evelyn, which has grown steadily in the last two years. They raised a little over $4,000. That takes their total fundraising for the Cancer Council to a little over $10,000 over the past three years. They not only raised lots of money on the day; they also did so by holding two sausage sizzles on the Saturdays leading up to the morning tea on Thursday. I want to pay tribute to the fundraising team at Mount Evelyn: Kathie Freeman from the Mount Evelyn Chamber of Commerce; Meaghan Hicks and Garrick Hicks from the Functional Beverage Co and Yarra Valley Tea Company; Leanne Vaytauer, the branch manager at the Mount Evelyn Community Bank; and Glen Booth and hospitality students from Ranges TEC, who baked over 400 scones and came along on the day to serve Devonshire teas.


There were many local businesses who not only supported the morning teas on the day but donated many prizes for the raffle. There are too many to list but I would like to say once again in this House what a great job they do for their local community. This was another sign of the strong community spirit in Mount Evelyn. I pay tribute to the organisers and everyone who was involved at both morning teas in Bayswater North and Mount Evelyn.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (10:00):  My question relates to the capability of the joint strike fighter. The American Director of Operational Test and Evaluation's report of December 2012 shows that the JSF is more vulnerable to damage than current fighters, thus not meeting its operational requirements document; it shows that the aircraft has significant weight issues and is within 273 pounds of having reached a weight that will impact on performance; and it shows that the aircraft is unable to achieve its acceleration and turn performance thresholds, as predicted by critics but rejected previously by Defence and Lockheed Martin. Given these clear shortcomings of the aircraft, and the facts that the cost has blown out and that the aircraft will achieve its initial operational capability only in 2020 at the earliest and will be overmatched by stealth fighters coming out of Russia and China, why won't the government put the project on hold, put a request for proposal out to tender and hold a competition to find the best contender?

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:01):  With respect to the ASPI's detail book and in terms of the Defence budget and the white paper: as you are aware, ASPI has concluded that the federal government has a $33 billion shortfall in its funding for the 2013 white paper. It says:


… in absolute terms funding remains well below what was promised back in 2009. Yet plans for the ADF remain as ambitious as ever.


ASPI also reports that:


Consistent with this, the share of GDP will remain below 1.7% for the next decade.


How exactly does your government expect to afford the equipment procurement set out in the white paper when the budget is continuing to be cut? Also, ASPI has belled the cat: will you now confirm that your goal of returning defence spending to two per cent of GDP is rhetorical, since it is clear from ASPI's analysis that, at best, you will only seek to reach 1.7 per cent of GDP over the next 10 years?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:02):  I am aware of the ASPI report and, whilst I appreciate the diligence with which the ASPI team have gone about their work, I am afraid we do not agree with their outcomes—isn't that a surprise to you! I do want to make the observation that the opposition effectively shares the same policy towards Defence budgets—and for that I thank them. I know that we share a commitment to ensuring that we develop the defence capability, as we have decided to do.


Let me just make some observations about the calculation of the $33 billion shortfall, which assumes a three per cent growth in the Defence budget from 2008-09 to 2017-18 and a 2.2 per cent real growth beyond. Unfortunately this fails to take into account that, when the new funding model for Defence was announced in the 2009-10 white paper, there were deferrals and reprogramming of funding in the early years that were publicly announced in the 2009-10 budget. Additionally, the three per cent growth predicted was never three per cent constant annual growth, but rather an average growth rate over a longer period of time. In the 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13 budgets, there were expenditure reductions applied to the Defence budget totalling $8.9 billion over the period 2010-11 to 2020-21 as detailed in Defence's portfolio budget statements.


Could I also refer further to whether or not the Defence budget has been cut over the decade. The white paper announced that government had decided the Defence funding model would be based on the four-year forward estimates budget cycle, determined on an annual basis and taking into account contemporary strategic, economic and fiscal circumstances. That, I think, is surely understood by everyone. This aligns Defence funding with the Commonwealth's broader budget process. It provides certainty for planning in the short term but recognises the difficulty in forecasting fiscal circumstances in the longer term—which, as we know, is an art which is not perfect.


The Defence budget for 2013-14 is $25.3 billion. This, as we also know, is $1.1 billion higher than the 2012-13 budget of $24.2 billion. This will grow to $30.7 billion by 2016-17. The government will provide Defence with $113 billion across the budget and forward estimates. This compares to $103 billion in the 2012-13 budget and forward estimates, or a $10 billion increase over the four-year period. In dollar terms, this is more than has ever been spent before on defence, and that, I am sure, is well appreciated.




Mr Robert:
  But every budget spends more on everything.




Mr SNOWDON:
  No, it does not.




Mr Robert:
  It does so.




Mr SNOWDON:
  No.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas

Mr SNOWDON:
  We could just have a—I am sorry.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Well, you could, but I will not allow it, so you will direct all your questions and answers through the chair.




Mr SNOWDON:
  You're a hard bugger! But let me just say I appreciate the way in which the opposition shadow minister is carrying himself, and I do not particularly mind his interjections.




Mr Robert interjecting
—





Mr SNOWDON:
  But through the chair—absolutely. The government, as we said, have spent more than ever before. The government also provide Defence with six years of general guidance beyond the forward estimates for planning purposes. This obviously concedes that attempting to provide tens of—I do not know what we are doing, but people are escaping—years of funding with precision is extremely difficult given the volatility in the world economy and government revenue forecasts. This budget, the government will provide Defence guidance of over $220 billion. Together, these amount to approximately $333 billion. So we are obviously committed, as you well know, to increasing the Defence budget funding towards a target of two per cent of GDP as and when fiscal circumstances allow, and I think that is broadly consistent with the view of the opposition. It is a long-term objective that will be implemented in an economically responsible way as and when fiscal circumstances allow.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:07):  The minister has taken spinning to a twirling dervish level, can I just say. Minister, despite the eloquent words, there is no escaping $25 billion in cumulative cuts to the Defence budget over the last five years, and there is no escaping cuts as a proportion of GDP, where defence expenditure is at the lowest level since 1938. No level of fiscal means and new budget process can escape that.


I draw your attention, sir, to the white paper and the resultant budget documents that look at the purchase of the 12 EA18G Growlers. The cost of acquiring the Growler, as per the white paper and the budget documents, is $2.974 billion, yet the budget paper makes it very clear that the only allocation of funds for that is $200 million in 2014-15. The budget also makes it expressly clear that the remainder—$2.774 billion—is to be met from within Defence's existing resources, with outlays out to 2012-22. It is page 288, for your staff rapidly searching their documents behind you. Existing resources—that is an absorption, Minister, of $2.774 billion. In your world, absorption is just one of those economic terms. Where I come from, absorption is a cut, because if you have to absorb $2.77 billion then you have to cut something else, because that is the way you absorb something. So, Minister, where will those cuts come from to allow the absorption of $2.774 billion for Growler?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:09):  I am surprised at the cynicism and even the sarcasm at times—to think that we would not do the right thing! As announced as part of the 2013 white paper, the government, as you well know, has decided to acquire the 12 new-build EA18G Growler electronic attack aircraft instead of—and I think this is far preferable in any event—converting Australia's 12 existing FA18F Super Hornet aircraft into the Growler configuration. These 12 Growler aircraft will enhance significantly, as I am sure you will agree, the ADF's electronic warfare capability and, together with the JSF and the Super Hornet will form a formidable air combat force capable of controlling both air and electronic environments. I think it is really important that we appreciate what we are getting here in terms of capability.


These additional 12 aircraft will cost approximately $2.9 billion. Offsetting this cost is the $1.5 billion already committed in the Defence Capability Program to convert 12 of Australia's existing FA18F Super Hornet aircraft into the Growler configuration. That which will no longer go ahead, so there is a saving which will be redirected towards the acquisition of the Growler. The government will also provide Defence with an additional $200 million towards this purchase in 2014-15. The remaining funding will be found through adjustments to the priority activities across Defence, which you have alluded to, including proposed capability acquisitions.


You would appreciate the way we estimate the costs of these things and then ultimately fund them. The details will be provided in the next Defence Capability Plan, which will be published before the end of the 2012-13 financial year. I can assure the shadow minister that we really understand the financial costs of doing this business and managing the costs within the budgeted framework that we have set for Defence.

 (Fadden) (10:13):  For the sake of putting a senatorial hat on and seeking a supplementary in the same space: Minister, in answering the question 'Where well the extra $2.77 billion come from that has to be absorbed?' you indicated that $1.5 billion will be redirected to the DCP, which was going to be used for conversion, and for the rest will just have to wait and see and trust the government. Frankly, that is hilarious considering the $25 billion worth of cuts. But let us just park that to one side. The $1.5 billion in the DCP that was previously committed for the conversion, which you are now looking to redirect, was never actually committed in real terms but was always to be absorbed within the DCP. It was never actually committed. Minister, can you point to me exactly where that $1.5 billion was committed?

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:14):  Since I was elected in 2010 I have spent quite a bit of time on the Defence Subcommittee with my colleagues here. We have been researching and inquiring into the mental health of those in the ADF, particularly those soldiers who are returning from deployments overseas. We have had extensive consultations throughout the country, with agencies including the Defence Community Organisation, Defence Families of Australia, RSL and Soldier On—a range of organisations who have highlighted a number of gaps in the system, particularly between DVA and Defence in terms of those agencies talking to each other, in terms of getting a seamless approach to the management of mental health and of those who return injured from deployment overseas.


I have three questions for the minister. The first is, what does the latest research into mental health issues associated with military service show us? Secondly, what is the government doing for the mental health of our current and former service people? Finally, what is the government's estimates of the future numbers of service personnel who have been engaged in operational activities over an extended period who may have mental health problems arising from these activities?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:16):  I thank my friend the member for Canberra for her questions. As she would know, and I am sure the opposition would agree, during my time as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Veterans' Affairs our absolute concern has been that in the past we have not really appreciated the extent of mental issues both in the defence community, current serving men and women, and also in the veteran community. That is why we had the Dunt review and all that flowed from it, why we have massive new expenditure into mental health in the Defence Force and why we did a suicide study in the veteran community. I think it is agreed across the board that there is no doubt that we are committed and Defence is committed to promoting good health but also, most particularly, good mental health.


Since 1999—these figures are quite illuminating—more than 65,000 ADF personnel have been deployed overseas and nearly 38,000 of those have deployed more than once. In the Navy, 10 per cent have deployed four times or more, and marine technicians feature very prominently. In the Army, seven per cent have deployed four times or more, with the Special Air Services and commandos featuring prominently. Some of those have done a large number of rotations. In the Air Force, eight per cent have deployed four times or more, with airborne electronics analysts and air combat officers featuring prominently. I have met a lot of these characters—they are wonderful people who have committed themselves significantly to years overseas, once you combine their service.


Recent research undertaken by the Centre for Traumatic Stress Studies at the University of Adelaide indicates that we can expect to see a minimum rate of personnel with diagnosable mental disorder of 22 per cent in a 12-month period. That 22 per cent is comparable with the general Australian community. Estimates of the prevalence of mental disorder, including PTSD, anxiety and depression, as well as alcohol issues, does not equate to the number of personnel who will actually seek help. The research also shows that only half of those with a mental health disorder will seek treatment in the next two years. That is an issue for us. Although the rate of those seeking help may increase, it is likely that this will occur at a gradual pace. We believe that there will be a rising tide of people seeking assistance and requiring help rather than the tsunami that people have been referring to. This research is supported by Dr Graeme Killer, the DVA Principal Medical Adviser.


We are confident that our efforts to educate and encourage our people to seek help as early as possible may also have an effect in increasing the number of those seeking treatment who require it. The whole question of resilience, of people understanding that it is okay to actually report a mental health illness or issue, is something which we have had to really drive hard. I want to pay tribute to the former Chief of the Defence Force, the current leader of the Defence Force, the previous service chiefs and the current service chiefs for their leadership in this regard. They have made very clear their expectations and the obligations of those in command positions to ensure that those beneath them are fully appraised of what they should do and have an awareness of the issues involved.


We are interested in supporting all of our personnel, no matter the source or cause of their mental health problems. Defence has improved its resilience training, screening, post-deployment reintegration activities, and  treatment and rehabilitation programs to ensure our servicing men and women are supported throughout their careers. I will sit down in a moment, but I do want to say some more about this because the elements of this year's budget which deal directly with our response to mental health are quite important. It goes not only to serving personnel but also their families.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:21):  Minister, thank you for the update in terms of mental health and wellbeing of our service personnel for which you enjoy the coalition's strongest and widest bipartisan support. Can I just move back on to the rural budget since these are a form of budget estimates, albeit in the House? Minister, I think we have ascertained that the $2.77 billion is to be absorbed. I think we have ascertained that the government does not know where that is coming from and your comments as to the details will be advised. I think that says it all.


We will all just wait and see. Somehow, Minister, I think you and I could put $5 down that you would not advise prior to parliament being prorogued but we will wait and see. Apart from the $2.77 billion being absorbed, it is my melancholy duty to inform you—and indeed the House—that you have also asked Defence to absorb another $150 million in other costs according to the PBS documents. These include the Defence abuse reparation payments, Operation Resolute costs—that is the cost of the Navy taxi service for asylum seekers—and security for the G20 leader summit. The list goes on.


Without making any comment on what the money is used for—and that is not my intent—I am simply putting out that $150 million worth of costs have to be absorbed again. Minister, can you please outline where these costs will be absorbed—that is, what part of Defence will have to be cut in terms of the budget? Are we are talking about personnel travel? Are we mothballing equipment? Are we pushing some elements of the DCP out? What exactly is being moved, absorbed or cut to make way for this $150 million in a range of areas I have outlined?

Of course, he would realise that we have the capability to get enhanced efficiencies out of this very large organisation and we intend to do so. As well as that, we know and he knows that the way this system works is that there is often quite a continuous reprioritisation of projects. We will do that on a continuing basis to meet our obligations and to ensure that we have the capability that is required for the Australian Defence Force and understand that that commitment goes not only to the capability in terms of equipment but also for investments through our personnel. I have no doubt at all that we will meet our obligations in both parts in terms of the capability development and deployment of our assets, as well as our investment into our Defence personnel.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:24):  Minister, in answer to the last two questions in terms of where funding is coming from for absorbed measures, you have told us the details are to be advised. You have talked of enhanced efficiencies in the organisation and you have talked about reprioritisation of programs. The only thing you have not spoken about, of course, is detailed programmatic specificity, but I am sure that is coming. If we can move onto some other funding issues, in January this year the Prime Minister launched the national security policy. In her speech she said:


The Government has already committed substantial funding and additional effort to strengthen our cyber capabilities, including $1.46 billion out to 2020 to strengthen our most sensitive networks.


That is an enormous amount of money. You can imagine my interest in finding out where that money was coming from, so I asked the Prime Minister through a question on notice. It was revealed that the funding was in fact to last until 2030, not 2020—a slight error of 10 years. The Prime Minister's grievous error—apparently a staffing error; you have to watch those staff—amounts to $114 million a year. That is quite an error, really, when you think about it. Given that Defence is the lead agency and is responsible for amalgamating the Commonwealth's cybersecurity operations under the new Australian cybersecurity operations centre, how does the government intend to make up this shortfall in funding or are the details to be advised, are there enhanced efficiencies or is there reprioritisation of programs?

I am sure you would appreciate that sometimes, very occasionally, very rarely, almost never, but sometimes, these things happen. I would not be condemning the Prime Minister or, indeed, the department. I think we need to appreciate that sometimes these things do happen. We can accept the criticism but not the cynicism.


Since coming to government in 2007 this government has increased the budget for intelligence and security in defence from $376 million in 2007-08 to $517 million in 2013-14. That funding will increase to $637 million over the forward estimates—a further increase of $120 million, or 23 per cent. The Defence Intelligence and Security Group has been excluded from the efficiency dividend—I am not sure that you are aware of that. I am confident we will meet our commitments in that regard.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:28):  I thank the member for her question. One of the challenges that became obvious to me and to others is the fact that whilst we had very good systems in place, and developed new systems to support them, to address the needs of current serving men and women, we actually did not have in place what we should have had in place for families. So we have been moving in that space to provide support for families of current serving men and woman and also support for those people who may have separated from the Defence Force. Significantly, you would be aware, there was a restriction on who got access to some of these entitlements post service.


In the Defence white paper 2013 and in the budget, the government announced a $26.4 million package for enhanced mental health programs for serving and ex-serving personnel and their families, to be administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. DVA has in place a number of mental health initiatives. These include online mental health support information, GP services, psychologists and social work services, specialist psychiatric services, pharmaceutical support, post-traumatic stress disorder programs and hospital services for those who need it.


What we have done here, though, is expand non-liability health cover. This initiative expands the existing arrangements with support and immediate treatment for diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders and depression without the need to lodge a compensation claim. That is quite important, because it means that people get almost immediate access to the treatment. These treatments will be expanded to include treatment for alcohol and substance misuse disorders. These arrangements have already been available to veterans with operational service, and this will be expanded to include veterans with eligible peacetime service since 1994.


It is important to understand that what we are doing here is expanding the range of people who now get access to these services. For example, those people who have been on operational service on border protection, those people who have been involved in humanitarian assistance, such as at Aceh, and those people who have been involved in other peacetime operations are now eligible to get these services. That is quite important, because we know that, whether it is in border protection or humanitarian assistance, some of these personnel have been exposed to really traumatic and quite dreadful experiences which have required them to seek support.


Prior to the passage of this budget, these people have not been able to access the support that other people with active service have been able to access—and that, to me, is really quite important. We are also expanding the amount of support that we are giving to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to include these people. That is important. The VVCS is a very good organisation. It is the organisation that we go to to provide support in the veteran community.


But we have still got more to do, and I do not shy away from this challenge. As I said, we have 65,000 personnel who have now served overseas since 1999. We had fewer than 60,000 people serve in Vietnam. So the number of people we have now who have experienced war is far larger than the number who served in Vietnam. Clearly, we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past—and we will not—and we now have to make sure that both in the short term and the long term, the needs of these people are properly addressed.


The seamless transition between DVA and defence is really vital in that regard. We have worked towards a system where that is close to happening. In many places it is very good and in other places it is a bit 'how's your father?' but it will be fixed. I am very, very pleased with the cooperation we now have as a result of an MOU between the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in dealing with these sorts of issues.

I note the comment that you made regarding cyber funding—that slight $1.46 billion rounding error over 10 years. I note that you have said that it is an isolated incident—a one-off—but I remember doing the coalition's response to the Prime Minister's national security statement where she spoke about Australia's defence expenditure comparable to other nations in the world. After the speech, the transcript that followed, had a different series of wording and the transcript was changed. Once may be isolated, Minister, but twice, unfortunately, is a pattern. But let us not be churlish about these things. Let us move on to DSTO funding.


The 2013-14 defence portfolio budget statements say that in 2012-13 DSTO received $441 million in funding. Next year, 2013-14, DSTO will receive $427 million. That is a $14 million cut, Minister. Let us also not forget that, in 2010-11 to 2011-12, you cut $13 million, and for 2011-12 to 2012-13 you cut $22 million. Minister, that is a cumulative cut of at least $49 million out of DSTO. And they are undertaking a significant organisational reform program, which I think is wise—and can I say: I am impressed with the new Chief Defence Scientist, Dr Alex Zelinsky. What I am not impressed about, Minister, is how you can possibly justify cutting the DSTO budget by $14 million this year alone and cumulatively by $49 million. How do you justify that? And, more importantly, what have you cut—or, Minister, are the details to be advised? Are we talking about enhanced efficiencies, or is there reprioritisation of programs?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:35):  I thank the member for his question and really do thank him for his interest in DSTO, which I think is one of the most remarkable organisations in government. Unfortunately, it hides its light under a bushel. That is for obvious reasons, in some regards, but I think we can do a lot more to publicise the work that it does.


Let me make it very clear: nothing that we will do in the context of DSTO's budget will affect our support for operations, which is its primary function. In my experience of this organisation over five years, it occupies a unique position in the Defence community but also in the research community across this country. What it is doing now is building a capacity for collaboration which did not exist previously, in the sense that, while it did collaborate with universities and other places, it is now developing a capacity to leverage off research which is being done in outside organisations which it can then use, or leverage off internally, for work which is being directed as a part of the national security space, or in support for operations, or in its future work.


You know the scale of work which DSTO does. It is vital in our support for operations. And, in terms of our support for operations in Afghanistan in particular, it has played a very important role in providing quite timely responses to immediate threats. And these timely responses to immediate threats have been able to be put in place very quickly. Nothing we have done and nothing we would do in the context of the better efficiencies that we want to achieve over the organisation will have any impact on our support for operations, and that is our primary function.


In the context of forecasting what our scientific requirements will be: again, I have no doubt about the depth of the relationships we have through DSTO with our counterparts in other countries, particularly in the 'five eyes' community, and the work which they are doing to support us. And leveraging off research which is being done elsewhere and partnering in research which is being done elsewhere has led to better outcomes. You would know that we now share facilities and research with these. So we are not doing repeat research; we are working collaboratively. These are giving us efficiencies, as they are giving other nations efficiencies—and here I am principally talking about the United States and Great Britain.


It is important that we appreciate the changing scientific environment: the greater collaboration between nations and the greater collaboration locally—not only between universities but now working more broadly with the private sector to appreciate what research capacities are in the private sector and trying to spin off that research for our Defence purposes.


I think we are really very fortunate to have Dr Zelinsky, as you rightly pointed out. His predecessor was a wonderful human being and a very, very good leader. They are different personalities, but they both have done significant work and done this nation a great service.


I have no doubt—because I meet with scientists in DSTO on a regular basis—about their capacity to continue to produce work of the finest quality for us and to guarantee not only support for our operations but also support for our national security, because they are now responsible for research in the national security space. I am in awe of this organisation. I am not a scientist; I do not have a scientific bone in my body. But I understand good research when I see it and I do appreciate the huge brains working on this stuff. I have no doubt that the efficiencies which we will gain through the decisions that have been taken will lead to a very positive outcome for all of us.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (10:40):  Minister, I would like to take you back to some of the earlier comments you made. Obviously, as our engagement overseas changes in Afghanistan and as our role in the Pacific and in East Timor winds down, more and more Defence personnel are coming back. You mentioned this in your answer to the member for Canberra. I have a particular question—




Mr Robert:
  Well, get to it.




Mr Snowdon:
  Leave him alone!




Mr PERRETT:
  That's all right.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Order, members! That was not helpful. It is not helpful, member for Fadden.




Mr PERRETT:
  I might restart. With our overseas Defence personnel returning to Australia—you touched on it in your answer to the member for Canberra—what support will be provided? I have a cousin in the MEAO at the moment. In my small role as a legal officer in the RAAF I have dealt with a few matters where drugs and alcohol have been an issue; they can become a part of your lifestyle, especially when you are posted overseas, as anyone would know.


When people came back from World War II, we already had a very strong RSL support network. Sadly, our World War II veterans are passing away. Many of the office bearers are now Korean and Vietnam war veterans. But, as you said, there is a new wave of veterans coming back from overseas, and you mentioned the specific support given to wives and girlfriends, who might be the first sentinels, I guess—the first to know if something is going on. I am particularly interested in any support that is provided in terms of linking people up for employment and support groups. Many of the people who come back from Afghanistan or other overseas areas of operations do not feel like turning to the RSL—with all deference to our wonderful RSL groups. Minister, I recently had you at the Sunnybank RSL, and that was the statement they made about trying to link up with former ADF personnel in our community. How do they make contact when there is often a generation gap? The RSLs provide excellent services. My Sunnybank RSL—and my other RSLs, but I focus on that one because you came along to the meeting there, Minister—have great support networks that they can link people to, but it is about finding those former ADF personnel. They could be living right alongside, but they do not put a flag out the front saying 'veteran'. The new lot of veterans might benefit from the support networks there and from groups like the RSL.


Minister, could you detail the sort of support, the sorts of links and the sorts of personnel that are involved in providing support; and, on a more informal basis, what you have seen in terms of best practice around the nation in your job, because you do straddle those various portfolios? What are the learnings there that are not necessarily budget items, or have only been flagged as budget items that we might be able to roll out in the months or years ahead?


Obviously, our RSLs change. Sadly, the numbers in three RSLs in my patch are becoming smaller every year. One has had to amalgamate; another is looking particularly skinny. I have been able to provide it with new accommodation, which might sustain it. There are not long waiting lists to get into RSLs. In my electorate, clubs which have a services club attached to them have finances and they can have lots of resources, but the number of personnel lining up to become members is not great. In my area of Sunnybank, as you know, the demographics of the community have changed. I am wondering whether you could comment on that. (Time expired)

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:45): I thank the member for his question. I know about his deep appreciation of the importance of dealing appropriately with serving veterans and with former serving veterans. I go back for a moment, if I may, to the health initiative announced through the white paper and in this budget. As well as expanding the mental health non-liability cover, there is a post discharge GP health assessment. This initiative will support a health assessment fitness check for all ADF members after discharge and the fitness check will be supported by a health screening tool with a mental health component which will be developed for use by GPs. The check will be supported through existing Medicare items. I will not go through the detail of that—I may do later—or through the changes to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. One of the things we are doing, which will be of interest to you, is developing the Peer-to-Peer Support network. This initiative is a program to support the recovery of clients with a mental health condition by providing a non-clinical support network. Building on the experience of a successful men's health peer education program, the Peer-to-Peer Support network enables individuals to be assisted by their peers without judgment or stigma attached to the relationship as it is based on mutual understanding and experience.


One of the things we have learnt and we know the RSL accepts—and this goes to your question about how you provide access for people after they have served—is that it is true, unfortunately, that many serving men and women and former serving men and women in a younger age cohort do not see the direct relevance of the RSL. There is a capacity now for serving men and women who are overseas to become online members of the RSL and that is a positive thing, and we are providing, through the relationship between Defence and DVA, on-base support officers in all the major bases across the country. The on-base support officers are DVA employees who provide advice and assistance to current serving men and women. As a former serving man, the shadow minister would know that there are people of the highest rank in this country who are claimants in the DVA system because of injuries incurred while they were in service. It is part of the way we deal with current serving men and women. We have discovered that, as a result of having the on-base advisory services on base for 18 months or so, they provide a unique space for connecting Defence personnel with ex-service organisations. I must say that at Holsworthy the Vietnam Veterans organisation has almost a full-time presence and the DVA on-base advisory person works closely with that organisation—so they pick them up.


But we do have a challenge, and it is an enormous challenge, about how we track people once they leave the service. This is an obligation which we have because we want to make sure. Effectively, once you go through a recruitment centre and walk through the gates at Wagga for your initial training, you are potentially a client of the Commonwealth till you are dead. That is an important thing to understand. If you put the uniform on, you can expect to be looked after all your life if you have an accident, are injured, are wounded or whatever, and if you are killed your family will get support. For them, that is until the partners are no longer with us. So it is very, very important that we have a seamless transition and we try and track those people who are serving, beyond service, and provide them with the support they desire. I know that we will be doing the DVA bit shortly, and I will come to that in more detail. (Time expired)

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:50):  Minister, a fine answer. It bore absolutely no resemblance to the wandering, waffling question but was a fine answer nonetheless. You started that answer by talking about ADF health, so I think—




Mr Perrett:
  Madam Deputy Speaker—




Mr ROBERT:
  No, just sit down.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson

Mr Perrett:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would ask the member to withdraw that suggestion. I found it quite offensive.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. Would you please withdraw.




Mr ROBERT:
  I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr ROBERT:
  You started the answer, Minister, talking about ADF health, so let us talk about ADF health—I think it is great—because the 2012-13 budget delayed the rollout of the ADF free family healthcare program by a further 12 months. That is the 2012-13 budget, the current budget, which delayed it by 12 months in order to save 50 million bucks. Taking into account this delay—which is not the first, I might add—what we currently have now bears no resemblance to what was promised by the Labor government in 2007. The program was due to begin on 1 July this year. The 2012-13 budget papers even made special mention and called it a saving. The government is going to save $50 million by taking free family health care from ADF dependants.


This year's budget papers make absolutely no mention of the program at all—a signature program, Minister, from the election of the mighty Labor government in 2007, and there is no mention of it. But—surprise, surprise—a small note appeared a week or so ago on the Defence website which simply states that the program has been delayed once more, now beginning on 1 January 2014. Minister, I must have missed your press release, and I apologise that I did not receive that, or I must have missed it in the budget, but I picked it up on that small note on the website: another six-month delay after the election. The trial program has now been running for over four years. That simply has to be some sort of record in terms of a trial program for the ADF free family health care.


Minister, given the repeated failure of the government to implement the full program as your government promised to do—and there is a danger of creating two classes of ADF dependants, those with access and those without—can you guarantee that this program, delayed many, many times, will actually start on 1 January 2014, and what is the cost of the program?

The 2009 Defence White Paper announced a three-year extension to the trial health care arrangements for the provision of basic medical and dental care to Defence families living in remote and regional locations. In the 2012-13 Budget, the Government decided to extend the trial until 30 June 2013.


You alluded to that. It continues:


The Government intends to continue the trial until 31 December 2013 and then cease the trial and make the program available to all dependants of permanent ADF members and dependants of Reserve members on Continuous Full-Time Service from 1 January 2014.


That will happen.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:54):  I am pleased you asked that, because it is now time to put to rest some of the furphies we have heard over an extensive period of time. Let us be clear in the first instance that superannuation retirement pay is not income support. Superannuation retirement pay cannot be seen as equivalent to a pension, an age pension or an invalidity pension. They are totally different things.


The opposition, through its spokesman on veterans' affairs, has conflated these two issues and led people to believe that somehow or another the superannuation entitlement they receive as payments as a result of their service is equivalent to the age pension. It is not a valid comparison. I know it. You know it. The shadow minister knows it. Minister Minchin, in a previous government, knew about it. He canned the whole idea. Even the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has confused the issue. Earlier this year in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, he said, 'What is good for civilians is good for former Defence personnel.' Does he know what former Defence personnel get. Does he know the arrangements they have entered into when they join the Defence Force.


This fair indexation policy, which you are supposedly advocating, is anything but fair. Nobody who joined the Australian Defence Force after 1991 is covered by the opposition's proposal. The 150,000 members of the MSBS, those people who have served in Iraq, Timor-Leste, the Solomons and Afghanistan, who are not in the DFRDB scheme, are not covered. Indeed I was at an event recently where a former very senior and distinguished serviceman was talking with a currently serving man, who is very distinguished in his own right. The former serviceman said to me, 'What are you doing about our pensions?' I said, 'Nothing. We are not going to change it in the way the opposition has proposed.' He said, 'It is all about helping our young blokes. It is all about these young blokes here.' The young serving person said, 'No it's not. It has no impact on me at all.'


Yet we have this masquerade, this policy, as if somehow or another the whole of the veteran community is going to be impacted by it. Despite the opposition's posturing, the DFRDB scheme is a good one. Let me just explain what the benefits are. The payment benefits on retirement after 20 years of service are: 75 per cent, under 45 years of age; 75 per cent, retired after 20 years of service, before 45 years of age; and 40 per cent with 35 to 40. They have the ability to commute five times the annual retirement pay in exchange for a reduction in retirement pay. This option has been taken up by 99 per cent of members. There is a higher employer contribution than other schemes: 30 per cent, against the community average of nine per cent. Adopting the opposition's policy would increase the government's contribution to closer to 40 per cent and this is just not sustainable. The scheme has a higher percentage of final salary superannuation retirement pay compared to other Commonwealth schemes: the military is 51.25 per cent at 30 years; the civilian equivalent is less than 40 per cent.


So what is Mr Abbott wanting? Does he want us to bring back the entitlements under DFRDB to make them equivalent to public servants. If that is his intention he should say so.


Since 1988 a separate three per cent productivity benefit has been paid fortnightly, and that is available as a lump sum on retirement. Let us get to the nub of this. What does this mean for people currently leaving the service? A colonel equivalent who retired at the beginning of 2012 after 30 years service got a retirement pay of $68,000, converted to a lump sum of around $340,000 in exchange to reduced annual payment of $55,000. That is supposed to be equivalent to the age pension. (Time expired)

Mr McCormack:
  Are we going to veterans now?




Mr SNOWDON:
  This is part of the same question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Minister, please continue.




Mr SNOWDON:
  A major equivalent who retired at the beginning of 2010 after 20 years service, with retirement pay of $30,000 per annum, converted it to a lump sum of around $150,000 in exchange for an annual payment of $26,000. That is equivalent to the age pension. They are seen as the same. How can that be? What is the difference between an income support payment, the age pension, and a retirement benefit as part of a superannuation scheme? They are not equivalent. They are different. Yet we have got the shadow minister going round to RSL conferences and trying to give people the view that somehow or other these things are the same. That is misleading, it is wrong, it is confusing and it is designed to confuse. I can accept that people may think that they want a different indexation scheme. I can accept that. I am happy to have that discussion. But people think that somehow or other we are going to sit back here and accept the proposition that a retirement benefit scheme, a superannuation scheme, is to be seen as the same as an income support scheme. I think it is downright wrong.



An honourable member:  Dishonest.




Mr SNOWDON:
  It is certainly dishonest. Let me just go to how these schemes currently operate. Let us put it in a proper context. Again, this is a superannuation scheme. It is superannuation, not income support. Understand this: over the period November 2007 to 1 January 2013, the salary for privates through to colonels in the ADF increased in excess of 19 per cent. From 1 January 2008 to 1 January 2013, a one-year shorter period, the comparable CPI increases for people on DFRB and DFRDB was 17 per cent. Are you guys trying to tell us that somehow or other these guys are not being treated fairly? I have already told you that your leader, from his own statements, has no idea what you are talking about. He says what is good for civilians is good for former Defence personnel. Well, these former Defence personnel are doing a damn sight better than their civilian counterparts—as they should.


Let us not be confused here. Trying to describe this superannuation scheme as an income support scheme, which is what the opposition is deliberately doing by confusing the two, is palpably dishonest, and I am sick to death of it. They have been out there in the veteran community, putting out misleading documents—documents which have emanated from the shadow minister's office and been sent to local members for distribution. We get them, so we know precisely what you are up to. You go out there deliberately misleading, effectively telling people lies, and you expect us not to respond. I have not responded until this day, but by God I am angry, because you have deliberately misled the veteran community. You have deliberately been dishonest to the veteran community. I do not think it is reasonable or fair for a person who wants to be the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to adopt that sort of behaviour. He should front up to the veteran community and explain to them the difference between a superannuation scheme and an income support scheme such as an age pension. But you will not, because I know what you are like. In any event, though, I know the truth, and people who are reasonable and who are prepared to assess this matter properly also know the truth. (Time expired)

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:04):  This crosses both defence and veterans' affairs, but I will ask it in a veterans affairs way. When Bruce Scott, the member for Maranoa, was the veterans' affairs minister, he came to Wagga Wagga to open the refurbishment of the Wagga Wagga war cemetery. I will start, in the spirit of bipartisanship, by commending the minister for the Anzac centenary grants; $100,000 is going to be well used in each and every electorate. Applications for my committee in the Riverina closed last Friday, and the minister will be pleased to know that we received 30 applications from interested people, many ex-service people, who are very keen to ensure that that $100,000 is well spent.


I would like to see a statue dedicated to John Ryan, the Victoria Cross winner from Tumut, who won his Victoria Cross on the Hindenburg Line in 1918. He enlisted on the Kangaroos march, which took off from Wagga Wagga in 1915. I know the minister would be well aware of the Kangaroos march and the work being done by Graham Brown and others from Exeter to re-enact that wonderful historical event in which so many people from the 55th Battalion and others marched out of Wagga Wagga, ended up in Sydney and went to the Great War. Many of them did not return. John Ryan was one who did return. Unfortunately, he did not have a happy life after he returned. It is sad to say that his latter years did not treat him well. He found it hard to get employment. I hope that now, thanks to the government’s initiative, we can remember him in death perhaps better than we looked after him in life. I commend the government for that initiative.


I would like to ask the minister whether there has been a creeping reduction in the number of regimental bands in the Army. Many veterans have contacted me about this matter. As the minister would be well aware, Kapooka is the Army Recruit Training Centre; all the Army recruits go through Kapooka. It is a wonderful Army base. My city of Wagga Wagga is a tri-service city, with the Navy, the Air Force and the Army Recruit Training Centre.


In 1972, in its first year, the Whitlam Labor government said that it was going to disband the Kapooka band. A spirited group, led by Bruce Pinney and the late alderman Helen Frisby, started a Save the Band campaign. I do hope that we do not have to do that again. The number of Kapooka band members has reduced from something like 28 to 20, and that is a great concern. Not only does the Army band play at all the march-outs; it also plays an integral role in many fundraising activities in the community. I know how focused the current commandant, Colonel David Hay, whose posting is due to conclude at the end of this year, is on community efforts. First and foremost, the priority of the band is to play at the army march-outs. They do a wonderful job. Many of the band members have been to Gallipoli and Villers-Bretonneux in recent years to play at various Anzac Day ceremonies. They are renowned bandspeople, great musicians.


There is a great fear that, because of the government’s cutbacks in defence and the government’s cutbacks—they are called savings—in veterans' affairs, the band is being reduced, along with bands right throughout Australia. I would like the minister to answer that question. I know it is a Defence portfolio question, but many veterans have asked me about it. I know the minister is well aware of an ex-Kapooka service soldier, Bert Hoebee. Minister, Bert is dismayed by the tone you used in your 15 May discussion about the DFRDB and DFRB and would like an apology on behalf of the ex-servicemen who he thinks have been slighted by your attack on them over the superannuation and veterans' affairs entitlement issue. Thank you, Minister.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:09):  I thank the member for his question and say to him that I am not aware of any plans to cut back further on regimental bands or their participation in ceremonial activities. I thank him for his participation in the Centenary Local Grants Program. I think it is a very important initiative and we want every local member in the country to be engaged with it. We know from the previous commemorative events we had in the nineties that this can be very successful. But it does rely on the local community taking ownership along with the local member and getting the right outcome for the community. I do thank the member and I understand the importance to Wagga of Kapooka and the triservice arrangements which exist there.


There is now a general acceptance, I think, that we are entering a period of very important commemorative events which will last until Armistice Day 2018. That is important to us, but it is going to create a lot of demand for things like ceremonial banks—because there will be a lot of activity. One of the things that Defence is doing is planning how to use its personnel in an appropriate way. The Federation Guard, as you know, is a very important part of this and has been working consistently at a very high level at all the ceremonial events I have been present at, including smaller events we have taken veterans away to—for commemorative services in Crete, Singapore and elsewhere. The Federation Guard have been fundamental to that, as they were at Anzac Day at Gallipoli and Anzac Day at Villers-Bretonneux—and that will continue to be the case.


I can give you an assurance that, from my perspective, there are no plans to diminish or deny the opportunities for these bands to be participating. But they are operational issues. At the end of the day, these people are service personnel who are required to work at the direction of the chiefs of the various services, which is as it should be. We will not be interfering in that process.


I do want to come back to the last point you made—around DFRB and DFRDB. I am affronted by what you said. More importantly, I am affronted by the way the opposition has been peddling this. I am affronted by it because my door is always open for genuine discussion and dialogue. But I am sick and tired of the vitriol which is coming from some quarters of the ex-service community and which has been promulgated and stimulated in part by the shadow minister. Giving encouragement to people to vent their views in such an extreme way is, I think, an insult to me, particularly, as well as to the government and to all veterans.


When you sit down and discuss this thing reasonably with veterans, they understand that they are treated specially. They appreciate that the superannuation arrangements they entered into when the joined the Defence Force were as they were and that they have been substantial beneficiaries ever since. I think it is important that the   opposition actually go and explain to people precisely what DFRDB recipients who are currently serving will get once they retire and then ask them, 'Do you see that as being the same as a pension?'


I mentioned earlier what a colonel would get after 30 years. I mentioned what a major would get after 20 years of service. Let me just go to a non-commissioned officer, a warrant officer, who retired at the beginning of 2012 after 30 years of service with a final salary of $47,000 per annum. He would get a lump sum of around $240,000, exchangeable for an annual payment, indexed to CPI, of $38,000.


Those in the private superannuation market have, since the GFC, seen their returns plummet. The returns for those people whose superannuation is indexed to CPI have increased and those people were, for a period, well in front of the commercial market. The returns for those people on CPI have increased and for a period were well in front of the commercial market. Why is it that there was no explanation by the opposition that this is a superannuation scheme guaranteed by taxpayers? (Time expired)

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:15):  In keeping with comments on budgets, I bring the minister back to the Veterans' Affairs budget. Let me firstly say he certainly gets our strong support for the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. I think it is well received across the board. If you could take a quick note back to your department, Minister, eight weeks to get a logo out is probably a bit on the long side, but I am sure you will sort that out.


More importantly, the budget paper contains a $120,000-grant for the federal electorate of New England to support two commemorative projects. This grant is on top of the local grant program of $100,000 to every electorate. So this is a specific $120,000 grant over and above to New England. The first was $20,000 to the Gunnedah Shire band for the cost of their travel to France in April. The second is a $100,000-grant to the Inverell RSL for construction of a new museum. Whilst the projects seem worthwhile—and I lend no comment otherwise—Minister, can you explain why New England has received $120,000 over and above other electorates? For instance, was the $20,000 paid to the Gunnedah Shire band organised through a public tender? Could other bands in other electorates across the country have applied for the funding? Similarly, what will the Australian government's $100,000 commitment to the Inverell RSL project provide? Who else is funding the project? What is the total cost? When is it going to be completed?

The Inverell payment was an appropriate one and was in partnership with them.


I point out that we are going to do an avenue of honour in North Queensland, which will be opened in late June by the Prime Minister, which is another important commemorative event. I am very pleased we are doing it. I do not see any disconnect between what we do there and what we have done elsewhere. There are other places where we have provided grants over and above the Saluting Their Service grants or other grants that are available because there are processes to deal with them.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:17):  I draw your attention to another issue. Last night at Senate estimates the Department of Veterans' Affairs confirmed that the average claim processing time under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act was 35 days above that reported in the budget papers and in the department's own annual report. The department confirmed last night that in March 2013 the average processing time was 155 days. But in the budget paper the government says that the mean processing time was 120 days. Minister, were you aware of this misreporting?


The department confirmed that $1.7 million given to them in the budget to make improvements to the processing time for compensation claims will simply be used to bring processing times back to the reported mean time rather than seeking to reduce the reported average claims processing time. Whilst the new secretary noted that we are not meeting our targets, it is clearly the government which takes responsibility for all issues with the department and has to justify why they have allowed what would seem like inaccurate reporting of veteran compensation claim processing times.


Minister, I think you would agree that this may cast doubts made in other areas over claims made in other documents about other processing times. I can imagine this situation is somewhat embarrassing, especially since in your 2011 post-budget press release you announced the claims process was 'complex, wieldy and slow' and you announced $3.4 million to improve that process. I fail to see if anything meaningful has happened since that money was allocated.


The misreporting also comes at a time when the department claims under the MRC Act that claims will increase by eight per cent. Without proper training for advocates and pensioner welfare officers, the complexity of the system may lead to further delays. The department further confirmed last night that veteran advocates are not being given specific training about the changes to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act currently before the parliament. Minister, surely without proper training the problems with the claim processing may only increase.


The increase in claim processing times comes on the back of that 2011 decision of the government to cut advocacy funding by $1 million a year over the forward estimates. I think we all agree this decision has placed enormous strain on volunteer veteran advocates and pensioner welfare officers, who are struggling to cope with the increased demand for their service from veterans and their families. These advocates provide an essential service to veterans and their families, helping them to negotiate their way through what is a complex rehab system. Taking the support out from under their feet is disappointing. Minister, can you explain how this misreporting of average claim processing times in the portfolio budget statements came about and what was its genesis? Can you explain that differentiation and, if indeed there are mistakes, Minister, will you take responsibility?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:21):  I am not sure if there is a misunderstanding by the opposition, but there has been no attempt to manipulate the figures nor to misreport. I am not sure why you would get to that position. The 120 days quoted in the 2014 portfolio budget statement is a benchmark KPI for processing claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The portfolio budget statement lists key performance targets for programs. It was not a misreporting of statistics. It is appropriate that there should be KPIs and it is appropriate we should try to meet the KPIs. I can only think that the opposition are saying leave them out—if the average is 155 days or 158 days, or whatever it is, make the KPI that. That is not appropriate. It is really inappropriate to change a benchmark target that is not being met.


We fully acknowledge that the average processing time for MRCA initial liability claims for the 12 months ending March 2013 was 155 days. There has been no fudging of figures, none. I am not sure why you would think there has been. What is in it for us to fudge the figures? It is a transparent process. Why fudge it? The performance against the individual targets is reported each year in DVA's annual report. There is no attempt to hide the figures; just read them and make comparisons. Of course we can do better and that is what we want to do.


The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has been conducting an inquiry into the care of Australian Defence Force personnel wounded and injured in operations. The department recently reported to the committee that the times taken to process MRCA liability claims for 2011-12 was 158 days on average. MRCA claims received have increased by an average in excess of nine per cent per annum over the last five years. As you would expect from a prudent government, in response to this increase in claims the government have provided $1.7 million over four years to improve MRCA processing times. It is important that we do it. It is not in it for us to try to extend these times. We want to make sure that we meet these benchmarks where we possibly can. These KPIs are quite important to us. There should be targets which we try to achieve. That is why we are making this additional $1.7 million available.


DVA is further addressing the time taken to process claims under MRCA through a number of ways. Firstly, by applying streamlining processes, providing further training and guidance for staff, redistributing claims across locations, prioritising cases, redeveloping ICT tools and improving access to information from the Department of Defence.


There is absolutely nothing in it for us to try and obfuscate or disguise or otherwise hide what we are achieving in terms of these timelines. It would be incorrect to think that somehow or other we would deliberately go around a process to distort or misreport the figures when we are quite open to public scrutiny here—and we accept that scrutiny, and we accept the desire and need for us to do better. I want to thank the department for the diligent way they have gone about trying to achieve these targets. I know that they are applying their best endeavours to getting the best possible outcome for all of those people putting in claims. If we can improve the time to settle those claims, we will. It is our intention, and anyone who believes that we would do otherwise does not understand the way we do our work.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:26):  Earlier this year the Australian National Audit Office released an audit of the Veterans' Children Education Scheme, VCES, and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme, let us just call that MRCAETS. The audit was a sobering analysis of how the government has certainly failed to ensure policies affecting veterans' children have kept pace with changes in the broader income support arrangements facing all Australians. In a repeat of their 2009 decision to exclude veteran disability pensions from the Harmer review of pensions, despite a hand-on-heart promise of the Treasurer on Brisbane radio on 12 September 2008 to do so, the government decided that payments to veterans' kids under VCES or MRCAETS would not be similarly adjusted. Instead, the government advised veterans to ring Centrelink to find out whether they would be better off under the family tax benefit system rather than DVA's own compensation-based education support system.


The audit found that, during the life of the scheme, changes in the wider social policy environment have at various times challenged DVA's policy and coordination capacity. Audit's analysis also indicates that, at least as far back as 2004, some students may have been financially better off by claiming benefits other than those offered by the VCES. However, DVA did not formally notify affected clients of this option until January 2012. According to the audit, the government rejected a DVA request to address the anomalous situation, saving $2 million by forcing veterans' families to Centrelink rather than DVA.


This situation would be bad enough on its own if the audit did not then find that the legislative provisions governing the VCES and MRCAETS were being flouted because of a lack of funding. The legislation requires VCES volunteer board members to travel and meet face-to-face with students, teachers and parents as part of the nation's obligations to assist these families. Funding for VCES board members to travel to see these students in rural and regional areas was slashed from a budget of $40,000 to just $10,000. This is particularly concerning, given that one of every two students under VCES and MRCAETS lives outside metropolitan areas, particularly in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania. Because of the lack of funding for outreach required by the legislation, volunteer board members were instead forced to rely on written reports sent to them by schools, rather than meeting face-to-face with the veteran, the student and the school to discuss the student's progress. The audit report highlighted the important role that these outreach arrangements have in assisting children of veterans to achieve better education outcomes.


Minister, this happened on your government's watch. Whilst we note that the department has accepted two recommendations from the ANAO, it may be cold comfort to veterans' families who have recently relied on a system that has been found to be broken. Minister, can you explain why the government rejected DVA's 2011 request to align VCES payments with the new FTB arrangement announced in the 2010 election? Will you also confirm that this rejection, to save just $2 million over four years, comes when advertising expenses for, for example, Gonski reforms are $21 million and, for NBN, $5 million?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:29):  Let me firstly make the observation that DVA, as the member for Fadden should know, or at least the shadow minister for veterans' affairs should know, has arrangements in place to advise VCES students of their options where FTB exceeds VCES allowances. The background to this is important.


From 1 January 2012 the government increased the maximum rate of FTBA for 16- to 18-year-olds in full-time secondary study from $52.64 to $214.06. It is currently $220.64 per fortnight. That equated it to the 13- to 15-year-old rate, which was a 2010 election commitment recognising the cost of older teenagers. The increased rate is to be payable until the end of the calendar year in which the child either turns 18 or leaves full-time secondary study, whichever is earlier. The end of year FTBA supplement will also be payable to families with children aged 16 to 18 at $726.35 pro rata once a tax return is lodged.


This change meant that new applicants for youth allowance could no longer be paid for a secondary student aged 16 and over and are asked to apply for FTB. However, Centrelink when wrote to existing youth allowance recipients very few applied for FTB—fewer than 10,000 from 85,000 letters sent out. DVA's VCES and MRCAETS rate of $223 per fortnight for 16- and 17-year-olds living at home is set at the same rate as Centerlink's youth allowance. The rate of FTBA, including the annual FTBA supplement is now more than the annual amount of youth, VCES and MRCAETS allowances payable for a secondary student aged 16 to 17 except for those on living away from home and homeless rates. This means it is more beneficial for some families after means testing to receive FTB than education assistance under VCES or MRCAETS—that is, they will be better off receiving a comparable payment from Centrelink than from DVA.


Also available from Centrelink is family tax benefit part B, which is targeted at single income and low-second-income-earning families. This may be paid up to $100.66 per fortnight. The FTB part B supplement is up to $354.05 per family per year. Under the children's scheme, Abstudy postgraduate award scheme or the VCES there is a similar preclusion to that of FTB. This means that dependants over 16 who apply for FTBA will be able to retain their orphan pension if the criteria are met. Those who have lost their orphan pension owing to receiving another payment will likely seek to have it reinstated. There were approximately 200 recipients of orphan pension in 2012. It was expected that this number would increase by 72 with those applying for FTB. Statistics indicate that only nine orphans have switched to FTB.


There is currently no preclusion in the MRCA that presents a payment for education assistance being made at the same time as a payment for an eligible young person. The reasons VCES and MRCAETS cannot be aligned for FTB rates of education allowance under the VCES and MRCAETS are linked to rates of youth allowance. However, unlike youth allowance, education allowances under the VCES and MRCAETS are not means tested. Aligning FTB is a difficult and is a different program to redesign. We are talking about a very small number, relatively speaking, of people. As I said earlier, DVA has put in place arrangement to advise VCES students of their options where FTB exceeds VCES allowances. That is a simple fact and something that I know you would appreciate.


I will conclude by returning to an earlier contribution to make sure that there is no misunderstanding. I have no difficulty at all with people arguing that they want to change an indexation rate for their retirement benefit. I have a great deal of difficulty in equating it to an age pension. I will read what Nick Minchin said when he was the coalition minister for finance:


This claim (to change indexation) was properly rejected by the Howard Government, of which I was a member.


There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment employment-related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit, in this case the age pension.


I rest my case. It is something so logical even those opposite should see it.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (11:35):  I refer the minister to some correspondence he produced earlier this week between himself and Telstra in 2009. He wrote to Telstra on 27 March 2009 raising a concern from a Mr Yossi Berger about asbestos-containing material in Telstra pits. Telstra wrote back on 28 April, in a letter the minister has distributed in the press gallery, in which Richard Coleman said:


Such pits are only removed and replaced in situations where they have suffered significant damage and therefore present a hazard. When serviceable pits remain in situ, they are not considered to present a risk to health and safety of any person.


The minister wrote again, in August 2009, pressing Mr Berger's argument that all the pits should be replaced. Then he received a reply on 13 August 2009 from Michael Rocca, then the head of network services, who wrote:


It is Telstra's opinion the proposals of Mr Berger do not achieve a satisfactory balance between commercial practicability and the actual health risk posed by in-ground pits that contain bonded asbestos cement. The potential higher risk for disturbance of in situ asbestos plant is recognised within the Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos, 2nd edition 2005, which states:


The removal of asbestos-containing materials can potentially expose workers and others to higher levels of … fibres than leaving the materials in situ.


The minister wrote back again, to Mr Thodey this time, the chief executive, and made the point in his letter, dated 2 November, that, when such ACM materials are disturbed, organisations, employees and contractors can be exposed to fibres. And he suggested a formal program of total removal would be a great legacy. Mr Thodey wrote back and, in his letter of 14 December, said:


Given the low risk of in situ pits, the potential risks of removal and the prohibitive associated costs, we do not believe a proactive pit removal process is justified at the time.


What this demonstrates is that, in 2009, the minister was very aware—very aware indeed—that there was asbestos-containing material in Telstra's pits. He was aware that Telstra had a view, supported by the industry standards, that they are safe if they are intact and left in situ and undamaged, and that health risks arise when they are disturbed. Of course, at that time they were being disturbed rarely, only when maintenance was required or trucks ran into them and so forth. However, by 2011, the deal that was done between NBN Co. and Telstra, of course, involved the disturbance of almost all of these pits on a massive, nationwide scale. From 2011, there have been reports in the press of asbestos being found in the works being conducted either by NBN Co. or by Telstra as part of the NBN project. There was a 2011 report in the Age, on page 6 of the 5 May edition; on 13 December last year there were reports about contamination found in Western Australia; and there have been a number of reports earlier this year as well.


I am hoping the minister will take the opportunity to enlighten us here, but, notwithstanding the fact that all of these pits were going to be disturbed so that the whole context changed dramatically with the NBN deal, and notwithstanding that there were reports of asbestos contamination, he does not appear to have raised concerns about them, having been put on notice in 2009, either with the communications minister or with NBN and Telstra prior to last week, when the matter became a very hot issue, as we all know, in the Sydney media. I could refer the minister, of course, to the questions that my colleague the member for Bradfield and others have raised in the various committees and the Senate estimates, but I imagine he does not pay much attention to questions from the opposition.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:40):  I think it is a little hash of the member opposite to say that I do not pay attention to his questions; I do. In terms of asbestos and the issues which he has raised, let me say again—and I will keep saying it, because it is an important opportunity to remind members of the opposition who have shown a new-found interest in asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma—that asbestos is a giant scourge. Last night on Lateline the member for Wentworth accused the government of trying to create a panic. I tell you what: when we know that nearly 700 people a year are dying from asbestos related diseases and that another 30,000 to 40,000 people will die of asbestosis, to not take the issue, not talk about it and not deal with the concerns raised by the residents of Penrith is not appropriate.


Let us look at the history of asbestos, because it goes to the wafer-thin propositions being advanced by the member for Wentworth, which are that somehow this government has not been doing enough about asbestosis and the dangers of asbestos. Let us have a little bit of history. First of all, the Telstra pipes and the Telstra ducts, which contain asbestos, have been rolled out over many, many years. Telstra and the Postmaster-General knew this. In fact, I must put on record a positive comment that the member for Wentworth's father-in-law, an eminent barrister, represented very ably victims of asbestos exposure on the waterfront. So these issues and the dangers of asbestos were well known.


We also know that certain corporate organisations such as James Hardie and, indeed, CSR chose to cover up and deny the risks of asbestos for many years. It was not so long ago that former opposition leader Mark Latham had to shame those opposite into handing back Hardie's donations. He had to shame them into doing it. The dangers of asbestos have been well known and for a very long time in Telstra. Indeed, it was well known to the opposition when they were in government. The late member for Calare, Peter Andren, raised with the then government and the then minister for communications on notice issues identical to the questions which I raised in 2009. At that stage, I think it was the then minister for agriculture in the House of Representatives, on behalf of the minister for communications, who said that Telstra had asbestos in its system, in some of its pits and in some of its ducts. So the sort of startling smoking-gun revelation that somehow it has only been of late that some of the dangers of asbestos have been revealed is not fair and not accurate.



Mr Turnbull interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  You will get your chance, Mal. Sorry. I don't mean to upset that glass jaw of yours. We were aware in 2001 of the need for Telstra to create a separate fund, and indeed it was the Leader of the Opposition, then as a minister, who said, 'No, we won't.' Again, in 2007, it was the Leader of the Opposition, who was the minister for health at that stage, who would not support the PBS being varied to include drugs which would help alleviate the suffering of victims of asbestosis and mesothelioma. Indeed, when the late Bernie Banton, the great warrior on the issue of asbestos, came forward, he was personally vilified by the now Leader of the Opposition.


We dial forward to now. It is correct that, even as the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, I maintained a strong interest in health and safety—reflecting knowledge, though, which both sides of the House already had. I certainly did contact Telstra a number of times, because people in Tasmania were saying to me that they were concerned about this process. Telstra came back not once, not twice but three times and said that they had it under control. This, I have to say, contrasts with the lack of interest of those opposite, who, despite knowing the issues, have not bothered to put them forward. I have not heard in this debate any reference to those—

  As I was saying, asbestos is a deadly serious issue and requires a serious approach. Telstra had advised the government—and they had been in contact with Comcare—that they had procedures for the rollout in terms of their responsibilities on asbestos. The CEO confirmed this at the end of 2009.


What is also clear is that in the last few weeks there have been a number of incidents which show, in my opinion, a breach of the standards we would expect in terms of the remediation of asbestos lined pits, which have been involved in the roll-out of new telecommunications. It is clear to me, from speaking to residents and others, that Telstra needs to lift its standards. That is what we are doing with a new national register. That is what we are doing with a task force oversighting Telstra. And Telstra has given stronger commitments than ever before.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:58):  I am very pleased to be able to be here this morning to make some inquiries in relation, particularly, to the employment and workplace relations portfolio. There has obviously been a great deal of good work done throughout the course of this government's life, particularly in relation to the creation of jobs—over 900,000 jobs created as a result of the fiscal settings and the endeavours of this government since it came to office. Obviously, there has been a significant emphasis on providing support for low-income workers and also providing support by means of taxation arrangements, changes to superannuation arrangements and changes in the way of household assistance measures which have provided, appropriately, support to some of those who are the most vulnerable in our society, including low-income workers. As someone with around 27,000 workers with a taxable income of less than $37,000 per annum in my electorate as at 2008-09, I am very conscious of the arrangements entered into by this government and the good work done by the minister in relation to low-income superannuation contribution. Regrettably, it is the case that those very same 27,000 workers will be those who are exposed to the proposals of the opposition on the low-income superannuation contribution. They have made it clear that they basically support an increase in taxation for that category of people—those 27,000 people in my electorate who are low-income workers. I know that this minister has certainly done a great deal of work both on that superannuation measure and on the progressive increase in the Superannuation Guarantee—another thing that is being resisted by those opposite. It is only ever a Labor government which focuses on superannuation, and, once again, all of these measures stand to the significant benefit of low-income workers in our community.


I know that there has also been a great deal of work done to support job seekers and more broadly across government to support those sorts of people who are in vulnerable circumstances. I know there have been more than 2,800 job seekers in La Trobe who have benefited through household assistance measures provided by the government to enable them to have a bit of extra income. There is a whole range of things to assist low-income workers and I am conscious of the fact that so many of those workers are often women—women in part-time or casual employment. In fact, I think the figures reveal that around 70 per cent of those categorised as part-time or casual workers are women. All these measures appropriately, but disproportionately, assist women in those sorts of jobs.


There has been very good work done by the government and the minister in pulling back from the WorkChoices regime that was left to us by the Howard government, and that good work continues. I know that the minister is very conscious of things like ensuring the ongoing protection of penalty rates and ensuring that we have a fair system of workplace relations. All of these things go to supporting, as Labor traditionally does, the people who are most vulnerable in our society—people on low incomes or who may otherwise be exposed to undue pressure in the workplace. The minister will also be aware that I have certainly taken an interest in arrangements relating to payments for some of our most disadvantaged people, particularly Newstart payments. My question today refers to the Senate's inquiry into Newstart: could you update the chamber on recent budget measures which assist single parents and Newstart recipients?

It is correct to say that this Labor government has kept our economy strong during some of the most difficult financial circumstances seen in peace time since the Second World War. We have created 950,000 new jobs and, as much as the member for Bradfield shakes his head, these are facts which not even the coalition conservative propaganda writers can unwrite. Despite this, we know that some people are doing it tough. Labor knows fundamentally that the best way out of disadvantage for people is to have a job. The best way for families and kids to get the best start in life is to have employment in their households. It is important to go to the big picture first to set the scene for the specific points that the member for La Trobe is inquiring about. We have relatively low inflation in this country. The cash rate set by the Reserve Bank is as low as it has been in a very long time. We have unemployment which is still reasonably soft at 5.5 per cent. We have seen a 13 per cent increase in the size of our GDP since the global financial crisis, our ASX is coasting towards 5,000—a distinct increase in the last 12 months—and I am optimistic that superannuation returns will be double-digit. Business investment as a share of our GDP is 18½ per cent. So there are things going well in this country that we do not always hear about from the coalition.


Having said that, the member for La Trobe is correct—there are significant pockets of disadvantage in this country. That is why we unveiled a package in the budget to support people into work. I can report to the member for La Trobe that from 20 March 2014 this package will provide an increase in the income-free area beyond which people's allowances are affected. This is the first time that has been done in over a decade. It is a $258 million investment to increase the amount that people can earn before their income support payments are affected. We want to increase the income-free area from $62 to $100, which will increase take-home pay to $494 per week. Not only is it the first increase in more than a decade; it is the first time it has been indexed to CPI in Australia's history. That will take place from 1 July 2015. It is estimated that 150,000 Australians will benefit immediately. We will provide extra benefit for thousands to take up work.


It does not stop there. We have the pensioner education supplement. This is important because, just as a job is important to people's well-being, the best education, or re-education, and support for education is what helps Australian employees have the resilience to cope in a changing global economy. There will be nearly $40 million to increase education opportunities. This will benefit 25,000 additional single parents moving from the PPS to Newstart. It will benefit an additional 90,000 single parents already on Newstart. This pensioner education supplement of $62 a fortnight will ensure that people can train for a certificate II, III or IV in the TAFE system, or indeed for a bachelor degree.


We are also going to extend the concession card. This will see a $2.2 million increase to concession entitlements, and 2,000 people will benefit over the forward estimates. There will be a 12-week buffer when moving off income support payments because income is too high to attract some of the other allowances. This will allow people, as they make the transition, access to discounted GP costs, car registration and medicines.


All of this builds upon the $1.1 billion income support bonus for low-income earners, which this government has already passed. I am sure it disappoints the member for La Trobe, like it disappoints me and disappoints millions of Australians, but those opposite voted against giving $1.1 billion to the lowest paid Australians. When it comes to assisting multinational mining companies, the mob opposite know where to go—they do not need to be told; they just march like automatons to the beat of the multinational drum. But when it has come to supporting low-income people, those opposite have voted against it. What is worse is that they have also indicated they are going to knock off the schoolkids bonus—bang, $400-plus for children of primary school age, and bang, $800 for children at secondary school. Those opposite can always be relied upon to miss an opportunity to help the low-paid. When you look at the tax they are putting on the superannuation contributions of people earning under $37,000—a new 15 per cent great big tax—it is a shame.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (12:08):  When the minister was talking about the political party that could be relied upon to support multinational mining companies, I assumed he was about to refer to the Treasurer and the Prime Minster who, after all, when they were designing their new mining tax, sat down and allowed the three biggest mining companies to design it. That is one of the reasons it has not raised any money.


The minister chose not to answer the question that I asked in my first intervention, which was what did he say, what actions did he take, after 2009 with regard to asbestos-containing material in the Telstra infrastructure in light of his being aware of the problem, as indeed many people were—most people interested in telecommunications were; it was hardly a secret—through his own personal correspondence with Telstra? Then the context changed and the pits were going to be disturbed on a wholesale basis. I should just describe what this disturbance involves. The way the NBN Co.'s network is designed, their junction boxes—what they call multiports—are devices that are being lodged in pits, but the existing pits are too small, for the most part, and so they have to be replaced with a larger plastic pit. Obviously, where the pit is made of concrete or concrete thought to contain asbestos, there is plenty of potential for contamination because the pit basically has to be broken up and removed. So it goes from being an occasional pattern of disturbance to being a near-universal pattern of disturbance. The minister has chosen not to answer the question as to what he did after 2009 in terms of raising his concerns with the minister for communications, let alone with NBN and Telstra. If the minister is not prepared to answer that, we cannot force him to answer it.


I turn now to another question, because it is very important that this issue be dealt with with clarity. The minister is quite right in saying that asbestos is a very dangerous substance. It is a very big issue and there is a complete unity ticket on that point. But we have to be very clear about what we are talking about. Now, the minister in 2009 was proposing to Telstra that there should be a proactive removal of all of their asbestos-containing infrastructure, whether it needed to be repaired, maintained, augmented or not—proactive removal. Telstra came back citing the national standards and saying, no, that would be unsafe.


The minister should tell us—and I think he owes the Australian people an explanation: does he believe that asbestos-containing material, whether it is in telecom networks or elsewhere in the built environment, should be removed proactively, regardless of whether it needs to be mended or altered or drilled into or repaired? In other words, is the minister still of the view—



An honourable member:  It could be in my garage.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Yes, it could be the honourable member's garage—if the honourable member has a garage with asbestos-containing material in the walls or in the roof, and it is intact, it is not friable, it is not flaking or powdered. Is the minister saying that that type of asbestos-containing material should be proactively removed? It is important for him as the minister for workplace relations to let us know that. And, if he does take that view, what does he say to the point—and I am not expressing a personal opinion on this but I want him to address it—that was made in the Code of practice for the safe removal of asbestos, which is a publication by his own department, I believe, which states:


The removal of asbestos-containing materials can potentially expose workers and others to higher levels of airborne asbestos fibres than leaving the materials in situ.


Is he arguing for a wholesale, proactive removal of all asbestos-containing material, even when it is stable, intact and not friable? That is a very important issue that he should address, because this issue is too serious for generalities and political grandstanding. We need precision.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (12:13):  I appreciate the member for Wentworth's well-known irony when he says this issue should not be politicised, when in fact that is what the opposition has done. First of all, in terms of the question he alleges is not answered, outside of my ministerial responsibilities in 2009, because I have an interest in health and safety I did contact Telstra not once, not twice but three times. There is correspondence I have tabled where Telstra, in the very last line of the very last letter, say that they are preparing for the NBN rollout. So, despite this sort of sly inference that somehow what has changed is the NBN rollout, Telstra were fully alive to that in 2009, and they certainly indicated that they have solid policies on asbestos.


I am interested in the fact that the member opposite says that the risks of asbestos in Telstra infrastructure are well known. What did the opposition ever do?


We have the relentless NBN watchdog, the member for Wentworth, sitting opposite. What did he ever do to raise the issue of health and safety? He probably has raised it and he probably has raised asbestos issues with the company since 2009—I do not know.


I invite the member for Wentworth to work with the government on asbestos issues. It is fun to throw bricks, but on this particular issue it is not appropriate. I look forward with great interest to finding out how many speeches the member for Wentworth has given about the perils of asbestos. He may have better records than I do—I fully acknowledge that, so I make that caveat—but I have searched nine years of the member for Wentworth's contributions to see what he has said about asbestos. I searched high and searched low—actually, I got someone else to press a button and search Hansard—but not a word until last week. I do not mind the belated interest, because it still is an important issue.



Mr Turnbull interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I do not mean to puncture the member for glass jaw here, but we must look at what has actually happened. For the record, I again state that the opposition's interest in this matter of Telstra and asbestos is being fuelled by their desire to rubbish the NBN. I do not believe they come here with the bona fides they claim, although I will exempt a number of individual backbenchers and shadow ministers whom I have noticed, periodically over time, raising the issue of asbestos. So it is not a blanket condemnation. But I find it difficult to accept a lecture and some of the politicised rubbish I am hearing.


Going through what we have done: Comcare have audited Telstra in the past, they have reviewed pit safety—



Mr Turnbull interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  As much as the member for Wentworth may find my answer discomfiting, I will give it in the manner I choose. He can ask the questions he wants to ask, but I will put the truth as it should be put.


In 2011, Comcare conducted a review of pit safety. They found a breach by Telstra, which Telstra then rectified. If you want to look at our record in tackling asbestos, it is worth noting that, since I became the minister 17 months ago, it is this side of the House which has finalised the Asbestos management review report, which looked at asbestos everywhere—not just the issues the Liberal Party want to conduct their political games over. It is this government which has acted on the recommendations. I have never had to stand behind a queue of coalition frontbenchers trying to talk about occupational health and safety. It is this government which has passed the legislation for the Office of Asbestos Safety. It is this government which, having heard the latest spate of reports in the last six or seven weeks, has acted to have a meeting with Telstra, NBN, the contractors, the stakeholders—we invited unions to the meeting, something which would never happen under those opposite because of their prejudice and bias against trade unions—and the victims groups.


When it comes to prioritised removal, we are not saying that all asbestos everywhere must be removed tomorrow. It is impossible. There are not enough licensed removalists and there are not enough places to take it. I get that, because I have been following this issue for a long period of time. The dangerous argument—not advanced by the member for Wentworth but by the man who beat him by one vote in the leadership ballot, the Leader of the Opposition—is to just leave it in the ground. 'The safest thing is to leave it in the ground,' the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday. What dangerous words. He is not fit to hold the highest office in the nation if he does not understand that sooner or later we have to start removing this asbestos—otherwise more people will die and more people will get sick. It is not enough to say, 'Leave it in place; we can do no more.' We can and we should.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (12:19):  I note what the minister has just said. I understand he did not raise the matter with the minister for communications, Telstra or NBN after 2009. That is now clear. I want to clear up, for the benefit of honourable members, the reference the minister made—which was very misleading, perhaps innocently misleading—to the letter of David Thodey dated 14 December. That letter ends, in the penultimate paragraph: 'Given the low risk of in situ pits, the potential risks of removal and the prohibitive associated costs, we do not believe a proactive pit removal process is justified at this time. This is particularly so given the rollout of a new fibre network by the new National Broadband Network Company.' What the minister may not be aware of is that at the end of 2009 there was no agreement by NBN Co. to use Telstra's pits and pipes. In fact, what NBN Co. was going to do was to overbuild the entire Telstra network. Mr Thodey, no doubt, was contemplating a situation where entirely new infrastructure which did not disturb his pits and pipes was going to be built by NBN Co. And that was the original plan of the government. All of that changed, however, when the agreement was reached, by June 2011 as I recall, between NBN Co. and Telstra which involved the wholesale disturbance of the Telstra infrastructure.


The second matter that I asked the minister about—and perhaps he could just put this to rest—




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, the time allotted for this matter has expired. There are other ministers at the table who have important issues that I am sure the members of the coalition want to question them on. The member for Wentworth is two minutes in and has not yet asked a question. He ran an MPI on this matter yesterday. Can I respectfully suggest that if he has a question of the minister he might wish to put it on notice. I am sure the minister would be willing to answer on notice any question that he was going to put to him.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Lyons
): I was not aware of the recommendation on the speakers list that this debate should finish at 12.15. I ask the member for Wentworth to ask his question so that we can—




Mr TURNBULL:
  I will do so, Mr Deputy Speaker.




Mr Georganas:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: as a common courtesy I did not jump up at the end of the minister's answer because I saw that the finish time for this debate was 12.15. Had I known the debate was going to continue, I would have jumped up and had the call.




Mr TURNBULL:
  I have the call.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wentworth will ask his question immediately and then I will put the question.




Mr TURNBULL:
  I will ask the question. I asked the minister earlier whether he advocated the proactive removal of all asbestos. He responded by saying no, he did not advocate that. But then he went into an attack on the Leader of the Opposition, criticising him for saying that asbestos-containing material which—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Member for Wentworth, please ask the question. I intend to move on.



Mr Shorten interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  I understand that this discomfits the minister.



Mr Shorten interjecting—

  You have done nothing. Since 2009, you have done nothing.



Mr Shorten interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wentworth will resume his seat. Minister, do you have a point of order?




Mr Shorten:
  The member is carrying on. He has not got to the question. He has been out of time for a while. What is more, I have made the offer to meet with him. I am happy to meet with you, Malcolm. You might not have the cameras there and you might not have your backbench. Let us just talk about asbestos. You are better than this. Be the spy catcher, Malcolm Turnbull, not the goblin Greek. Let us meet. Let us talk. If you really care about asbestos, let us do it properly as the residents and victims deserve. You are better than this, Malcolm.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (12:24):  Whether this is as contested as what we just had, I do not know, but thank you for the opportunity to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 and to present the 2013-14 Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry appropriation. This budget is the next instalment of the Gillard government's plan for Australia's primary industries. The allocation for the portfolio in 2013-14 is $1.92 billion, an increase of $300 million over 2012-13.


The $440 million Farm Finance package will help farmers struggling with debt, through targeted financial assistance. Up to $30 million per annum for two years to each state and the Northern Territory for concessional loans to eligible farmers is available in this budget. Farm Finance includes $6.3 million over two years for around 17 new rural financial counsellors across Australia. Farm Finance enhances eligibility for the Farm Management Deposits Scheme, increasing the non-primary-production income threshold for farm management deposits from $65,000 to $100,000.


On drought reform: we know that drought in this country is inevitable, just as we know that the old exceptional circumstances policy did not work. It was reactive and inequitable and did not prepare our farmers for the future. Minister Ludwig and his state and territory colleagues recently signed an Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform. The centrepiece is the Commonwealth's $99.4 million investment in a new farm household allowance. Farmers can receive support when they need it. They will not have to hope that their property is on the right side of a line on a map. Case managers will provide the support farmers need to help them to better manage risk, improve their preparedness for hardship and make tough decisions about their long-term sustainability.


The National Food Plan is listed in the budget as 'decisions taken but not yet announced', but the government released Australia's first National Food Plan on 25 May, so, as we talk now, it has been announced. The plan includes $42 million worth of new initiatives, including $28.5 million for an Asian Food Markets Research Fund, $5.6 million to build Australia's food trade ties in key and emerging markets, $2.2 million to assess the long-term prospects for food supply and demand in Asian countries and $2 million to create a brand identity for Australian food. It provides a framework for Australia's food system based on the national objectives of the Australia in the Asian century white paper.


On natural resource management: the budget confirms a $200 million investment in the successful Reef Rescue program until 2018, including $70 million from the sustainable agriculture stream of Caring for our Country.


In forestry, delivering on our Tasmanian forestry agreement commitments, $500,000 is allocated to develop a national certification standard through a grant to the Forest Stewardship Council. This is an important part of the Gillard government's $330 million investment to support the historic agreement to provide certainty for industry, jobs and the environment.


Commitments made in previous budgets are confirmed in this budget. Those commitments include a continued commitment to the post-entry quarantine facility in Victoria, a continued investment in primary industries research and development and continued investment in Australia's farmers for a changing climate. I commend the portfolio appropriation to the chamber.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Government Whip) (12:29):  Minister, the 2013-14 budget strengthens the foundation of Australian agriculture. It prepares our farmers for future challenges and lays groundwork for opportunities for rural Australia, particularly now, in the Asian century. The budget, as you have outlined, will make farmers stronger and better prepared for the future and will enable them to access more opportunities, both here and overseas.


I note that the budget makes provision for the historic Farm Finance package, which will help alleviate pressures of debt and provide targeted financial assistance for farmers, particularly when they need it.


At the moment, when you look through my area, you see we have a pretty strong green drought. The grass is green but there is not much cover, which is making it difficult for farmers. Minister Ludwig was exactly right when he said that viable farmers cannot grow if they are held back by unmanageable debt. Farm finance responds to that. I hope that the Victorian government gets off its backside and works with the Gillard government to deliver this opportunity, which I note even the VFF—the training ground for national MPs, their apprenticeship factory—has urged them to do.




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr MITCHELL:
  He will be the fourth president in a row who has gone into that and the VFF says they are not political. The budget also funds the next stage of the government's plan for Australian agriculture, preparing for the future. The Gillard government's National Drought Program Reform gives farmers the tools they need to prepare for drought. We know over the years just how bad drought has been across this country and the issues it has caused in rural Australia. I am pleased to see that the budget has made provision for the $99.4 million farm household assistance to support farmers through hardship. This is very important for our farmers. We look forward to the states finalising their contribution to the National Drought Program Reform, including the farm business training and the social support.


The budget also confirms $429 million for the Carbon Farming Futures Program. That is taking the best abatement and greenhouse gas reduction research and converting it to use on farms. The Gillard government has continued our commitment to research development and extension funding. The budget also includes $238.2 million for the Research and Development Corporation, Minister Ludwig has told us. Investing in RD&E and ensuring that an environment which encourages innovation is vital to Australian farmers. They can capitalise on the Asian century.


I note that the budget continues this government's commitment to biosecurity reform. We know that a modern, world-class biosecurity system is a gateway to global marketplaces. Because of our strong biosecurity system, our farmers get the opportunity to invest and trade in the world's best markets, while also managing the risks which come with increased passenger and cargo movements into the country. The 2013-14 budget demonstrates the Gillard government's plan for Australian agriculture so that our farmers can keep feeding Australians and the world.


The budget keeps our economy strong, makes the smart investments for our future and ensures that every Australian gets a fair go. We are investing for the future, putting jobs and economic growth first and protecting the important services that Australians rely on. My question to you, Minister, is: can you advise the chamber on the status and design and construction of the state-of-the-art, post-entry quarantine facility announced in last year's budget in the seat of McEwen?

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2013-06-05,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (12:33):  I have a couple of questions relating to departmental issues, which I will put on the record now. Then I will speak to the next series of questions. As far as the departmental issues are concerned, question on notice No. 139 in October 2012 and No. 124 in February 2013, were the coalition asked what nil meant to the annual rental of leased properties. The response was that annual rent is nil as the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is charged a licence fee, not rent, for some properties. That is a ludicrous answer and very technically a semantic play on words because the real question is: what is it actually costing the department, whether it be rent, a licence fee, whatever it might be to site itself in properties around Australia? That is really the question I am asking of the minister or his representative. What is it actually costing and can you now provide details of rent payments, licence fees and any other moneys paid for the lease of properties by DAFF?


My other questions are: what role has DAFF had in investigating the level of animal welfare issues that are associated with the Queensland cattle crisis? And what contact has DAFF or the minister had with the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to look at cattle being allowed into national parks?


The Minister for the Environment, Water, Population and Communities, representing Senator Ludwig, made mention of the fact that recently, at a meeting with his state counterparts, an MOU was discussed regarding drought issues. And, yes, quite rightly, as the minister said, the old program of drought relief was changed in the way that he described. But the only other hard fact in that whole MOU—there was a heap of ideas and touchy-feely stuff and various things but only one hard fact—was that the government would not be the lender of last resort. That is fine, except at the same meeting it was discussed how the states and the Commonwealth would combine to make a reality the loans that the Commonwealth wants to make to agriculture around Australia.


My questions regarding those loans—they are totally at odds with that MOU statement, however we will take that one on notice ourselves—are: what are the trigger events that will make those loans a reality in the six states and one territory involved? With $60 million, or $30 million a year for two years, why would the Northern Territory, with something under 500 farmers in the whole Territory, have available to it the same amount of loans as New South Wales, shall we say, with somewhere between 35,000 and 40,000 farmers? Why should Tasmania, which is quite obviously the smallest state in Australia, have the same amount available to it as WA, which is quite obviously the biggest state in Australia? That is one question I would like answered: what was the idea behind that particular part of the policy or the loan?


I believe the interest rate has been set but not agreed to yet, at 4½ per cent. Knowing that the Commonwealth will probably borrow, at three per cent or a little more, the money that is going to them on loan, is there a policy about the Commonwealth covering every single cost—in other words, charging 1½ per cent or thereabouts more than the money will cost it? Is there going to be a reckoning on how that will be accounted, and have we got an agreement with any of the states as yet?

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-05,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (12:38):  From the outset, can I acknowledge to the minister, my electorate's appreciation of the announcement in the budget that there will be more rural financial counsellors. That is very important. I know that the member for Calare, the shadow minister, knows how important rural financial counsellors are in these difficult days. And I know you, too, Minister, would appreciate just what a valuable role they play in the bush to help not just farmers but other people who are struggling with rural debt. To help them get through that crisis in their lives is very important.


I would like to ask a couple of questions which might not be generally related to the appropriations, but will certainly affect the budget over the coming 12 months. Firstly, Minister, are you aware that skyrocketing electricity prices are forcing irrigators in the Riverina to turn back the clock and reinstall decades-old diesel pumps on their properties? On-farm power prices have jumped 17 per cent in the past year, in line with residential prices, and close to 80 per cent in the past five years. The Murrumbidgee High Security Irrigators Chief Executive Officer Brian Halse—I think you know him—was quoted in The Area News recently, saying:


Electricity is a huge issue for anyone pumping water and some locals are spending $60,000 or $80,000 a year just on power.


That really goes against the whole thought of carbon pricing that the minister's side of politics would certain push. It just does not make sense that they are using decades-old diesel pumps to get the water to where it is needed.


My other question, which, again, will have an impact on your budget bottom line, is your position on the foreign takeover of GrainCorp. There is, as you know, a significant bid by Archer Daniels Midland to take over the GrainCorp operations, which are so valuable to the wheat and grain growers in the eastern states. It is a significant issue. Certainly in my electorate I have many, many people who are desperately worried that we are going to lose port access and desperately worried that just the cost of getting grain to markets is going to be that much higher, especially with the running down over progressive years of railway lines by successive state governments of every persuasion, though certainly more Labor than coalition.


I would be very interested to know what your thoughts are as to whether the Treasurer should stop this takeover—whether he should say 'No'—because this is such a valuable asset, not just to the grain growers who are shareholders but, indeed, to Australians generally. We used to ride on the sheep's back, but at the same time we used to ride on our wheat and grain profits. But that is not the case any more. If ADM in fact takes over GrainCorp, that will have a significant deleterious effect on our valuable grain crops and on the profits of those annual harvests. I implore you, minister, to do whatever you can to stop this takeover. The Treasurer did nothing when the Spanish food giant Ebro threatened to take over SunRice. SunRice stayed in Australian hands after a very close vote. As you would be well aware, the profits from the rice harvests of the past two years have been such that the Coleambally mill has reopened, which meant many, many jobs to Riverina industry and that wonderful Riverina community.


I know that you are concerned about these issues. You have visited my electorate on a number of occasions and I appreciate that. I know you have spoken to locals in difficult times, but you have been prepared to be open. Whilst I certainly do not think the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has helped with many of my locals' certainty or lack thereof, I know they did appreciate the fact that you had the gumption to front them and explain your government's position. But I do ask you to respond to those two important issues: first of all, the use of diesel for irrigators to use their pumps and, secondly, ADM's potential takeover of GrainCorp.

 (Lyons) (12:43):  I also thank the minister and government for the new financial counsellors. We have several in Tasmania and they will be, and already are, very much appreciated. Also appreciated is the money for Rural Alive and Well, an organisation that is looking after forest contractors through some of the changes taking place throughout that industry. The farm household allowance will be provided, I understand, from 1 July 2014 to farmers in hardship to replace the exceptional circumstances relief payment and transitional farm family payment. Farmers in Tasmania are on the front line against climate volatility. The national drought reform package is focused on preparing farmers before drought with tools and skills that they need to emerge from it, sustain their enterprises through dry times and help them to survive.


You know, Minister, because you have been there and you have visited my electorate, about some of irrigation schemes that we are putting in place. That will build some drought-proofing for us as well, but we need to develop the new direction for farming in Australia to look toward the dry times so that we can assist the enterprises that are there for the long haul to sustain themselves during those dry times.


We are investing in the future, putting jobs and economic growth first and protecting the important services that Australia relies on. Minister, could you advise if the states and territories have agreed to the drought policy? Why is this a fairer policy than the old one for the new direction in which we are going?

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (12:45):  I will give advance notice that when my time runs out I will be seeking the call again. I have a few issues to go through. But I think it has been helpful to allow the run of questions because some people wanted to touch on the same areas, so it has allowed me to incorporate those into my answer.


I will flag in particular for the benefit of the member for Riverina the two issues he raised. One arguably goes to either the minister for energy or the minister for climate change and is difficult to deal with in the context of the appropriations here. The second one, which was a reference to the Foreign Investment Review Board, is managed exclusively by the Treasury. I do not begrudge at all the opportunity that he has taken to put his views on the record but there is little in the context of this particular debate other than to say that the government supports investment in agriculture.


First I will deal with the concessional loans for farm businesses in the farm finance package, which have come up a couple times. Concessional loans will give farmers breathing space to focus on growing and improving their farm business. The government is working with the state and Northern Territory governments to make products available across the country via appropriate delivery agencies. We want to take a flexible approach when working with the states and territories to ensure the loans are directed appropriately and are best suited to the farmers in their jurisdiction. As of 29 May this year, since farm finance was announced on 27 April, the department has chaired four teleconferences with senior officials from each jurisdiction. The first was convened on 30 April, at the Commonwealth's request, to discuss the government's announcement.


In addition to these teleconferences there have been many direct discussions with officials, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. However, at this stage we have not resolved signing on to these loans with any of the states. We encourage them to do so. It has been one of the issues that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been raising in the context of challenges that Queensland graziers and pastoralists are facing at the moment.


Even if you were to accept, which the government does not, the arguments about national parks that are put forward by the Queensland government, opening up national parks deals with a small subset of stock levels in drought affected areas. There needs to be an approach which reaches to all of the people who have stock and who are in a situation of crisis. The loans are one of the tools to be able to do that.


On the issue of national parks, I am obviously aware—speaking on behalf of the minister for agriculture—that there have been calls for national parks in Queensland to be used for grazing for drought affected cattle. While the management of national parks in Queensland lies within their responsibility, many parks may have been established to protect matters of national environmental significance. Under Commonwealth environmental law, actions that have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance require approval.


The words here from the minister say 'from my colleague, Minister Burke' but that was obviously not prepared for me. It will sound weird if I start talking about discussions with myself. The minister I am representing has been talking to me about the question of grazing in national parks. But the administration of environmental law is exclusively one for the environment minister and one where the decisions for the environment minister have to be made strictly according to law, not according to the policy of the government. With that in mind, as I made clear here yesterday, the legal powers that were available under national environmental law to prevent cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park were largely there because there was a heritage decision in place. There is no such heritage decision in the Queensland areas. So the government policy thinks that the approach taken by the Queensland government is ill-advised and also inadequate in terms of the genuine crisis that many farmers are facing, and this carries through to some of the criticisms of farmers who have managed their stock levels very carefully and feel they have now been placed at a disadvantage while neighbours get free adjustment. Others have said, 'Well, it is one thing is there is feed, but if there is no water in these areas they are of limited utility.' We do not feel it is a comprehensive solution in a way, shape or form. It is not the way we approach national parks. Notwithstanding that, any actual intervention would depend on national environmental law, and the powers here are quite different to the powers as they stood in Victoria. (Extension of time granted)


A number of biosecurity issues were raised, in particular the issue of post-entry quarantine. In July 2012 the Commonwealth announced the site acquisition of a 144-hectare parcel of land in Mickleham, Victoria for the construction of a new post-entry quarantine facility. The new facility will consolidate existing animal and plant quarantine services in a single integrated site and will provide Australia with the newest and most advanced technology and operating practices available. The department continued to consult stakeholders during the development of concept designs for the new facility. The project was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in early 2013. The referral was a critical step in the delivery of the project. The Public Works Committee must approve the proposed works before construction of the facility can proceed. In terms of what progress has been made, in the budget the government announced funding of $379.9 million over seven years for construction and operation of the new facility for high-risk plant and animal inputs. This built on the government's announcement made in the 2011-12 budget when a commitment to fund further development of future post-entry arrangements was made which included detailed design work and procurement activities related to land acquisition along with funds for the maintenance and refurbishment of existing facilities.


Government operated facilities to manage high-risk imported animal and plant species are key component of our biosecurity system. A secure and efficient facility discourages smuggling and reduces biosecurity risk associated with the importation of new genetic material which is necessary for Australian agriculture to maintain competitiveness and productivity. I might add that the issue of whether or not our post-entry quarantine facilities are adequate and up to date has been a very pertinent one in Australia, particularly following the Callinan report into the outbreak of equine influenza. On that occasion where systems had collapsed and the operation of a quarantine facility was not up to scratch we ended up consequently with a number of deeply serious challenges that carried a very high cost. So to be establishing a new post-entry quarantine facility and making sure that the operation of it has a high level of stakeholder engagement is not just a good thing to do, it is actually quite essential to make sure that we are properly able to manage the biosecurity challenges in a country where one of our key strategic advantages is that, compared to other countries, there are many weeds, pests and diseases that we do not have, and we want to keep it that way. When something comes in that has not previously been here, we saw with equine influenza just how bad it can be.


I have covered the national parks issue for the member for Calare. We also had the issue that was raised elsewhere of the national drought reform program itself and the agreement for the states and territories to drought reform. This is something which has been going since 2007 when, in addition to the ministerial council, we started the ministerial forum with state and territory ministers, originally chaired by myself and now chaired by Minister Ludwig. We work together to try to see how we could eliminate the challenges that occurred with waiting for exceptional circumstances declarations and the injustice of lines on maps where you have two farmers side by side facing identical climate circumstances and identical challenges—one received a high level of assistance, the other received nothing.


The Gillard government is delivering on its commitment to reform drought programs. We are moving to a pro-active rather than a reactive system. We want to ensure farmers are able to prepare for challenges and manage risks. No longer will we have to wait until farmers are in crisis before assistance can be offered. This is about helping Australian farmers get back on their feet and prosper and succeed in the future, ultimately delivering a more productive agricultural sector. On 3 May this year the minister signed an agreement with the states and the Northern Territory to formalise National Drought Program Reform. This package focusing on risk management and preparedness includes the Farm Household Allowance, which provides case managers to support farm families as they make decisions about their future. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme and taxation measures including the enhancements to the deposit scheme—announced as part of Farm Finance—a national approach to farm business training, a coordinated and collaborative approach to the provision of social support services, tools and technologies to inform farmer decision making. The agreement outlines the roles and responsibilities for each government in implementing the package from 1 July 2014. The agreement also includes a framework that will guide government decisions to increase or introduce support when conditions are declining while still meeting the reform objectives.


A number of members raised the Rural Financial Counselling Service and I thank them for doing so. The Rural Financial Counselling Service program continues to provide free and confidential financial counselling services to farmers, fishers and small businesses who are in financial difficulty and need support to manage the challenges of change and adjustment. Rural financial counsellors are well placed to refer clients to GPs and other government and non-government service providers. The Australian government has announced additional funding for the service for two financial years to 30 June 2015. An amount of $5.9 million will provide 17 additional full-time equivalent rural financial counsellors. Until implementation of the new Farm Household Allowance on 1 July 2014, the government is continuing to provide the Transitional Farm Family Payment. Farming families can apply for up to 12 months' household support paid at the same rate as Newstart and the Transitional Farm Family Payment is available to eligible farmers regardless of location or the reason they are experiencing financial hardship.


For those issues, we have the breakdown of most of what has been covered. I might sit down so that the shadow minister has an opportunity to put a couple of extra things on the record.

What input has the department had on the value and importance of the stone fruit industry on the Murray and in the Goulburn Valley and the impact on the community of the loss of SPC Ardmona? Is the department supporting industry by providing information and support to other departments investigating the WTO anti-dumping and safeguard provisions?

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (12:59):  I will take those issues on in good faith. The shadow minister raised very serious issues relating to SPC. There is good reason the agriculture minister acted quickly in referring them to the trade minister and making him aware of those. The level of concern is there.


Some extra information has arrived. The company wrote to the Prime Minister on 29 April requesting that the government impose safeguard measures in the form of increased tariffs on retail sized canned tomato and multiserve fruit products. The department has reviewed the request to determine whether there is a possible case to impose provisional and/or full safeguard measures. It was on the basis of that review that the agricultural minister referred the issue to the minister for trade and to the Treasurer. I understand that the minister for trade and the Treasurer will consider the agriculture minister's recommendation in consultation with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation. The government will work to make its decision on this matter as quickly as possible. If it is determined that a possible case for safeguard measures exists the government would refer the request to a competent authority, currently the Productivity Commission, to conduct an investigation in accordance with WTO rules. The competent authority would recommend whether measures should be imposed.


I am mindful of the time. What I would like to do on the remaining issues is suggest that the minister's office will be in direct contact with the shadow minister's office to work out the appropriate form of providing answers to those questions, whether it be in writing, through me or through the Notice Paper. I will ask the minister's office to make contact with the shadow minister as soon as possible.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (10:00):  My question relates to the capability of the joint strike fighter. The American Director of Operational Test and Evaluation's report of December 2012 shows that the JSF is more vulnerable to damage than current fighters, thus not meeting its operational requirements document; it shows that the aircraft has significant weight issues and is within 273 pounds of having reached a weight that will impact on performance; and it shows that the aircraft is unable to achieve its acceleration and turn performance thresholds, as predicted by critics but rejected previously by Defence and Lockheed Martin. Given these clear shortcomings of the aircraft, and the facts that the cost has blown out and that the aircraft will achieve its initial operational capability only in 2020 at the earliest and will be overmatched by stealth fighters coming out of Russia and China, why won't the government put the project on hold, put a request for proposal out to tender and hold a competition to find the best contender?

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:01):  With respect to the ASPI's detail book and in terms of the Defence budget and the white paper: as you are aware, ASPI has concluded that the federal government has a $33 billion shortfall in its funding for the 2013 white paper. It says:


… in absolute terms funding remains well below what was promised back in 2009. Yet plans for the ADF remain as ambitious as ever.


ASPI also reports that:


Consistent with this, the share of GDP will remain below 1.7% for the next decade.


How exactly does your government expect to afford the equipment procurement set out in the white paper when the budget is continuing to be cut? Also, ASPI has belled the cat: will you now confirm that your goal of returning defence spending to two per cent of GDP is rhetorical, since it is clear from ASPI's analysis that, at best, you will only seek to reach 1.7 per cent of GDP over the next 10 years?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:02):  I am aware of the ASPI report and, whilst I appreciate the diligence with which the ASPI team have gone about their work, I am afraid we do not agree with their outcomes—isn't that a surprise to you! I do want to make the observation that the opposition effectively shares the same policy towards Defence budgets—and for that I thank them. I know that we share a commitment to ensuring that we develop the defence capability, as we have decided to do.


Let me just make some observations about the calculation of the $33 billion shortfall, which assumes a three per cent growth in the Defence budget from 2008-09 to 2017-18 and a 2.2 per cent real growth beyond. Unfortunately this fails to take into account that, when the new funding model for Defence was announced in the 2009-10 white paper, there were deferrals and reprogramming of funding in the early years that were publicly announced in the 2009-10 budget. Additionally, the three per cent growth predicted was never three per cent constant annual growth, but rather an average growth rate over a longer period of time. In the 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13 budgets, there were expenditure reductions applied to the Defence budget totalling $8.9 billion over the period 2010-11 to 2020-21 as detailed in Defence's portfolio budget statements.


Could I also refer further to whether or not the Defence budget has been cut over the decade. The white paper announced that government had decided the Defence funding model would be based on the four-year forward estimates budget cycle, determined on an annual basis and taking into account contemporary strategic, economic and fiscal circumstances. That, I think, is surely understood by everyone. This aligns Defence funding with the Commonwealth's broader budget process. It provides certainty for planning in the short term but recognises the difficulty in forecasting fiscal circumstances in the longer term—which, as we know, is an art which is not perfect.


The Defence budget for 2013-14 is $25.3 billion. This, as we also know, is $1.1 billion higher than the 2012-13 budget of $24.2 billion. This will grow to $30.7 billion by 2016-17. The government will provide Defence with $113 billion across the budget and forward estimates. This compares to $103 billion in the 2012-13 budget and forward estimates, or a $10 billion increase over the four-year period. In dollar terms, this is more than has ever been spent before on defence, and that, I am sure, is well appreciated.




Mr Robert:
  But every budget spends more on everything.




Mr SNOWDON:
  No, it does not.




Mr Robert:
  It does so.




Mr SNOWDON:
  No.

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! There is a lot of discussion between the two benches opposite each other. Everything is through the chair.

  We could just have a—I am sorry.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Well, you could, but I will not allow it, so you will direct all your questions and answers through the chair.




Mr SNOWDON:
  You're a hard bugger! But let me just say I appreciate the way in which the opposition shadow minister is carrying himself, and I do not particularly mind his interjections.




Mr Robert interjecting
—





Mr SNOWDON:
  But through the chair—absolutely. The government, as we said, have spent more than ever before. The government also provide Defence with six years of general guidance beyond the forward estimates for planning purposes. This obviously concedes that attempting to provide tens of—I do not know what we are doing, but people are escaping—years of funding with precision is extremely difficult given the volatility in the world economy and government revenue forecasts. This budget, the government will provide Defence guidance of over $220 billion. Together, these amount to approximately $333 billion. So we are obviously committed, as you well know, to increasing the Defence budget funding towards a target of two per cent of GDP as and when fiscal circumstances allow, and I think that is broadly consistent with the view of the opposition. It is a long-term objective that will be implemented in an economically responsible way as and when fiscal circumstances allow.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:07):  The minister has taken spinning to a twirling dervish level, can I just say. Minister, despite the eloquent words, there is no escaping $25 billion in cumulative cuts to the Defence budget over the last five years, and there is no escaping cuts as a proportion of GDP, where defence expenditure is at the lowest level since 1938. No level of fiscal means and new budget process can escape that.


I draw your attention, sir, to the white paper and the resultant budget documents that look at the purchase of the 12 EA18G Growlers. The cost of acquiring the Growler, as per the white paper and the budget documents, is $2.974 billion, yet the budget paper makes it very clear that the only allocation of funds for that is $200 million in 2014-15. The budget also makes it expressly clear that the remainder—$2.774 billion—is to be met from within Defence's existing resources, with outlays out to 2012-22. It is page 288, for your staff rapidly searching their documents behind you. Existing resources—that is an absorption, Minister, of $2.774 billion. In your world, absorption is just one of those economic terms. Where I come from, absorption is a cut, because if you have to absorb $2.77 billion then you have to cut something else, because that is the way you absorb something. So, Minister, where will those cuts come from to allow the absorption of $2.774 billion for Growler?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:09):  I am surprised at the cynicism and even the sarcasm at times—to think that we would not do the right thing! As announced as part of the 2013 white paper, the government, as you well know, has decided to acquire the 12 new-build EA18G Growler electronic attack aircraft instead of—and I think this is far preferable in any event—converting Australia's 12 existing FA18F Super Hornet aircraft into the Growler configuration. These 12 Growler aircraft will enhance significantly, as I am sure you will agree, the ADF's electronic warfare capability and, together with the JSF and the Super Hornet will form a formidable air combat force capable of controlling both air and electronic environments. I think it is really important that we appreciate what we are getting here in terms of capability.


These additional 12 aircraft will cost approximately $2.9 billion. Offsetting this cost is the $1.5 billion already committed in the Defence Capability Program to convert 12 of Australia's existing FA18F Super Hornet aircraft into the Growler configuration. That which will no longer go ahead, so there is a saving which will be redirected towards the acquisition of the Growler. The government will also provide Defence with an additional $200 million towards this purchase in 2014-15. The remaining funding will be found through adjustments to the priority activities across Defence, which you have alluded to, including proposed capability acquisitions.


You would appreciate the way we estimate the costs of these things and then ultimately fund them. The details will be provided in the next Defence Capability Plan, which will be published before the end of the 2012-13 financial year. I can assure the shadow minister that we really understand the financial costs of doing this business and managing the costs within the budgeted framework that we have set for Defence.

Frankly, that is hilarious considering the $25 billion worth of cuts. But let us just park that to one side.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:14):  Since I was elected in 2010 I have spent quite a bit of time on the Defence Subcommittee with my colleagues here. We have been researching and inquiring into the mental health of those in the ADF, particularly those soldiers who are returning from deployments overseas. We have had extensive consultations throughout the country, with agencies including the Defence Community Organisation, Defence Families of Australia, RSL and Soldier On—a range of organisations who have highlighted a number of gaps in the system, particularly between DVA and Defence in terms of those agencies talking to each other, in terms of getting a seamless approach to the management of mental health and of those who return injured from deployment overseas.


I have three questions for the minister. The first is, what does the latest research into mental health issues associated with military service show us? Secondly, what is the government doing for the mental health of our current and former service people? Finally, what is the government's estimates of the future numbers of service personnel who have been engaged in operational activities over an extended period who may have mental health problems arising from these activities?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:16):  I thank my friend the member for Canberra for her questions. As she would know, and I am sure the opposition would agree, during my time as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Veterans' Affairs our absolute concern has been that in the past we have not really appreciated the extent of mental issues both in the defence community, current serving men and women, and also in the veteran community. That is why we had the Dunt review and all that flowed from it, why we have massive new expenditure into mental health in the Defence Force and why we did a suicide study in the veteran community. I think it is agreed across the board that there is no doubt that we are committed and Defence is committed to promoting good health but also, most particularly, good mental health.


Since 1999—these figures are quite illuminating—more than 65,000 ADF personnel have been deployed overseas and nearly 38,000 of those have deployed more than once. In the Navy, 10 per cent have deployed four times or more, and marine technicians feature very prominently. In the Army, seven per cent have deployed four times or more, with the Special Air Services and commandos featuring prominently. Some of those have done a large number of rotations. In the Air Force, eight per cent have deployed four times or more, with airborne electronics analysts and air combat officers featuring prominently. I have met a lot of these characters—they are wonderful people who have committed themselves significantly to years overseas, once you combine their service.


Recent research undertaken by the Centre for Traumatic Stress Studies at the University of Adelaide indicates that we can expect to see a minimum rate of personnel with diagnosable mental disorder of 22 per cent in a 12-month period. That 22 per cent is comparable with the general Australian community. Estimates of the prevalence of mental disorder, including PTSD, anxiety and depression, as well as alcohol issues, does not equate to the number of personnel who will actually seek help. The research also shows that only half of those with a mental health disorder will seek treatment in the next two years. That is an issue for us. Although the rate of those seeking help may increase, it is likely that this will occur at a gradual pace. We believe that there will be a rising tide of people seeking assistance and requiring help rather than the tsunami that people have been referring to. This research is supported by Dr Graeme Killer, the DVA Principal Medical Adviser.


We are confident that our efforts to educate and encourage our people to seek help as early as possible may also have an effect in increasing the number of those seeking treatment who require it. The whole question of resilience, of people understanding that it is okay to actually report a mental health illness or issue, is something which we have had to really drive hard. I want to pay tribute to the former Chief of the Defence Force, the current leader of the Defence Force, the previous service chiefs and the current service chiefs for their leadership in this regard. They have made very clear their expectations and the obligations of those in command positions to ensure that those beneath them are fully appraised of what they should do and have an awareness of the issues involved.


We are interested in supporting all of our personnel, no matter the source or cause of their mental health problems. Defence has improved its resilience training, screening, post-deployment reintegration activities, and  treatment and rehabilitation programs to ensure our servicing men and women are supported throughout their careers. I will sit down in a moment, but I do want to say some more about this because the elements of this year's budget which deal directly with our response to mental health are quite important. It goes not only to serving personnel but also their families.

These include the Defence abuse reparation payments, Operation Resolute costs—that is the cost of the Navy taxi service for asylum seekers—and security for the G20 leader summit. The list goes on.


Without making any comment on what the money is used for—and that is not my intent—I am simply putting out that $150 million worth of costs have to be absorbed again. Minister, can you please outline where these costs will be absorbed—that is, what part of Defence will have to be cut in terms of the budget? Are we are talking about personnel travel? Are we mothballing equipment? Are we pushing some elements of the DCP out? What exactly is being moved, absorbed or cut to make way for this $150 million in a range of areas I have outlined?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:23):  I thank the honourable member opposite for his question. Of course, he would realise that we have the capability to get enhanced efficiencies out of this very large organisation and we intend to do so. As well as that, we know and he knows that the way this system works is that there is often quite a continuous reprioritisation of projects. We will do that on a continuing basis to meet our obligations and to ensure that we have the capability that is required for the Australian Defence Force and understand that that commitment goes not only to the capability in terms of equipment but also for investments through our personnel. I have no doubt at all that we will meet our obligations in both parts in terms of the capability development and deployment of our assets, as well as our investment into our Defence personnel.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:24):  Minister, in answer to the last two questions in terms of where funding is coming from for absorbed measures, you have told us the details are to be advised. You have talked of enhanced efficiencies in the organisation and you have talked about reprioritisation of programs. The only thing you have not spoken about, of course, is detailed programmatic specificity, but I am sure that is coming. If we can move onto some other funding issues, in January this year the Prime Minister launched the national security policy. In her speech she said:


The Government has already committed substantial funding and additional effort to strengthen our cyber capabilities, including $1.46 billion out to 2020 to strengthen our most sensitive networks.


That is an enormous amount of money. You can imagine my interest in finding out where that money was coming from, so I asked the Prime Minister through a question on notice. It was revealed that the funding was in fact to last until 2030, not 2020—a slight error of 10 years. The Prime Minister's grievous error—apparently a staffing error; you have to watch those staff—amounts to $114 million a year. That is quite an error, really, when you think about it. Given that Defence is the lead agency and is responsible for amalgamating the Commonwealth's cybersecurity operations under the new Australian cybersecurity operations centre, how does the government intend to make up this shortfall in funding or are the details to be advised, are there enhanced efficiencies or is there reprioritisation of programs?

As you well know, the Prime Minister promptly corrected the record in relation to that commitment over 2020 to 2030. I am sure you would appreciate that sometimes, very occasionally, very rarely, almost never, but sometimes, these things happen. I would not be condemning the Prime Minister or, indeed, the department. I think we need to appreciate that sometimes these things do happen. We can accept the criticism but not the cynicism.


Since coming to government in 2007 this government has increased the budget for intelligence and security in defence from $376 million in 2007-08 to $517 million in 2013-14. That funding will increase to $637 million over the forward estimates—a further increase of $120 million, or 23 per cent. The Defence Intelligence and Security Group has been excluded from the efficiency dividend—I am not sure that you are aware of that. I am confident we will meet our commitments in that regard.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:28):  I thank the member for her question. One of the challenges that became obvious to me and to others is the fact that whilst we had very good systems in place, and developed new systems to support them, to address the needs of current serving men and women, we actually did not have in place what we should have had in place for families. So we have been moving in that space to provide support for families of current serving men and woman and also support for those people who may have separated from the Defence Force. Significantly, you would be aware, there was a restriction on who got access to some of these entitlements post service.


In the Defence white paper 2013 and in the budget, the government announced a $26.4 million package for enhanced mental health programs for serving and ex-serving personnel and their families, to be administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. DVA has in place a number of mental health initiatives. These include online mental health support information, GP services, psychologists and social work services, specialist psychiatric services, pharmaceutical support, post-traumatic stress disorder programs and hospital services for those who need it.


What we have done here, though, is expand non-liability health cover. This initiative expands the existing arrangements with support and immediate treatment for diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders and depression without the need to lodge a compensation claim. That is quite important, because it means that people get almost immediate access to the treatment. These treatments will be expanded to include treatment for alcohol and substance misuse disorders. These arrangements have already been available to veterans with operational service, and this will be expanded to include veterans with eligible peacetime service since 1994.


It is important to understand that what we are doing here is expanding the range of people who now get access to these services. For example, those people who have been on operational service on border protection, those people who have been involved in humanitarian assistance, such as at Aceh, and those people who have been involved in other peacetime operations are now eligible to get these services. That is quite important, because we know that, whether it is in border protection or humanitarian assistance, some of these personnel have been exposed to really traumatic and quite dreadful experiences which have required them to seek support.


Prior to the passage of this budget, these people have not been able to access the support that other people with active service have been able to access—and that, to me, is really quite important. We are also expanding the amount of support that we are giving to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to include these people. That is important. The VVCS is a very good organisation. It is the organisation that we go to to provide support in the veteran community.


But we have still got more to do, and I do not shy away from this challenge. As I said, we have 65,000 personnel who have now served overseas since 1999. We had fewer than 60,000 people serve in Vietnam. So the number of people we have now who have experienced war is far larger than the number who served in Vietnam. Clearly, we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past—and we will not—and we now have to make sure that both in the short term and the long term, the needs of these people are properly addressed.


The seamless transition between DVA and defence is really vital in that regard. We have worked towards a system where that is close to happening. In many places it is very good and in other places it is a bit 'how's your father?' but it will be fixed. I am very, very pleased with the cooperation we now have as a result of an MOU between the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in dealing with these sorts of issues.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:33):  Minister, I would like to return—noting your statement; and thank you for it—to the issue of budget and funding. I note the comment that you made regarding cyber funding—that slight $1.46 billion rounding error over 10 years. I note that you have said that it is an isolated incident—a one-off—but I remember doing the coalition's response to the Prime Minister's national security statement where she spoke about Australia's defence expenditure comparable to other nations in the world. After the speech, the transcript that followed, had a different series of wording and the transcript was changed. Once may be isolated, Minister, but twice, unfortunately, is a pattern. But let us not be churlish about these things. Let us move on to DSTO funding.


The 2013-14 defence portfolio budget statements say that in 2012-13 DSTO received $441 million in funding. Next year, 2013-14, DSTO will receive $427 million. That is a $14 million cut, Minister. Let us also not forget that, in 2010-11 to 2011-12, you cut $13 million, and for 2011-12 to 2012-13 you cut $22 million. Minister, that is a cumulative cut of at least $49 million out of DSTO. And they are undertaking a significant organisational reform program, which I think is wise—and can I say: I am impressed with the new Chief Defence Scientist, Dr Alex Zelinsky. What I am not impressed about, Minister, is how you can possibly justify cutting the DSTO budget by $14 million this year alone and cumulatively by $49 million. How do you justify that? And, more importantly, what have you cut—or, Minister, are the details to be advised? Are we talking about enhanced efficiencies, or is there reprioritisation of programs?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:35):  I thank the member for his question and really do thank him for his interest in DSTO, which I think is one of the most remarkable organisations in government. Unfortunately, it hides its light under a bushel. That is for obvious reasons, in some regards, but I think we can do a lot more to publicise the work that it does.


Let me make it very clear: nothing that we will do in the context of DSTO's budget will affect our support for operations, which is its primary function. In my experience of this organisation over five years, it occupies a unique position in the Defence community but also in the research community across this country. What it is doing now is building a capacity for collaboration which did not exist previously, in the sense that, while it did collaborate with universities and other places, it is now developing a capacity to leverage off research which is being done in outside organisations which it can then use, or leverage off internally, for work which is being directed as a part of the national security space, or in support for operations, or in its future work.


You know the scale of work which DSTO does. It is vital in our support for operations. And, in terms of our support for operations in Afghanistan in particular, it has played a very important role in providing quite timely responses to immediate threats. And these timely responses to immediate threats have been able to be put in place very quickly. Nothing we have done and nothing we would do in the context of the better efficiencies that we want to achieve over the organisation will have any impact on our support for operations, and that is our primary function.


In the context of forecasting what our scientific requirements will be: again, I have no doubt about the depth of the relationships we have through DSTO with our counterparts in other countries, particularly in the 'five eyes' community, and the work which they are doing to support us. And leveraging off research which is being done elsewhere and partnering in research which is being done elsewhere has led to better outcomes. You would know that we now share facilities and research with these. So we are not doing repeat research; we are working collaboratively. These are giving us efficiencies, as they are giving other nations efficiencies—and here I am principally talking about the United States and Great Britain.


It is important that we appreciate the changing scientific environment: the greater collaboration between nations and the greater collaboration locally—not only between universities but now working more broadly with the private sector to appreciate what research capacities are in the private sector and trying to spin off that research for our Defence purposes.


I think we are really very fortunate to have Dr Zelinsky, as you rightly pointed out. His predecessor was a wonderful human being and a very, very good leader. They are different personalities, but they both have done significant work and done this nation a great service.


I have no doubt—because I meet with scientists in DSTO on a regular basis—about their capacity to continue to produce work of the finest quality for us and to guarantee not only support for our operations but also support for our national security, because they are now responsible for research in the national security space. I am in awe of this organisation. I am not a scientist; I do not have a scientific bone in my body. But I understand good research when I see it and I do appreciate the huge brains working on this stuff. I have no doubt that the efficiencies which we will gain through the decisions that have been taken will lead to a very positive outcome for all of us.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (10:40):  Minister, I would like to take you back to some of the earlier comments you made. Obviously, as our engagement overseas changes in Afghanistan and as our role in the Pacific and in East Timor winds down, more and more Defence personnel are coming back. You mentioned this in your answer to the member for Canberra. I have a particular question—




Mr Robert:
  Well, get to it.




Mr Snowdon:
  Leave him alone!




Mr PERRETT:
  That's all right.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Order, members! That was not helpful. It is not helpful, member for Fadden.




Mr PERRETT:
  I might restart. With our overseas Defence personnel returning to Australia—you touched on it in your answer to the member for Canberra—what support will be provided? I have a cousin in the MEAO at the moment. In my small role as a legal officer in the RAAF I have dealt with a few matters where drugs and alcohol have been an issue; they can become a part of your lifestyle, especially when you are posted overseas, as anyone would know.


When people came back from World War II, we already had a very strong RSL support network. Sadly, our World War II veterans are passing away. Many of the office bearers are now Korean and Vietnam war veterans. But, as you said, there is a new wave of veterans coming back from overseas, and you mentioned the specific support given to wives and girlfriends, who might be the first sentinels, I guess—the first to know if something is going on. I am particularly interested in any support that is provided in terms of linking people up for employment and support groups. Many of the people who come back from Afghanistan or other overseas areas of operations do not feel like turning to the RSL—with all deference to our wonderful RSL groups. Minister, I recently had you at the Sunnybank RSL, and that was the statement they made about trying to link up with former ADF personnel in our community. How do they make contact when there is often a generation gap? The RSLs provide excellent services. My Sunnybank RSL—and my other RSLs, but I focus on that one because you came along to the meeting there, Minister—have great support networks that they can link people to, but it is about finding those former ADF personnel. They could be living right alongside, but they do not put a flag out the front saying 'veteran'. The new lot of veterans might benefit from the support networks there and from groups like the RSL.


Minister, could you detail the sort of support, the sorts of links and the sorts of personnel that are involved in providing support; and, on a more informal basis, what you have seen in terms of best practice around the nation in your job, because you do straddle those various portfolios? What are the learnings there that are not necessarily budget items, or have only been flagged as budget items that we might be able to roll out in the months or years ahead?


Obviously, our RSLs change. Sadly, the numbers in three RSLs in my patch are becoming smaller every year. One has had to amalgamate; another is looking particularly skinny. I have been able to provide it with new accommodation, which might sustain it. There are not long waiting lists to get into RSLs. In my electorate, clubs which have a services club attached to them have finances and they can have lots of resources, but the number of personnel lining up to become members is not great. In my area of Sunnybank, as you know, the demographics of the community have changed. I am wondering whether you could comment on that. (Time expired)

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:45): I thank the member for his question. I know about his deep appreciation of the importance of dealing appropriately with serving veterans and with former serving veterans. I go back for a moment, if I may, to the health initiative announced through the white paper and in this budget. As well as expanding the mental health non-liability cover, there is a post discharge GP health assessment. This initiative will support a health assessment fitness check for all ADF members after discharge and the fitness check will be supported by a health screening tool with a mental health component which will be developed for use by GPs. The check will be supported through existing Medicare items. I will not go through the detail of that—I may do later—or through the changes to the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. One of the things we are doing, which will be of interest to you, is developing the Peer-to-Peer Support network. This initiative is a program to support the recovery of clients with a mental health condition by providing a non-clinical support network. Building on the experience of a successful men's health peer education program, the Peer-to-Peer Support network enables individuals to be assisted by their peers without judgment or stigma attached to the relationship as it is based on mutual understanding and experience.


One of the things we have learnt and we know the RSL accepts—and this goes to your question about how you provide access for people after they have served—is that it is true, unfortunately, that many serving men and women and former serving men and women in a younger age cohort do not see the direct relevance of the RSL. There is a capacity now for serving men and women who are overseas to become online members of the RSL and that is a positive thing, and we are providing, through the relationship between Defence and DVA, on-base support officers in all the major bases across the country. The on-base support officers are DVA employees who provide advice and assistance to current serving men and women. As a former serving man, the shadow minister would know that there are people of the highest rank in this country who are claimants in the DVA system because of injuries incurred while they were in service. It is part of the way we deal with current serving men and women. We have discovered that, as a result of having the on-base advisory services on base for 18 months or so, they provide a unique space for connecting Defence personnel with ex-service organisations. I must say that at Holsworthy the Vietnam Veterans organisation has almost a full-time presence and the DVA on-base advisory person works closely with that organisation—so they pick them up.


But we do have a challenge, and it is an enormous challenge, about how we track people once they leave the service. This is an obligation which we have because we want to make sure. Effectively, once you go through a recruitment centre and walk through the gates at Wagga for your initial training, you are potentially a client of the Commonwealth till you are dead. That is an important thing to understand. If you put the uniform on, you can expect to be looked after all your life if you have an accident, are injured, are wounded or whatever, and if you are killed your family will get support. For them, that is until the partners are no longer with us. So it is very, very important that we have a seamless transition and we try and track those people who are serving, beyond service, and provide them with the support they desire. I know that we will be doing the DVA bit shortly, and I will come to that in more detail. (Time expired)

Mr ROBERT:
  I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr ROBERT:
  You started the answer, Minister, talking about ADF health, so let us talk about ADF health—I think it is great—because the 2012-13 budget delayed the rollout of the ADF free family healthcare program by a further 12 months. That is the 2012-13 budget, the current budget, which delayed it by 12 months in order to save 50 million bucks. Taking into account this delay—which is not the first, I might add—what we currently have now bears no resemblance to what was promised by the Labor government in 2007. The program was due to begin on 1 July this year. The 2012-13 budget papers even made special mention and called it a saving. The government is going to save $50 million by taking free family health care from ADF dependants.


This year's budget papers make absolutely no mention of the program at all—a signature program, Minister, from the election of the mighty Labor government in 2007, and there is no mention of it. But—surprise, surprise—a small note appeared a week or so ago on the Defence website which simply states that the program has been delayed once more, now beginning on 1 January 2014. Minister, I must have missed your press release, and I apologise that I did not receive that, or I must have missed it in the budget, but I picked it up on that small note on the website: another six-month delay after the election. The trial program has now been running for over four years. That simply has to be some sort of record in terms of a trial program for the ADF free family health care.


Minister, given the repeated failure of the government to implement the full program as your government promised to do—and there is a danger of creating two classes of ADF dependants, those with access and those without—can you guarantee that this program, delayed many, many times, will actually start on 1 January 2014, and what is the cost of the program?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:54):  I am pleased you asked that, because it is now time to put to rest some of the furphies we have heard over an extensive period of time. Let us be clear in the first instance that superannuation retirement pay is not income support. Superannuation retirement pay cannot be seen as equivalent to a pension, an age pension or an invalidity pension. They are totally different things.


The opposition, through its spokesman on veterans' affairs, has conflated these two issues and led people to believe that somehow or another the superannuation entitlement they receive as payments as a result of their service is equivalent to the age pension. It is not a valid comparison. I know it. You know it. The shadow minister knows it. Minister Minchin, in a previous government, knew about it. He canned the whole idea. Even the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has confused the issue. Earlier this year in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, he said, 'What is good for civilians is good for former Defence personnel.' Does he know what former Defence personnel get. Does he know the arrangements they have entered into when they join the Defence Force.


This fair indexation policy, which you are supposedly advocating, is anything but fair. Nobody who joined the Australian Defence Force after 1991 is covered by the opposition's proposal. The 150,000 members of the MSBS, those people who have served in Iraq, Timor-Leste, the Solomons and Afghanistan, who are not in the DFRDB scheme, are not covered. Indeed I was at an event recently where a former very senior and distinguished serviceman was talking with a currently serving man, who is very distinguished in his own right. The former serviceman said to me, 'What are you doing about our pensions?' I said, 'Nothing. We are not going to change it in the way the opposition has proposed.' He said, 'It is all about helping our young blokes. It is all about these young blokes here.' The young serving person said, 'No it's not. It has no impact on me at all.'


Yet we have this masquerade, this policy, as if somehow or another the whole of the veteran community is going to be impacted by it. Despite the opposition's posturing, the DFRDB scheme is a good one. Let me just explain what the benefits are. The payment benefits on retirement after 20 years of service are: 75 per cent, under 45 years of age; 75 per cent, retired after 20 years of service, before 45 years of age; and 40 per cent with 35 to 40. They have the ability to commute five times the annual retirement pay in exchange for a reduction in retirement pay. This option has been taken up by 99 per cent of members. There is a higher employer contribution than other schemes: 30 per cent, against the community average of nine per cent. Adopting the opposition's policy would increase the government's contribution to closer to 40 per cent and this is just not sustainable. The scheme has a higher percentage of final salary superannuation retirement pay compared to other Commonwealth schemes: the military is 51.25 per cent at 30 years; the civilian equivalent is less than 40 per cent.


So what is Mr Abbott wanting? Does he want us to bring back the entitlements under DFRDB to make them equivalent to public servants. If that is his intention he should say so.


Since 1988 a separate three per cent productivity benefit has been paid fortnightly, and that is available as a lump sum on retirement. Let us get to the nub of this. What does this mean for people currently leaving the service? A colonel equivalent who retired at the beginning of 2012 after 30 years service got a retirement pay of $68,000, converted to a lump sum of around $340,000 in exchange to reduced annual payment of $55,000. That is supposed to be equivalent to the age pension. (Time expired)

That is equivalent to the age pension. They are seen as the same. How can that be? What is the difference between an income support payment, the age pension, and a retirement benefit as part of a superannuation scheme? They are not equivalent. They are different. Yet we have got the shadow minister going round to RSL conferences and trying to give people the view that somehow or other these things are the same. That is misleading, it is wrong, it is confusing and it is designed to confuse. I can accept that people may think that they want a different indexation scheme. I can accept that. I am happy to have that discussion. But people think that somehow or other we are going to sit back here and accept the proposition that a retirement benefit scheme, a superannuation scheme, is to be seen as the same as an income support scheme. I think it is downright wrong.



An honourable member:  Dishonest.




Mr SNOWDON:
  It is certainly dishonest. Let me just go to how these schemes currently operate. Let us put it in a proper context. Again, this is a superannuation scheme. It is superannuation, not income support. Understand this: over the period November 2007 to 1 January 2013, the salary for privates through to colonels in the ADF increased in excess of 19 per cent. From 1 January 2008 to 1 January 2013, a one-year shorter period, the comparable CPI increases for people on DFRB and DFRDB was 17 per cent. Are you guys trying to tell us that somehow or other these guys are not being treated fairly? I have already told you that your leader, from his own statements, has no idea what you are talking about. He says what is good for civilians is good for former Defence personnel. Well, these former Defence personnel are doing a damn sight better than their civilian counterparts—as they should.


Let us not be confused here. Trying to describe this superannuation scheme as an income support scheme, which is what the opposition is deliberately doing by confusing the two, is palpably dishonest, and I am sick to death of it. They have been out there in the veteran community, putting out misleading documents—documents which have emanated from the shadow minister's office and been sent to local members for distribution. We get them, so we know precisely what you are up to. You go out there deliberately misleading, effectively telling people lies, and you expect us not to respond. I have not responded until this day, but by God I am angry, because you have deliberately misled the veteran community. You have deliberately been dishonest to the veteran community. I do not think it is reasonable or fair for a person who wants to be the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to adopt that sort of behaviour. He should front up to the veteran community and explain to them the difference between a superannuation scheme and an income support scheme such as an age pension. But you will not, because I know what you are like. In any event, though, I know the truth, and people who are reasonable and who are prepared to assess this matter properly also know the truth.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:04):  This crosses both defence and veterans' affairs, but I will ask it in a veterans affairs way. When Bruce Scott, the member for Maranoa, was the veterans' affairs minister, he came to Wagga Wagga to open the refurbishment of the Wagga Wagga war cemetery. I will start, in the spirit of bipartisanship, by commending the minister for the Anzac centenary grants; $100,000 is going to be well used in each and every electorate. Applications for my committee in the Riverina closed last Friday, and the minister will be pleased to know that we received 30 applications from interested people, many ex-service people, who are very keen to ensure that that $100,000 is well spent.


I would like to see a statue dedicated to John Ryan, the Victoria Cross winner from Tumut, who won his Victoria Cross on the Hindenburg Line in 1918. He enlisted on the Kangaroos march, which took off from Wagga Wagga in 1915. I know the minister would be well aware of the Kangaroos march and the work being done by Graham Brown and others from Exeter to re-enact that wonderful historical event in which so many people from the 55th Battalion and others marched out of Wagga Wagga, ended up in Sydney and went to the Great War. Many of them did not return. John Ryan was one who did return. Unfortunately, he did not have a happy life after he returned. It is sad to say that his latter years did not treat him well. He found it hard to get employment. I hope that now, thanks to the government’s initiative, we can remember him in death perhaps better than we looked after him in life. I commend the government for that initiative.


I would like to ask the minister whether there has been a creeping reduction in the number of regimental bands in the Army. Many veterans have contacted me about this matter. As the minister would be well aware, Kapooka is the Army Recruit Training Centre; all the Army recruits go through Kapooka. It is a wonderful Army base. My city of Wagga Wagga is a tri-service city, with the Navy, the Air Force and the Army Recruit Training Centre.


In 1972, in its first year, the Whitlam Labor government said that it was going to disband the Kapooka band. A spirited group, led by Bruce Pinney and the late alderman Helen Frisby, started a Save the Band campaign. I do hope that we do not have to do that again. The number of Kapooka band members has reduced from something like 28 to 20, and that is a great concern. Not only does the Army band play at all the march-outs; it also plays an integral role in many fundraising activities in the community. I know how focused the current commandant, Colonel David Hay, whose posting is due to conclude at the end of this year, is on community efforts. First and foremost, the priority of the band is to play at the army march-outs. They do a wonderful job. Many of the band members have been to Gallipoli and Villers-Bretonneux in recent years to play at various Anzac Day ceremonies. They are renowned bandspeople, great musicians.


There is a great fear that, because of the government’s cutbacks in defence and the government’s cutbacks—they are called savings—in veterans' affairs, the band is being reduced, along with bands right throughout Australia. I would like the minister to answer that question. I know it is a Defence portfolio question, but many veterans have asked me about it. I know the minister is well aware of an ex-Kapooka service soldier, Bert Hoebee. Minister, Bert is dismayed by the tone you used in your 15 May discussion about the DFRDB and DFRB and would like an apology on behalf of the ex-servicemen who he thinks have been slighted by your attack on them over the superannuation and veterans' affairs entitlement issue. Thank you, Minister.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:09):  I thank the member for his question and say to him that I am not aware of any plans to cut back further on regimental bands or their participation in ceremonial activities. I thank him for his participation in the Centenary Local Grants Program. I think it is a very important initiative and we want every local member in the country to be engaged with it. We know from the previous commemorative events we had in the nineties that this can be very successful. But it does rely on the local community taking ownership along with the local member and getting the right outcome for the community. I do thank the member and I understand the importance to Wagga of Kapooka and the triservice arrangements which exist there.


There is now a general acceptance, I think, that we are entering a period of very important commemorative events which will last until Armistice Day 2018. That is important to us, but it is going to create a lot of demand for things like ceremonial banks—because there will be a lot of activity. One of the things that Defence is doing is planning how to use its personnel in an appropriate way. The Federation Guard, as you know, is a very important part of this and has been working consistently at a very high level at all the ceremonial events I have been present at, including smaller events we have taken veterans away to—for commemorative services in Crete, Singapore and elsewhere. The Federation Guard have been fundamental to that, as they were at Anzac Day at Gallipoli and Anzac Day at Villers-Bretonneux—and that will continue to be the case.


I can give you an assurance that, from my perspective, there are no plans to diminish or deny the opportunities for these bands to be participating. But they are operational issues. At the end of the day, these people are service personnel who are required to work at the direction of the chiefs of the various services, which is as it should be. We will not be interfering in that process.


I do want to come back to the last point you made—around DFRB and DFRDB. I am affronted by what you said. More importantly, I am affronted by the way the opposition has been peddling this. I am affronted by it because my door is always open for genuine discussion and dialogue. But I am sick and tired of the vitriol which is coming from some quarters of the ex-service community and which has been promulgated and stimulated in part by the shadow minister. Giving encouragement to people to vent their views in such an extreme way is, I think, an insult to me, particularly, as well as to the government and to all veterans.


When you sit down and discuss this thing reasonably with veterans, they understand that they are treated specially. They appreciate that the superannuation arrangements they entered into when the joined the Defence Force were as they were and that they have been substantial beneficiaries ever since. I think it is important that the   opposition actually go and explain to people precisely what DFRDB recipients who are currently serving will get once they retire and then ask them, 'Do you see that as being the same as a pension?'


I mentioned earlier what a colonel would get after 30 years. I mentioned what a major would get after 20 years of service. Let me just go to a non-commissioned officer, a warrant officer, who retired at the beginning of 2012 after 30 years of service with a final salary of $47,000 per annum. He would get a lump sum of around $240,000, exchangeable for an annual payment, indexed to CPI, of $38,000.


Those in the private superannuation market have, since the GFC, seen their returns plummet. The returns for those people whose superannuation is indexed to CPI have increased and those people were, for a period, well in front of the commercial market. The returns for those people on CPI have increased and for a period were well in front of the commercial market. Why is it that there was no explanation by the opposition that this is a superannuation scheme guaranteed by taxpayers? (Time expired)

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:15):  In keeping with comments on budgets, I bring the minister back to the Veterans' Affairs budget. Let me firstly say he certainly gets our strong support for the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. I think it is well received across the board. If you could take a quick note back to your department, Minister, eight weeks to get a logo out is probably a bit on the long side, but I am sure you will sort that out.


More importantly, the budget paper contains a $120,000-grant for the federal electorate of New England to support two commemorative projects. This grant is on top of the local grant program of $100,000 to every electorate. So this is a specific $120,000 grant over and above to New England. The first was $20,000 to the Gunnedah Shire band for the cost of their travel to France in April. The second is a $100,000-grant to the Inverell RSL for construction of a new museum. Whilst the projects seem worthwhile—and I lend no comment otherwise—Minister, can you explain why New England has received $120,000 over and above other electorates? For instance, was the $20,000 paid to the Gunnedah Shire band organised through a public tender? Could other bands in other electorates across the country have applied for the funding? Similarly, what will the Australian government's $100,000 commitment to the Inverell RSL project provide? Who else is funding the project? What is the total cost? When is it going to be completed?

The Inverell payment was an appropriate one and was in partnership with them.


I point out that we are going to do an avenue of honour in North Queensland, which will be opened in late June by the Prime Minister, which is another important commemorative event. I am very pleased we are doing it. I do not see any disconnect between what we do there and what we have done elsewhere. There are other places where we have provided grants over and above the Saluting Their Service grants or other grants that are available because there are processes to deal with them.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:17):  I draw your attention to another issue. Last night at Senate estimates the Department of Veterans' Affairs confirmed that the average claim processing time under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act was 35 days above that reported in the budget papers and in the department's own annual report. The department confirmed last night that in March 2013 the average processing time was 155 days. But in the budget paper the government says that the mean processing time was 120 days. Minister, were you aware of this misreporting?


The department confirmed that $1.7 million given to them in the budget to make improvements to the processing time for compensation claims will simply be used to bring processing times back to the reported mean time rather than seeking to reduce the reported average claims processing time. Whilst the new secretary noted that we are not meeting our targets, it is clearly the government which takes responsibility for all issues with the department and has to justify why they have allowed what would seem like inaccurate reporting of veteran compensation claim processing times.


Minister, I think you would agree that this may cast doubts made in other areas over claims made in other documents about other processing times. I can imagine this situation is somewhat embarrassing, especially since in your 2011 post-budget press release you announced the claims process was 'complex, wieldy and slow' and you announced $3.4 million to improve that process. I fail to see if anything meaningful has happened since that money was allocated.


The misreporting also comes at a time when the department claims under the MRC Act that claims will increase by eight per cent. Without proper training for advocates and pensioner welfare officers, the complexity of the system may lead to further delays. The department further confirmed last night that veteran advocates are not being given specific training about the changes to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act currently before the parliament. Minister, surely without proper training the problems with the claim processing may only increase.


The increase in claim processing times comes on the back of that 2011 decision of the government to cut advocacy funding by $1 million a year over the forward estimates. I think we all agree this decision has placed enormous strain on volunteer veteran advocates and pensioner welfare officers, who are struggling to cope with the increased demand for their service from veterans and their families. These advocates provide an essential service to veterans and their families, helping them to negotiate their way through what is a complex rehab system. Taking the support out from under their feet is disappointing. Minister, can you explain how this misreporting of average claim processing times in the portfolio budget statements came about and what was its genesis? Can you explain that differentiation and, if indeed there are mistakes, Minister, will you take responsibility?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:21):  I am not sure if there is a misunderstanding by the opposition, but there has been no attempt to manipulate the figures nor to misreport. I am not sure why you would get to that position. The 120 days quoted in the 2014 portfolio budget statement is a benchmark KPI for processing claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The portfolio budget statement lists key performance targets for programs. It was not a misreporting of statistics. It is appropriate that there should be KPIs and it is appropriate we should try to meet the KPIs. I can only think that the opposition are saying leave them out—if the average is 155 days or 158 days, or whatever it is, make the KPI that. That is not appropriate. It is really inappropriate to change a benchmark target that is not being met.


We fully acknowledge that the average processing time for MRCA initial liability claims for the 12 months ending March 2013 was 155 days. There has been no fudging of figures, none. I am not sure why you would think there has been. What is in it for us to fudge the figures? It is a transparent process. Why fudge it? The performance against the individual targets is reported each year in DVA's annual report. There is no attempt to hide the figures; just read them and make comparisons. Of course we can do better and that is what we want to do.


The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has been conducting an inquiry into the care of Australian Defence Force personnel wounded and injured in operations. The department recently reported to the committee that the times taken to process MRCA liability claims for 2011-12 was 158 days on average. MRCA claims received have increased by an average in excess of nine per cent per annum over the last five years. As you would expect from a prudent government, in response to this increase in claims the government have provided $1.7 million over four years to improve MRCA processing times. It is important that we do it. It is not in it for us to try to extend these times. We want to make sure that we meet these benchmarks where we possibly can. These KPIs are quite important to us. There should be targets which we try to achieve. That is why we are making this additional $1.7 million available.


DVA is further addressing the time taken to process claims under MRCA through a number of ways. Firstly, by applying streamlining processes, providing further training and guidance for staff, redistributing claims across locations, prioritising cases, redeveloping ICT tools and improving access to information from the Department of Defence.


There is absolutely nothing in it for us to try and obfuscate or disguise or otherwise hide what we are achieving in terms of these timelines. It would be incorrect to think that somehow or other we would deliberately go around a process to distort or misreport the figures when we are quite open to public scrutiny here—and we accept that scrutiny, and we accept the desire and need for us to do better. I want to thank the department for the diligent way they have gone about trying to achieve these targets. I know that they are applying their best endeavours to getting the best possible outcome for all of those people putting in claims. If we can improve the time to settle those claims, we will. It is our intention, and anyone who believes that we would do otherwise does not understand the way we do our work.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:26):  Earlier this year the Australian National Audit Office released an audit of the Veterans' Children Education Scheme, VCES, and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme, let us just call that MRCAETS. The audit was a sobering analysis of how the government has certainly failed to ensure policies affecting veterans' children have kept pace with changes in the broader income support arrangements facing all Australians. In a repeat of their 2009 decision to exclude veteran disability pensions from the Harmer review of pensions, despite a hand-on-heart promise of the Treasurer on Brisbane radio on 12 September 2008 to do so, the government decided that payments to veterans' kids under VCES or MRCAETS would not be similarly adjusted. Instead, the government advised veterans to ring Centrelink to find out whether they would be better off under the family tax benefit system rather than DVA's own compensation-based education support system.


The audit found that, during the life of the scheme, changes in the wider social policy environment have at various times challenged DVA's policy and coordination capacity. Audit's analysis also indicates that, at least as far back as 2004, some students may have been financially better off by claiming benefits other than those offered by the VCES. However, DVA did not formally notify affected clients of this option until January 2012. According to the audit, the government rejected a DVA request to address the anomalous situation, saving $2 million by forcing veterans' families to Centrelink rather than DVA.


This situation would be bad enough on its own if the audit did not then find that the legislative provisions governing the VCES and MRCAETS were being flouted because of a lack of funding. The legislation requires VCES volunteer board members to travel and meet face-to-face with students, teachers and parents as part of the nation's obligations to assist these families. Funding for VCES board members to travel to see these students in rural and regional areas was slashed from a budget of $40,000 to just $10,000. This is particularly concerning, given that one of every two students under VCES and MRCAETS lives outside metropolitan areas, particularly in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania. Because of the lack of funding for outreach required by the legislation, volunteer board members were instead forced to rely on written reports sent to them by schools, rather than meeting face-to-face with the veteran, the student and the school to discuss the student's progress. The audit report highlighted the important role that these outreach arrangements have in assisting children of veterans to achieve better education outcomes.


Minister, this happened on your government's watch. Whilst we note that the department has accepted two recommendations from the ANAO, it may be cold comfort to veterans' families who have recently relied on a system that has been found to be broken. Minister, can you explain why the government rejected DVA's 2011 request to align VCES payments with the new FTB arrangement announced in the 2010 election? Will you also confirm that this rejection, to save just $2 million over four years, comes when advertising expenses for, for example, Gonski reforms are $21 million and, for NBN, $5 million?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:29):  Let me firstly make the observation that DVA, as the member for Fadden should know, or at least the shadow minister for veterans' affairs should know, has arrangements in place to advise VCES students of their options where FTB exceeds VCES allowances. The background to this is important.


From 1 January 2012 the government increased the maximum rate of FTBA for 16- to 18-year-olds in full-time secondary study from $52.64 to $214.06. It is currently $220.64 per fortnight. That equated it to the 13- to 15-year-old rate, which was a 2010 election commitment recognising the cost of older teenagers. The increased rate is to be payable until the end of the calendar year in which the child either turns 18 or leaves full-time secondary study, whichever is earlier. The end of year FTBA supplement will also be payable to families with children aged 16 to 18 at $726.35 pro rata once a tax return is lodged.


This change meant that new applicants for youth allowance could no longer be paid for a secondary student aged 16 and over and are asked to apply for FTB. However, Centrelink when wrote to existing youth allowance recipients very few applied for FTB—fewer than 10,000 from 85,000 letters sent out. DVA's VCES and MRCAETS rate of $223 per fortnight for 16- and 17-year-olds living at home is set at the same rate as Centerlink's youth allowance. The rate of FTBA, including the annual FTBA supplement is now more than the annual amount of youth, VCES and MRCAETS allowances payable for a secondary student aged 16 to 17 except for those on living away from home and homeless rates. This means it is more beneficial for some families after means testing to receive FTB than education assistance under VCES or MRCAETS—that is, they will be better off receiving a comparable payment from Centrelink than from DVA.


Also available from Centrelink is family tax benefit part B, which is targeted at single income and low-second-income-earning families. This may be paid up to $100.66 per fortnight. The FTB part B supplement is up to $354.05 per family per year. Under the children's scheme, Abstudy postgraduate award scheme or the VCES there is a similar preclusion to that of FTB. This means that dependants over 16 who apply for FTBA will be able to retain their orphan pension if the criteria are met. Those who have lost their orphan pension owing to receiving another payment will likely seek to have it reinstated. There were approximately 200 recipients of orphan pension in 2012. It was expected that this number would increase by 72 with those applying for FTB. Statistics indicate that only nine orphans have switched to FTB.


There is currently no preclusion in the MRCA that presents a payment for education assistance being made at the same time as a payment for an eligible young person. The reasons VCES and MRCAETS cannot be aligned for FTB rates of education allowance under the VCES and MRCAETS are linked to rates of youth allowance. However, unlike youth allowance, education allowances under the VCES and MRCAETS are not means tested. Aligning FTB is a difficult and is a different program to redesign. We are talking about a very small number, relatively speaking, of people. As I said earlier, DVA has put in place arrangement to advise VCES students of their options where FTB exceeds VCES allowances. That is a simple fact and something that I know you would appreciate.


I will conclude by returning to an earlier contribution to make sure that there is no misunderstanding. I have no difficulty at all with people arguing that they want to change an indexation rate for their retirement benefit. I have a great deal of difficulty in equating it to an age pension. I will read what Nick Minchin said when he was the coalition minister for finance:


This claim (to change indexation) was properly rejected by the Howard Government, of which I was a member.


There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment employment-related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit, in this case the age pension.


I rest my case. It is something so logical even those opposite should see it.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (11:35):  I refer the minister to some correspondence he produced earlier this week between himself and Telstra in 2009. He wrote to Telstra on 27 March 2009 raising a concern from a Mr Yossi Berger about asbestos-containing material in Telstra pits. Telstra wrote back on 28 April, in a letter the minister has distributed in the press gallery, in which Richard Coleman said:


Such pits are only removed and replaced in situations where they have suffered significant damage and therefore present a hazard. When serviceable pits remain in situ, they are not considered to present a risk to health and safety of any person.


The minister wrote again, in August 2009, pressing Mr Berger's argument that all the pits should be replaced. Then he received a reply on 13 August 2009 from Michael Rocca, then the head of network services, who wrote:


It is Telstra's opinion the proposals of Mr Berger do not achieve a satisfactory balance between commercial practicability and the actual health risk posed by in-ground pits that contain bonded asbestos cement. The potential higher risk for disturbance of in situ asbestos plant is recognised within the Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos, 2nd edition 2005, which states:


The removal of asbestos-containing materials can potentially expose workers and others to higher levels of … fibres than leaving the materials in situ.


The minister wrote back again, to Mr Thodey this time, the chief executive, and made the point in his letter, dated 2 November, that, when such ACM materials are disturbed, organisations, employees and contractors can be exposed to fibres. And he suggested a formal program of total removal would be a great legacy. Mr Thodey wrote back and, in his letter of 14 December, said:


Given the low risk of in situ pits, the potential risks of removal and the prohibitive associated costs, we do not believe a proactive pit removal process is justified at the time.


What this demonstrates is that, in 2009, the minister was very aware—very aware indeed—that there was asbestos-containing material in Telstra's pits. He was aware that Telstra had a view, supported by the industry standards, that they are safe if they are intact and left in situ and undamaged, and that health risks arise when they are disturbed. Of course, at that time they were being disturbed rarely, only when maintenance was required or trucks ran into them and so forth. However, by 2011, the deal that was done between NBN Co. and Telstra, of course, involved the disturbance of almost all of these pits on a massive, nationwide scale. From 2011, there have been reports in the press of asbestos being found in the works being conducted either by NBN Co. or by Telstra as part of the NBN project. There was a 2011 report in the Age, on page 6 of the 5 May edition; on 13 December last year there were reports about contamination found in Western Australia; and there have been a number of reports earlier this year as well.


I am hoping the minister will take the opportunity to enlighten us here, but, notwithstanding the fact that all of these pits were going to be disturbed so that the whole context changed dramatically with the NBN deal, and notwithstanding that there were reports of asbestos contamination, he does not appear to have raised concerns about them, having been put on notice in 2009, either with the communications minister or with NBN and Telstra prior to last week, when the matter became a very hot issue, as we all know, in the Sydney media. I could refer the minister, of course, to the questions that my colleague the member for Bradfield and others have raised in the various committees and the Senate estimates, but I imagine he does not pay much attention to questions from the opposition.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:40):  I think it is a little hash of the member opposite to say that I do not pay attention to his questions; I do. In terms of asbestos and the issues which he has raised, let me say again—and I will keep saying it, because it is an important opportunity to remind members of the opposition who have shown a new-found interest in asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma—that asbestos is a giant scourge. Last night on Lateline the member for Wentworth accused the government of trying to create a panic. I tell you what: when we know that nearly 700 people a year are dying from asbestos related diseases and that another 30,000 to 40,000 people will die of asbestosis, to not take the issue, not talk about it and not deal with the concerns raised by the residents of Penrith is not appropriate.


Let us look at the history of asbestos, because it goes to the wafer-thin propositions being advanced by the member for Wentworth, which are that somehow this government has not been doing enough about asbestosis and the dangers of asbestos. Let us have a little bit of history. First of all, the Telstra pipes and the Telstra ducts, which contain asbestos, have been rolled out over many, many years. Telstra and the Postmaster-General knew this. In fact, I must put on record a positive comment that the member for Wentworth's father-in-law, an eminent barrister, represented very ably victims of asbestos exposure on the waterfront. So these issues and the dangers of asbestos were well known.


We also know that certain corporate organisations such as James Hardie and, indeed, CSR chose to cover up and deny the risks of asbestos for many years. It was not so long ago that former opposition leader Mark Latham had to shame those opposite into handing back Hardie's donations. He had to shame them into doing it. The dangers of asbestos have been well known and for a very long time in Telstra. Indeed, it was well known to the opposition when they were in government. The late member for Calare, Peter Andren, raised with the then government and the then minister for communications on notice issues identical to the questions which I raised in 2009. At that stage, I think it was the then minister for agriculture in the House of Representatives, on behalf of the minister for communications, who said that Telstra had asbestos in its system, in some of its pits and in some of its ducts. So the sort of startling smoking-gun revelation that somehow it has only been of late that some of the dangers of asbestos have been revealed is not fair and not accurate.



Mr Turnbull interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  You will get your chance, Mal. Sorry. I don't mean to upset that glass jaw of yours. We were aware in 2001 of the need for Telstra to create a separate fund, and indeed it was the Leader of the Opposition, then as a minister, who said, 'No, we won't.' Again, in 2007, it was the Leader of the Opposition, who was the minister for health at that stage, who would not support the PBS being varied to include drugs which would help alleviate the suffering of victims of asbestosis and mesothelioma. Indeed, when the late Bernie Banton, the great warrior on the issue of asbestos, came forward, he was personally vilified by the now Leader of the Opposition.


We dial forward to now. It is correct that, even as the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, I maintained a strong interest in health and safety—reflecting knowledge, though, which both sides of the House already had. I certainly did contact Telstra a number of times, because people in Tasmania were saying to me that they were concerned about this process. Telstra came back not once, not twice but three times and said that they had it under control. This, I have to say, contrasts with the lack of interest of those opposite, who, despite knowing the issues, have not bothered to put them forward. I have not heard in this debate any reference to those—

Mr SHORTEN:
  As I was saying, asbestos is a deadly serious issue and requires a serious approach. Telstra had advised the government—and they had been in contact with Comcare—that they had procedures for the rollout in terms of their responsibilities on asbestos. The CEO confirmed this at the end of 2009.


What is also clear is that in the last few weeks there have been a number of incidents which show, in my opinion, a breach of the standards we would expect in terms of the remediation of asbestos lined pits, which have been involved in the roll-out of new telecommunications. It is clear to me, from speaking to residents and others, that Telstra needs to lift its standards. That is what we are doing with a new national register. That is what we are doing with a task force oversighting Telstra. And Telstra has given stronger commitments than ever before.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:58):  I am very pleased to be able to be here this morning to make some inquiries in relation, particularly, to the employment and workplace relations portfolio. There has obviously been a great deal of good work done throughout the course of this government's life, particularly in relation to the creation of jobs—over 900,000 jobs created as a result of the fiscal settings and the endeavours of this government since it came to office. Obviously, there has been a significant emphasis on providing support for low-income workers and also providing support by means of taxation arrangements, changes to superannuation arrangements and changes in the way of household assistance measures which have provided, appropriately, support to some of those who are the most vulnerable in our society, including low-income workers. As someone with around 27,000 workers with a taxable income of less than $37,000 per annum in my electorate as at 2008-09, I am very conscious of the arrangements entered into by this government and the good work done by the minister in relation to low-income superannuation contribution. Regrettably, it is the case that those very same 27,000 workers will be those who are exposed to the proposals of the opposition on the low-income superannuation contribution. They have made it clear that they basically support an increase in taxation for that category of people—those 27,000 people in my electorate who are low-income workers. I know that this minister has certainly done a great deal of work both on that superannuation measure and on the progressive increase in the Superannuation Guarantee—another thing that is being resisted by those opposite. It is only ever a Labor government which focuses on superannuation, and, once again, all of these measures stand to the significant benefit of low-income workers in our community.


I know that there has also been a great deal of work done to support job seekers and more broadly across government to support those sorts of people who are in vulnerable circumstances. I know there have been more than 2,800 job seekers in La Trobe who have benefited through household assistance measures provided by the government to enable them to have a bit of extra income. There is a whole range of things to assist low-income workers and I am conscious of the fact that so many of those workers are often women—women in part-time or casual employment. In fact, I think the figures reveal that around 70 per cent of those categorised as part-time or casual workers are women. All these measures appropriately, but disproportionately, assist women in those sorts of jobs.


There has been very good work done by the government and the minister in pulling back from the WorkChoices regime that was left to us by the Howard government, and that good work continues. I know that the minister is very conscious of things like ensuring the ongoing protection of penalty rates and ensuring that we have a fair system of workplace relations. All of these things go to supporting, as Labor traditionally does, the people who are most vulnerable in our society—people on low incomes or who may otherwise be exposed to undue pressure in the workplace. The minister will also be aware that I have certainly taken an interest in arrangements relating to payments for some of our most disadvantaged people, particularly Newstart payments. My question today refers to the Senate's inquiry into Newstart: could you update the chamber on recent budget measures which assist single parents and Newstart recipients?

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (12:03):  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. She has a longstanding interest in reform and supporting people who are less well-off in our communities. It is correct to say that this Labor government has kept our economy strong during some of the most difficult financial circumstances seen in peace time since the Second World War. We have created 950,000 new jobs and, as much as the member for Bradfield shakes his head, these are facts which not even the coalition conservative propaganda writers can unwrite. Despite this, we know that some people are doing it tough. Labor knows fundamentally that the best way out of disadvantage for people is to have a job. The best way for families and kids to get the best start in life is to have employment in their households. It is important to go to the big picture first to set the scene for the specific points that the member for La Trobe is inquiring about. We have relatively low inflation in this country. The cash rate set by the Reserve Bank is as low as it has been in a very long time. We have unemployment which is still reasonably soft at 5.5 per cent. We have seen a 13 per cent increase in the size of our GDP since the global financial crisis, our ASX is coasting towards 5,000—a distinct increase in the last 12 months—and I am optimistic that superannuation returns will be double-digit. Business investment as a share of our GDP is 18½ per cent. So there are things going well in this country that we do not always hear about from the coalition.


Having said that, the member for La Trobe is correct—there are significant pockets of disadvantage in this country. That is why we unveiled a package in the budget to support people into work. I can report to the member for La Trobe that from 20 March 2014 this package will provide an increase in the income-free area beyond which people's allowances are affected. This is the first time that has been done in over a decade. It is a $258 million investment to increase the amount that people can earn before their income support payments are affected. We want to increase the income-free area from $62 to $100, which will increase take-home pay to $494 per week. Not only is it the first increase in more than a decade; it is the first time it has been indexed to CPI in Australia's history. That will take place from 1 July 2015. It is estimated that 150,000 Australians will benefit immediately. We will provide extra benefit for thousands to take up work.


It does not stop there. We have the pensioner education supplement. This is important because, just as a job is important to people's well-being, the best education, or re-education, and support for education is what helps Australian employees have the resilience to cope in a changing global economy. There will be nearly $40 million to increase education opportunities. This will benefit 25,000 additional single parents moving from the PPS to Newstart. It will benefit an additional 90,000 single parents already on Newstart. This pensioner education supplement of $62 a fortnight will ensure that people can train for a certificate II, III or IV in the TAFE system, or indeed for a bachelor degree.


We are also going to extend the concession card. This will see a $2.2 million increase to concession entitlements, and 2,000 people will benefit over the forward estimates. There will be a 12-week buffer when moving off income support payments because income is too high to attract some of the other allowances. This will allow people, as they make the transition, access to discounted GP costs, car registration and medicines.


All of this builds upon the $1.1 billion income support bonus for low-income earners, which this government has already passed. I am sure it disappoints the member for La Trobe, like it disappoints me and disappoints millions of Australians, but those opposite voted against giving $1.1 billion to the lowest paid Australians. When it comes to assisting multinational mining companies, the mob opposite know where to go—they do not need to be told; they just march like automatons to the beat of the multinational drum. But when it has come to supporting low-income people, those opposite have voted against it. What is worse is that they have also indicated they are going to knock off the schoolkids bonus—bang, $400-plus for children of primary school age, and bang, $800 for children at secondary school. Those opposite can always be relied upon to miss an opportunity to help the low-paid. When you look at the tax they are putting on the superannuation contributions of people earning under $37,000—a new 15 per cent great big tax—it is a shame.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (12:08):  When the minister was talking about the political party that could be relied upon to support multinational mining companies, I assumed he was about to refer to the Treasurer and the Prime Minster who, after all, when they were designing their new mining tax, sat down and allowed the three biggest mining companies to design it. That is one of the reasons it has not raised any money.


The minister chose not to answer the question that I asked in my first intervention, which was what did he say, what actions did he take, after 2009 with regard to asbestos-containing material in the Telstra infrastructure in light of his being aware of the problem, as indeed many people were—most people interested in telecommunications were; it was hardly a secret—through his own personal correspondence with Telstra? Then the context changed and the pits were going to be disturbed on a wholesale basis. I should just describe what this disturbance involves. The way the NBN Co.'s network is designed, their junction boxes—what they call multiports—are devices that are being lodged in pits, but the existing pits are too small, for the most part, and so they have to be replaced with a larger plastic pit. Obviously, where the pit is made of concrete or concrete thought to contain asbestos, there is plenty of potential for contamination because the pit basically has to be broken up and removed. So it goes from being an occasional pattern of disturbance to being a near-universal pattern of disturbance. The minister has chosen not to answer the question as to what he did after 2009 in terms of raising his concerns with the minister for communications, let alone with NBN and Telstra. If the minister is not prepared to answer that, we cannot force him to answer it.


I turn now to another question, because it is very important that this issue be dealt with with clarity. The minister is quite right in saying that asbestos is a very dangerous substance. It is a very big issue and there is a complete unity ticket on that point. But we have to be very clear about what we are talking about. Now, the minister in 2009 was proposing to Telstra that there should be a proactive removal of all of their asbestos-containing infrastructure, whether it needed to be repaired, maintained, augmented or not—proactive removal. Telstra came back citing the national standards and saying, no, that would be unsafe.


The minister should tell us—and I think he owes the Australian people an explanation: does he believe that asbestos-containing material, whether it is in telecom networks or elsewhere in the built environment, should be removed proactively, regardless of whether it needs to be mended or altered or drilled into or repaired? In other words, is the minister still of the view—



An honourable member:  It could be in my garage.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Yes, it could be the honourable member's garage—if the honourable member has a garage with asbestos-containing material in the walls or in the roof, and it is intact, it is not friable, it is not flaking or powdered. Is the minister saying that that type of asbestos-containing material should be proactively removed? It is important for him as the minister for workplace relations to let us know that. And, if he does take that view, what does he say to the point—and I am not expressing a personal opinion on this but I want him to address it—that was made in the Code of practice for the safe removal of asbestos, which is a publication by his own department, I believe, which states:


The removal of asbestos-containing materials can potentially expose workers and others to higher levels of airborne asbestos fibres than leaving the materials in situ.


Is he arguing for a wholesale, proactive removal of all asbestos-containing material, even when it is stable, intact and not friable? That is a very important issue that he should address, because this issue is too serious for generalities and political grandstanding. We need precision.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (12:13):  I appreciate the member for Wentworth's well-known irony when he says this issue should not be politicised, when in fact that is what the opposition has done. First of all, in terms of the question he alleges is not answered, outside of my ministerial responsibilities in 2009, because I have an interest in health and safety I did contact Telstra not once, not twice but three times. There is correspondence I have tabled where Telstra, in the very last line of the very last letter, say that they are preparing for the NBN rollout. So, despite this sort of sly inference that somehow what has changed is the NBN rollout, Telstra were fully alive to that in 2009, and they certainly indicated that they have solid policies on asbestos.


I am interested in the fact that the member opposite says that the risks of asbestos in Telstra infrastructure are well known. What did the opposition ever do?


We have the relentless NBN watchdog, the member for Wentworth, sitting opposite. What did he ever do to raise the issue of health and safety? He probably has raised it and he probably has raised asbestos issues with the company since 2009—I do not know.


I invite the member for Wentworth to work with the government on asbestos issues. It is fun to throw bricks, but on this particular issue it is not appropriate. I look forward with great interest to finding out how many speeches the member for Wentworth has given about the perils of asbestos. He may have better records than I do—I fully acknowledge that, so I make that caveat—but I have searched nine years of the member for Wentworth's contributions to see what he has said about asbestos. I searched high and searched low—actually, I got someone else to press a button and search Hansard—but not a word until last week. I do not mind the belated interest, because it still is an important issue.



Mr Turnbull interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I do not mean to puncture the member for glass jaw here, but we must look at what has actually happened. For the record, I again state that the opposition's interest in this matter of Telstra and asbestos is being fuelled by their desire to rubbish the NBN. I do not believe they come here with the bona fides they claim, although I will exempt a number of individual backbenchers and shadow ministers whom I have noticed, periodically over time, raising the issue of asbestos. So it is not a blanket condemnation. But I find it difficult to accept a lecture and some of the politicised rubbish I am hearing.


Going through what we have done: Comcare have audited Telstra in the past, they have reviewed pit safety—



Mr Turnbull interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  As much as the member for Wentworth may find my answer discomfiting, I will give it in the manner I choose. He can ask the questions he wants to ask, but I will put the truth as it should be put.


In 2011, Comcare conducted a review of pit safety. They found a breach by Telstra, which Telstra then rectified. If you want to look at our record in tackling asbestos, it is worth noting that, since I became the minister 17 months ago, it is this side of the House which has finalised the Asbestos management review report, which looked at asbestos everywhere—not just the issues the Liberal Party want to conduct their political games over. It is this government which has acted on the recommendations. I have never had to stand behind a queue of coalition frontbenchers trying to talk about occupational health and safety. It is this government which has passed the legislation for the Office of Asbestos Safety. It is this government which, having heard the latest spate of reports in the last six or seven weeks, has acted to have a meeting with Telstra, NBN, the contractors, the stakeholders—we invited unions to the meeting, something which would never happen under those opposite because of their prejudice and bias against trade unions—and the victims groups.


When it comes to prioritised removal, we are not saying that all asbestos everywhere must be removed tomorrow. It is impossible. There are not enough licensed removalists and there are not enough places to take it. I get that, because I have been following this issue for a long period of time. The dangerous argument—not advanced by the member for Wentworth but by the man who beat him by one vote in the leadership ballot, the Leader of the Opposition—is to just leave it in the ground. 'The safest thing is to leave it in the ground,' the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday. What dangerous words. He is not fit to hold the highest office in the nation if he does not understand that sooner or later we have to start removing this asbestos—otherwise more people will die and more people will get sick. It is not enough to say, 'Leave it in place; we can do no more.' We can and we should.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (12:19):  I note what the minister has just said. I understand he did not raise the matter with the minister for communications, Telstra or NBN after 2009. That is now clear. I want to clear up, for the benefit of honourable members, the reference the minister made—which was very misleading, perhaps innocently misleading—to the letter of David Thodey dated 14 December. That letter ends, in the penultimate paragraph: 'Given the low risk of in situ pits, the potential risks of removal and the prohibitive associated costs, we do not believe a proactive pit removal process is justified at this time. This is particularly so given the rollout of a new fibre network by the new National Broadband Network Company.' What the minister may not be aware of is that at the end of 2009 there was no agreement by NBN Co. to use Telstra's pits and pipes. In fact, what NBN Co. was going to do was to overbuild the entire Telstra network. Mr Thodey, no doubt, was contemplating a situation where entirely new infrastructure which did not disturb his pits and pipes was going to be built by NBN Co. And that was the original plan of the government. All of that changed, however, when the agreement was reached, by June 2011 as I recall, between NBN Co. and Telstra which involved the wholesale disturbance of the Telstra infrastructure.


The second matter that I asked the minister about—and perhaps he could just put this to rest—




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, the time allotted for this matter has expired. There are other ministers at the table who have important issues that I am sure the members of the coalition want to question them on. The member for Wentworth is two minutes in and has not yet asked a question. He ran an MPI on this matter yesterday. Can I respectfully suggest that if he has a question of the minister he might wish to put it on notice. I am sure the minister would be willing to answer on notice any question that he was going to put to him.

Mr TURNBULL:
  I have the call.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wentworth will ask his question immediately and then I will put the question.




Mr TURNBULL:

But then he went into an attack on the Leader of the Opposition, criticising him for saying that asbestos-containing material which—

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (12:24):  Whether this is as contested as what we just had, I do not know, but thank you for the opportunity to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 and to present the 2013-14 Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry appropriation. This budget is the next instalment of the Gillard government's plan for Australia's primary industries. The allocation for the portfolio in 2013-14 is $1.92 billion, an increase of $300 million over 2012-13.


The $440 million Farm Finance package will help farmers struggling with debt, through targeted financial assistance. Up to $30 million per annum for two years to each state and the Northern Territory for concessional loans to eligible farmers is available in this budget. Farm Finance includes $6.3 million over two years for around 17 new rural financial counsellors across Australia. Farm Finance enhances eligibility for the Farm Management Deposits Scheme, increasing the non-primary-production income threshold for farm management deposits from $65,000 to $100,000.


On drought reform: we know that drought in this country is inevitable, just as we know that the old exceptional circumstances policy did not work. It was reactive and inequitable and did not prepare our farmers for the future. Minister Ludwig and his state and territory colleagues recently signed an Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform. The centrepiece is the Commonwealth's $99.4 million investment in a new farm household allowance. Farmers can receive support when they need it. They will not have to hope that their property is on the right side of a line on a map. Case managers will provide the support farmers need to help them to better manage risk, improve their preparedness for hardship and make tough decisions about their long-term sustainability.


The National Food Plan is listed in the budget as 'decisions taken but not yet announced', but the government released Australia's first National Food Plan on 25 May, so, as we talk now, it has been announced. The plan includes $42 million worth of new initiatives, including $28.5 million for an Asian Food Markets Research Fund, $5.6 million to build Australia's food trade ties in key and emerging markets, $2.2 million to assess the long-term prospects for food supply and demand in Asian countries and $2 million to create a brand identity for Australian food. It provides a framework for Australia's food system based on the national objectives of the Australia in the Asian century white paper.


On natural resource management: the budget confirms a $200 million investment in the successful Reef Rescue program until 2018, including $70 million from the sustainable agriculture stream of Caring for our Country.


In forestry, delivering on our Tasmanian forestry agreement commitments, $500,000 is allocated to develop a national certification standard through a grant to the Forest Stewardship Council. This is an important part of the Gillard government's $330 million investment to support the historic agreement to provide certainty for industry, jobs and the environment.


Commitments made in previous budgets are confirmed in this budget. Those commitments include a continued commitment to the post-entry quarantine facility in Victoria, a continued investment in primary industries research and development and continued investment in Australia's farmers for a changing climate. I commend the portfolio appropriation to the chamber.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Government Whip) (12:29):  Minister, the 2013-14 budget strengthens the foundation of Australian agriculture. It prepares our farmers for future challenges and lays groundwork for opportunities for rural Australia, particularly now, in the Asian century. The budget, as you have outlined, will make farmers stronger and better prepared for the future and will enable them to access more opportunities, both here and overseas.


I note that the budget makes provision for the historic Farm Finance package, which will help alleviate pressures of debt and provide targeted financial assistance for farmers, particularly when they need it.


At the moment, when you look through my area, you see we have a pretty strong green drought. The grass is green but there is not much cover, which is making it difficult for farmers. Minister Ludwig was exactly right when he said that viable farmers cannot grow if they are held back by unmanageable debt. Farm finance responds to that. I hope that the Victorian government gets off its backside and works with the Gillard government to deliver this opportunity, which I note even the VFF—the training ground for national MPs, their apprenticeship factory—has urged them to do.




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr MITCHELL:
  He will be the fourth president in a row who has gone into that and the VFF says they are not political. The budget also funds the next stage of the government's plan for Australian agriculture, preparing for the future. The Gillard government's National Drought Program Reform gives farmers the tools they need to prepare for drought. We know over the years just how bad drought has been across this country and the issues it has caused in rural Australia. I am pleased to see that the budget has made provision for the $99.4 million farm household assistance to support farmers through hardship. This is very important for our farmers. We look forward to the states finalising their contribution to the National Drought Program Reform, including the farm business training and the social support.


The budget also confirms $429 million for the Carbon Farming Futures Program. That is taking the best abatement and greenhouse gas reduction research and converting it to use on farms. The Gillard government has continued our commitment to research development and extension funding. The budget also includes $238.2 million for the Research and Development Corporation, Minister Ludwig has told us. Investing in RD&E and ensuring that an environment which encourages innovation is vital to Australian farmers. They can capitalise on the Asian century.


I note that the budget continues this government's commitment to biosecurity reform. We know that a modern, world-class biosecurity system is a gateway to global marketplaces. Because of our strong biosecurity system, our farmers get the opportunity to invest and trade in the world's best markets, while also managing the risks which come with increased passenger and cargo movements into the country. The 2013-14 budget demonstrates the Gillard government's plan for Australian agriculture so that our farmers can keep feeding Australians and the world.


The budget keeps our economy strong, makes the smart investments for our future and ensures that every Australian gets a fair go. We are investing for the future, putting jobs and economic growth first and protecting the important services that Australians rely on. My question to you, Minister, is: can you advise the chamber on the status and design and construction of the state-of-the-art, post-entry quarantine facility announced in last year's budget in the seat of McEwen?

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (12:33):  I have a couple of questions relating to departmental issues, which I will put on the record now. Then I will speak to the next series of questions. As far as the departmental issues are concerned, question on notice No. 139 in October 2012 and No. 124 in February 2013, were the coalition asked what nil meant to the annual rental of leased properties. The response was that annual rent is nil as the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is charged a licence fee, not rent, for some properties. That is a ludicrous answer and very technically a semantic play on words because the real question is: what is it actually costing the department, whether it be rent, a licence fee, whatever it might be to site itself in properties around Australia? That is really the question I am asking of the minister or his representative. What is it actually costing and can you now provide details of rent payments, licence fees and any other moneys paid for the lease of properties by DAFF?


My other questions are: what role has DAFF had in investigating the level of animal welfare issues that are associated with the Queensland cattle crisis? And what contact has DAFF or the minister had with the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to look at cattle being allowed into national parks?


The Minister for the Environment, Water, Population and Communities, representing Senator Ludwig, made mention of the fact that recently, at a meeting with his state counterparts, an MOU was discussed regarding drought issues. And, yes, quite rightly, as the minister said, the old program of drought relief was changed in the way that he described. But the only other hard fact in that whole MOU—there was a heap of ideas and touchy-feely stuff and various things but only one hard fact—was that the government would not be the lender of last resort. That is fine, except at the same meeting it was discussed how the states and the Commonwealth would combine to make a reality the loans that the Commonwealth wants to make to agriculture around Australia.


My questions regarding those loans—they are totally at odds with that MOU statement, however we will take that one on notice ourselves—are: what are the trigger events that will make those loans a reality in the six states and one territory involved? With $60 million, or $30 million a year for two years, why would the Northern Territory, with something under 500 farmers in the whole Territory, have available to it the same amount of loans as New South Wales, shall we say, with somewhere between 35,000 and 40,000 farmers? Why should Tasmania, which is quite obviously the smallest state in Australia, have the same amount available to it as WA, which is quite obviously the biggest state in Australia? That is one question I would like answered: what was the idea behind that particular part of the policy or the loan?


I believe the interest rate has been set but not agreed to yet, at 4½ per cent. Knowing that the Commonwealth will probably borrow, at three per cent or a little more, the money that is going to them on loan, is there a policy about the Commonwealth covering every single cost—in other words, charging 1½ per cent or thereabouts more than the money will cost it? Is there going to be a reckoning on how that will be accounted, and have we got an agreement with any of the states as yet?

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-05,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (12:38):  From the outset, can I acknowledge to the minister, my electorate's appreciation of the announcement in the budget that there will be more rural financial counsellors. That is very important. I know that the member for Calare, the shadow minister, knows how important rural financial counsellors are in these difficult days. And I know you, too, Minister, would appreciate just what a valuable role they play in the bush to help not just farmers but other people who are struggling with rural debt. To help them get through that crisis in their lives is very important.


I would like to ask a couple of questions which might not be generally related to the appropriations, but will certainly affect the budget over the coming 12 months. Firstly, Minister, are you aware that skyrocketing electricity prices are forcing irrigators in the Riverina to turn back the clock and reinstall decades-old diesel pumps on their properties? On-farm power prices have jumped 17 per cent in the past year, in line with residential prices, and close to 80 per cent in the past five years. The Murrumbidgee High Security Irrigators Chief Executive Officer Brian Halse—I think you know him—was quoted in The Area News recently, saying:


Electricity is a huge issue for anyone pumping water and some locals are spending $60,000 or $80,000 a year just on power.


That really goes against the whole thought of carbon pricing that the minister's side of politics would certain push. It just does not make sense that they are using decades-old diesel pumps to get the water to where it is needed.


My other question, which, again, will have an impact on your budget bottom line, is your position on the foreign takeover of GrainCorp. There is, as you know, a significant bid by Archer Daniels Midland to take over the GrainCorp operations, which are so valuable to the wheat and grain growers in the eastern states. It is a significant issue. Certainly in my electorate I have many, many people who are desperately worried that we are going to lose port access and desperately worried that just the cost of getting grain to markets is going to be that much higher, especially with the running down over progressive years of railway lines by successive state governments of every persuasion, though certainly more Labor than coalition.


I would be very interested to know what your thoughts are as to whether the Treasurer should stop this takeover—whether he should say 'No'—because this is such a valuable asset, not just to the grain growers who are shareholders but, indeed, to Australians generally. We used to ride on the sheep's back, but at the same time we used to ride on our wheat and grain profits. But that is not the case any more. If ADM in fact takes over GrainCorp, that will have a significant deleterious effect on our valuable grain crops and on the profits of those annual harvests. I implore you, minister, to do whatever you can to stop this takeover. The Treasurer did nothing when the Spanish food giant Ebro threatened to take over SunRice. SunRice stayed in Australian hands after a very close vote. As you would be well aware, the profits from the rice harvests of the past two years have been such that the Coleambally mill has reopened, which meant many, many jobs to Riverina industry and that wonderful Riverina community.


I know that you are concerned about these issues. You have visited my electorate on a number of occasions and I appreciate that. I know you have spoken to locals in difficult times, but you have been prepared to be open. Whilst I certainly do not think the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has helped with many of my locals' certainty or lack thereof, I know they did appreciate the fact that you had the gumption to front them and explain your government's position. But I do ask you to respond to those two important issues: first of all, the use of diesel for irrigators to use their pumps and, secondly, ADM's potential takeover of GrainCorp.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (12:43):  I also thank the minister and government for the new financial counsellors. We have several in Tasmania and they will be, and already are, very much appreciated. Also appreciated is the money for Rural Alive and Well, an organisation that is looking after forest contractors through some of the changes taking place throughout that industry. The farm household allowance will be provided, I understand, from 1 July 2014 to farmers in hardship to replace the exceptional circumstances relief payment and transitional farm family payment. Farmers in Tasmania are on the front line against climate volatility. The national drought reform package is focused on preparing farmers before drought with tools and skills that they need to emerge from it, sustain their enterprises through dry times and help them to survive.


You know, Minister, because you have been there and you have visited my electorate, about some of irrigation schemes that we are putting in place. That will build some drought-proofing for us as well, but we need to develop the new direction for farming in Australia to look toward the dry times so that we can assist the enterprises that are there for the long haul to sustain themselves during those dry times.


We are investing in the future, putting jobs and economic growth first and protecting the important services that Australia relies on. Minister, could you advise if the states and territories have agreed to the drought policy? Why is this a fairer policy than the old one for the new direction in which we are going?

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (12:45):  I will give advance notice that when my time runs out I will be seeking the call again. I have a few issues to go through. But I think it has been helpful to allow the run of questions because some people wanted to touch on the same areas, so it has allowed me to incorporate those into my answer.


I will flag in particular for the benefit of the member for Riverina the two issues he raised. One arguably goes to either the minister for energy or the minister for climate change and is difficult to deal with in the context of the appropriations here. The second one, which was a reference to the Foreign Investment Review Board, is managed exclusively by the Treasury. I do not begrudge at all the opportunity that he has taken to put his views on the record but there is little in the context of this particular debate other than to say that the government supports investment in agriculture.


First I will deal with the concessional loans for farm businesses in the farm finance package, which have come up a couple times. Concessional loans will give farmers breathing space to focus on growing and improving their farm business. The government is working with the state and Northern Territory governments to make products available across the country via appropriate delivery agencies. We want to take a flexible approach when working with the states and territories to ensure the loans are directed appropriately and are best suited to the farmers in their jurisdiction. As of 29 May this year, since farm finance was announced on 27 April, the department has chaired four teleconferences with senior officials from each jurisdiction. The first was convened on 30 April, at the Commonwealth's request, to discuss the government's announcement.


In addition to these teleconferences there have been many direct discussions with officials, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. However, at this stage we have not resolved signing on to these loans with any of the states. We encourage them to do so. It has been one of the issues that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been raising in the context of challenges that Queensland graziers and pastoralists are facing at the moment.


Even if you were to accept, which the government does not, the arguments about national parks that are put forward by the Queensland government, opening up national parks deals with a small subset of stock levels in drought affected areas. There needs to be an approach which reaches to all of the people who have stock and who are in a situation of crisis. The loans are one of the tools to be able to do that.


On the issue of national parks, I am obviously aware—speaking on behalf of the minister for agriculture—that there have been calls for national parks in Queensland to be used for grazing for drought affected cattle. While the management of national parks in Queensland lies within their responsibility, many parks may have been established to protect matters of national environmental significance. Under Commonwealth environmental law, actions that have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance require approval.


The words here from the minister say 'from my colleague, Minister Burke' but that was obviously not prepared for me. It will sound weird if I start talking about discussions with myself. The minister I am representing has been talking to me about the question of grazing in national parks. But the administration of environmental law is exclusively one for the environment minister and one where the decisions for the environment minister have to be made strictly according to law, not according to the policy of the government. With that in mind, as I made clear here yesterday, the legal powers that were available under national environmental law to prevent cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park were largely there because there was a heritage decision in place. There is no such heritage decision in the Queensland areas. So the government policy thinks that the approach taken by the Queensland government is ill-advised and also inadequate in terms of the genuine crisis that many farmers are facing, and this carries through to some of the criticisms of farmers who have managed their stock levels very carefully and feel they have now been placed at a disadvantage while neighbours get free adjustment. Others have said, 'Well, it is one thing is there is feed, but if there is no water in these areas they are of limited utility.' We do not feel it is a comprehensive solution in a way, shape or form. It is not the way we approach national parks. Notwithstanding that, any actual intervention would depend on national environmental law, and the powers here are quite different to the powers as they stood in Victoria. (Extension of time granted)


A number of biosecurity issues were raised, in particular the issue of post-entry quarantine. In July 2012 the Commonwealth announced the site acquisition of a 144-hectare parcel of land in Mickleham, Victoria for the construction of a new post-entry quarantine facility. The new facility will consolidate existing animal and plant quarantine services in a single integrated site and will provide Australia with the newest and most advanced technology and operating practices available. The department continued to consult stakeholders during the development of concept designs for the new facility. The project was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in early 2013. The referral was a critical step in the delivery of the project. The Public Works Committee must approve the proposed works before construction of the facility can proceed. In terms of what progress has been made, in the budget the government announced funding of $379.9 million over seven years for construction and operation of the new facility for high-risk plant and animal inputs. This built on the government's announcement made in the 2011-12 budget when a commitment to fund further development of future post-entry arrangements was made which included detailed design work and procurement activities related to land acquisition along with funds for the maintenance and refurbishment of existing facilities.


Government operated facilities to manage high-risk imported animal and plant species are key component of our biosecurity system. A secure and efficient facility discourages smuggling and reduces biosecurity risk associated with the importation of new genetic material which is necessary for Australian agriculture to maintain competitiveness and productivity. I might add that the issue of whether or not our post-entry quarantine facilities are adequate and up to date has been a very pertinent one in Australia, particularly following the Callinan report into the outbreak of equine influenza. On that occasion where systems had collapsed and the operation of a quarantine facility was not up to scratch we ended up consequently with a number of deeply serious challenges that carried a very high cost. So to be establishing a new post-entry quarantine facility and making sure that the operation of it has a high level of stakeholder engagement is not just a good thing to do, it is actually quite essential to make sure that we are properly able to manage the biosecurity challenges in a country where one of our key strategic advantages is that, compared to other countries, there are many weeds, pests and diseases that we do not have, and we want to keep it that way. When something comes in that has not previously been here, we saw with equine influenza just how bad it can be.


I have covered the national parks issue for the member for Calare. We also had the issue that was raised elsewhere of the national drought reform program itself and the agreement for the states and territories to drought reform. This is something which has been going since 2007 when, in addition to the ministerial council, we started the ministerial forum with state and territory ministers, originally chaired by myself and now chaired by Minister Ludwig. We work together to try to see how we could eliminate the challenges that occurred with waiting for exceptional circumstances declarations and the injustice of lines on maps where you have two farmers side by side facing identical climate circumstances and identical challenges—one received a high level of assistance, the other received nothing.


The Gillard government is delivering on its commitment to reform drought programs. We are moving to a pro-active rather than a reactive system. We want to ensure farmers are able to prepare for challenges and manage risks. No longer will we have to wait until farmers are in crisis before assistance can be offered. This is about helping Australian farmers get back on their feet and prosper and succeed in the future, ultimately delivering a more productive agricultural sector. On 3 May this year the minister signed an agreement with the states and the Northern Territory to formalise National Drought Program Reform. This package focusing on risk management and preparedness includes the Farm Household Allowance, which provides case managers to support farm families as they make decisions about their future. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme and taxation measures including the enhancements to the deposit scheme—announced as part of Farm Finance—a national approach to farm business training, a coordinated and collaborative approach to the provision of social support services, tools and technologies to inform farmer decision making. The agreement outlines the roles and responsibilities for each government in implementing the package from 1 July 2014. The agreement also includes a framework that will guide government decisions to increase or introduce support when conditions are declining while still meeting the reform objectives.


A number of members raised the Rural Financial Counselling Service and I thank them for doing so. The Rural Financial Counselling Service program continues to provide free and confidential financial counselling services to farmers, fishers and small businesses who are in financial difficulty and need support to manage the challenges of change and adjustment. Rural financial counsellors are well placed to refer clients to GPs and other government and non-government service providers. The Australian government has announced additional funding for the service for two financial years to 30 June 2015. An amount of $5.9 million will provide 17 additional full-time equivalent rural financial counsellors. Until implementation of the new Farm Household Allowance on 1 July 2014, the government is continuing to provide the Transitional Farm Family Payment. Farming families can apply for up to 12 months' household support paid at the same rate as Newstart and the Transitional Farm Family Payment is available to eligible farmers regardless of location or the reason they are experiencing financial hardship.


For those issues, we have the breakdown of most of what has been covered. I might sit down so that the shadow minister has an opportunity to put a couple of extra things on the record.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (12:59):  I will take those issues on in good faith. The shadow minister raised very serious issues relating to SPC. There is good reason the agriculture minister acted quickly in referring them to the trade minister and making him aware of those. The level of concern is there.


Some extra information has arrived. The company wrote to the Prime Minister on 29 April requesting that the government impose safeguard measures in the form of increased tariffs on retail sized canned tomato and multiserve fruit products. The department has reviewed the request to determine whether there is a possible case to impose provisional and/or full safeguard measures. It was on the basis of that review that the agricultural minister referred the issue to the minister for trade and to the Treasurer. I understand that the minister for trade and the Treasurer will consider the agriculture minister's recommendation in consultation with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation. The government will work to make its decision on this matter as quickly as possible. If it is determined that a possible case for safeguard measures exists the government would refer the request to a competent authority, currently the Productivity Commission, to conduct an investigation in accordance with WTO rules. The competent authority would recommend whether measures should be imposed.


I am mindful of the time. What I would like to do on the remaining issues is suggest that the minister's office will be in direct contact with the shadow minister's office to work out the appropriate form of providing answers to those questions, whether it be in writing, through me or through the Notice Paper. I will ask the minister's office to make contact with the shadow minister as soon as possible.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:14):  Through the 2013-14 appropriation bills the government will provide the portfolio with $7 billion to deliver its priorities. This includes $6.8 billion directly to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, of which $5.1 billion is an equity injection into NBN Co. It also includes $1.1 billion through the department to the ABC; $273.8 million through the department to the SBS; $111.6 million to the Australian Communications and Media Authority; and $90.4 million to the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency.


The government is providing over $178 million in new funding to the portfolio for a range of measures. This includes $50 million to the department for a range of important programs, including $26.6 million over five years to assist free-to-air television broadcasters to relocate their digital television services to new television channels; $12.9 million for expanding the Digital Enterprise and Digital Local Government programs; $2.5 million to extend the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme for a further year; and $5.4 million over five years to assist the production and transmission of community radio.


The federal Labor government is very proud of our support of the public broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS. They provide a vital service to the nation. As the regional development minister can I say that the role that the ABC play in regional Australia cannot be underestimated in terms of providing a service to the community, particularly at times when information on natural disasters is important to be transmitted in real time. In addition to the continuing base funding of $2.5 billion over three years, $182 million will be provided to the ABC for new measures, including a loan to assist in the construction of a purpose-built facility at Southbank in Melbourne; funding to enable the expansion of ABC news and current affairs; funds to enable it to meet growing audience demand for its digital media services; and funding to produce documentaries commemorating the Anzac Centenary.


In addition to the continuation of its base funding of $569 million over three years for SBS, $20 million will be provided to the SBS to enable it to build on the success of its digital initiatives. I note that the SBS has recently expanded some of its language services to facilitate access to some of the newer communities that have arrived in Australia in recent times. I congratulate them and the leadership that they show in the community in promoting inclusiveness as an essential element of the success of multicultural Australia.


The 2013-14 budget also provides additional funding to the ACMA. This includes $10.5 million for the high-frequency direction finding upgrade to continue support the high-frequency bands used by the aviation, maritime, defence and emergency services communities, as well as $6 million to continue its revenue assurance project.


This budget also includes a $5.1 billion equity injection to NBN Co. The budget papers reconfirm the total equity contribution to NBN Co. will be $30.4 billion. The National Broadband Network is the largest infrastructure project in our nation's history. The NBN is about transforming telecommunications and the economy by investing in the infrastructure that we need now and that we will also need for the future. This is critical infrastructure that our country needs for the 21st century.


Only this Labor government will make the smart investments that Australia needs for our future. The National Broadband Network, along with the National Plan for School Improvement, DisabilityCare Australia and the Nation Building Program are all important parts of this. Our funding announced in the 2013-14 budget for the Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy portfolio will encourage a vibrant, sustainable and internationally competitive digital economy in Australia.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:20):  I have a number of matters to raise with the minister. I am going to deal first with the issue of asbestos, as that seems to be in the forefront of attention at the moment. In the spirit of seeking some enlightenment—light as opposed to heat—I invite the minister to respond substantively, if he can; if he cannot answer substantively, then he should say so, rather than giving a sort of ad hominem spray, which is what we had from his counterpart Mr Shorten. This is the issue I want to seek the minister's views on. We know that the received wisdom, official wisdom, on asbestos is—and I am quoting now from the code of practice How to Manage and Control Asbestos in the Workplace, at page 17. It says here:


If asbestos or ACM—


asbestos-containing material—


is in good condition and left undisturbed, it is unlikely that airborne asbestos will be released into the air and the risk to health is extremely low. It is usually safer to leave it and review its condition over time. However, if the asbestos or ACM has deteriorated, has been disturbed, or if asbestos-contaminated dust is present, the likelihood that airborne asbestos will be released into the air is increased.


This is consistent across all the official material on dealing with asbestos.


It was from a similar official publication, the Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos, that Telstra quoted in writing to Mr Shorten as the MP for Maribyrnong in 2009, when they said that the removal of asbestos-containing materials can potentially expose workers and others to higher levels of fibre than leaving the material in situ. Telstra's approach has been not to seek to replace asbestos-containing material unless the pit is disturbed for whatever reason. Of course, what we have seen with the advent of the NBN's deal with Telstra in 2011 is very widespread disturbance and hence a much bigger asbestos management problem than was the case back in 2009. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made it clear now that, despite the interest he evinced in 2009, he did not raise his concerns about this with either the communications minister or NBN and Telstra in 2011 or 2012.


I want to know from the minister whether it is the government's view—and this is simply to get some clarity on this—that the official standards should be changed or are mistaken and whether Telstra's practice is no longer valid in the sense of not seeking to replace intact undisturbed asbestos-containing material which is in situ—that is to say, buried under the ground—and only to replace it when it is being disturbed. Of course, as the minister knows, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the Telstra pits are being replaced because they are too small for the NBN's purposes.


This is an important point because there is a lot of undisturbed asbestos-containing material in the Telstra network that will not be disturbed even with the NBN, and of course there is an even vaster amount of asbestos-containing material in people's houses and garages and schools and hospitals that is intact and undisturbed. The question is: given the remarks that the workplace relations minister has made, is the government's view that there should be, as Mr Shorten recommended in 2009, proactive material of otherwise stable, undisturbed, intact asbestos-containing material?


If that were to be the government's approach, that is a very significant change of policy, and there is a lack of clarity at the moment as to whether there is now a change of policy on dealing with asbestos-containing material.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (17:25):  I have a question, Minister. It is to do with the record funding for the ABC and SBS, but I have a statement that I want to make about it first. The ABC and SBS are two of Australia's most important and trusted cultural institutions. The government is proud of its track record in supporting the national broadcasters, and it is a track record built upon the recent budget and the triennial funding announcement.


The government will provide the ABC with $89.4 million in additional funding over the next three years to expand news and current affairs services and for digital delivery of ABC programs. The government is also providing the ABC with a loan of $90 million over three years so it can consolidate the majority of its Melbourne based operations at its Southbank site. This will allow the ABC to achieve operational savings while continuing to deliver high-quality broadcast content. In addition to new funding announced in the budget, the ABC will receive $2.5 billion over three years in ongoing base funding from 2013-14. That base funding is important.


The SBS will receive $20 million in new funding over the next triennium to build on the success of its digital initiatives and to continue to develop its programming and services to reflect and promote multicultural and Indigenous Australia. The new funding is in addition to the $158.1 million over five years provided as part of the 2012-13 budget to ensure that SBS remains a vibrant and dynamic national broadcaster.


Both the ABC and SBS will continue to be exempt from the efficiency dividend, and I will say more about that.


In the last triennial funding round in 2009, the Labor government provided the ABC with the largest increase in its operational base funding since 1983. I remember the ABC out lobbying too at that time and walking around the halls of parliament, and I also remember that I wrote a letter about that to the minister, lobbying on it. I was at that stage the only MP who had written a letter on it. Then I led the charge to make sure that all the other MPs did that as well, and that was across the parliament.


The funding provided in 2012-13 represented the most significant funding boost SBS has ever had. This is in stark contrast to the previous government, whose first budget stripped $55 million per year from the ABC's base funding, crippling the national broadcaster's ability to keep pace with the changing media environment.


Can I say that I get a bit tired of the whole debate about the ABC: 'Is it biased or is it not?' I am sure every MP in here has an experience and a view. I do get a bit fed up with that, particularly from the coalition. The honourable member for Wentworth is fond of asserting that the public broadcasters have no greater friend than him.




Mr Turnbull:
  I don't think I've said that, but it's probably a fair comment.




Ms SAFFIN:
  The honourable member for Wentworth has said words to that effect. I was maybe putting it more eloquently than the honourable member might have. But it was only last week that the honourable member for Wentworth was refusing to rule out slashing the budgets of the national broadcasters under a coalition government. When it comes to the national broadcasters—



An honourable member interjecting—




Ms SAFFIN:
  yes, I tell you, yes—the coalition cannot be trusted. A friend would be saying: 'Funding won't be slashed. Funding is secure, and I agree to no efficiency dividend.'


But this new funding that I have talked about ensures that the ABC and SBS can continue to build on the extensive range of services they provide to their audiences, especially the growing demand for their innovative digital services. The national broadcasters provide a range of programs, news and information across television, radio and digital platforms accessed by millions of Australians every day. In a changing media environment they are more important than ever as a source of news and current affairs, local content and telling stories.


I have seen a quote from the honourable member for Wentworth, which reads as follows:


But if there is a broader austerity of some kind across the board then all departments may have to bear some of the pain.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:30):  Firstly, I thank the member for Page for her contribution and for her ongoing support of ABC and SBS. I am not surprised that a regional member feels so strongly about the role that these fine national institutions play in our lives, making a huge difference whether it be through television, radio or new media opportunities that both of these institutions are engaged in.


With regard to the record funding for ABC and SBS, the government is proud of the support that we have given. It has also been given, might I say, from some other portfolios. My portfolio of infrastructure has, for example, assisted in building the new headquarters of the ABC in Brisbane. People would be aware of issues raised about the health of staff at the former ABC headquarters. The new structure stands on the banks of the Brisbane River.


I went to the opening of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. The ABC does play that important cultural role in our cities and our regions. One thing that orchestra have been doing, as do other institutions associated with our public broadcasters, is bring cultural activities to regional communities. They certainly play a fine role there.


The government is absolutely committed to this funding. We are committed to the independence as well of the ABC and SBS, unlike the former government that stacked the boards with right-wing ideologues. We have ensured that there is a professionalism brought to the appointment of the boards and to those institutions.


In response to the shadow minister's questions that were raised, the issue of asbestos is indeed one that has haunted communities since the dangers of asbestos became clear. It must be said that the dangers were apparent to executives in companies such as James Hardie a long time before they were prepared to fess up to the consequences of this deadly product for which they were prepared to put profit before the lives of those people who worked with the product and those people who just lived in communities. Indeed, it is the case that where building work for infrastructure takes place in cities such as Sydney there needs to be absolute care to ensure that the workers are protected and also that communities are unaffected where this work is taking place.


I know that when a refurbishment of an oval in my electorate was taking place, they found a lot of asbestos had literally just been buried beneath the oval—covered over with dirt as if the problem would just go away. This is something that does need to be above politics. The member for Wentworth is clearly genuine in his concerns about these issues; these issues are serious but they are not new. We know that claims, for example, that legacy infrastructure with asbestos will not be disturbed under the coalition's plan is not true. That is why these claims are now being refuted by industry experts. We need to make sure that this work occurs in an appropriate way. There is no way to avoid interacting with asbestos when you are working on Australia's fixed telecommunications network. The member for Wentworth cannot avoid dealing with asbestos if he is ever in a position to build his fibre to the node system which would consist of some 70,000 nodes at least. As independent telecommunications consultant and safety expert Fernando Calero told the Financial Review:


… rolling out fibre-to-the-node technology still requires some modification of pits and pipes between Telstra exchanges and street corners, as well as those pipes connecting Telstra exchanges.


Mr Calero also said:


A lot of the inter-exchange stuff is asbestos. … Many of the main trunks are asbestos.


It is a fact that when this work takes place every care must be taken and Telstra has accepted responsibility for doing just that.


We know indeed that this is not a new issue. We know that in 2001 Telstra wanted to create an independent body to fast-track compensation payments to employees exposed to asbestos. They sought approval from the then Department of Workplace Relations, but they got knocked back. The then Minister for Workplace Relations was the current Leader of the Opposition. So, the opposition leader knew about those issues as far back as 2001, when Telstra made a clear approach to the department. In 2005 it was raised again. In September 2005 a question on notice was asked of Minister McGauran representing the then communications minister Senator Coonan about Telstra's use of asbestos. The minister provided an answer in February 2006 that explained Telstra's use of asbestos in pits, ducts and exchanges and the possibility of exposure. This has been an issue that has been around for a long time. This is an issue that requires every care.


I had the great honour of being a patron of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation prior to being elected as a member of the House of Representatives and afterwards as a backbench member through my association with Barry Robson, a great Australian, and the great Bernie Banton—as heroic an Australian as anyone could meet. He was courageous until the end, fighting and campaigning not for himself but for justice for other Australians. I believe that we need to ensure that every respect is given to people such as Bernie Banton for the role he has played in fighting companies that did hid what they were doing—companies like James Hardie and CSR, which some prominent people on the opposite side see fit to defend in cases against victims of asbestos. I have found some of the politicking in the last week or so a bit galling, frankly, given the history of these issues. Of these issues, I would say that Telstra—just like any other company or organisation engaged in activity that is likely to disturb asbestos—needs to take every care possible.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:40):  I am very disappointed that despite my generosity in encouraging the minister to speak for twice as long, he was unable to answer the question—nor would the minister for workplace relations answer it. The question was this: is the government saying that undisturbed, intact, non-friable asbestos-containing material should not be left in situ—as is the practice at Telstra; as indeed is contemplated in the national codes—but rather should be proactively removed, notwithstanding that this carries, as the national code I read from earlier, risks of contamination?


This is a very serious point. That is why I said at the outset that I do not want to have a slanging match with the minister opposite. I do not want to get into ancient history. I want to get some clarity on this very important point. I will leave that with the minister. I would just respond to the honourable member from the north coast.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We are here to consider the expenditure of the relevant department.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  All right. I should have called a point of order. I have no right to reply there; fair enough. I now want to turn to the rollout of the NBN. I want to ask the minister whether he is concerned and what he is going to do about the failure of the NBN to meet its rollout targets. It was originally forecast, in late 2010, to pass 950,000 brownfield premises by 30 June this year. In August 2012 that was scaled back to 286,000 premises—a massive reduction. As of the end of March, that was scaled back again to somewhere between 155,000 and 175,000 premises to be passed. As of mid May, so we have been told, they have only passed just over 70,000 premises.


The big issue here is whether there is a flaw in the construction model and whether this project is genuinely scalable in the manner contemplated in the corporate plan. We are being told directly—through the media and elsewhere—that contractors are not making a living out of this work. I was talking to a contractor today who said to me that his rate to excavate, remove and dispose of a Telstra pit made of asbestos-containing material was $78. He said he cannot make a living out of that. He said his rate for putting in a new, large, plastic pit and setting it all up—buying the pit, labour, materials and everything else—was $295. This is a very relevant issue. Is the reason the project is running so slowly the fact that the contractors are not making a quid out of it?


The challenge is that at the moment the NBN Co. is passing 353 houses a working day, in this half year. That is the current rate. They should have been passing over a thousand. Their plan calls for them next year to be passing 10 times that number. Every time the NBN Co. has missed a target—and this is a fact, this is not conjecture—it asserts that the ramp-up is going to be even steeper. I ask the minister whether the government is satisfied with the rollout so far and what measures he believes the government and the NBN Co. should take to enable it to get closer to meeting the targets in its corporate plan?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:45):  Can I say that the most certain way of slowing the progress of the NBN would be to stop building it. That is what those opposite have in mind with their inferior, slower, alternative plan that is not of course the NBN. They have realised that the NBN is quite popular, so they are now pretending that they are going to keep it. It will cost just about as much, but for a far inferior product in which they have acknowledged would need to be upgraded before they have even started. I think it is right to actually get the infrastructure right first-up. If this mob were in charge of the Sydney Harbour Bridge it would have had one lane both ways. It is absurd.


From time to time the member for Wentworth says it is going too slow, but this week his Senate leader, the esteemed Senator Abetz, had this to say on 3 June:


… the reason that these talks need to be held is that there has been this indecent haste with the rollout of NBN.


It is going too slow, according to the member for Wentworth, but his Senate leader says it is going too fast. The fact is the rollout of the NBN is happening in every state and territory across the country. So far this year new areas switched on include Gungahlin, Toowoomba, Coffs Harbour, Bacchus Marsh, Hobart, Gosford, Blacktown and Townsville. There are well over 50,000 NBN services live across Australia, providing enhanced broadband to homes, businesses and schools, and NBN's take-up rates are world records. We also have fixed wireless NBN services being provided from 69 sites, including Ballarat, Darwin, Geraldton, Toowoomba, Tamworth and many other areas. Construction has commenced at over 115 additional sites and, overall, more than 770 sites have received planning approvals.


This is a project which common sense tells you, as it ramps-up, it is possible to do it faster and faster. It is logical that the initial stages of the rollout of the NBN would be slower than the middle stages and the middle stages would be slower than the final stages. That is the way that infrastructure happens. Whether it be the NBN or the building of a road or a new rail line. If you look at the regional rail network in Victoria, which is in my portfolio, you will see that we are now expending over $100 million every month on what is the largest infrastructure commitment to public transport that any Australian government has given to any project. It ramps-up with huge benefits for Melbourne but also, importantly, for Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. We on this side of the House understand infrastructure and the way that it develops. We understand that you need to get it right the first time. We understand that you need to be committed to put that investment in and that you get a return on that investment. Indeed, the NBN will deliver a return, not just an economic return but a social return as well because of the benefits it will bring to the provision of education and health services, because of the opportunity that will be created, particularly in regional Australia, at overcoming the tyranny of distance that has been a disadvantage for people in regional Australia, compared with their counterparts in CBD electorates, or the distance of Australia from the rest of the world. This is a very important project. The rollout is proceeding. The only threat to the rollout is the failure to re-elect the Labor government in September.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (17:50):  I am very pleased to be able to make some inquiries this afternoon about the broadband, communications and digital economy portfolio. I certainly commend the very fine work that is being done by both the minister here today and his colleague in the other place in relation to the rollout and the governance of the NBN. I know that it is met with very sincere enthusiasm in the part of the world that I represent. Indeed, one of the universities that is in my electorate has already talked to me about ways in which they might be able to take the opportunity advanced by the NBN to develop some telehealth, some medical applications, for the NBN and to pursue opportunities there in conjunction with other organisations. It is very welcome in educational institutions. I know that it is certainly welcome by small businesses and large businesses alike and, indeed, by residents in my part of the world.


NBN Co. is set to roll out fairly soon in Boronia and in and around the basin, at the northern end of my electorate and, at the same time, in the greenfield sites in the southern end of my electorate—the growth corridor. It is being very well received and there is much anticipation of the rollout in those areas, as there is across the Dandenong Ranges. Residents regularly report to me about the unreliability of the copper network. They appreciate all too readily its flaws. I know that the member for Wentworth would be aware of this, because he has been in my part of the world with the former member for La Trobe in recent weeks, admittedly to a fairly select audience there, but he certainly did come along. So I am sure he is familiar with the interest in the NBN's roll out to homes and businesses—not to somewhere down the street but right to people's doors. This is so that they can use the NBN for the transformative purpose that it was intended to have, such as for social use by people who might be isolated in the more remote parts of my electorate. It will be very beneficial for not only a lot of elderly residents who have taken an interest in our Broadband for Seniors program but, needless to say, also business applications.


I was recently at a forum which the Emerald small business group held with the Assistant Treasurer. I can certainly say that there was much interest in the NBN's application for business, particularly in that part of my electorate which is effectively on the urban rural fringe of Melbourne. I guess you might call it a peri-urban area. For people who may have to travel quite long distances to transact business, when the NBN is rolled out to that area it will be extremely beneficial, and there was much interest in it. Likewise, I have mentioned medical use and, of course, educational use for the NBN. Clearly, a great deal of work has been done right across government, not simply in this portfolio but in the health portfolio and the education portfolio to establish the NBN and to contemplate its applications immediately as it rolls out and into the future.


In light of this, I am particularly interested to ask about one transformative way in which the NBN might be best used by businesses, small and large, and that is in the context of cloud computing. Business operators are certainly acutely aware of the benefits that are presented to them by cloud computing, which enables them to have the potential to access quite powerful IT infrastructure without necessarily having to own it and operate it on site. It is a flexible means by which businesses and others can gain the benefits of the NBN network.


Today's internet, as all of us know, increasingly involves two-way communications through an interactive environment. Regrettably, those opposite routinely forget about the importance of upload speeds or upload capacity. Happily, we have not forgotten that. We are alive to it in the context of cloud computing. It is really unfortunate that those opposite have not seen the potential for cloud computing to advance business or the NBN as a means to advance business—those whom they purport so regularly to speak on behalf of.


My question today in light of all of this and in light of my evidently keen interest in the NBN is: are there particular ways through the budget and otherwise that the minister can advise about the application of cloud computing and how it can be advanced by the NBN?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:54):  I thank the member for La Trobe for her ongoing interest in the NBN and her conveying of the interest of her local business community. I of course have had the pleasure of visiting the fine electorate of La Trobe, including to a community cabinet meeting where we had discussions with local business leaders about the capacity for the NBN to allow an area which is on the urban fringes of the great city of Melbourne to engage and compete in real time and not have to be located in the CBD. That has other advantages as well in terms of transport and transforming the lifestyles of people who live in such a magnificent electorate, which has lots of open space and a lot of attractiveness to it. The areas on the outskirts of our cities have had the disadvantage of distance, and one of the things that the NBN does is make it very possible for businesses to locate and compete in a real sense, because the physical location is not as important and, of course, there are all the applications that the member speaks about, particularly in terms of medical technology.


It is indeed a tragedy that in some of the debate from those opposite they have comprehensively failed to understand the importance of upload speeds and the importance of transformative technologies like Cloud computing. The sorts of comments that you see from time to time about the NBN just being about downloading movies faster than is possible in other areas is an example of that. I genuinely felt a great deal of sympathy for the member for Wentworth when he was standing in Fox Studios and the Sonny Bill Williams image appeared and there was the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'That is computer generated, isn't it?' as if he had woken up to the fact that he had not just appeared in Fox Studios as an apparition as a result of some sort of Dr Who TARDIS type system. That says a lot about their failure to understand why this transformative policy is so important.


It will also revolutionise access to the Cloud. We are no longer living in a broadcast world. Today's internet is increasingly a two-way, thoroughly interactive environment. Cloud computing facilitates this new world by enabling access to powerful IT infrastructure without the need to own and operate it on site. Unlike those opposite, we are getting on with the job of building broadcast infrastructure to support technologies like Cloud for all Australians and the potential of this technology into the future.


For someone with a 12-year-old who is much more technologically competent than his father—and that is a familiar experience—opening up the world to young people means that part of what the NBN debate is about is embracing the future and not being scared or intimidated by it. It is about embracing the opportunities that it will bring. It is a democratic mechanism, which is very important in terms of participation in that two-way interactive environment of the future. So I thank the member for La Trobe, and I certainly look forward to the opportunities of the future as facilitated by the rollout of the NBN.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:59):  The minister in his day job, of course, is the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and is responsible for Infrastructure Australia. I want to ask him whether he regrets the government breaking its election pledge in 2007 to refer any major infrastructure investment by the Commonwealth to Infrastructure Australia for a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. This, of course, was not the case with the NBN, the largest infrastructure project in our history, where no such analysis, no such homework, was done.


I draw the minister's attention to his attempt to compare the rollout of the NBN with a road. He gives the impression that he is more familiar with roads than he is with telecom networks. But the point is not that the rollout is slower at the beginning than it is at the middle and the end; the point is that the rollout is so far behind the NBN Co.'s own corporate plan. It is the NBN not failing anybody else's standards but failing its own standards. In that context, I want to draw his attention to a report today in The Australian Financial Review which sets out, as has been acknowledged by the NBN Co., that not only are they going to miss their rollout figures for the fixed line fibre-to-the-premise network in brownfield sites by a very large margin, as I mentioned earlier, but they are also going to miss by a very large margin, around 50 per cent, the target for fixed wireless, which is the technology to be used for four per cent of the overall footprint.


I want to see what the minister's view is on the NBN Co.'s explanation for this. The NBN Co.'s chief executive said to a Senate committee last week that the problem with the wireless rollout was due to large trees. I wonder if the minister could reflect on whether a cost-benefit analysis would have identified the fact that in regional Australia there are quite a lot of trees, large and small. It does seem curious that the presence of trees, large trees, would come as a shock to the NBN Co. and that it had not been anticipated. The other reason to which the chief executive of the NBN Co. attributed this huge failure to meet their target was inaccurate address information, which I gather means that they could not find their customers. This seems to be an extraordinary failure, and I wonder whether the minister's normal cheerful equanimity will be disturbed by the revelation that the NBN Co. failed to anticipate that there were large trees in Australia, some or all of them containing koalas, no doubt, and that the NBN Co., in addition to that, has failed to be able to find its customers.



A government member interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The honourable member says it is rubbish. I am just quoting what they have said.


The other matter that he might turn his mind to is this point. I seek to get his views on this question of asbestos and fibre to the node by just drawing to his attention the fact that the whole point of a fibre-to-the-node rollout, the justification for it, is that it involves much less civil works. The minister would know that 80 per cent of the cost of a telecom rollout, if not more, is in the civil works. The electronics and the cables are actually a relatively small part of it, even though they are the most obviously ingenious and brilliant. So, by definition, a fibre-to-the-node rollout, while it does not exclude exposure to asbestos-containing materials entirely—and no-one has suggested that it does, least of all me—does of necessity mean that the infrastructure between the street cabinet and the customer's premise is not being disturbed in the way it is with a fibre-to-the-premise rollout. That is why there is not the need to dig up and replace millions of Telstra pits and thousands of kilometres of Telstra ducts and pipes. I just want to draw that to the minister's attention and see if that would cause him to review his opinion.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:04):  I would also like to ask the minister about the National Broadband Network and how, under Labor's National Broadband Network every home and business will be able to connect to the NBN by 2021, and some areas sooner than others such as mine and the member for Chifley's. I understand that 11.8 million premises will be directly connect by fibre.


I also note that the coalition has a document which proposes to connect only 2.8 million premises directly to fibre, mostly premises in new developments, and that will mean that there will be nine million Australian households and businesses that would disconnected from Labor's NBN unless they pay up to $5,000 for it, leading to some quite perverse results, including, as I know you are aware, minister, and reported in the Blacktown Advocate on 22 April that:


Blacktown will become a city of broadband haves and have nots under the coalition's watered-down version of the National Broadband Network.


I also note that National Party policy 2012-13 states as follows:


The Nationals' policy is to place a priority on rolling out fibre optic cable to the majority of consumers in regional Australia first.


The NBN, as I know you are aware, minister, will deliver fibre to the home to 70 per cent of regional premises, which I know the member for Page would be very interested in as well. I note that the Nationals' Senator Joyce said in 2009 that the National Broadband Network is 'truly the Nationals' broadband network' as it has been 'lifted', according to Senator Joyce, straight from the Page Research Centre's position paper in 2005 into telecommunications. The senator said, 'How could we disagree with something that is quite evidently our idea?'


As you may be aware, minister, the National Party appears to have rejected that now think that regional Australia can make do with a fibre-to-the-node model. I also draw attention to the coalition's document which states that nine million premises will be served what former senator Nick Minchin described in 2009 as 75,000 'large equipment cabinets' similar in size to large refrigerators connected to mains power, including fans or air conditioners. I did not say this, the then Senator Minchin said: 'I do not think anybody would really want one of these large cabinets outside their home'.


Minister, you may also have seen and been aware of what Senator Nash has said about the coalition's plan and what it would mean for regional Australia. In 2007 she said:


The people of rural and regional Australia know a furphy when they see one. It is widely understood in the telecommunications industry that FTTN will not deliver improved broadband speeds for rural and regional areas.


The senator also said about fibre to the node, 'It is a furphy. It is fraudulent.'. Senator Nash said:


In spruiking their flawed fibre-to-the-node plan Labor are doing one of two things: they are either deluding themselves and at the same time the Australian public if they think FTTN will deliver high-speed broadband to rural and regional areas, or they are being deliberately deceitful and are trying to trick the public into supporting a plan they know is flawed.


I also note Senator Boswell said: 'Fibre to the node just will not work in rural and regional Australia'. And while on the subject of rural and regional Australia, as an aside, minister, you may also be aware of the principle in Labor's NBN of wholesale equivalent of pricing, whereas the alternative document proposes to get rid of this and exacerbate the digital divide not only on accessibility but also affordability as between regional and metropolitan areas. I also note former BT CTO Peter Cochrane said, 'fibre to the cabinet is one of the biggest mistakes humanity has made'.


As I said in parliament yesterday, statistics have shown that Labor's NBN, prior to the coalition releasing its alternative, had the support of 73 per cent of Australians. That figure actually went up afterwards to be 78 per cent support from people compared to the alternative. So my question, minister, is: what are the benefits of rolling out fibre to 11.8 million homes and businesses in Australia?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (18:09):  I thank the members for their contributions. Firstly, to the member for Wentworth who mentioned Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia was established very proudly by this government. When they produced their first report to COAG in May 2009, they identified progress moving forward of what would be required to truly develop economic productivity through nation-building infrastructure. Table 2 identifies infrastructure priorities under seven themes. Theme 1 is a National Broadband Network.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  they then went on to speak about developing a more extensive, accessible and globally competitive broadband system. 'Infrastructure Australia supports an investment from the Building Australia Fund to develop the National Broadband Network.' This mob opposite have gone around and promised funding for infrastructure projects on the back of an envelope before there is any analysis whatsoever—




Mr Turnbull:
  As opposed to the back of a beer coaster.




Mr ALBANESE:
  As opposed to the Infrastructure Australia system whereby 15 out of 15 projects have been funded, including four projects in the last budget that we are dealing with in these appropriations for additional projects—two of which, the Melbourne metro project and the cross river rail project, in spite of Infrastructure Australia's recommendations and support, and in spite of the fact that negotiations had concluded with both the respective state governments. Under pressure from the federal opposition, they have walked away from this. In Brisbane we know, as a result of the state government failing to support its own proposal for the cross river rail project, they are now proposing that they will rip out the seats from the trains so people will have to stand up on the trains. That is the alternative infrastructure vision of those opposite.


I am asked by the member for Greenway about a range of issues with regard to the digital divide. The great advantage of the NBN is overcoming regional disadvantage and disadvantage between people who live in different parts of our capital cities. What the NBN has done in places like Blacktown, where it has been rolled out in the electorates of Greenway and Chifley, is provide economic opportunity. If those opposite have their way, as has been identified, some people in the community will have the NBN and some people will not. They will have a second-rate system. That is of enormous regret.


What is extraordinary is the National Party rolling over on the issue of wholesale pricing equivalent—a principle which says that whether you live in Burnie, Ballarat, Marrickville or Vaucluse, you pay the same amount which is something that is absolutely essential to equity in the system. Those opposite have not done that. I note that it was a National Party member who came up with 'fraudband'. I say very clearly that the shadow minister for 'fraudband' and the copper economy should be embarrassed by his party's position, because to have fibre to some and copper to others after it goes through what the member for Wentworth says is a bar fridge on the corner of particular streets is just extraordinary. He acknowledges it is essentially a fridge-like large structure which will appear all over the suburbs. Every single one of those fridges will be a symbol of the backward nature of those who want to keep us in the copper age rather than the fibre age.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:15):  The 2013-14 budget continues the government's strong investment in regional Australia and its commitment to working in partnership with regional economies in transition and to helping develop creative solutions to those regions—to support better economic, social and environmental outcomes across all of those regional communities. This budget invests record amounts in community-driven investment. In the budget we have built on our existing commitment to regional Australia, through the Regional Development Australia Fund, to finance very important infrastructure projects that address the specific economic and community needs of all of our regions.


From the first two rounds, we have invested some $350 million to leverage projects already worth $1.2 billion across the community. Already 75 projects are under way ensuring people living in rural and regional Australia are getting the services and support that they need, supporting the improvement and construction of regional infrastructure, community sporting and youth associations and cultural projects across regional Australian communities.


We have been strengthening governance, improving infrastructure and supporting economic development in Australia's Indian Ocean territories, committing to Norfolk Island reform, meeting the operating deficit of the Norfolk Island government but at the same time strengthening governance and improving services for the benefit of the island's economy and its residents, particularly in the area of apprenticeships and child protection. They are two very important areas of the island and are in desperate need. We have also been extending the operation of the Reconstruction Inspectorate and the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce to ensure that every cent of our flood-rebuilding package goes where it is needed and helps flood-affected communities to rebuild their roads, bridges, rail lines and public facilities so that they can get their lives back on track.


In the budget we are also contributing to the future economic development of North Queensland and supporting activities that enhance Indigenous and community engagement to facilitate the opportunities that are available under the Australia in the Asian century white paper. It is important also as part of this budget that we recognise the important role that local government plays across this country. The budget includes funding, as we have been debating, to conduct a referendum on the financial recognition of local government in the Australian constitution. That referendum will be held on the same date as the 2013 election and $10 million has been funded for a national civics campaign and education campaign, which is to provide information to the general public about the referendum. It is some time since we have had a referendum. There are generations of kids who have not had exposure to what that means and they will be voting for the first time, so the civics education campaign is very important.


The 2013 budget also includes a $25 million package to create jobs and encourage a generation of arts and creative businesses. The minister here will talk a little more about that. There is also additional funding being provided in the sports portfolio. We want to continue the very successful, Active After-school Communities program. It is a terrific program that has been doing great work in small and large schools across the country. The program is extended for one calendar year until December 2014. The program also supports around 2,000 primary schools and 1,200 out-of-school care services to provide quality sport programs.


The budget also increases the intelligence, investigative and results-management capabilities of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority and it enhances the National Integrity of Sport Unit's ability to assess and respond to information about drugs and corruption in sport. Our commitment in this budget to regional Australia and its long-term economic and social sustainability is strong. It is something that members on this side of the House have felt very passionately about for a long time and I am very pleased that in this budget we continue that commitment to regional Australia. The portfolio continues to look forward to strengthening those relationships across Australia, particularly through our involvement with regional development through our RDA network; local government, importantly, to get those linkages between the RDA network and local government right; services to the territories; and arts and sport—that is part of our portfolio—to drive even stronger regional growth and a more sustainable nation to capitalise in particular on the opportunities of the Asian century. I welcome questions.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:20):  It is a pity the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government is not with us; otherwise, I would be referring the minister to program 1.1 of his department's PBS and asking the minister to explain where this funding, which is supposed to be for regional Australia, is being spent. Does the minister agree with his predecessor that regional Australia is all of Australia? Is the minister aware of the definition of 'regional Australia' used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics? Does his department use this definition when meeting the objectives listed under program 1.1? How did the minister's department come to define 'regional Australia' as it does; was it a ministerial decision? Will the minister confirm that the largest regional infrastructure project that Labor has funded is the $480 million investment in roads around Perth Airport? Last time I checked, Perth was a capital city. So does the minister consider Perth to be part of regional Australia?


I refer the minister to the Sydney Multicultural Arts and Sports Precinct that has just been funded under round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund. Does the minister consider Sydney to be part of regional Australia? I refer the minister to Melbourne's Western Indoor Sports Hub, the WISH project precinct, which has been funded under round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund. Does the minister consider Western Melbourne to be part of regional Australia?


I ask the minister to explain why the Gillard government has given preferential treatment to projects proposed in Western Sydney, allowing 20 projects to proceed to full application status in the RDA Fund, whereas every other region was only permitted to submit their top three projects. Will the minister justify for the benefit of the House why the Gillard government broke promises made to regional Australia when they formed government and why, in the last three years, they have reduced spending on regional Australia? How can the minister now defend Labor's Regional Development Australia Fund, which actually spends $90 million per year less than the regional fund it replaced, the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program?


I refer the minister to the objective of his department listed on page 36 of the portfolio budget statement:


… drives regional policy to improve social, economic and environmental outcomes for regional Australians.


I ask the minister: how does the government's carbon tax improve the social, economic and environmental outcomes for regional Australians? Does the minister agree that the Gillard government's carbon tax will drive up the cost of living for regional Australians without saving the environment? Minister, given regional Australia will suffer the greatest impact because most of our power generation, mining and manufacturing sectors reside in regional Australia, will you advise the House what actions your department will take to drive regional policy? Given Australians in regional New South Wales spent 25 per cent more on electricity than those in Sydney, and Australians in regional Victoria spent 30 per cent more than those in Melbourne—



Government members interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  what steps will the minister take to drive social, economic and environmental regional policy?



Government members interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  Minister, your answer should be 'scrapping the carbon tax', because the carbon tax is bad for regional Australia. As I say—



Government members interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill, I cannot believe that you are allowing this level of interruption and—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill

Mr BALDWIN:
  I ask you to take control of the House. It is obvious that these members opposite—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order, member for Paterson!




Mr BALDWIN:
  have got an awful lot to hide.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Paterson will return to his questions.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I am, Madam Deputy Speaker. The whole issue here is regional Australia. Why is all of Australia considered regional Australia? Why aren't regional Australia funds just for regional areas? Why are the capital cities included in regional Australia funding? Weren't you smart enough to develop an urban development fund and a regional fund? Because what you are doing is taking money out of the bush and putting it directly back into the city.

 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:24):  I am very happy to respond to the questions. Many of the responsibilities that you just asked about—




Mr Baldwin:
  Where's the minister?




Mrs Elliot:
  She is the minister!




Mr Baldwin:
  I am talking about a cabinet minister.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

Ms KING:
  I am hoping that that is not sexism operating there in terms of my ministerial responsibilities! But that is okay.




Mr Baldwin:
  On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: I ask the minister to withdraw that comment calling me sexist.




Ms KING:
  I am happy to facilitate the ongoing debate about this by withdrawing that comment. As the minister responsible for many of the issues you have raised, I am very happy to discuss them. I am really disappointed that the shadow minister for this area does not seem to understand what regional development is about. There are many people—like me, like the member opposite and like the many regional members who have come here today—who live in what are classified as regional or provincial cities. But that is not the sole definition of regional development. It never has been. It has not been the sole definition across the entire history of academic work in regional development. There are regions in capital cities, there are regions in outer metropolitan areas, there are regions in and around provincial cities and there are regions in and around rural towns. The RDA network we have developed was in fact based on the previous government's area consultative committee councils. Are you telling me that you had no area consultative committee councils in city areas?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill
):  The minister will direct her remarks through the chair.




Ms KING:
  My apologies, Deputy Speaker. Is the shadow member saying that there were no area consultative committees in city areas? I have a recollection that there were five area consultative committees covering the area of Melbourne and that they put in applications under the Regional Partnerships programs—and, I think, were successful. I have a vague recollection too of an inner Sydney area getting support under the Regional Partnerships program—for a project on a beach.


I cannot believe that the shadow minister, who is purporting to be the developer of regional development policy for the opposition, does not seem to understand regional development. Let me go to one particular project announced out of round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund which was raised by the shadow minister—the project in Werribee. I do not know whether you have ever visited Werribee, but let me suggest to you that you might want to do that. When I was in Werribee with the Prime Minister announcing that RDAF round 4 project, I was delighted to meet the lovely mayor, Heather, who is from there. She was originally born in my electorate in Trawalla, where Jim Scullin was born—I am very proud to have that association. She talked about how Werribee was a town of 8,000 people when she first moved there. It is, and was always viewed as, a country town. My sister moved there 20 years ago. It is a tiny country town. It has faced enormous population growth, which is terrific.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms KING:
  I am glad that you have been there. So you know that Werribee is a country town which has faced enormous pressure from population growth exploding out of Melbourne. The community had a tiny basketball stadium which was servicing a huge population. The opportunity to make that a regional sporting facility, a centre for basketball for the west of Victoria, is a terrific opportunity.


Again I say to the shadow minister: you clearly do not understand regional development. It is not just about regional provincial cities; it is also about regions and regional areas that cover a whole raft of areas. I know, having been in this area for a while, that the shadow minister is committed to making sure that we have good policy across our regions. I remind the shadow minister that, under the Regional Partnerships program, you did fund a whole raft of projects—some of which were successful and some of which were questionable, to be quite honest, particularly those in the private sector—and perhaps you might want to reflect on that when you ask a question.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (18:29):  This budget includes a $235 million package to drive the implementation of Creative Australia—the National Cultural Policy. Creative Australia aims to ensure that the cultural sector, incorporating all aspects of the arts, heritage and the creative industries, has the skills, resources and resilience to play an active role in Australia's future. I want to pay tribute to my predecessor in the portfolio, the member for Hotham, for the work that he did in putting together Creative Australia.


Additional funding has been provided to the arts portfolio to ensure that the Australia Council can meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving artistic practice through provision of $75.3 million in new funding, including $15 per annum in additional funding for arts organisations to address unfunded excellence; $1.25 million per annum in funding to harness excellence in the major performing arts companies; $1 million per annum for training and development to build the professional capacity of the arts sector; $1 million per annum to develop and implement a detailed and systematic data collection program; establish a new funding program for the newly formed Creative Partnerships Australia at a cost of $8.6 million over two years; continuing training available to students through our elite arts training organisations through a provision of $20.8 million over four years; establish the arts ready program to address skills through targeted on-the-job training at a cost of $3.4 million over four years; provide $9.3 million over four years to six major performing arts companies to ensure they can continue to tell innovative and uniquely Australian stories; extend the existing Indigenous Languages Support program and enable funding to language projects based in the Torres Strait by providing an additional $14 million over four years; provide $11.3 million over four years to continue the successful Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program; continue the ArtStart program to assist recent arts graduates to grow their professional practice into a sustainable business at a cost of $9.7 million over four years; establish a digital content fund supporting Australian digital production at a cost of $10 million over four years; and ensure a one-off $20 million location incentive to increase Australia's competitiveness as a world-class filming destination.


As part of the $235 million package, funding was also provided through other portfolios to ensure $40 million in funding for cultural infrastructure, as parts of rounds 3 and 4 of the Regional Australia Development Fund, to continue the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project and to assist community groups that operate self-help radio retransmission facilities in regional and remote areas at a cost of $5.1 million over four years; provide $8 million over two years to establish the Creative Young Stars program to encourage, support and celebrate creative, cultural, academic and community achievement.


We are very proud to release Creative Australia and believe it provides a strong strategic framework for government investment in the arts, cultural heritage and creative industries, establishing a solid base for future growth and improved sustainability in the sector. The portfolio looks forward to implementing Creative Australia over the next 10 years.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (18:32):  As a regional member, I am very pleased to be participating tonight. I certainly have some questions for the minister for regional services later in relation to some of the government's massive investment right throughout regional Australia.


When I look at my electorate, I see more than $1.5 billion of major investment in community infrastructure in a regional area, in roads, in health facilities and in community facilities. It has made a really big difference to my area. This budget commits almost $1 billion through the Regional Development Australia Fund, to finance infrastructure projects throughout the nation. I am very proud that we have delivered so much.


I am really excited tonight to be talking about the $500,000 from the RDAF for the Knox Park youth precinct at Murwillumbah. This is funded by the Tweed Shire Council, which is matching the federal Labor government's commitment of $500,000. It is a fantastic investment and the project will deliver a range of recreational facilities for a whole range of age groups including an adventure playground and a plaza style skate park. This particular park has needed to be upgraded for a long period of time. We were very proud to make the announcement. It is going to make a very big difference to that area. This is what RDAF funding does; it really makes a huge investment in regional areas and delivers great results.


I was also really pleased only a couple of weeks ago on 21 May when the minister for regional development was in my area and we turned the sod at the Arkinstall Park Sports Centre at Tweed heads. That received $5 million from in the previous round of RDAF funding. It is a great investment in our area. That is to complete and do some major upgrades on our netball and tennis courts. When it is completed we will have an international-style facility for tennis and netball which we can be really proud of.


It will also be a great training facility, with the Commonwealth Games just up the road at the Gold Coast in 2018. If they are looking for some training they can just come over the border to Tweed Heads and we will have that wonderful sporting facility there which will make a huge difference. Really importantly, it is going to make a very big difference to our region. Our kids will be able to use international-style sporting facilities, which is so important. Of course, the economic benefits from all these projects just go on and on. There are so many.


I do not have the time to talk about all the funding in my electorate when it comes to regional development but, previously, under the other programs, there was $9.5 million for the sport and recreation centre at Byron Bay; $2.7 million for the cultural and community centre at Lennox Head; and $2 million for the community centre at Murwillumbah. That all came out of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program—our previous regional development program—and that has made a massive difference to the community as well.


I also want to touch on the incredible upgrades to the Pacific Highway that we have had in my area which have made a big difference to our region. There was $359 million for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway at Sexton Hill and more than $500 million for the Pacific Highway upgrade between Tintenbar and Ewingsdale. Of course, we have also had the BER—another great investment. There was $115 million worth of upgrades to 90 local schools. What a difference that has made to our kids and what they can access in terms of their educational opportunities?


Also, there was $7 million for our GP superclinic at Tweed Heads, which opened its doors last Friday—a great, great achievement—and $1.8 million for the Jack Evans Boat Harbour redevelopment. Finally—we have another very important one--$2 million from this government was delivered for Australia's first high-performance surfing centre at Casuarina. We actually have the world's only high-performance centre or surfing—a great institute at Casuarina, just near Kingscliff. We have a lot of surfing greats that will come there and provide a mentoring service for young people. We are very proud to have the world's first. It truly remarkable.


That all adds up to more than $1.5 billion—a remarkable investment my electorate of Richmond. What you see from this government is real investment in real projects right throughout regional Australia and right across the board, whether it is roads, health facilities or community infrastructure. I have seen firsthand the benefits of all these facilities and the difference that they make. I would certainly like to hear a bit more from the minister, and I would like the Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories to outline the importance of this government's support for regional Australia—particularly touching on our Regional Development Australia Fund and the difference that it makes local communities like mine.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:37):  I thank the member for highlighting the project in her electorate recently funded under RDAF 3. Regional Development Australia Fund round 3 has been a very successful round. We took the opportunity after each round to review, to listen to stakeholders and to go out and talk to the RDA network about what was happening with that round. One of the things that we were fed back was that often it was difficult for small communities and small towns to compete against larger councils. So that round was specifically designed for towns under 30,000. I was really delighted to see that round fund some 79 projects right the way across the country and in some communities that are very disadvantaged and which would not previously have had the opportunity to apply for that funding of up to $500,000—many applications were smaller than that—and make a substantial difference across each of those rounds.


The member has also highlighted that this government's commitment to regional Australia is not just about RDAF. I know people often want to focus on that particular program, but it has been across all areas of government. There has been significant investment through the Building the Education Revolution, primarily focused on schools. A large proportion of that money has gone to schools in regional, rural and remote Australia, providing opportunities for small communities that have never, for example, had access to libraries before—because those facilities are opened up to community members. The BER provided libraries, electronic whiteboards, meeting spaces and sporting infrastructure for small regional and small rural communities across the country.


Our investment in health included the Regional Cancer Centres. There has been significant investment by this government in improving the terrible divide that occurs in this country between city people who are diagnosed with cancer and people who live in regional and rural Australia who are diagnosed with cancer.


We know the health outcomes and survival rates of people diagnosed with cancer in regional and rural Australia are some five years behind their metropolitan counterparts. We know that is not good enough. When you look across health, whether it is through GP super clinics, hospitals and health funds, which have seen investments in major health projects across the country but particularly in regional areas, right the way through to the regional integrated, that is very important and this government is very proud of them.


I also want to touch on the government's education reforms which we saw pass the House recently. Again I reiterate how incredibly important those reforms are because of the loading on the basis of size and locational disadvantage and what that means for regional students. I cannot overemphasise how critical that investment is to regional Australia. I think that the New South Wales National Party minister absolutely gets it. It is not something we often admit to but I know many regional MPs on this side of the House are very fond of members of the National Party. We share a lot in common in terms of the seats we represent. We do not often say that. I know many National Party members are of good heart and understand that the education reforms are a significant advantage to regional Australians and to many regional and rural schools.


I hope sense prevails across the country and that National Party members are listened to. In New South Wales, the National Party education minister absolutely gets it. This is critical. Our students in regional Australia are going to be left behind if we do not deal with this issue, if we do not put serious investment into our education system and increase funding on the basis of location and size. It is absolutely critical that we do so. The bills have now passed the House of Representatives. I certainly hope they pass the other place. What I absolutely hope is that the politics we have seen played out across the country is put aside—about not wanting, in someone's political spin doctoring mind, to give the government an advantage if Gonski gets through, that we cannot possibly allow them a win. I hope that sort of commentary, which we are seeing from Liberal and National Party coalition governments in some states, is put aside and that we see increases in funding to regional students. There are some $6 billion that regional and rural schools will benefit from; under the opposition's policy $16 billion will be cut. I hope the Nationals see sense on this.

  No, I am right about that. The only other member of the Gillard-Rudd ministry who came from a country area was the member for Hunter who was Minister for Defence between December 2007 and June 2009—I think that is correct. I acknowledge the fact that Labor is recognising—

Mr McCORMACK:
  No, as ministers I am talking about.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Riverina might need to do his homework before he comes to the chamber, rather than call on the other people in the class to answer the questions.




Mr McCORMACK:
  I acknowledge all the other ministers in the room who come from regional Australia. It is great that Labor is finally recognising that good people from regional Australia are here to represent the portfolio areas. I also want to acknowledge the fact that in round 3 of the RDAF funding Tumbarumba in my electorate will receiving $340,000 for a sports stadium. I appreciate that. I am always very balanced on these things. I expressed concern last night in the parliament about the fact that the electorates of Watson and Lalor are receiving funding in the next round, round 4. I do hope that Tumut shire, which was one of the final applicants for funding for Gocup Road, receive that funding because that is a vital corridor for transport and industry in that region.


I have some questions here from the shadow minister for sport, who is unable to be here. Is the relevant minister here or should I put them on notice?




Mr Burke:
  Madam Acting Deputy Speaker O'Neill, a point of order: if the member asks them, the conversation might move on and someone will find out and get a note to us, and we will be able to answer them, if not immediately then before we wind up.




Mr McCORMACK:
  I will ask the ones that I can ask in the time I have left and I will put the others on notice. The member for Cowper asks: what is it the total value of all spending commitments by the Australian government in relation to the 2015 Asian Cup, including in-kind support, debt forgiveness, the Major Events Taskforce and direct assistance? What does the Australian public receive in return for contributions such as the substantial amount of money provided for a regional soccer tournament? What was the one-off grant of $50,000 to Football Federation Australia for which was provided sometime between January and May? Who authorised the grant? Under what program was the grant given? What is the anticipated final cost to the taxpayer for the rectification works of the AIS European training centre, including the cost of the review by Copa International SRL? Was any damage and defects caused by athletes through either accident or poor behaviour? The budget allocated an additional $1.8 million to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority over three years. Does this money increase represent a doubling of ASADA's investigative resources, as promised by the minister for sport at the 7 February press conference? The budget allocated an additional $3 million for the Major Events Taskforce. What will this $3 million be used for? How will the Major Events Taskforce be different from previous arrangements in relation to major events such as the 2006 Commonwealth Games?


The member for Cowper is unable to be here, but they are the questions he would like answered by the relevant minister. I do thank the House and I thank Labor for recognising that there are many good people amongst its ranks from regional areas to represent rural and regional Australia—real Australia.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:47):  I will briefly cover a couple of points. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that you have pointed to funding under Regional Development Australia round 3 that was in your electorate. I am happy that that project has been widely welcomed in your electorate, as it has been across the 79 project areas that were funded under that. I think that round has been a very good round and some good lessons were learned about the importance of supporting smaller rural communities as part of that. I know members here also had a number of projects in their own electorates that have been important as well.


The member for Maranoa, a good representative of regional Australia, got four projects under round 3 in his electorate—with three projects totalling $1.2 million. I was very disappointed that I did not get, 'Yes, that's fantastic; we got three projects' and all I got, 'Where's my fourth?' I have to say that was very disappointing. I heard him on ABC regional radio bemoaning the fact that the fourth project did not get up. He was saying, 'I don't just want the three projects; I want more and I'm disappointed.' He also said that it was a rort and everything had gone down the eastern seaboard. Frankly, I was disappointed that he called it a rort in the sense that he got three projects and not four.


In terms of the questions asked around RDAF 4, we have made decisions on that round. They will be announced over the course of the next month and I am looking forward to visiting many communities across the country to announce those projects. I was very pleased to announce the project in Werribee, which we discussed briefly before. Another project that we announced was in Sydney. Again, this is a very important arts and cultural precinct, which will be very important for that region. I know that it will make a substantial difference there. Also, a project that was announced in my own electorate, in Ballarat, was a regional soccer facility. Another very important project was announced in the member for Corangamite's electorate, not in my electorate, which I am sure he will have much to say about.


In reference to the sports questions, all of those issues were substantially covered in Senate estimates; they were discussed in quite a lot of detail. There were a number of hours of debate on them. So I say to the member for Cowper that the Senate estimates really did cover all of those questions.

Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (18:50):  I think it is really positive that we are able to talk about an outstanding program that is available to rural and regional Australia—no matter how you want to define it. Most people in this room have only something very positive to say about it.




Opposition member interjecting—





Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  I suppose it is still lingering for some of them. My friend from the Riverina has also been a recipient. His community won that argument in a very competitive round and so they merited RDA funding. I congratulate them on that. Before I go on and discuss a couple of mine, if I may, I want to say that I have had the privilege of having both ministers, who are here at the moment, visit my electorate in terms of their portfolios. To our new minister, may I congratulate you on that.


There are two programs that I want to mention in passing. The Active After-schools Community program is a fantastic program, and it has been largely rolled out in my electorate. We have a fantastic number of schools involved in it, and I do want to commend the government and also the continuation of its funding, Minister. Then there is the Creative Young Stars Program, which was announced recently and the $27,000 for every electorate. I congratulate the minister on that. I suppose he can read about it in Hansard rather than hear me talk about it.


Another program that I would like to talk about is Happy feet at the Penguin Athletics centre. In round 1, the Central Coast Council—where I used to be a councillor; and I am very proud to have been a councillor—applied for funding and missed out. Like many councils, they were determined to learn from round 1, and they were successful in round 2. Effectively, they got $520,000 from us, along with their investment. What is so fantastic about these programs is that you get the co-investment of the communities, and so their contribution of $531,000 will be put towards revamping what we call the Dial Regional Sports Complex. This funding has allowed the community to completely redo the surface, which will make it an all-weather surface and, at the same time, fix up a lot of the seating, as well as revamp the administration building and associated other builds. The Central Coast Council is a council that does not ask for much, unless it is in there pitching itself as well. This is a genuine regional sports complex, carrying out really important work—and that is, first and foremost, the health and wellbeing of our region and communities. A lot of RDA funding is associated with community health programs, so it is great for infrastructure and also very, very important for the health and wellbeing of our communities.


The other great thing about many of these projects is that they involve employment. This is very important, particularly in rural and regional Australia as we are challenged economically in a number of areas for a whole variety of reasons—it is a fact. These projects are very important for stimulating and sustaining employment. One thing that I forgot to add about the regional sports complex project—and, hopefully, Minister, you will be able to open it when it is completed—is that it involves improved lighting so that we will be able to have night programs for the region. I do congratulate the Central Coast Council on gaining that funding.


More recently—let me tell you: if you have not visited this place, you must—there was King Island, the absolute jewel in the crown of Tasmania. Every cow has a name; it is just called in personally to be milked. King Island has the most extraordinary cheese and beef that you can imagine. Not only is it going to have two world-class golf courses—



An honourable member:  Do cows play golf?




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  The cows play golf! You put your bag on the cow and you take it around the golf course with you!


However, very importantly, you have to get onto the island. What have we got? The minister came over just recently: $500,000 to a project of well over a million dollars to completely upgrade the terminal. It is going to not only provide better amenity on the island but bring in even more tourists. There are no cows in this terminal! It is a fantastic project, and congratulations to the council. Minister, I am sure you will be able to enlighten us on other similar rural and regional projects and the importance of them to local communities.

With the member for Parramatta, I convene the Labor Friends of the Arts, so I have worked with the previous minister, Minister Crean, and had a great function the other day with Minister Burke. Minister, my question is: in this modern world of social media and changing links around the world, how are we going to tell Australian stories and help define Australian culture—that vast, shifting Australian culture? What are the economic opportunities associated with that? Can you tell us about the new money contained in the budget for the reform of the Australia Council, which is the Australian government's principal arts funding body? Could you also touch on this exciting new program, the Creative Young Stars Program?

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports—Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (18:56):  I thank the member for Moreton for that neat segue into the Creative Young Stars Program. I am not sure that I will be able to compete with the thespian parliamentary secretary who preceded me. The worth of this project came very sharply into focus for me after I met James Morrison at the Jazz Bell Awards and he told me that 3½ thousand young people were gathering in Mount Gambier, three or four weekends ago, to learn from Australia's international jazz musicians and the LA big band that had flown in specially from LA, which refused to do any commercial appearances. These people aged under 25 from all over Australia were coming to exhibit their creativity.


We know of these kinds of functions that take place all across Australia. We know of young people from all of our electorates who are desperate to get some way into a pathway into work in this area, to develop their creativity, and Creative Young Stars is just the program. It comes out of Creative Australia. This government has undertaken and designed it to help young people to achieve their full potential in the arts, creative industries, community service and the educational sector by developing their skills, abilities and professional connections and, as we said, opening up opportunities for work.


This is a similar program to the program we have developed in the area of sports. We do not want Australians just to be seen as brilliant sportsmen; we also want to see our National Cultural Policy develop in a creative Australia accessible to the young people of Australia. Creative Young Stars will see young people up to 25 years of age with the ability to apply for $8 million allocated across Australia to every federal seat equally. Grants are in four categories, for performing arts, cultural activities, academic endeavour and school and community achievement. The grants will help gifted young people to participate in such events as eisteddfods, public-speaking tournaments and cultural, artistic and academic events—and, just like Mr Morrison recommended, in events like Generations in Jazz, which took place in Mount Gambier for the 25th year.


The first application will be through your federal MP, who can grant up to 12 awards and two group grants in the electorate. Individuals are able to access $500 and groups are able to get grants of $3,000 for groups of six or more members. The grants for Creative Young Stars open on 1 June and close on 21 June. You can visit the youth.gov.au website for information and application forms and I expect it will be of great use to all members of parliament, not just government members. We are expecting enthusiastic participation on behalf of the young people in your electorates in regional and rural Australia as well as right across all of the cities. I pay great tribute to the Office for the Arts which, if members of parliament are not energetic enough, is going to follow up through all the regional art networks, making sure that young people right across this country—not just where there are active members of parliament—can access this wonderful program.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:14):  Through the 2013-14 appropriation bills the government will provide the portfolio with $7 billion to deliver its priorities. This includes $6.8 billion directly to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, of which $5.1 billion is an equity injection into NBN Co. It also includes $1.1 billion through the department to the ABC; $273.8 million through the department to the SBS; $111.6 million to the Australian Communications and Media Authority; and $90.4 million to the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency.


The government is providing over $178 million in new funding to the portfolio for a range of measures. This includes $50 million to the department for a range of important programs, including $26.6 million over five years to assist free-to-air television broadcasters to relocate their digital television services to new television channels; $12.9 million for expanding the Digital Enterprise and Digital Local Government programs; $2.5 million to extend the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme for a further year; and $5.4 million over five years to assist the production and transmission of community radio.


The federal Labor government is very proud of our support of the public broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS. They provide a vital service to the nation. As the regional development minister can I say that the role that the ABC play in regional Australia cannot be underestimated in terms of providing a service to the community, particularly at times when information on natural disasters is important to be transmitted in real time. In addition to the continuing base funding of $2.5 billion over three years, $182 million will be provided to the ABC for new measures, including a loan to assist in the construction of a purpose-built facility at Southbank in Melbourne; funding to enable the expansion of ABC news and current affairs; funds to enable it to meet growing audience demand for its digital media services; and funding to produce documentaries commemorating the Anzac Centenary.


In addition to the continuation of its base funding of $569 million over three years for SBS, $20 million will be provided to the SBS to enable it to build on the success of its digital initiatives. I note that the SBS has recently expanded some of its language services to facilitate access to some of the newer communities that have arrived in Australia in recent times. I congratulate them and the leadership that they show in the community in promoting inclusiveness as an essential element of the success of multicultural Australia.


The 2013-14 budget also provides additional funding to the ACMA. This includes $10.5 million for the high-frequency direction finding upgrade to continue support the high-frequency bands used by the aviation, maritime, defence and emergency services communities, as well as $6 million to continue its revenue assurance project.


This budget also includes a $5.1 billion equity injection to NBN Co. The budget papers reconfirm the total equity contribution to NBN Co. will be $30.4 billion. The National Broadband Network is the largest infrastructure project in our nation's history. The NBN is about transforming telecommunications and the economy by investing in the infrastructure that we need now and that we will also need for the future. This is critical infrastructure that our country needs for the 21st century.


Only this Labor government will make the smart investments that Australia needs for our future. The National Broadband Network, along with the National Plan for School Improvement, DisabilityCare Australia and the Nation Building Program are all important parts of this. Our funding announced in the 2013-14 budget for the Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy portfolio will encourage a vibrant, sustainable and internationally competitive digital economy in Australia.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-05,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:20):  I have a number of matters to raise with the minister. I am going to deal first with the issue of asbestos, as that seems to be in the forefront of attention at the moment. In the spirit of seeking some enlightenment—light as opposed to heat—I invite the minister to respond substantively, if he can; if he cannot answer substantively, then he should say so, rather than giving a sort of ad hominem spray, which is what we had from his counterpart Mr Shorten. This is the issue I want to seek the minister's views on. We know that the received wisdom, official wisdom, on asbestos is—and I am quoting now from the code of practice How to Manage and Control Asbestos in the Workplace, at page 17. It says here:


If asbestos or ACM—


asbestos-containing material—


is in good condition and left undisturbed, it is unlikely that airborne asbestos will be released into the air and the risk to health is extremely low. It is usually safer to leave it and review its condition over time. However, if the asbestos or ACM has deteriorated, has been disturbed, or if asbestos-contaminated dust is present, the likelihood that airborne asbestos will be released into the air is increased.


This is consistent across all the official material on dealing with asbestos.


It was from a similar official publication, the Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos, that Telstra quoted in writing to Mr Shorten as the MP for Maribyrnong in 2009, when they said that the removal of asbestos-containing materials can potentially expose workers and others to higher levels of fibre than leaving the material in situ. Telstra's approach has been not to seek to replace asbestos-containing material unless the pit is disturbed for whatever reason. Of course, what we have seen with the advent of the NBN's deal with Telstra in 2011 is very widespread disturbance and hence a much bigger asbestos management problem than was the case back in 2009. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made it clear now that, despite the interest he evinced in 2009, he did not raise his concerns about this with either the communications minister or NBN and Telstra in 2011 or 2012.


I want to know from the minister whether it is the government's view—and this is simply to get some clarity on this—that the official standards should be changed or are mistaken and whether Telstra's practice is no longer valid in the sense of not seeking to replace intact undisturbed asbestos-containing material which is in situ—that is to say, buried under the ground—and only to replace it when it is being disturbed. Of course, as the minister knows, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the Telstra pits are being replaced because they are too small for the NBN's purposes.


This is an important point because there is a lot of undisturbed asbestos-containing material in the Telstra network that will not be disturbed even with the NBN, and of course there is an even vaster amount of asbestos-containing material in people's houses and garages and schools and hospitals that is intact and undisturbed. The question is: given the remarks that the workplace relations minister has made, is the government's view that there should be, as Mr Shorten recommended in 2009, proactive material of otherwise stable, undisturbed, intact asbestos-containing material?


If that were to be the government's approach, that is a very significant change of policy, and there is a lack of clarity at the moment as to whether there is now a change of policy on dealing with asbestos-containing material.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (17:25):  I have a question, Minister. It is to do with the record funding for the ABC and SBS, but I have a statement that I want to make about it first. The ABC and SBS are two of Australia's most important and trusted cultural institutions. The government is proud of its track record in supporting the national broadcasters, and it is a track record built upon the recent budget and the triennial funding announcement.


The government will provide the ABC with $89.4 million in additional funding over the next three years to expand news and current affairs services and for digital delivery of ABC programs. The government is also providing the ABC with a loan of $90 million over three years so it can consolidate the majority of its Melbourne based operations at its Southbank site. This will allow the ABC to achieve operational savings while continuing to deliver high-quality broadcast content. In addition to new funding announced in the budget, the ABC will receive $2.5 billion over three years in ongoing base funding from 2013-14. That base funding is important.


The SBS will receive $20 million in new funding over the next triennium to build on the success of its digital initiatives and to continue to develop its programming and services to reflect and promote multicultural and Indigenous Australia. The new funding is in addition to the $158.1 million over five years provided as part of the 2012-13 budget to ensure that SBS remains a vibrant and dynamic national broadcaster.


Both the ABC and SBS will continue to be exempt from the efficiency dividend, and I will say more about that.


In the last triennial funding round in 2009, the Labor government provided the ABC with the largest increase in its operational base funding since 1983. I remember the ABC out lobbying too at that time and walking around the halls of parliament, and I also remember that I wrote a letter about that to the minister, lobbying on it. I was at that stage the only MP who had written a letter on it. Then I led the charge to make sure that all the other MPs did that as well, and that was across the parliament.


The funding provided in 2012-13 represented the most significant funding boost SBS has ever had. This is in stark contrast to the previous government, whose first budget stripped $55 million per year from the ABC's base funding, crippling the national broadcaster's ability to keep pace with the changing media environment.


Can I say that I get a bit tired of the whole debate about the ABC: 'Is it biased or is it not?' I am sure every MP in here has an experience and a view. I do get a bit fed up with that, particularly from the coalition. The honourable member for Wentworth is fond of asserting that the public broadcasters have no greater friend than him.




Mr Turnbull:
  I don't think I've said that, but it's probably a fair comment.




Ms SAFFIN:
  The honourable member for Wentworth has said words to that effect. I was maybe putting it more eloquently than the honourable member might have. But it was only last week that the honourable member for Wentworth was refusing to rule out slashing the budgets of the national broadcasters under a coalition government. When it comes to the national broadcasters—



An honourable member interjecting—




Ms SAFFIN:
  yes, I tell you, yes—the coalition cannot be trusted. A friend would be saying: 'Funding won't be slashed. Funding is secure, and I agree to no efficiency dividend.'


But this new funding that I have talked about ensures that the ABC and SBS can continue to build on the extensive range of services they provide to their audiences, especially the growing demand for their innovative digital services. The national broadcasters provide a range of programs, news and information across television, radio and digital platforms accessed by millions of Australians every day. In a changing media environment they are more important than ever as a source of news and current affairs, local content and telling stories.


I have seen a quote from the honourable member for Wentworth, which reads as follows:


But if there is a broader austerity of some kind across the board then all departments may have to bear some of the pain.


I repeat: there is no efficiency dividend. My question is, Minister: would you like to— (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:30):  Firstly, I thank the member for Page for her contribution and for her ongoing support of ABC and SBS. I am not surprised that a regional member feels so strongly about the role that these fine national institutions play in our lives, making a huge difference whether it be through television, radio or new media opportunities that both of these institutions are engaged in.


With regard to the record funding for ABC and SBS, the government is proud of the support that we have given. It has also been given, might I say, from some other portfolios. My portfolio of infrastructure has, for example, assisted in building the new headquarters of the ABC in Brisbane. People would be aware of issues raised about the health of staff at the former ABC headquarters. The new structure stands on the banks of the Brisbane River.


I went to the opening of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. The ABC does play that important cultural role in our cities and our regions. One thing that orchestra have been doing, as do other institutions associated with our public broadcasters, is bring cultural activities to regional communities. They certainly play a fine role there.


The government is absolutely committed to this funding. We are committed to the independence as well of the ABC and SBS, unlike the former government that stacked the boards with right-wing ideologues. We have ensured that there is a professionalism brought to the appointment of the boards and to those institutions.


In response to the shadow minister's questions that were raised, the issue of asbestos is indeed one that has haunted communities since the dangers of asbestos became clear. It must be said that the dangers were apparent to executives in companies such as James Hardie a long time before they were prepared to fess up to the consequences of this deadly product for which they were prepared to put profit before the lives of those people who worked with the product and those people who just lived in communities. Indeed, it is the case that where building work for infrastructure takes place in cities such as Sydney there needs to be absolute care to ensure that the workers are protected and also that communities are unaffected where this work is taking place.


I know that when a refurbishment of an oval in my electorate was taking place, they found a lot of asbestos had literally just been buried beneath the oval—covered over with dirt as if the problem would just go away. This is something that does need to be above politics. The member for Wentworth is clearly genuine in his concerns about these issues; these issues are serious but they are not new. We know that claims, for example, that legacy infrastructure with asbestos will not be disturbed under the coalition's plan is not true. That is why these claims are now being refuted by industry experts. We need to make sure that this work occurs in an appropriate way. There is no way to avoid interacting with asbestos when you are working on Australia's fixed telecommunications network. The member for Wentworth cannot avoid dealing with asbestos if he is ever in a position to build his fibre to the node system which would consist of some 70,000 nodes at least. As independent telecommunications consultant and safety expert Fernando Calero told the Financial Review:


… rolling out fibre-to-the-node technology still requires some modification of pits and pipes between Telstra exchanges and street corners, as well as those pipes connecting Telstra exchanges.


Mr Calero also said:


A lot of the inter-exchange stuff is asbestos. … Many of the main trunks are asbestos.


It is a fact that when this work takes place every care must be taken and Telstra has accepted responsibility for doing just that.


We know indeed that this is not a new issue. We know that in 2001 Telstra wanted to create an independent body to fast-track compensation payments to employees exposed to asbestos. They sought approval from the then Department of Workplace Relations, but they got knocked back. The then Minister for Workplace Relations was the current Leader of the Opposition. So, the opposition leader knew about those issues as far back as 2001, when Telstra made a clear approach to the department. In 2005 it was raised again. In September 2005 a question on notice was asked of Minister McGauran representing the then communications minister Senator Coonan about Telstra's use of asbestos. The minister provided an answer in February 2006 that explained Telstra's use of asbestos in pits, ducts and exchanges and the possibility of exposure. This has been an issue that has been around for a long time. This is an issue that requires every care.


I had the great honour of being a patron of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation prior to being elected as a member of the House of Representatives and afterwards as a backbench member through my association with Barry Robson, a great Australian, and the great Bernie Banton—as heroic an Australian as anyone could meet. He was courageous until the end, fighting and campaigning not for himself but for justice for other Australians. I believe that we need to ensure that every respect is given to people such as Bernie Banton for the role he has played in fighting companies that did hid what they were doing—companies like James Hardie and CSR, which some prominent people on the opposite side see fit to defend in cases against victims of asbestos. I have found some of the politicking in the last week or so a bit galling, frankly, given the history of these issues. Of these issues, I would say that Telstra—just like any other company or organisation engaged in activity that is likely to disturb asbestos—needs to take every care possible.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:40):  I am very disappointed that despite my generosity in encouraging the minister to speak for twice as long, he was unable to answer the question—nor would the minister for workplace relations answer it. The question was this: is the government saying that undisturbed, intact, non-friable asbestos-containing material should not be left in situ—as is the practice at Telstra; as indeed is contemplated in the national codes—but rather should be proactively removed, notwithstanding that this carries, as the national code I read from earlier, risks of contamination?


This is a very serious point. That is why I said at the outset that I do not want to have a slanging match with the minister opposite. I do not want to get into ancient history. I want to get some clarity on this very important point. I will leave that with the minister. I would just respond to the honourable member from the north coast.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We are here to consider the expenditure of the relevant department.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  All right. I should have called a point of order. I have no right to reply there; fair enough. I now want to turn to the rollout of the NBN. I want to ask the minister whether he is concerned and what he is going to do about the failure of the NBN to meet its rollout targets. It was originally forecast, in late 2010, to pass 950,000 brownfield premises by 30 June this year. In August 2012 that was scaled back to 286,000 premises—a massive reduction. As of the end of March, that was scaled back again to somewhere between 155,000 and 175,000 premises to be passed. As of mid May, so we have been told, they have only passed just over 70,000 premises.


The big issue here is whether there is a flaw in the construction model and whether this project is genuinely scalable in the manner contemplated in the corporate plan. We are being told directly—through the media and elsewhere—that contractors are not making a living out of this work. I was talking to a contractor today who said to me that his rate to excavate, remove and dispose of a Telstra pit made of asbestos-containing material was $78. He said he cannot make a living out of that. He said his rate for putting in a new, large, plastic pit and setting it all up—buying the pit, labour, materials and everything else—was $295. This is a very relevant issue. Is the reason the project is running so slowly the fact that the contractors are not making a quid out of it?


The challenge is that at the moment the NBN Co. is passing 353 houses a working day, in this half year. That is the current rate. They should have been passing over a thousand. Their plan calls for them next year to be passing 10 times that number. Every time the NBN Co. has missed a target—and this is a fact, this is not conjecture—it asserts that the ramp-up is going to be even steeper. I ask the minister whether the government is satisfied with the rollout so far and what measures he believes the government and the NBN Co. should take to enable it to get closer to meeting the targets in its corporate plan?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:45):  Can I say that the most certain way of slowing the progress of the NBN would be to stop building it. That is what those opposite have in mind with their inferior, slower, alternative plan that is not of course the NBN. They have realised that the NBN is quite popular, so they are now pretending that they are going to keep it. It will cost just about as much, but for a far inferior product in which they have acknowledged would need to be upgraded before they have even started. I think it is right to actually get the infrastructure right first-up. If this mob were in charge of the Sydney Harbour Bridge it would have had one lane both ways. It is absurd.


From time to time the member for Wentworth says it is going too slow, but this week his Senate leader, the esteemed Senator Abetz, had this to say on 3 June:


… the reason that these talks need to be held is that there has been this indecent haste with the rollout of NBN.


It is going too slow, according to the member for Wentworth, but his Senate leader says it is going too fast. The fact is the rollout of the NBN is happening in every state and territory across the country. So far this year new areas switched on include Gungahlin, Toowoomba, Coffs Harbour, Bacchus Marsh, Hobart, Gosford, Blacktown and Townsville. There are well over 50,000 NBN services live across Australia, providing enhanced broadband to homes, businesses and schools, and NBN's take-up rates are world records. We also have fixed wireless NBN services being provided from 69 sites, including Ballarat, Darwin, Geraldton, Toowoomba, Tamworth and many other areas. Construction has commenced at over 115 additional sites and, overall, more than 770 sites have received planning approvals.


This is a project which common sense tells you, as it ramps-up, it is possible to do it faster and faster. It is logical that the initial stages of the rollout of the NBN would be slower than the middle stages and the middle stages would be slower than the final stages. That is the way that infrastructure happens. Whether it be the NBN or the building of a road or a new rail line. If you look at the regional rail network in Victoria, which is in my portfolio, you will see that we are now expending over $100 million every month on what is the largest infrastructure commitment to public transport that any Australian government has given to any project. It ramps-up with huge benefits for Melbourne but also, importantly, for Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. We on this side of the House understand infrastructure and the way that it develops. We understand that you need to get it right the first time. We understand that you need to be committed to put that investment in and that you get a return on that investment. Indeed, the NBN will deliver a return, not just an economic return but a social return as well because of the benefits it will bring to the provision of education and health services, because of the opportunity that will be created, particularly in regional Australia, at overcoming the tyranny of distance that has been a disadvantage for people in regional Australia, compared with their counterparts in CBD electorates, or the distance of Australia from the rest of the world. This is a very important project. The rollout is proceeding. The only threat to the rollout is the failure to re-elect the Labor government in September.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (17:50):  I am very pleased to be able to make some inquiries this afternoon about the broadband, communications and digital economy portfolio. I certainly commend the very fine work that is being done by both the minister here today and his colleague in the other place in relation to the rollout and the governance of the NBN. I know that it is met with very sincere enthusiasm in the part of the world that I represent. Indeed, one of the universities that is in my electorate has already talked to me about ways in which they might be able to take the opportunity advanced by the NBN to develop some telehealth, some medical applications, for the NBN and to pursue opportunities there in conjunction with other organisations. It is very welcome in educational institutions. I know that it is certainly welcome by small businesses and large businesses alike and, indeed, by residents in my part of the world.


NBN Co. is set to roll out fairly soon in Boronia and in and around the basin, at the northern end of my electorate and, at the same time, in the greenfield sites in the southern end of my electorate—the growth corridor. It is being very well received and there is much anticipation of the rollout in those areas, as there is across the Dandenong Ranges. Residents regularly report to me about the unreliability of the copper network. They appreciate all too readily its flaws. I know that the member for Wentworth would be aware of this, because he has been in my part of the world with the former member for La Trobe in recent weeks, admittedly to a fairly select audience there, but he certainly did come along. So I am sure he is familiar with the interest in the NBN's roll out to homes and businesses—not to somewhere down the street but right to people's doors. This is so that they can use the NBN for the transformative purpose that it was intended to have, such as for social use by people who might be isolated in the more remote parts of my electorate. It will be very beneficial for not only a lot of elderly residents who have taken an interest in our Broadband for Seniors program but, needless to say, also business applications.


I was recently at a forum which the Emerald small business group held with the Assistant Treasurer. I can certainly say that there was much interest in the NBN's application for business, particularly in that part of my electorate which is effectively on the urban rural fringe of Melbourne. I guess you might call it a peri-urban area. For people who may have to travel quite long distances to transact business, when the NBN is rolled out to that area it will be extremely beneficial, and there was much interest in it. Likewise, I have mentioned medical use and, of course, educational use for the NBN. Clearly, a great deal of work has been done right across government, not simply in this portfolio but in the health portfolio and the education portfolio to establish the NBN and to contemplate its applications immediately as it rolls out and into the future.


In light of this, I am particularly interested to ask about one transformative way in which the NBN might be best used by businesses, small and large, and that is in the context of cloud computing. Business operators are certainly acutely aware of the benefits that are presented to them by cloud computing, which enables them to have the potential to access quite powerful IT infrastructure without necessarily having to own it and operate it on site. It is a flexible means by which businesses and others can gain the benefits of the NBN network.


Today's internet, as all of us know, increasingly involves two-way communications through an interactive environment. Regrettably, those opposite routinely forget about the importance of upload speeds or upload capacity. Happily, we have not forgotten that. We are alive to it in the context of cloud computing. It is really unfortunate that those opposite have not seen the potential for cloud computing to advance business or the NBN as a means to advance business—those whom they purport so regularly to speak on behalf of.


My question today in light of all of this and in light of my evidently keen interest in the NBN is: are there particular ways through the budget and otherwise that the minister can advise about the application of cloud computing and how it can be advanced by the NBN?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (17:54):  I thank the member for La Trobe for her ongoing interest in the NBN and her conveying of the interest of her local business community. I of course have had the pleasure of visiting the fine electorate of La Trobe, including to a community cabinet meeting where we had discussions with local business leaders about the capacity for the NBN to allow an area which is on the urban fringes of the great city of Melbourne to engage and compete in real time and not have to be located in the CBD. That has other advantages as well in terms of transport and transforming the lifestyles of people who live in such a magnificent electorate, which has lots of open space and a lot of attractiveness to it. The areas on the outskirts of our cities have had the disadvantage of distance, and one of the things that the NBN does is make it very possible for businesses to locate and compete in a real sense, because the physical location is not as important and, of course, there are all the applications that the member speaks about, particularly in terms of medical technology.


It is indeed a tragedy that in some of the debate from those opposite they have comprehensively failed to understand the importance of upload speeds and the importance of transformative technologies like Cloud computing. The sorts of comments that you see from time to time about the NBN just being about downloading movies faster than is possible in other areas is an example of that. I genuinely felt a great deal of sympathy for the member for Wentworth when he was standing in Fox Studios and the Sonny Bill Williams image appeared and there was the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'That is computer generated, isn't it?' as if he had woken up to the fact that he had not just appeared in Fox Studios as an apparition as a result of some sort of Dr Who TARDIS type system. That says a lot about their failure to understand why this transformative policy is so important.


It will also revolutionise access to the Cloud. We are no longer living in a broadcast world. Today's internet is increasingly a two-way, thoroughly interactive environment. Cloud computing facilitates this new world by enabling access to powerful IT infrastructure without the need to own and operate it on site. Unlike those opposite, we are getting on with the job of building broadcast infrastructure to support technologies like Cloud for all Australians and the potential of this technology into the future.


For someone with a 12-year-old who is much more technologically competent than his father—and that is a familiar experience—opening up the world to young people means that part of what the NBN debate is about is embracing the future and not being scared or intimidated by it. It is about embracing the opportunities that it will bring. It is a democratic mechanism, which is very important in terms of participation in that two-way interactive environment of the future. So I thank the member for La Trobe, and I certainly look forward to the opportunities of the future as facilitated by the rollout of the NBN.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:59):  The minister in his day job, of course, is the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and is responsible for Infrastructure Australia. I want to ask him whether he regrets the government breaking its election pledge in 2007 to refer any major infrastructure investment by the Commonwealth to Infrastructure Australia for a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. This, of course, was not the case with the NBN, the largest infrastructure project in our history, where no such analysis, no such homework, was done.


I draw the minister's attention to his attempt to compare the rollout of the NBN with a road. He gives the impression that he is more familiar with roads than he is with telecom networks. But the point is not that the rollout is slower at the beginning than it is at the middle and the end; the point is that the rollout is so far behind the NBN Co.'s own corporate plan. It is the NBN not failing anybody else's standards but failing its own standards. In that context, I want to draw his attention to a report today in The Australian Financial Review which sets out, as has been acknowledged by the NBN Co., that not only are they going to miss their rollout figures for the fixed line fibre-to-the-premise network in brownfield sites by a very large margin, as I mentioned earlier, but they are also going to miss by a very large margin, around 50 per cent, the target for fixed wireless, which is the technology to be used for four per cent of the overall footprint.


I want to see what the minister's view is on the NBN Co.'s explanation for this. The NBN Co.'s chief executive said to a Senate committee last week that the problem with the wireless rollout was due to large trees. I wonder if the minister could reflect on whether a cost-benefit analysis would have identified the fact that in regional Australia there are quite a lot of trees, large and small. It does seem curious that the presence of trees, large trees, would come as a shock to the NBN Co. and that it had not been anticipated. The other reason to which the chief executive of the NBN Co. attributed this huge failure to meet their target was inaccurate address information, which I gather means that they could not find their customers. This seems to be an extraordinary failure, and I wonder whether the minister's normal cheerful equanimity will be disturbed by the revelation that the NBN Co. failed to anticipate that there were large trees in Australia, some or all of them containing koalas, no doubt, and that the NBN Co., in addition to that, has failed to be able to find its customers.



A government member interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The honourable member says it is rubbish. I am just quoting what they have said.


The other matter that he might turn his mind to is this point. I seek to get his views on this question of asbestos and fibre to the node by just drawing to his attention the fact that the whole point of a fibre-to-the-node rollout, the justification for it, is that it involves much less civil works. The minister would know that 80 per cent of the cost of a telecom rollout, if not more, is in the civil works. The electronics and the cables are actually a relatively small part of it, even though they are the most obviously ingenious and brilliant. So, by definition, a fibre-to-the-node rollout, while it does not exclude exposure to asbestos-containing materials entirely—and no-one has suggested that it does, least of all me—does of necessity mean that the infrastructure between the street cabinet and the customer's premise is not being disturbed in the way it is with a fibre-to-the-premise rollout. That is why there is not the need to dig up and replace millions of Telstra pits and thousands of kilometres of Telstra ducts and pipes. I just want to draw that to the minister's attention and see if that would cause him to review his opinion.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:04):  I would also like to ask the minister about the National Broadband Network and how, under Labor's National Broadband Network every home and business will be able to connect to the NBN by 2021, and some areas sooner than others such as mine and the member for Chifley's. I understand that 11.8 million premises will be directly connect by fibre.


I also note that the coalition has a document which proposes to connect only 2.8 million premises directly to fibre, mostly premises in new developments, and that will mean that there will be nine million Australian households and businesses that would disconnected from Labor's NBN unless they pay up to $5,000 for it, leading to some quite perverse results, including, as I know you are aware, minister, and reported in the Blacktown Advocate on 22 April that:


Blacktown will become a city of broadband haves and have nots under the coalition's watered-down version of the National Broadband Network.


I also note that National Party policy 2012-13 states as follows:


The Nationals' policy is to place a priority on rolling out fibre optic cable to the majority of consumers in regional Australia first.


The NBN, as I know you are aware, minister, will deliver fibre to the home to 70 per cent of regional premises, which I know the member for Page would be very interested in as well. I note that the Nationals' Senator Joyce said in 2009 that the National Broadband Network is 'truly the Nationals' broadband network' as it has been 'lifted', according to Senator Joyce, straight from the Page Research Centre's position paper in 2005 into telecommunications. The senator said, 'How could we disagree with something that is quite evidently our idea?'


As you may be aware, minister, the National Party appears to have rejected that now think that regional Australia can make do with a fibre-to-the-node model. I also draw attention to the coalition's document which states that nine million premises will be served what former senator Nick Minchin described in 2009 as 75,000 'large equipment cabinets' similar in size to large refrigerators connected to mains power, including fans or air conditioners. I did not say this, the then Senator Minchin said: 'I do not think anybody would really want one of these large cabinets outside their home'.


Minister, you may also have seen and been aware of what Senator Nash has said about the coalition's plan and what it would mean for regional Australia. In 2007 she said:


The people of rural and regional Australia know a furphy when they see one. It is widely understood in the telecommunications industry that FTTN will not deliver improved broadband speeds for rural and regional areas.


The senator also said about fibre to the node, 'It is a furphy. It is fraudulent.'. Senator Nash said:


In spruiking their flawed fibre-to-the-node plan Labor are doing one of two things: they are either deluding themselves and at the same time the Australian public if they think FTTN will deliver high-speed broadband to rural and regional areas, or they are being deliberately deceitful and are trying to trick the public into supporting a plan they know is flawed.


I also note Senator Boswell said: 'Fibre to the node just will not work in rural and regional Australia'. And while on the subject of rural and regional Australia, as an aside, minister, you may also be aware of the principle in Labor's NBN of wholesale equivalent of pricing, whereas the alternative document proposes to get rid of this and exacerbate the digital divide not only on accessibility but also affordability as between regional and metropolitan areas. I also note former BT CTO Peter Cochrane said, 'fibre to the cabinet is one of the biggest mistakes humanity has made'.


As I said in parliament yesterday, statistics have shown that Labor's NBN, prior to the coalition releasing its alternative, had the support of 73 per cent of Australians. That figure actually went up afterwards to be 78 per cent support from people compared to the alternative. So my question, minister, is: what are the benefits of rolling out fibre to 11.8 million homes and businesses in Australia?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (18:09):  I thank the members for their contributions. Firstly, to the member for Wentworth who mentioned Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia was established very proudly by this government. When they produced their first report to COAG in May 2009, they identified progress moving forward of what would be required to truly develop economic productivity through nation-building infrastructure. Table 2 identifies infrastructure priorities under seven themes. Theme 1 is a National Broadband Network.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  they then went on to speak about developing a more extensive, accessible and globally competitive broadband system. 'Infrastructure Australia supports an investment from the Building Australia Fund to develop the National Broadband Network.' This mob opposite have gone around and promised funding for infrastructure projects on the back of an envelope before there is any analysis whatsoever—




Mr Turnbull:
  As opposed to the back of a beer coaster.




Mr ALBANESE:
  As opposed to the Infrastructure Australia system whereby 15 out of 15 projects have been funded, including four projects in the last budget that we are dealing with in these appropriations for additional projects—two of which, the Melbourne metro project and the cross river rail project, in spite of Infrastructure Australia's recommendations and support, and in spite of the fact that negotiations had concluded with both the respective state governments. Under pressure from the federal opposition, they have walked away from this. In Brisbane we know, as a result of the state government failing to support its own proposal for the cross river rail project, they are now proposing that they will rip out the seats from the trains so people will have to stand up on the trains. That is the alternative infrastructure vision of those opposite.


I am asked by the member for Greenway about a range of issues with regard to the digital divide. The great advantage of the NBN is overcoming regional disadvantage and disadvantage between people who live in different parts of our capital cities. What the NBN has done in places like Blacktown, where it has been rolled out in the electorates of Greenway and Chifley, is provide economic opportunity. If those opposite have their way, as has been identified, some people in the community will have the NBN and some people will not. They will have a second-rate system. That is of enormous regret.


What is extraordinary is the National Party rolling over on the issue of wholesale pricing equivalent—a principle which says that whether you live in Burnie, Ballarat, Marrickville or Vaucluse, you pay the same amount which is something that is absolutely essential to equity in the system. Those opposite have not done that. I note that it was a National Party member who came up with 'fraudband'. I say very clearly that the shadow minister for 'fraudband' and the copper economy should be embarrassed by his party's position, because to have fibre to some and copper to others after it goes through what the member for Wentworth says is a bar fridge on the corner of particular streets is just extraordinary. He acknowledges it is essentially a fridge-like large structure which will appear all over the suburbs. Every single one of those fridges will be a symbol of the backward nature of those who want to keep us in the copper age rather than the fibre age.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:15):  The 2013-14 budget continues the government's strong investment in regional Australia and its commitment to working in partnership with regional economies in transition and to helping develop creative solutions to those regions—to support better economic, social and environmental outcomes across all of those regional communities. This budget invests record amounts in community-driven investment. In the budget we have built on our existing commitment to regional Australia, through the Regional Development Australia Fund, to finance very important infrastructure projects that address the specific economic and community needs of all of our regions.


From the first two rounds, we have invested some $350 million to leverage projects already worth $1.2 billion across the community. Already 75 projects are under way ensuring people living in rural and regional Australia are getting the services and support that they need, supporting the improvement and construction of regional infrastructure, community sporting and youth associations and cultural projects across regional Australian communities.


We have been strengthening governance, improving infrastructure and supporting economic development in Australia's Indian Ocean territories, committing to Norfolk Island reform, meeting the operating deficit of the Norfolk Island government but at the same time strengthening governance and improving services for the benefit of the island's economy and its residents, particularly in the area of apprenticeships and child protection. They are two very important areas of the island and are in desperate need. We have also been extending the operation of the Reconstruction Inspectorate and the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce to ensure that every cent of our flood-rebuilding package goes where it is needed and helps flood-affected communities to rebuild their roads, bridges, rail lines and public facilities so that they can get their lives back on track.


In the budget we are also contributing to the future economic development of North Queensland and supporting activities that enhance Indigenous and community engagement to facilitate the opportunities that are available under the Australia in the Asian century white paper. It is important also as part of this budget that we recognise the important role that local government plays across this country. The budget includes funding, as we have been debating, to conduct a referendum on the financial recognition of local government in the Australian constitution. That referendum will be held on the same date as the 2013 election and $10 million has been funded for a national civics campaign and education campaign, which is to provide information to the general public about the referendum. It is some time since we have had a referendum. There are generations of kids who have not had exposure to what that means and they will be voting for the first time, so the civics education campaign is very important.


The 2013 budget also includes a $25 million package to create jobs and encourage a generation of arts and creative businesses. The minister here will talk a little more about that. There is also additional funding being provided in the sports portfolio. We want to continue the very successful, Active After-school Communities program. It is a terrific program that has been doing great work in small and large schools across the country. The program is extended for one calendar year until December 2014. The program also supports around 2,000 primary schools and 1,200 out-of-school care services to provide quality sport programs.


The budget also increases the intelligence, investigative and results-management capabilities of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority and it enhances the National Integrity of Sport Unit's ability to assess and respond to information about drugs and corruption in sport. Our commitment in this budget to regional Australia and its long-term economic and social sustainability is strong. It is something that members on this side of the House have felt very passionately about for a long time and I am very pleased that in this budget we continue that commitment to regional Australia. The portfolio continues to look forward to strengthening those relationships across Australia, particularly through our involvement with regional development through our RDA network; local government, importantly, to get those linkages between the RDA network and local government right; services to the territories; and arts and sport—that is part of our portfolio—to drive even stronger regional growth and a more sustainable nation to capitalise in particular on the opportunities of the Asian century. I welcome questions.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:20):  It is a pity the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government is not with us; otherwise, I would be referring the minister to program 1.1 of his department's PBS and asking the minister to explain where this funding, which is supposed to be for regional Australia, is being spent. Does the minister agree with his predecessor that regional Australia is all of Australia? Is the minister aware of the definition of 'regional Australia' used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics? Does his department use this definition when meeting the objectives listed under program 1.1? How did the minister's department come to define 'regional Australia' as it does; was it a ministerial decision? Will the minister confirm that the largest regional infrastructure project that Labor has funded is the $480 million investment in roads around Perth Airport? Last time I checked, Perth was a capital city. So does the minister consider Perth to be part of regional Australia?


I refer the minister to the Sydney Multicultural Arts and Sports Precinct that has just been funded under round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund. Does the minister consider Sydney to be part of regional Australia? I refer the minister to Melbourne's Western Indoor Sports Hub, the WISH project precinct, which has been funded under round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund. Does the minister consider Western Melbourne to be part of regional Australia?


I ask the minister to explain why the Gillard government has given preferential treatment to projects proposed in Western Sydney, allowing 20 projects to proceed to full application status in the RDA Fund, whereas every other region was only permitted to submit their top three projects. Will the minister justify for the benefit of the House why the Gillard government broke promises made to regional Australia when they formed government and why, in the last three years, they have reduced spending on regional Australia? How can the minister now defend Labor's Regional Development Australia Fund, which actually spends $90 million per year less than the regional fund it replaced, the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program?


I refer the minister to the objective of his department listed on page 36 of the portfolio budget statement:


… drives regional policy to improve social, economic and environmental outcomes for regional Australians.


I ask the minister: how does the government's carbon tax improve the social, economic and environmental outcomes for regional Australians? Does the minister agree that the Gillard government's carbon tax will drive up the cost of living for regional Australians without saving the environment? Minister, given regional Australia will suffer the greatest impact because most of our power generation, mining and manufacturing sectors reside in regional Australia, will you advise the House what actions your department will take to drive regional policy? Given Australians in regional New South Wales spent 25 per cent more on electricity than those in Sydney, and Australians in regional Victoria spent 30 per cent more than those in Melbourne—

Mr BALDWIN:
  what steps will the minister take to drive social, economic and environmental regional policy?

Mr BALDWIN:
  I am, Madam Deputy Speaker. The whole issue here is regional Australia. Why is all of Australia considered regional Australia? Why aren't regional Australia funds just for regional areas? Why are the capital cities included in regional Australia funding? Weren't you smart enough to develop an urban development fund and a regional fund? Because what you are doing is taking money out of the bush and putting it directly back into the city.

Ms KING:
  I am happy to facilitate the ongoing debate about this by withdrawing that comment. As the minister responsible for many of the issues you have raised, I am very happy to discuss them. I am really disappointed that the shadow minister for this area does not seem to understand what regional development is about. There are many people—like me, like the member opposite and like the many regional members who have come here today—who live in what are classified as regional or provincial cities. But that is not the sole definition of regional development. It never has been. It has not been the sole definition across the entire history of academic work in regional development. There are regions in capital cities, there are regions in outer metropolitan areas, there are regions in and around provincial cities and there are regions in and around rural towns. The RDA network we have developed was in fact based on the previous government's area consultative committee councils. Are you telling me that you had no area consultative committee councils in city areas?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill
):  The minister will direct her remarks through the chair.




Ms KING:
  My apologies, Deputy Speaker. Is the shadow member saying that there were no area consultative committees in city areas? I have a recollection that there were five area consultative committees covering the area of Melbourne and that they put in applications under the Regional Partnerships programs—and, I think, were successful. I have a vague recollection too of an inner Sydney area getting support under the Regional Partnerships program—for a project on a beach.


I cannot believe that the shadow minister, who is purporting to be the developer of regional development policy for the opposition, does not seem to understand regional development. Let me go to one particular project announced out of round 4 of the Regional Development Australia Fund which was raised by the shadow minister—the project in Werribee. I do not know whether you have ever visited Werribee, but let me suggest to you that you might want to do that. When I was in Werribee with the Prime Minister announcing that RDAF round 4 project, I was delighted to meet the lovely mayor, Heather, who is from there. She was originally born in my electorate in Trawalla, where Jim Scullin was born—I am very proud to have that association. She talked about how Werribee was a town of 8,000 people when she first moved there. It is, and was always viewed as, a country town. My sister moved there 20 years ago. It is a tiny country town. It has faced enormous population growth, which is terrific.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms KING:
  I am glad that you have been there. So you know that Werribee is a country town which has faced enormous pressure from population growth exploding out of Melbourne. The community had a tiny basketball stadium which was servicing a huge population. The opportunity to make that a regional sporting facility, a centre for basketball for the west of Victoria, is a terrific opportunity.


Again I say to the shadow minister: you clearly do not understand regional development. It is not just about regional provincial cities; it is also about regions and regional areas that cover a whole raft of areas. I know, having been in this area for a while, that the shadow minister is committed to making sure that we have good policy across our regions. I remind the shadow minister that, under the Regional Partnerships program, you did fund a whole raft of projects—some of which were successful and some of which were questionable, to be quite honest, particularly those in the private sector—and perhaps you might want to reflect on that when you ask a question.

Creative Australia aims to ensure that the cultural sector, incorporating all aspects of the arts, heritage and the creative industries, has the skills, resources and resilience to play an active role in Australia's future. I want to pay tribute to my predecessor in the portfolio, the member for Hotham, for the work that he did in putting together Creative Australia.


Additional funding has been provided to the arts portfolio to ensure that the Australia Council can meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving artistic practice through provision of $75.3 million in new funding, including $15 per annum in additional funding for arts organisations to address unfunded excellence; $1.25 million per annum in funding to harness excellence in the major performing arts companies; $1 million per annum for training and development to build the professional capacity of the arts sector; $1 million per annum to develop and implement a detailed and systematic data collection program; establish a new funding program for the newly formed Creative Partnerships Australia at a cost of $8.6 million over two years; continuing training available to students through our elite arts training organisations through a provision of $20.8 million over four years; establish the arts ready program to address skills through targeted on-the-job training at a cost of $3.4 million over four years; provide $9.3 million over four years to six major performing arts companies to ensure they can continue to tell innovative and uniquely Australian stories; extend the existing Indigenous Languages Support program and enable funding to language projects based in the Torres Strait by providing an additional $14 million over four years; provide $11.3 million over four years to continue the successful Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program; continue the ArtStart program to assist recent arts graduates to grow their professional practice into a sustainable business at a cost of $9.7 million over four years; establish a digital content fund supporting Australian digital production at a cost of $10 million over four years; and ensure a one-off $20 million location incentive to increase Australia's competitiveness as a world-class filming destination.


As part of the $235 million package, funding was also provided through other portfolios to ensure $40 million in funding for cultural infrastructure, as parts of rounds 3 and 4 of the Regional Australia Development Fund, to continue the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project and to assist community groups that operate self-help radio retransmission facilities in regional and remote areas at a cost of $5.1 million over four years; provide $8 million over two years to establish the Creative Young Stars program to encourage, support and celebrate creative, cultural, academic and community achievement.


We are very proud to release Creative Australia and believe it provides a strong strategic framework for government investment in the arts, cultural heritage and creative industries, establishing a solid base for future growth and improved sustainability in the sector.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (18:32):  As a regional member, I am very pleased to be participating tonight. I certainly have some questions for the minister for regional services later in relation to some of the government's massive investment right throughout regional Australia.


When I look at my electorate, I see more than $1.5 billion of major investment in community infrastructure in a regional area, in roads, in health facilities and in community facilities. It has made a really big difference to my area. This budget commits almost $1 billion through the Regional Development Australia Fund, to finance infrastructure projects throughout the nation. I am very proud that we have delivered so much.


I am really excited tonight to be talking about the $500,000 from the RDAF for the Knox Park youth precinct at Murwillumbah. This is funded by the Tweed Shire Council, which is matching the federal Labor government's commitment of $500,000. It is a fantastic investment and the project will deliver a range of recreational facilities for a whole range of age groups including an adventure playground and a plaza style skate park. This particular park has needed to be upgraded for a long period of time. We were very proud to make the announcement. It is going to make a very big difference to that area. This is what RDAF funding does; it really makes a huge investment in regional areas and delivers great results.


I was also really pleased only a couple of weeks ago on 21 May when the minister for regional development was in my area and we turned the sod at the Arkinstall Park Sports Centre at Tweed heads. That received $5 million from in the previous round of RDAF funding. It is a great investment in our area. That is to complete and do some major upgrades on our netball and tennis courts. When it is completed we will have an international-style facility for tennis and netball which we can be really proud of.


It will also be a great training facility, with the Commonwealth Games just up the road at the Gold Coast in 2018. If they are looking for some training they can just come over the border to Tweed Heads and we will have that wonderful sporting facility there which will make a huge difference. Really importantly, it is going to make a very big difference to our region. Our kids will be able to use international-style sporting facilities, which is so important. Of course, the economic benefits from all these projects just go on and on. There are so many.


I do not have the time to talk about all the funding in my electorate when it comes to regional development but, previously, under the other programs, there was $9.5 million for the sport and recreation centre at Byron Bay; $2.7 million for the cultural and community centre at Lennox Head; and $2 million for the community centre at Murwillumbah. That all came out of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program—our previous regional development program—and that has made a massive difference to the community as well.


I also want to touch on the incredible upgrades to the Pacific Highway that we have had in my area which have made a big difference to our region. There was $359 million for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway at Sexton Hill and more than $500 million for the Pacific Highway upgrade between Tintenbar and Ewingsdale. Of course, we have also had the BER—another great investment. There was $115 million worth of upgrades to 90 local schools. What a difference that has made to our kids and what they can access in terms of their educational opportunities?


Also, there was $7 million for our GP superclinic at Tweed Heads, which opened its doors last Friday—a great, great achievement—and $1.8 million for the Jack Evans Boat Harbour redevelopment. Finally—we have another very important one--$2 million from this government was delivered for Australia's first high-performance surfing centre at Casuarina. We actually have the world's only high-performance centre or surfing—a great institute at Casuarina, just near Kingscliff. We have a lot of surfing greats that will come there and provide a mentoring service for young people. We are very proud to have the world's first. It truly remarkable.


That all adds up to more than $1.5 billion—a remarkable investment my electorate of Richmond. What you see from this government is real investment in real projects right throughout regional Australia and right across the board, whether it is roads, health facilities or community infrastructure. I have seen firsthand the benefits of all these facilities and the difference that they make. I would certainly like to hear a bit more from the minister, and I would like the Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories to outline the importance of this government's support for regional Australia—particularly touching on our Regional Development Australia Fund and the difference that it makes local communities like mine.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:37):  I thank the member for highlighting the project in her electorate recently funded under RDAF 3. Regional Development Australia Fund round 3 has been a very successful round. We took the opportunity after each round to review, to listen to stakeholders and to go out and talk to the RDA network about what was happening with that round. One of the things that we were fed back was that often it was difficult for small communities and small towns to compete against larger councils. So that round was specifically designed for towns under 30,000. I was really delighted to see that round fund some 79 projects right the way across the country and in some communities that are very disadvantaged and which would not previously have had the opportunity to apply for that funding of up to $500,000—many applications were smaller than that—and make a substantial difference across each of those rounds.


The member has also highlighted that this government's commitment to regional Australia is not just about RDAF. I know people often want to focus on that particular program, but it has been across all areas of government. There has been significant investment through the Building the Education Revolution, primarily focused on schools. A large proportion of that money has gone to schools in regional, rural and remote Australia, providing opportunities for small communities that have never, for example, had access to libraries before—because those facilities are opened up to community members. The BER provided libraries, electronic whiteboards, meeting spaces and sporting infrastructure for small regional and small rural communities across the country.


Our investment in health included the Regional Cancer Centres. There has been significant investment by this government in improving the terrible divide that occurs in this country between city people who are diagnosed with cancer and people who live in regional and rural Australia who are diagnosed with cancer.


We know the health outcomes and survival rates of people diagnosed with cancer in regional and rural Australia are some five years behind their metropolitan counterparts. We know that is not good enough. When you look across health, whether it is through GP super clinics, hospitals and health funds, which have seen investments in major health projects across the country but particularly in regional areas, right the way through to the regional integrated, that is very important and this government is very proud of them.


I also want to touch on the government's education reforms which we saw pass the House recently. Again I reiterate how incredibly important those reforms are because of the loading on the basis of size and locational disadvantage and what that means for regional students. I cannot overemphasise how critical that investment is to regional Australia. I think that the New South Wales National Party minister absolutely gets it. It is not something we often admit to but I know many regional MPs on this side of the House are very fond of members of the National Party. We share a lot in common in terms of the seats we represent. We do not often say that. I know many National Party members are of good heart and understand that the education reforms are a significant advantage to regional Australians and to many regional and rural schools.


I hope sense prevails across the country and that National Party members are listened to. In New South Wales, the National Party education minister absolutely gets it. This is critical. Our students in regional Australia are going to be left behind if we do not deal with this issue, if we do not put serious investment into our education system and increase funding on the basis of location and size. It is absolutely critical that we do so. The bills have now passed the House of Representatives. I certainly hope they pass the other place. What I absolutely hope is that the politics we have seen played out across the country is put aside—about not wanting, in someone's political spin doctoring mind, to give the government an advantage if Gonski gets through, that we cannot possibly allow them a win. I hope that sort of commentary, which we are seeing from Liberal and National Party coalition governments in some states, is put aside and that we see increases in funding to regional students. There are some $6 billion that regional and rural schools will benefit from; under the opposition's policy $16 billion will be cut. I hope the Nationals see sense on this.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:42):   I would be prepared to give the minister an extension of time if she is going to continue to praise the National Party. I congratulate the member for Ballarat for her rise on 25 March to be Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories. I am sure she will do a good job. I also acknowledge the fact that the member for Eden Monaro on 4 February was appointed Minister for Defence Materiel. It is good that Labor is finally recognising that they should have ministers from the bush, from rural Australia. Correct me if I am wrong here;  howl me down if you will.



Honourable member interjecting—





Mr McCORMACK:
  No, I am right about that. The only other member of the Gillard-Rudd ministry who came from a country area was the member for Hunter who was Minister for Defence between December 2007 and June 2009—I think that is correct. I acknowledge the fact that Labor is recognising—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  You can have your say—



Honourable members interjecting—





Mr McCORMACK:
  No, as ministers I am talking about.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Riverina might need to do his homework before he comes to the chamber, rather than call on the other people in the class to answer the questions.




Mr McCORMACK:
  I acknowledge all the other ministers in the room who come from regional Australia. It is great that Labor is finally recognising that good people from regional Australia are here to represent the portfolio areas. I also want to acknowledge the fact that in round 3 of the RDAF funding Tumbarumba in my electorate will receiving $340,000 for a sports stadium. I appreciate that. I am always very balanced on these things. I expressed concern last night in the parliament about the fact that the electorates of Watson and Lalor are receiving funding in the next round, round 4. I do hope that Tumut shire, which was one of the final applicants for funding for Gocup Road, receive that funding because that is a vital corridor for transport and industry in that region.


I have some questions here from the shadow minister for sport, who is unable to be here. Is the relevant minister here or should I put them on notice?




Mr Burke:
  Madam Acting Deputy Speaker O'Neill, a point of order: if the member asks them, the conversation might move on and someone will find out and get a note to us, and we will be able to answer them, if not immediately then before we wind up.




Mr McCORMACK:
  I will ask the ones that I can ask in the time I have left and I will put the others on notice. The member for Cowper asks: what is it the total value of all spending commitments by the Australian government in relation to the 2015 Asian Cup, including in-kind support, debt forgiveness, the Major Events Taskforce and direct assistance? What does the Australian public receive in return for contributions such as the substantial amount of money provided for a regional soccer tournament? What was the one-off grant of $50,000 to Football Federation Australia for which was provided sometime between January and May? Who authorised the grant? Under what program was the grant given? What is the anticipated final cost to the taxpayer for the rectification works of the AIS European training centre, including the cost of the review by Copa International SRL? Was any damage and defects caused by athletes through either accident or poor behaviour? The budget allocated an additional $1.8 million to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority over three years. Does this money increase represent a doubling of ASADA's investigative resources, as promised by the minister for sport at the 7 February press conference? The budget allocated an additional $3 million for the Major Events Taskforce. What will this $3 million be used for? How will the Major Events Taskforce be different from previous arrangements in relation to major events such as the 2006 Commonwealth Games?


The member for Cowper is unable to be here, but they are the questions he would like answered by the relevant minister. I do thank the House and I thank Labor for recognising that there are many good people amongst its ranks from regional areas to represent rural and regional Australia—real Australia.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (18:47):  I will briefly cover a couple of points. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that you have pointed to funding under Regional Development Australia round 3 that was in your electorate. I am happy that that project has been widely welcomed in your electorate, as it has been across the 79 project areas that were funded under that. I think that round has been a very good round and some good lessons were learned about the importance of supporting smaller rural communities as part of that. I know members here also had a number of projects in their own electorates that have been important as well.


The member for Maranoa, a good representative of regional Australia, got four projects under round 3 in his electorate—with three projects totalling $1.2 million. I was very disappointed that I did not get, 'Yes, that's fantastic; we got three projects' and all I got, 'Where's my fourth?' I have to say that was very disappointing. I heard him on ABC regional radio bemoaning the fact that the fourth project did not get up. He was saying, 'I don't just want the three projects; I want more and I'm disappointed.' He also said that it was a rort and everything had gone down the eastern seaboard. Frankly, I was disappointed that he called it a rort in the sense that he got three projects and not four.


In terms of the questions asked around RDAF 4, we have made decisions on that round. They will be announced over the course of the next month and I am looking forward to visiting many communities across the country to announce those projects. I was very pleased to announce the project in Werribee, which we discussed briefly before. Another project that we announced was in Sydney. Again, this is a very important arts and cultural precinct, which will be very important for that region. I know that it will make a substantial difference there. Also, a project that was announced in my own electorate, in Ballarat, was a regional soccer facility. Another very important project was announced in the member for Corangamite's electorate, not in my electorate, which I am sure he will have much to say about.


In reference to the sports questions, all of those issues were substantially covered in Senate estimates; they were discussed in quite a lot of detail. There were a number of hours of debate on them. So I say to the member for Cowper that the Senate estimates really did cover all of those questions.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2013-06-05,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (18:50):  I think it is really positive that we are able to talk about an outstanding program that is available to rural and regional Australia—no matter how you want to define it. Most people in this room have only something very positive to say about it.




Opposition member interjecting—





Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  I suppose it is still lingering for some of them. My friend from the Riverina has also been a recipient. His community won that argument in a very competitive round and so they merited RDA funding. I congratulate them on that. Before I go on and discuss a couple of mine, if I may, I want to say that I have had the privilege of having both ministers, who are here at the moment, visit my electorate in terms of their portfolios. To our new minister, may I congratulate you on that.


There are two programs that I want to mention in passing. The Active After-schools Community program is a fantastic program, and it has been largely rolled out in my electorate. We have a fantastic number of schools involved in it, and I do want to commend the government and also the continuation of its funding, Minister. Then there is the Creative Young Stars Program, which was announced recently and the $27,000 for every electorate. I congratulate the minister on that. I suppose he can read about it in Hansard rather than hear me talk about it.


Another program that I would like to talk about is Happy feet at the Penguin Athletics centre. In round 1, the Central Coast Council—where I used to be a councillor; and I am very proud to have been a councillor—applied for funding and missed out. Like many councils, they were determined to learn from round 1, and they were successful in round 2. Effectively, they got $520,000 from us, along with their investment. What is so fantastic about these programs is that you get the co-investment of the communities, and so their contribution of $531,000 will be put towards revamping what we call the Dial Regional Sports Complex. This funding has allowed the community to completely redo the surface, which will make it an all-weather surface and, at the same time, fix up a lot of the seating, as well as revamp the administration building and associated other builds. The Central Coast Council is a council that does not ask for much, unless it is in there pitching itself as well. This is a genuine regional sports complex, carrying out really important work—and that is, first and foremost, the health and wellbeing of our region and communities. A lot of RDA funding is associated with community health programs, so it is great for infrastructure and also very, very important for the health and wellbeing of our communities.


The other great thing about many of these projects is that they involve employment. This is very important, particularly in rural and regional Australia as we are challenged economically in a number of areas for a whole variety of reasons—it is a fact. These projects are very important for stimulating and sustaining employment. One thing that I forgot to add about the regional sports complex project—and, hopefully, Minister, you will be able to open it when it is completed—is that it involves improved lighting so that we will be able to have night programs for the region. I do congratulate the Central Coast Council on gaining that funding.


More recently—let me tell you: if you have not visited this place, you must—there was King Island, the absolute jewel in the crown of Tasmania. Every cow has a name; it is just called in personally to be milked. King Island has the most extraordinary cheese and beef that you can imagine. Not only is it going to have two world-class golf courses—



An honourable member:  Do cows play golf?




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  The cows play golf! You put your bag on the cow and you take it around the golf course with you!


However, very importantly, you have to get onto the island. What have we got? The minister came over just recently: $500,000 to a project of well over a million dollars to completely upgrade the terminal. It is going to not only provide better amenity on the island but bring in even more tourists. There are no cows in this terminal! It is a fantastic project, and congratulations to the council. Minister, I am sure you will be able to enlighten us on other similar rural and regional projects and the importance of them to local communities.

With the member for Parramatta, I convene the Labor Friends of the Arts, so I have worked with the previous minister, Minister Crean, and had a great function the other day with Minister Burke. Minister, my question is: in this modern world of social media and changing links around the world, how are we going to tell Australian stories and help define Australian culture—that vast, shifting Australian culture? What are the economic opportunities associated with that? Can you tell us about the new money contained in the budget for the reform of the Australia Council, which is the Australian government's principal arts funding body? Could you also touch on this exciting new program, the Creative Young Stars Program?

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports—Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (18:56):  I thank the member for Moreton for that neat segue into the Creative Young Stars Program. I am not sure that I will be able to compete with the thespian parliamentary secretary who preceded me. The worth of this project came very sharply into focus for me after I met James Morrison at the Jazz Bell Awards and he told me that 3½ thousand young people were gathering in Mount Gambier, three or four weekends ago, to learn from Australia's international jazz musicians and the LA big band that had flown in specially from LA, which refused to do any commercial appearances. These people aged under 25 from all over Australia were coming to exhibit their creativity.


We know of these kinds of functions that take place all across Australia. We know of young people from all of our electorates who are desperate to get some way into a pathway into work in this area, to develop their creativity, and Creative Young Stars is just the program. It comes out of Creative Australia. This government has undertaken and designed it to help young people to achieve their full potential in the arts, creative industries, community service and the educational sector by developing their skills, abilities and professional connections and, as we said, opening up opportunities for work.


This is a similar program to the program we have developed in the area of sports. We do not want Australians just to be seen as brilliant sportsmen; we also want to see our National Cultural Policy develop in a creative Australia accessible to the young people of Australia. Creative Young Stars will see young people up to 25 years of age with the ability to apply for $8 million allocated across Australia to every federal seat equally. Grants are in four categories, for performing arts, cultural activities, academic endeavour and school and community achievement. The grants will help gifted young people to participate in such events as eisteddfods, public-speaking tournaments and cultural, artistic and academic events—and, just like Mr Morrison recommended, in events like Generations in Jazz, which took place in Mount Gambier for the 25th year.


The first application will be through your federal MP, who can grant up to 12 awards and two group grants in the electorate. Individuals are able to access $500 and groups are able to get grants of $3,000 for groups of six or more members. The grants for Creative Young Stars open on 1 June and close on 21 June. You can visit the youth.gov.au website for information and application forms and I expect it will be of great use to all members of parliament, not just government members. We are expecting enthusiastic participation on behalf of the young people in your electorates in regional and rural Australia as well as right across all of the cities. I pay great tribute to the Office for the Arts which, if members of parliament are not energetic enough, is going to follow up through all the regional art networks, making sure that young people right across this country—not just where there are active members of parliament—can access this wonderful program.
