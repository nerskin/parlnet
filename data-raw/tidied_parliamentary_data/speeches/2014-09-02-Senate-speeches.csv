"PRESIDENT, The",,2014-09-02,"



The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  Honourable senators, yesterday during debate on the second reading of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, Senator O'Sullivan took a point of order on a remark by Senator Waters in relation to the Premier of Queensland in which Senator Waters alleged corrupt conduct.


The Temporary Chair of Committees, Senator Smith, did not hear the allegation but asked Senator Waters to withdraw it, which she did. However, Senator Waters then suggested that an inference from the particular circumstances remained. There were further points of order and Senator Waters clarified that she did not assert that the Premier had personally received any money.


I remind honourable senators that standing order 193(3) protects members of other houses, including state parliaments, against offensive words, imputations of improper motives and personal reflections. All such remarks are considered highly disorderly. It is clearly disorderly to make a direct assertion of corruption. An inference linking receipt of funds or in-kind support with particular action invites certain conclusions and may also offend the prohibition against personal reflections. Consideration of the proof Hansard shows that Senator Waters sailed dangerously close to doing so but, having clarified what she meant, was allowed to continue by the chair.


I remind all senators of the need for courtesy in debate in accordance with the standing orders. I also remind senators of the need to listen to and respect the chair.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:16): Pursuant to standing order 115(2)(a), I move:


That the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Repeal and Other Measures Bill 2014 be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 23 October 2014.


I have a whole range of reasons for this motion. Most importantly, however, it is so we can understand what filthy deal has been done. So far we here in parliament are learning more from tweets than we are from the chamber, the minister involved and the PUP Senators who have once again been mugged and conned by this government. 


This is a government that promised no surprises. This is a government which is a shambles. I saw the Treasurer in the chamber just before shaking hands. After his debacle at his party room meeting this morning, when the Prime Minister of Australia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the senior Western Australia minister slapped him down for attacking Colin Barnett, we can understand why he is so desperate to get any sort of win over any piece of legislation. 


This chamber deserves and is entitled to understand exactly what these measures do. There may have been a few nice cups of tea between Senator Lazarus and Mr Hockey, but that does not suffice as parliamentary debate. He may have been so willing to give you whatever it is that you think you have got, Senator Lazarus, but it is incumbent upon you to come into this chamber and explain to the Australian public, in more than a two- or three-minute speech, what you think the impacts here are. You have to justify and explain to the seven million to eight million Australians receiving superannuation why they are now getting less superannuation because of PUP. PUP needs to explain why that is the case. 


Senator Lazarus interjected before. He said that they want the money now. If they want the money now, why are you repealing the low-income superannuation contribution? Why are you repealing the income support bonus? Why are you repealing the schoolkids bonus? You are trying to pretend that you are keeping them for a while, but you say yourself that the Australian public needs the money now. You know who the last person was who said something like that when it came to superannuation? His name was Norm Gallagher. Norm Gallagher opposed superannuation payments in the 1980s because, he said, 'The workers need them now.' So you are up there with Norm Gallagher with your vision and your understanding of superannuation. 


Australia's superannuation scheme is considered worldwide to be a gold star superannuation scheme that ensures that Australians do not need to live in poverty and do not need government contributions into the future in order to live. All around the world people look at our superannuation system and give it a big tick. But we have the Norm Gallagher approach from Senator Lazarus, who says, 'No, the people need the money now'—and then he cuts a whole bunch of benefits to ordinary Australians. The hypocrisy of this position genuinely needs to be explained. To support the gag and to do the deal on the amendments is one thing, but to vote against sending this to committee is an entirely different standard. 


Senator Xenophon has quoted Senator Minchin, but that does not matter to PUP. You go into your party room and allegedly have disputes. Maybe you even compare notes with Mr Hockey about what it is like to have a fight in your party room on a given day. I do not know what is behind this. But these amendments deserve to be scrutinised. They do not deserve to be shoved through the Senate as if it were a sausage machine. There is no difference if you are supporting these amendments. You should not be afraid to have these amendments put through a Senate committee so that the parliament and the people of Australia can absolutely understand. What are you afraid of in PUP? Why are you afraid of scrutiny? Why do you want to put these amendments through this morning? Why cannot they go, as per this motion I have moved, to a Senate committee? 


Apparently the Prime Minister has already booked the blue room and Mr Hockey is desperate for a win this morning to cover his debacle of a performance in the party room. You, PUP, are going to be complicit in covering up what Mr Hockey has been up to this morning. Why cannot this chamber have an examination of these amendments for a few weeks?

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-09-02,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:22):  I support Senator Conroy's motion to refer the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Repeal and Other Measures Bill to a committee. It is absolutely imperative that there is an opportunity to scrutinise what this deal actually does. I can tell you this: what it does is cast a real blow to every working Australian's superannuation, because it is saying: 'Big miners, get out there and pop your champagne corks. Clive Palmer has just delivered for himself and for you—for Rio Tinto, for BHP, for all of them—a mega windfall gain.' If ever there was a conflict of interest, it is this one. 


How is it possible that you can have a coal billionaire voting down a mining tax? His friends in the mining industry get off scot-free, and who pays? They have frozen the superannuation entitlements of ordinary working Australians for seven years so that over there in the corporate boardrooms of the mining industry they can drink their champagne. I bet they sit here and think what a great effort it was all those years ago, when they negotiated the mining tax, that they ran an advertising campaign and got it watered down. Then today Clive Palmer delivers for them. This is the Mr Palmer who is trying to open up a mega coalmine in the Galilee Basin in Queensland—the Waratah coalmine—driving climate change. But do we care? No, apparently the Palmer United Party is very happy to abandon carbon pricing—another windfall gain. 


This is exactly what the Australian people were concerned about—the prospect of a mining billionaire coming in here and changing the law to facilitate a benefit to the big miners at the expense of ordinary working Australians. That is an absolute disgrace. As for trying to pitch this as some kind of win, all they are doing is delaying the abolition of the benefits that are here, whether in terms of the schoolkids bonus or anything else. It is just delaying abolition. The Greens are saying that we should be raising money from the big miners in order to put it into health and education and benefits. 


I want to go to the area of superannuation again, because it is critical. Why is it fair that those in the public service, those in politics, including those in the Palmer United Party, sit here and get 15 per cent superannuation going into retirement but that working people are still stuck on nine per cent superannuation? We are saying that for seven years you can be frozen at that level; for seven years you can put up with that so that BHP can pop the champagne corks and so that Gina Rinehart can say, 'Now I've got more profits, I can push the abolition of the minimum wage and do you in even further.' That is where this is going. 


This country has become a plutocracy. Democracy has gone out the window. This is a plutocracy—a government for the wealthy by the wealthy. We now have a deal in here with a coalmining billionaire abolishing tax on coal profits to benefit the big end of town, for whom the Abbott government governs at the expense of ordinary people. That is an absolute disgrace. Then to have it dumped in here as a deal and expect us to deal with it in this short time is completely wrong. We need the opportunity to scrutinise this. That is why it should be going to the committee, as has been proposed, and as we are now debating. 


Whilst there will be big smiles in the Liberal Party rooms and big smiles around the mining tables—big smiles for the Palmer United Party because the leader of the party has just locked in mega profits for himself so that he will never have to pay the mining tax—let's make it very clear that this is a conflict of interest. If anyone in a boardroom were in the same position they would be forced to leave the meeting. We have got to a ridiculous stage in this parliament, in this country, where you can come in here and vote for your own financial self-interest in such a mega way. It is wrong. That is why so many Australians are becoming disillusioned with the parliamentary process, because they look at this parliament and say that it is not these parliamentarians making the decisions; it is big money at the big end of town.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:27):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I find it interesting that the minister wants to jump up and have a debate when he is truncating debate, and he has had the debate in the office of the Treasurer, the cups of tea—




Senator Edwards:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I was clearly in full line of sight, and Senator Cormann was on his feet seconds before the Leader of the Opposition. Review the tape. He was on his feet three seconds before the Leader of the Opposition. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The Leader of the Opposition has the call.




Senator Ludwig:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, what a ridiculous submission Senator Edwards just made: 'Review the tape.' We could all take five minutes to go back and have a look at the tape. It is a ridiculous point of order. Senator Edwards is embarrassed by the coalition's position on this bill and seeks to take a superfluous point of order. It is completely ridiculous. It is a point of order that should fail. It is a point of order that really highlights the coalition's position with respect to this bill. Their position is that they want to ram legislation through the Senate. When you look back at what they have said in the past about this conduct, you see that Senator Edwards is just supporting this position.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ludwig, there is no point of order. You are debating the issue. Senator Wong has the call. 




Senator WONG:
  I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Conroy, and I do so because I think the eight million Australians whose superannuation will now be frozen for seven years are probably entitled to know a bit about it before this Senate votes on it—because that is what this bill does. That is what this dirty deal, which was thrown on the table just a few minutes after the Senate came to order, does. This deal asks us to vote on it straightaway. That is what this deal does. Amidst all the colour and movement and all the procedural shenanigans—the Treasurer and Mr Palmer were in here a few moments ago to watch the deal being delivered—there is a fundamental single proposition here. One thing Australians need to know is that this government and the crossbenchers—Senator Day, Senator Leyonhjelm and PUP—have agreed to freeze your superannuation for seven years. That is the one thing Australians need to know. What I would say is: I don't recall that policy before the election. Does anybody remember Mr Abbott giving that commitment?



Opposition senators interjecting—No!




Senator WONG:
  In fact, I remember Mr Abbott giving a commitment that there will be no adverse changes to superannuation. I think the millions of Australians who have been subjected to this deal, without any opportunity to talk to the people who are trading their money away, without any opportunity to talk to these senators and to hold them accountable for the money that they are trading away, would probably think that having their superannuation frozen for seven or eight years is probably an adverse change. 


You know what: it is the change that dare not speak its name. It is the change the government actually does not want to expose to scrutiny. This is so recent a dirty deal, so secret a dirty deal, that what they are putting to the chamber now is different to what they rammed through the House of Representatives yesterday. I tell you what: this is not calm and methodical government, is it? It is government by deal-making and government by Mr Palmer. That is what it is: government by deal-making behind closed doors and government by Mr Palmer. He is making you break an election commitment: no adverse changes to superannuation. And you do not even have the spine to actually expose this deal to some scrutiny, to actually talk to Australians, because it is their superannuation savings you have traded away in order to get a political win. 


The contempt with which this government clearly hold the Australian people has been on display every day since they were elected and certainly in the budget and subsequently. Day after day after day they break their promises and then they even have the temerity to tell Australians: 'Oh, we're actually not breaking our promises. We're actually not. I know that looks like a cut to health. I know that looks like a cut to education. I know it looks like a cut to the pension. But it's not, really. We're keeping our promises.' This should go to a committee for inquiry, because I think millions of Australian are entitled to know what the rest of this deal is. 


Senator Lazarus got up and said: 'We're keeping things. They get the money now. That's what they need.' What the Palmer United Party have done, despite the fact that they went out so hard on the schoolkids bonus, the income support bonus and the low-income superannuation contribution—I hate to break it to you—is that they are still voting for repeal. They are still voting to cut those things, just a few years later. Senator Lazarus, if I have got it wrong, you stand up and tell me, because I have just looked at the explanatory memorandum and it talks about the date of repeal of those things. So it is a couple more years on repeal but you are still voting to repeal it. You have got a deal where you froze the superannuation of millions of Australians and you are voting to cut the things you said that you would defend. Well, I would like to know and I suspect many Australians would like to know: what else was part of this deal? So far it does not sound like a very good deal. It sounds like a deal that a lot of working people who voted for Palmer United, who voted for senators on the crossbench, would probably reckon is a pretty bad deal. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax Repeal and Other Measures Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:34):  It will not surprise the chamber to hear me say that the government will not support the proposed amendment from the Labor Party. It is just another delaying tactic by the Labor Party in a desperate attempt to keep in place a failed tax which has hurt the economy, which has hurt investment in the mining industry and which has hurt the capacity for Australia to create more jobs so that people across Australia can get ahead. This mining tax repeal bill has now been debated for 33½ hours. This is now three hours more than the previous government spent on the whole debate putting the mining tax in place in the first place, with all of the associated measures attached to it. 


I thank the Senate for their support today in helping to facilitate the efficient passage of this legislation, because it will help us build a stronger, more prosperous economy. It will help us create more jobs, because—guess what?—a strong mining industry, despite Labor's and the Greens' attacks on the mining industry, a strong mining industry is good for Australia, is good for the Australian economy and is an important part of generating more jobs so that young people across Australia can have more opportunity to get ahead. 


The agreement that the government has reached with crossbench senators, led by the leader of the Palmer United Party, Mr Palmer, does secure the retention of the schoolkids bonus until after the next election. We have been quite transparent about the fact that it secures the retention of the schoolkids bonus on a means tested basis until 31 December 2016. Of course, at that time, after the Australian people have spoken, it will be up to the next parliament and to the next government that is elected at the next election to determine how to proceed from there on in. The Labor Party are free to go to the next election promising that they will keep the schoolkids bonus beyond 31 December 2016, that they will keep the low-income super contribution beyond 30 June 2017 and that they will keep the low-income support bonus beyond 31 December 2016. The Labor Party are free to do this, and the Labor Party are free to say in the lead-up to the next election that, if elected, they will reintroduce the mining tax. 



Senator Lines interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  I am sure that Senator Lines in Western Australia will go and campaign for that particular policy. Let me make a few comments in relation to compulsory super increases—something which is clearly not understood by the Labor Party today but which is very clearly understood by Senator Lazarus and the Palmer United Party—and that is that increases in compulsory super do not come out of thin air. They come out of people's own pockets. They come out of people's wages. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  You know what? Don't take my word for it, because this is what Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, himself used to say when he was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. All of a sudden they have all gone quiet! I table a series of quotes from then Minister Shorten, where he very clearly says that superannuation guarantee increases come out of wages. The agreement that we have reached with the Palmer United Party, the Liberal Democrat, the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party and Family First—in the division just now it was supported by the Democratic Labour Party too—is a good agreement, because it achieves the right balance




Senator Wong:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I asked the minister: has this deal gone to the coalition party room?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  That is a debating point.




Senator CORMANN:
  As we come to the end of this debate, I can see that the Leader of the Opposition, who has rammed many bills through this parliament with the support of the Greens, is getting increasingly desperate. She cannot accept that the government has worked positively and constructively with crossbench senators to find common ground. We have sought in good faith to work constructively and positively with senators in the national interest to find the right balance between making sure that we get rid of the mining tax while keeping certain benefits in place until after the next election. Then in the judgement of a series of senators—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Cormann is misleading the Australian public who are listening to this debate. This is not maintaining superannuation; it is ripping it away.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator CORMANN:
  I can see that Senator Cameron and others do not like to hear the truth. We have reached an agreement with a majority of senators that will see the repeal of the mining tax, that will see the maintenance of the low-income super contribution to 30 June 2017, that will see the maintenance of the schoolkids bonus on a means-tested basis until 31 December 2016, that will see the maintenance of the low-income support bonus until 31 December 2016, and that will leave workers across Australia with more of their own money pre-retirement, given that we will not be increasing compulsory super again until 1 July 2021. I have tabled various statements made by the now Leader of the Opposition when he was in government where he made it very clear—(Time expired)

 (New South Wales) (13:39):  I have never heard so much hypocrisy in my life. You have to expect hypocrisy from the coalition. The coalition's hand will be in every worker's pocket and in every worker's superannuation account for years. That is an unacceptable position.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Pursuant to order earlier today the time for the debate has now expired. The question before the chair is that the motion moved by Senator Conroy to refer the bill to a committee be agreed to.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:54):  I seek leave to make a statement of between five and 10 minutes.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is not granted.




Senator WONG:
  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion standing in my name, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Wong from making a statement.


On the suspension of standing orders motion, Mr President, I want to be very clear what we are debating here and what we are about to do. The Senate is about to vote on amendments we have not even debated. The Senate is about to vote on amendments we have not actually debated—in fact, no-one in the parliament has debated them—because these amendments are not even the same as the ones which were rammed through the lower house. 


What has occurred is this: we have a deal that has been done in secret, behind closed doors, between the government, the Palmer United Party and other crossbench senators. Let me tell you what the crux of that deal is. To any Australians who may be listening, what has been traded off by the government is your superannuation. The government did not give anything. What the government did was put their hand in your pocket and took out your superannuation increases over the next seven years. That is what has occurred. This minister comes in here and says to the Senate: 'You've got to pass this now.' He talks about the importance of repealing the mining tax. 


Let everybody be clear: the mining tax repeal bill was passed previously by this Senate. What the government did not like was the amendments that senators attached to it. That is what the government did: they had already passed it but they did not like the amendments and so they brought it back. What have they done? They have now done a dirty deal, which means your superannuation will be frozen for seven years.




Senator Back:
  What's wrong with that?




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from Senator Back, who is having a go at me. I am sure that all the workers from Western Australia will be most happy, Senator Back, that you want their wages to go down. You are telling them that you want their wages frozen. Go to the next election, Senator Back, and say: 'The Liberal Party stands for freezing your superannuation.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I raise a point of order, Mr President. I understood this was a motion to suspend standing orders and I understand the purpose of the debate is to convince the Senate on why standing orders should be suspended. So far the speaker has not gone close to addressing that. I seek your advice, Mr President. It is clear that this is a breach of standing orders, and if the standing orders are not going to be pursued why don't we get rid of them?




Senator Moore:
  On the point of order, Mr President, it is clear that the Leader of the Opposition in this place is arguing that there needs to be a suspension of standing orders. She has put forward that this is an important issue; she has spoken about the necessity and the dire consequences of amendments which we had not seen. The Leader of the Opposition has identified that we have been asked to vote on a series of amendments that we have not seen. Not only have we not seen them, but the people in the community, who will be scrutinising what we have done in this place, have not seen them, either. It is not a false argument—



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Moore. You are debating the point of order. On the point of order, Senator Macdonald, you are correct: it is a motion in relation to the suspension of standing orders, but the practice has been over many years that the debate can be wide-ranging and can touch upon the reasons for the suspension. The Leader of the Opposition is in order and she has the call.




Senator WONG:
  I am very happy to go directly to the point. I always listen to Senator Macdonald—he is so interesting at the moment on these issues. I look forward to him telling Australians what he said in the party room when this deal was discussed there. I am assuming it did go to the party room; if it did not, I look forward to him explaining why it is that he can come in here and vote for this deal when he has not had the opportunity in his party room to put his view. 


Very simply, the reason for the suspension of standing orders is this: it is to enable debate. It is the only way we can actually get debate on the amendments, because the government has put a guillotine in place, and this Senate is unable to continue to debate the amendments which were dropped on us just a few hours ago. They are not small amendments; they are not minor amendments; they are amendments which tell eight million Australians that they have been traded off. They have been traded off in order for Mr Hockey to get a win. I tell you what—he really needs one, doesn't he? Eight million workers are paying for Mr Hockey's incompetent display over recent weeks. Eight million workers are paying for the fact that this Treasurer has so incompetently sold the budget and told Australians such gems of wisdom as 'poor people don't drive cars.' That is what eight million Australians are paying for—this government and this Treasurer want a political win.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted. Two o'clock is a hard marker in relation to the suspension of standing orders. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Wong, that standing orders be suspended, be agreed to.

A division having been called—





Senator Moore:
  Mr President, under standing order 195 I ask that the question be read in full so we can understand exactly what we are voting on at this stage.



The PRESIDENT:  I will ask the Clerk to read the question. 



The Clerk:  The question before the chair is that schedules 6 to 9, as amended, be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Lock the doors. The question is that schedules 6 to 9, as amended, be agreed to. I have just been advised that the bells did not ring for one minute. Because Senator Moore took a point of order, the Clerk, rightly, did not ring the bells. I had assumed they had rung because the clock on the timer had run down. However, we will now ring them for one further minute, to make sure. The bells are ringing.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, as we had not had the bells rung at all and people had left, I submit that we should have them rung for four minutes. There has been a gap, and senators are very easily confused. The situation should be clear.



The PRESIDENT:  We will ring the bells for four minutes to make absolutely sure.

Senator Ludlam asked me some questions today relating to Australia's exports of uranium to the Russian Federation. I can inform the Senate that Australia is not currently exporting any uranium to Russia; I indicated that in my answer before.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:21):  I move:



That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.



Here we are, one-third of the way through the term of this government. One year into this government and what the Australian public know is that this is an unfair, incompetent and arrogant government—unfair in almost everything it does. What Senator Abetz has outlined today is that same unfairness. Whether it is workers seeking to bargain with their employers or the unemployed trying to get a fair go in this country, this government is unfair. It is an incompetent government, because this is a government that went to the Australia public saying it would not do deals. And yet we see deals being done with the Palmer United Party that will be a pyrrhic victory for this government. And it will be a pyrrhic victory for the Palmer United Party as well, because if you want to hammer the conditions and the rights of Australian workers, Work Choices showed that that would be a price that would have to be paid by this government.


This is an ideological government; a government that puts ideology before the national interest. It is an untrustworthy government because you cannot trust a word it says. I asked Senator Abetz today about changes to the 457 visa system, and he simply said, 'No, there will be no changes.' The problem for Senator Abetz and the problem for this government is that not only do we on this side of the chamber not trust them, but the Australia public also do not trust the Abbott government, because this government is a one that came to power based on lies and misrepresentation. We see it every day of the week with this government: more changes that were not outlined to the Australia public by this government and more lies and more rhetoric to try to hide the facts of its untruthful position.


When Senator Abetz raised the issue of immigration, he failed to deal with the article in The Australian today, where Senator Cash is quoted as saying:


Our immigration responses should recognise the unique labour needs of different geographic areas and allow flexibility to properly respond to those needs.


Senator Abetz will obviously have an opportunity to respond in this debate, and I would ask him to have a look at that article in The Australian and respond to Senator Cash's argument that you need different, more flexible approaches—that you have to be unique. There has been one other argument that I have heard about the uniqueness of the Australian labour market, and that argument came from Gina Rinehart. Gina Rinehart said that we should recognise the uniqueness of the mining industry and the uniqueness of the regional areas where mining takes place. That uniqueness could be fixed up by looking at what happens in Africa, where workers are on $2 a day, and we had to compete with workers in Africa on $2 a day. This position is in The Australian today—guidelines have been seen by The Australian. The Australian is saying, 'We have seen these guidelines.' The reporter has seen the guidelines and it means that workers could be paid as skilled workers about $10,000 less, or 10 per cent less, than other workers. A skilled worker could be paid $48,510 a year, rather than the minimum rate of $53,900 a year.


Senator Abetz, nobody believes your government. Nobody believes you. When it comes to the Department of Human Services on bargaining, what is the ask there? Lots of access to flex time; loss of overtime for additional hours worked; reduced hourly rates of pay; a reduction of 5.9 per cent of superannuation contributions; reduced job security; massive cuts to conditions of employment; and a pay offer that would result in the reduction of real wages.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:26):  Don't you feel sorry for poor old Senator Cameron? He warbles in here, he goes on about lies, he goes on about the failures of the Abbott government. There are four main pillars of the Abbott government, one of which we saw here today. The first is that we will get rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax.




Senator Cameron:
  The first pillar is lies.




Senator BACK:
  That is a lie is it Senator Cameron? The second one is that we are going to stop the boats. That is another lie, is it, Senator Cameron? Look at your performance in government. The third pillar is that we are going to build the roads of the twenty-first century and we all know that they are well and truly underway. The fourth one is that we are going to fix the budget. Every one of those are well and truly underway. But do not allow Senator Cameron's interjections to interfere.


What did the Leader of the Government in the Senate say in answer to questions today? He said that the Fair Work Commission is the appropriate place for these issues to be debated. And, indeed, they have been debated. If I could refer to Mr John Hart and the hospitality and catering industry, who took to the Fair Work Commission a case that said that a circumstance—particularly on Mondays that are public holidays—that the 75 percent penalty for people working on those days was too high, and he won the case.


Let me give you some stats, because these are important, particularly to employment for long-term unemployed people—young people, older people and regional people. Deloittes were commissioned by hospitality and catering to look at where the job needs are. They came back recently with a figure of 65,000 jobs unfilled in hospitality and catering by the end of 2014. When you add tourism to that it goes up to 80,000 jobs that are there begging. The other day when we spoke to the president of the Australian Hotels Association in Perth, the question was asked, 'Why are there so many foreign sounding accents on the other side of the bars?' He said that a recent survey indicated—Senator Sterle who travels throughout the state will be interested in this—that his members could not find local Australians to take 45 per cent of the jobs in hotels in WA. So, that is where the demand is and that is where the opportunities lie. When we heard poor old Senator Cameron going on about overseas workers, let me make this point very, very clearly: it is always in a company's interests, it is always in Roy Hill's interests, to employ Australians. Why? Because you do not have to relocate them from another country. You do not have to orientate them to our country. You do not have to provide all of those necessities that are not necessary for Australians. That is why we will always prefer Australians rather than those who are not from our country.


But the simple fact of the matter is, as those of us from the powerhouse state of Western Australia know, that we cannot always fill the jobs with those who have the necessary skills. A good example is welding skills on some of our offshore projects at the moment. What are we going to do? Not go ahead with those projects? Is that in the best interests of Australia? Is that in the best interest of Western Australians and Australian workers generally? Not to actually go ahead with those projects? No, it isn't the best thing!



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Thank you, Senator Bilyk, for your contribution. I appreciate it.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  It is in the best interests of Australia, obviously, to employ Australians. But when we cannot, the best interest surely must lie with getting in those visa holders who can do the work skilfully—not to the exclusion of Australians.


Senator Cameron made an observation. What he omitted to do in talking about wages below, of course, was to say—and I am going to read the background here, if I may—listen carefully, through you, Mr Deputy President, to Senator Cameron: 'in exceptional circumstances, if the employer has not been able to find an Australian worker in an occupation where the award or the market rate is below.' There we are! If you cannot find an Australian worker you go and have a look at another one.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Since Senator Cameron invited the opportunity to respond to all questions asked of Senator Abetz I am delighted to be able to respond to those of Senator Sterle. It is wonderful in the coalition that we can canvas a wide range of views, because we have a wide range geographically, as Senator Sterle himself well knows.


We have a mainly export-oriented wheat industry in Western Australia—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Ninety-five per cent, Senator Bilyk—you do not grow much wheat in Tasmania—95 per cent of our wheat is exported, regardless of the size of the harvest.


Here on the east coast sometimes very little is exported; depending on their harvest it might be nearly all taken domestically. So thank you very much. There is a circumstance: we in the coalition have the opportunity to canvas the wide range of views and to come up—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  You would not believe it, Senator Cameron: we can come up with good decisions based on good policy! Try it sometime! You will be interested— (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:32):  What we heard in response to the questions by the opposition from Senator Abetz today was a minister who is completely out of touch in his position on jobs. About an answer to my question in particular: I was hoping that Senator Abetz had been listening and had realised that his policy requiring job seekers to apply for 40 jobs a month was not achievable and not able to be implemented realistically.




Senator Abetz:
  I am sitting here to listen to you.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I thought he might have been listening to the unemployed people and community organisations that have said from the very outset that this is a completely meaningless way to help unemployed people into jobs.


I thought he might have been listening because last week, I think it was, on 2GB Drive Minister Abetz said that he was not about people applying for jobs in meaningless ways. Of course, he acknowledged that that would be a burden to small businesses. So I had a little ray of hope that this minister, who has put this policy out there—this policy that will not work and which does nothing to help unemployed people into jobs—was finally listening, even to the small business community.


But it appears today, from his answers in the Senate, that that hope has gone. He was not listening. He is not prepared actually to look at his ideologically-driven policy and to put it aside because everyone knows, including the minister's own party, that this is a policy that will not work.


I also asked Senator Abetz about Tasmania, where we have 7.6 per cent unemployment and where we also have, unfortunately, the highest youth unemployment rate in the country. Up in Braddon on the north-west coast, Mr Whiteley's seat—the member for Braddon—we have 21 per cent youth unemployment.




Senator Abetz:
  A very good member!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Senator Abetz suggests that Mr Whiteley is a very good member. If he were a very good member he would be going out to see Senator Abetz and saying, 'This is not going to help young unemployed people in my area. It's not doing anything for them.' On the one hand they have been told to get out there and apply for these jobs in this way and then training pathways have been taken away—all the training that was available to them.


So everyone knows that this is a harsh policy and it does nothing to assist job seekers. But it is not designed to assist job seekers; it is designed to punish them. This is what it is designed to do. Of course, the Newstart under-30s measures that the government is also seeking to implement are designed to punish the job seekers as well. They are designed to punish people because they are unemployed. This is what this government is doing.


As I was saying, on the north-west coast youth unemployment is over 21 per cent and this is a policy that is going to have devastating effects in Braddon when people start to lose all support for a minimum of six months. We know that it can be much longer. In Tasmania, youth unemployment is 17.4 per cent compared to the national average of just over 12 per cent.




Senator Abetz:
  A legacy of state Labor.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Senator Abetz interjects again. We have just seen this unemployment rate rise and Premier Hodgman has just announced in his budget that he will sack 700 public servants. That is not going to help the job market at all.



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator CAROL BROWN:

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:37):  It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on the motion to take note of Senator Abetz's answers during question time, because I think Senator Abetz gave some fantastic answers. What this actually reflects on is the questioners. We are going to spend a little bit of time on Senator Cameron, because Senator Cameron's performance was particularly embarrassing, and it was compounded by his contribution to this debate. 


If we are going to take note of answers, it is also important we take note of the questions that are asked by those opposite. Senator Cameron asked Senator Abetz, 'Has the government established new rules which will enable employers to hire foreign workers on salaries up to 10 per cent below standard rates?' Senator Abetz's answer was, 'No.' Instead of going to the part of his question that says, 'If yes, ask this; if no, ask this,' Senator Cameron went ahead and asked, 'Won't the introduction of foreign workers on below standard rates simply make it more difficult for Australians to get a job?' 


Didn't you hear the answer to the question? The answer to the question was 'No,' Senator Cameron, yet you felt the need to go ahead with the question as if you had not heard the answer given by Senator Abetz. That is the fundamental problem. You have no regard to the facts, no regard to what is put on the record; you simply make assertions even when you know they are false. That continued as Senator Cameron quoted from the article which presumably spurred the question in the first place. I am told the article that Senator Cameron was quoting from was retracted by the author later on the same day. Senator Cameron asked a question based on an article that had already been retracted, he got a clear answer saying that there is going to be no change and then he went ahead with his line of questioning. Senator Cameron—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Seselja, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator SESELJA:
  Through you, Deputy President, you can tell when Senator Cameron has no grasp of the facts because he gets louder and louder and louder. The louder he speaks, the more hot air, the surer you can be that he has no idea what he is talking about. That is what people should look out for when they hear Senator Cameron in debate. As he yells and we hear the bile that we often hear, be sure that he has not read the document he is referring to. We saw it with the stronger penalties legislation that we were debating and that we will be debating later: he clearly had not read it. He is the shadow minister but he does not actually know what is in it. Senator Cameron might be good at defending some of his factional allies, like Ian Macdonald of ICAC fame, but he is not so good at getting across the detail. 


Let us be clear on what we are talking about. Let us be clear on what Senator Abetz made clear and on what Senator Cash made clear: the story that was published was false. Workers coming in will have to be paid at least what Australian workers are being paid. Those are the facts. Senator Cash has made it 100 per cent clear. The author retracted the article. Senator Abetz made it clear to you in question time today, yet you pretended that it had not happened. How about we deal with the facts rather than the scaremongering? Next time we hear from the likes of Senator Cameron making all sorts of outrageous claims, people should consider that. People should consider how loose Senator Cameron and the Labor Party are with facts. They are not interested in what is actually happening; they are interested in making up a story about what they would like to tell the public is happening. The fact is that it is not true. 




Senator Cameron:
  Imagine you lot saying that—what hypocrisy!




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Cameron interjects. He may be good at looking after the likes of Ian Macdonald of ICAC fame, but he is not good at getting across the facts of his portfolio. That has been shown again today. I commend Senator Abetz for putting some facts on the table today. (Time expired)

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:42):  I also rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answers given by Senator Abetz to questions put to him in question time. But I just want to say that that was a shocking waste of five minutes—that was terrible. You really had no grasp, Senator Seselja.


I want to touch on the important issue of the use of foreign workers, particularly but not limited to those on 457 visas. Everyone in this place knows my commitment to the Kimberley, after 30 years of working up and down that area both as a truckie and then as a senator. If we did not have foreign workers, backpackers, in the Kimberley, I would be the first one to admit, the Kimberley would close down. Roadhouses would not be open, pubs would not be open and cafes would not be open. It is a well-known fact. 


We on this side of the chamber have never ever set out to demonise foreign workers. Our problem is when they are used to the exclusion of Australian workers, on substandard rates of pay and conditions, and when Australians are not even given the opportunity to apply for the job. It is all right for Senator Back to carry on, raise his voice, scream and somehow attack me. I was half asleep, but he woke me up. I do not know how I fitted into it.


Mr Deputy President, you have a commitment to working people, as demonstrated in your previous life. I am not running this as an argument from just this side of the chamber, but I am going to pose a small question that I do not expect to be answered. I am going to plant a seed in those opposite. I contacted a very good friend of mine yesterday. We were having a chat. I wanted to ask him how things were in WA. He has a transport company. I am going to dig deeper into this. He said to me: 'You are not going to believe what is happening in WA.' He said he has never seen it so bad, that it is shocking. He said, 'There is a mob in WA that have started up a removals company and they only target office removals,' which is a very, very important part of the removals industry, because it employs a heck of a lot of workers, predominantly after hours and on weekends. As an ex furniture removalist I say we made our cream on office removals on the weekend. But he has put to me—and he is going to give me the information—that this mob that have started up only use backpackers. They only access foreign backpackers to go out there, put on a pair of sand shoes or desert boots—no training, no occupational health and safety, not Australian residents, not going to spend a heap of their money and time here in WA. It is just a means to get a few bob and then take off somewhere else.


We welcome backpackers—crikey, the more the merrier—but I am going to dig deeper. There is an accusation that there are a number of mining companies in Western Australia using this mob. I am not talking little backyard ventures. I will report it to the Senate, I will investigate fully and I will go out in the media and tell that lot up there. I will be banging, clapping and throwing hand grenades—whatever I have to do. I do not want to start a 'union' fight; this is not a union fight. But I challenge that side of the chamber to stand with me because o senator in this place, no member of parliament in the other place, if these accusations are proven correct, could ever justify it. Not even the maddies on the far right on that side could justify the use of backpackers to circumvent Australian citizens carrying out furniture removals—office removals for multi-billion-dollar companies.


With that one cleared, I go to some of the questions to Senator Abetz. I was the one who raised the point about the mess that is their party room and the mocking that started. You do not have to be Einstein and pick up the paper every day to work out there is something going wrong on that side of the parliamentary chambers. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that every time the Treasurer and member for North Sydney opens his mouth there is a bevy of backbenchers who cannot wait to brief the media to have a crack at the mess that was and is this budget. Over 100 days, every day we go to the media there is someone backgrounding about what a mess this is. Even today. I am not going to have enough time, unfortunately, but the latest one is the absolute meltdown of the Treasurer in their party room today. I have run out of time, but I will get to contribute to this slapdown— (Time expired)

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:56):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted. 




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I table the explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



According to the Australia Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), in a report released in 2010, between 60-80% of Australian adults have never used a financial planner. The report also asserted that the people that could benefit the most from financial advice are younger people and those with less wealth or income, however these are the two cohorts that seek financial advice the least. 


There is little doubt that accessibility to financial advice and improved financial literacy would help a large number of Australians better manage their finances. However the cloud that hangs over the financial advice industry as a result of scandals and cover-ups is a large contributor to why financial advice is underutilised. 


Over the last decade events such as the collapse of Storm Financial and managed investment schemes such as Timbercorp burnt many retail investors who sought out and received financial advice. The recent Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the activities of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission led to the presentation of compelling evidence and widespread publicity of the fraudulent activities that went on in the Commonwealth Bank subsidiary Commonwealth Financial Planning. Macquarie Wealth was also implicated by the Senate inquiry. 


It is unsurprising that Australians are hesitant in seeking financial advice following these types of revelations. This is to the detriment of the vast majority of independent financial planners who are responsible and demonstrate professional conduct. 


The current Government has also made it clear that they are more interested in protecting the financial services industry, especially the large banks which dominate the industry, rather than consumers. They are unwilling to ensure past incidences of wrongdoing are appropriately investigated and that the perpetrators are prosecuted. The ASIC inquiry recommended a Royal Commission into the activities of the Commonwealth Bank.  Even with their penchant for Royal Commissions (Pink batts and Unions) the Government was pretty clear that they wouldn't be exposing the big end of town to proper investigation. 


They are also unwilling to accept that the legislation and structures that govern the industry need changing. Their determination to unwind the previous government's future of financial advice reforms to the detriment of the consumer clearly demonstrated this. A coalition of consumer organisation including CHOICE and Seniors Australia united in their concern at the Government's actions. 


It was extremely disappointing to see the Palmer United Party join the Government in the Senate to ensure the changes to the future of financial advice reforms were enacted through regulation. I hope the Palmer United Party takes a good look at the legislation when it arrives in the Senate and vote against the legislation to ensure consumers are protected. 


This Bill is a small step in reforming the legislation that governs the industry by providing consumers with a clear differentiation between personal and general advice. It is a direction explored by David Murray in his Financial Systems Inquiry interim report. Surprisingly it is also a position that the Commonwealth Bank has recently advocated for. Media reports on August 29 indicated that the Commonwealth Bank thought renaming 'general advice' sales is a positive move forward. 


I welcome the recognition by David Murray and the Commonwealth Bank that changes are needed in terminology. 


A slight definitional change is an important first step in amending the Corporations Act to help improve consumer information. Under the Corporations Act 2001, financial product advice falls under two categories, personal advice or general advice. According to the Corporations Act 2001 Section 766B: 


""personal advice is financial product advice that is given or directed to a person (including by electronic means) in circumstances where:


(a)  the provider of the advice has considered one or more of the person's objectives, financial situation and needs (otherwise than for the purposes of compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 or with regulations, or AML/CTF Rules, under that Act); or


(b) a reasonable person might expect the provider to have considered one or more of those matters.""


The term advice when it is used in reference to 'general advice' is misleading. Under the current legislation 'advice' is provided when, for example, a bank teller provides a customer with information about insurance. The aim of this Bill is to make it clear that when this insurance information is provided it is not advice based on any personal circumstances but is information provided by the teller because they are interested in selling a product.  The term advice implies something beyond information. In terms of general advice for financial products this is not the case and therefore the Bill's purpose is to clear up the misconception. 


The current government talks about our ageing population and the burden this may place on budgets in the coming years while undermining consumer protections in favour of their mates in the banking and big end of the financial services industry, many who have the vertically integrated business models that pose a systemic risk. This sends the wrong signals by locking in the mistakes of the past. This also means people will potentially continue to refuse to obtain the advice and information that they need to plan for the risks they face over their lifetimes and into retirement. 


This Bill presents a straightforward change that the Parliament should adopt. The Government should heed the work done by the Financial Systems Inquiry, an inquiry they commissioned themselves. David Murray asserts in his interim report that:


""Consumers should have confidence and trust in the financial system and be able to expect fair treatment. Effective regulation that minimises misconduct and promotes fair outcomes will drive confidence and trust in the financial system.""


It is clear that the Government has no interest in improving the financial services industry and the protection of consumers if it threatens the profits of the large banks and financial services companies. Evidence provided by the recent Senate Inquiry into the repeal of the Future of Financial Advice reforms demonstrated this. 


The Greens are eagerly anticipating the final report of the Financial Systems Inquiry particularly in regards to consumer protections. I look forward to working with the industry and consumer groups to make real structural changes.  


I again call on the Government to represent the consumers rather than the big end of town. There is a lot to do to improve the reputation of the industry and the protection of consumers. This Bill is just the start. There are many structural issues to tackle to ensure that consumers are protected from another ‘Storm Financial’ or fraudulent behaviour through a financial services company. 


An improved financial advice system that is reliable and trusted benefits the industry itself, the consumer and the country as a whole.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:00):  I rise to speak in this matter of public importance debate on the impact of the Abbott government's GP tax and medicine price hike on pensioners, the poor and the chronically ill. There is no doubt that the Abbott government's GP tax and medicine price hike will have a profound effect on the lives of many vulnerable Australians. I want to first note today media reports that the Prime Minister is planning 'refinements' to his terrible $7 GP tax. According to David Crowe in The Australiannewspaper yesterday:


THE federal government is preparing to give ground in one of the most heated fights over its budget reforms as Tony Abbott tells his colleagues to expect “refinements” to the $7 fee on visits to the doctor.


The Prime Minister has signalled the plan in private talks with Coalition MPs amid pressure from crossbench senators for drastic changes to the medical co-payment meant to generate $3.5 billion in revenue over the next four years.


No amount of refinement will fix this rotten GP tax. This plan must be abandoned. The GP tax is cruel and unfair. It is bad health policy. Taxing sick people to see the doctor will prevent them from visiting the doctor when they need to and that will lead to them suffering more serious and costly health problems. 


When this tax was first announced I was inundated with emails, phone calls and letters from people voicing their anger and frustration at this tax, as I am sure many senators and members in this place would have been as well. It was clear that the GP tax and increase in the cost of medicines would force many people to have to decide between paying their rent and going to the doctor. For many it would be a choice between putting food on the table and filling their prescription. 


It was not just people who were already struggling who wrote to me. Even those who told me that they were well-off could not believe that people who were already disadvantaged were being singled out with the new tax that undermines our universal health system. They understood what this tax and increase in the cost of medicines would mean to pensioners, families and the chronically ill. The question they asked me and the one I repeat today is: how will pensioners and those who are chronically ill afford the government's new $7 GP tax? This new tax shows just how out of touch this government is with the health needs of Australians. When people are already struggling to make ends meet how will they pay more not only to go to the doctor but also for every prescription they have to fill? Many people who are chronically ill take several medications a day and the cost to them will quickly add up.


I note the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into out-of-pocket expenses released recently clearly shows that Tasmania would be hardest hit by this terrible new GP tax. The President of the Australian Medical Association, Associate Professor Brian Owler, told the inquiry:


Tasmania has a higher burden of chronic disease and higher smoking rates, and we need to do more to encourage preventive health care and chronic disease management. That is why I think the co-payment is probably going to affect Tasmanians more than it affects people in other jurisdictions.


This $7 GP tax will make it so much harder for Tasmanians who are sick. Many will put off going to the doctor and their medical conditions may worsen. The 2013 state government health indicators report found that 16 per cent of low-income Tasmanians have difficulty accessing GPs, with cost one of the key barriers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services in Tasmania, in the period between 2009 and 2011 an estimated 13,000 Tasmanians in the lowest income range ended up having to be treated in hospital for conditions that could have been addressed at the primary care level.


The GP tax will put even more pressure on our public hospital emergency departments and elective surgery waiting lists. Despite the Prime Minister promising no cuts to health, this budget will rip $1.1 billion out of Tasmania's hospitals over the next decade. In this budget cycle alone, funding for Tasmanian hospitals has been cut by $49 million over the next four years. The Royal Hobart Hospital is already under pressure in its emergency department. It was reported in the Mercury newspaper yesterday that a three-year-old boy with severe breathing problems was stuck in an ambulance for 1½ hours while he waited for treatment. According to the newspaper reports, there were no beds available at the hospital. The report said that when the boy's breathing deteriorated the paramedics hit the alarm button to get him seen to.


Labor do not want to make it harder for people who are sick and put more pressure on hospitals that are already under pressure. We do not want pensioners and the vulnerable attacked. Even some government MPs do not support this terrible tax. The member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, acknowledged in his local paper, though very belatedly, that the GP tax should be scrapped for pensioners and people with chronic illness.


I am surprised that it took him three months to realise that this terrible tax would hurt Tasmanians and especially pensioners and people with chronic illnesses. It seems to me that his new-found concern about the tax was more about saving his own job than a genuine concern about sick people. In Mr Whiteley's own electorate youth unemployment is over 20 per cent, and I ask Mr Whiteley: why should young unemployed people have to pay this unfair new GP tax to go to the doctor? We know from research from the Brotherhood of St Lawrence released recently that underemployment of young Australians has hit its highest level in 40 years.


But it is not just taxing sick people to go to the doctor; in the budget this government also announced an increase in the cost of PBS medicines by 13 per cent on top of inflation by 1 January 2015. This is another 80c for pensioners on the cost of prescriptions for some of the most disadvantaged Australians, including people on full-rate pensions—the people who can least afford this increase. For the benefit of the Senate, people on full-rate pensions receive about $20,000 per annum. It will be an extra $5 for people who are not pensioners but who also may struggle to find the extra $7 to go to the doctors and then on top of that an extra $5 for a prescription.


Evidence to the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2014 made it clear that these increases to the PBS would target pensioners and low- and middle-income earners. The Consumer Health Forum provided the committee with evidence of more patients not filling their prescriptions due to cost. The Senate report into the PBS price hikes confirmed that those hardest hit by the increase in medicines will be the sick and chronically ill. The committee found that:



… very high users will pay $145.30 extra per single, couple or family per year to reach the general patient safety net. 


In a damning indictment, the committee reported:


Some submitters questioned whether the increases in co-payments may result in unintended consequences due to the inability of some patients to fill their prescriptions due to rising costs. Submitters expressed concern that this may result in severe health consequences for vulnerable patients and increased health expenditure in the longer term as well as consequences for the pharmaceutical sector. 


The Australian Medical Association told the Senate inquiry that the international research shows that increases in co-payments lead to poor adherence to prescriptions, which would cost taxpayers and the government more in the longer term.


Pensioners and people who are on low incomes and who live with chronic illness rely on bulk-billing and they should not have to pay more for their medicines. They must be spared this harsh and unfair $7 GP tax; they must be spared an increase in the cost of their medicines. The GP tax and the hike in the cost of medicines are an outrageous attack on pensioners, poor people and those who are chronically ill. Both taxes will add to their stress and anxiety. They will compound the disadvantage they already suffer. They are an outrageous attack on our universal health system. Labor will not stand by and see Medicare dismantled. Labor will never support a two-tiered, American-style health system. (Time expired)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:10):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this very important issue today. I wanted to address both of the central elements raised in Senator Brown's speech, which is about GP co-payments but also about changes in PBS co-payments. Both are very important. Can I make this point at the outset: this is about making both our Medicare system—our medical benefits system—and our PBS sustainable. If you look historically there has been bipartisan recognition that we have to take measures to make these things more sustainable. 


I will go into some detail on how the Labor Party saw fit in office in the Hawke-Keating years to not only introduce a co-payment for GPs but also to increase co-payments for the PBS. We have seen that recognition. That has to be fundamental to this debate. Do we in 10 or 20 years time want to see the Medicare system where people still can have access to their GP or do we want to make it increasingly hard as budgets struggle to keep up? Do we want a situation where we can continue to list the medicines that are needed and people can access subsidised medicine or, where we do not take the measures and therefore see many Australians left behind? That, in fact, is at the heart of what this issue is about. That is at the heart of this debate: in 10 years time, in 20 years time, will we still have these excellent systems that we have? 


We believe that the way to make it sustainable is to ask for some contribution by individuals. That has been recognised in a bipartisan way when it comes to the PBS. It has been absolutely recognised by both sides of politics that some contribution when it comes to subsidised medicines is the sustainable way to go. We believe that that also applies when it comes to GPs. So I do want to remind the Senate about the fact of some of that bipartisanship from people like Andrew Leigh and people like Bob Hawke. I will quote from Andrew Leigh. It is worth putting in context when he said this, because it was in 2003. Since 2003 we have seen a significant increase in medical benefits payments by the Commonwealth from around $8 billion to over $18 billion. It has more than doubled since he said this. So if it were true in 2003, it is more true in 2014, given the proportion of our budget that is now being paid out in medical benefits. Dr Leigh described a Medicare co-payment as 'hardly a radical idea'. He made an important point. He said:


As health researchers have shown, costless medical care means that people go to the doctor even when they don't need to—


That was one, but secondly he said:


… driving up the cost for all of us.


That is a really important point. It drives up the cost for everyone and it undermines the sustainability. Andrew Leigh had that to say back in 2003, back when we were paying out about $8 billion under the Medicare benefits schedule. Now we are doing over $18 billion. If it was true when Andrew Leigh said it in 2003, it is even more true now, in 2014.


Of course, we know about Bob Hawke. Senator Brown, I think towards the end of her speech, suggested that this was about getting rid of Medicare; this was about undermining Medicare. It is actually the opposite. I do not think there would be a Labor senator—and I challenge a Labor senator to get up and say this—who would say that Bob Hawke was interested in destroying Medicare. Was Bob Hawke interested in destroying Medicare? No. I do not think anyone could legitimately make that claim. I think people would say that Bob Hawke was committed to Medicare. One of the ways he showed his commitment was in seeking to make it more sustainable.




Senator Carol Brown:
  There isn't a GP tax.




Senator SESELJA:
  I hear the interjections from Senator Brown. I would be happy if a Labor senator did want to get up and say that Bob Hawke was seeking to undermine Medicare. I do not believe that is what he was doing; I believe what he was doing was seeking to make it sustainable. Many years ago, when we were spending a lot less than even when Andrew Leigh made his comments in 2003, he said: 'It is quite clear. I understand there is a very significant blow-out in regard to the Medicare situation in terms of servicing. What needs to be done, of course, is to ensure that both on the supply side and the demand side there be some restraint imposed because you can't have a situation where you're just going to have outlays growing as in the rate they were.' That is what Bob Hawke had to say.




Senator Carol Brown:
  This is about stopping people going to the doctor. That's what it's all about.




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Brown interjects. Apparently, when Bob Hawke said it, it was not wrong and it was not undermining Medicare—and I do not believe he was trying to undermine Medicare. But many years later, when we are making many more and much greater payments, it is different. Andrew Leigh recognised in 2003, when we were paying out $8 billion, that this was a good idea. He recognised it in '03; Bob Hawke recognised it well before that. We take the same approach: we want to make Medicare more sustainable. This has been recognised as the way to do that. It has been recognised by Andrew Leigh, it has been recognised by Bob Hawke and it is recognised in this year's budget.


The alternative, when it comes to both MBS and PBS, is for the system to become unsustainable and for Australians to not get the kind of medical care that they deserve. That is something, on the coalition side, that do not want to see.


We hear the criticisms about co-payments for PBS. We have seen historical changes to payments for PBS. We have seen that historically. Under both sides of politics we have seen it. In 1983 we saw $2 for concessional co-payments. In 1986, under the Labor government, we saw the co-payment for non-pensioners increasing from $2 to $2.50. For pensioners, we saw it increasing in 1990 from nothing to $2.50. And we saw it under the Howard government because there is a recognition that, if we want to have a PBS system that continues to provide life-saving drugs for Australians, asking people to make a modest contribution to that is a good way to go. It is an important way to go.


It is not something that was invented by the coalition upon coming to office; it is something that was recognised by previous Labor governments; it is something that was recognised by previous coalition governments. Under the previous Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments—we saw, in fact, the listing of only eight medicines every month, when we are seeing now over 20 medicines every month being listed. We want to see medicines on the PBS. We want to see Australians having access to that. That is what we are seeking to deliver. That is what the facts show—and, in fact, we were lagging behind in the last six years. I do not want to see a situation in 10 years time or 15 years time or 20 years time where members of my family cannot get access to live-saving drugs that are not listed because the system becomes unaffordable. This is an important part of the sustainability of our healthcare system that has been recognised for a long time by both sides of politics. It has been recognised by people like Bob Hawke, by people like Andrew Leigh and by people like this coalition government.


The alternative, of course, as we see the increasing costs is to pretend that there is no problem. That seems to be the Labor Party's approach to all of these budgetary issues. We do need to get the budget under control. That means taking sensible measures—measures that in the past have been supported by the Labor Party, but in fact, now, they are being reckless in not supporting it, with no alternative plan. They have only a plan for more and more debt and deficit but, importantly, for an undermining of our healthcare system as it becomes increasingly unsustainable.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-09-02,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:21):  Before I go to the details of the issue of the GP co-payment, I want to refer to the matter of public importance, which is:


The impact of the Abbott Government's GP tax and medicine price hike on pensioners, the poor and the chronically ill.


I want to say something about that. The members of the coalition would be surprised to hear that I do not think this is a GP tax. I do not think it has any of the hallmarks of a tax. I think it is quite clearly a co-payment. It takes us closer to a user-pays system. In fact, I have deliberately avoided using the word 'tax'—and let me tell you why.


When this issue first came up, we considered calling this a GP tax and I resisted it. I resisted it because, every time we run around in this place and use the word 'tax' in this sort of context, we undermine those effective, fair and efficient taxes that allow us to fund universal health care, insurance, income support, education and so on. Taxation is the price you pay for a civilised society. I am, for one, someone who supports progressive taxation and who supports a taxation on resource consumption. I think taxes can be a good thing if collected wisely and spent wisely. That is why I think it is a mistake to refer to this as a GP tax. This is a co-payment that works in precisely the opposite way in which a fair health system should work.


A fair health system should be based on the principle of fair taxation—the more you earn, the more you pay—and, at the point of delivery, the point of access of the service, everybody should get access to that service. That is the way taxes should work. Senator Seselja is right: health care is not free. It is not free under the current system. If you are a high income earner, you pay more into the system. You pay more into our health care system, and you should be entitled to access it. So this is not a tax; this takes us away from that important principle and moves us closer to a user-pays system in health care, which is both expensive and unfair. You only need to look at the US to see that in action.


What underpins this co-payment is the notion that our health care system is unsustainable. It is simply not borne out by the evidence. We have had inquiries into out-of-pocket health care costs. We have had inquiries into the PBS co-payment. We have had inquiries into the move from private health insurers into the health space in primary care. We have heard the same story over and over again: we have a good health system, it is sustainable, and by world standards people get access to one of the best health care systems in the world.


Let us look at some of those facts. We spend about nine per cent of our GDP on health care. By OECD standards, that is below the average. It is below the OECD average. Health care spending at a Commonwealth level has been stable for more than a decade. I say that again: health care spending by the Commonwealth has been stable as a proportion of GDP for more than a decade. We are on track to have a very small increase in our health care spend over the next 10 years.


The government would have you believe that that is due to health care costs spiralling out of control. Not at all. The small increase—maybe a half to another per cent of GDP on health care over the next decade, taking us to the OECD average—is because people are getting access to new, life-saving treatment. Health care technologies continue to develop all the time and we are in the enviable situation where we are providing people with the means to live longer, healthier and more productive lives. That is not a crisis. That is something to celebrate. If the whole proposition we all believe in, which is that we should strive for economic growth and development, is not going to provide the dividend of better health care, then what the hell are we doing in its place?


When you ask people time and time and time again what they want their governments to be spending money on—




Senator Bilyk:
  Health and education.




Senator DI NATALE:
  It is health and education. Thank you, Senator Bilyk. People say it time and time again. The whole point of economic progress is to be able to provide people with the means to spend money on the things they value, and that is health and education.


There is a notion that people visit the GP too frequently. Again, this is not borne out by any evidence. It is true that some people visit the doctor unnecessarily—that is, that if they do not visit a doctor their symptoms would resolve and they would not be any worse off because of it. But the whole point of having a trained health workforce is so that people who do not have the means to be able to distinguish between what is a serious symptom and one that is benign can get that advice and reassurance from a trained health professional.


As a former GP, I can tell you that a lot of what we did involved assessing and diagnosing, and providing people with reassurance. That is what the job involves. That is not a wasted visit. That is actually quite important, because the person sitting at home with a pain in their chest and who does not know if it is indigestion or the early signs of a heart attack, needs to have a professional assessment of those symptoms. That is what visiting a GP does. If you put a price barrier in front of a patient, you can be absolutely guaranteed that we will deter some of those necessary visits. The person sitting at home with chest pain and who is worrying, 'Could this be heart attack? No, it is probably indigestion', will be influenced by the fact that they will have to face a charge to see the GP potentially to have a blood test or an X-ray and have their script filled by a doctor—all of which will absolutely deter some of those necessary visits. As a consequence, it will cost our health system more. People will end up in emergency departments and in intensive-care units, because simple, treatable and preventable problems were missed in the first instance. That is why this is such a short-sighted policy.


There are so many things that we can do to improve the efficiency of our health system. We can invest much more in health promotion and illness prevention. We should be doing that. For example, we know from a study by Deakin and Queensland universities that the 20 best prevention strategies, based on good evidence, would cost us about $4 billion and return $11 billion in savings. We know that. Yet, at the same time that we introduce this co-payment, we are dismantling the Preventative Health Agency. It is short-sighted not just in terms of the impact it has on the lives of ordinary people, but because it will cost us money. Also, in medicine we do too many things that are not based on good evidence. We should be funding what works. A lot of what we do adds very little value. There is a big opportunity to start looking at the current Medicare list and reviewing how we fund a number of procedures that add very little value—the number of arthroscopies we do in this country, for example, many of which are unnecessary. We should also look at Vitamin D testing, and the new and complex forms of prostatic surgery. They add very little value but a lot of cost. Of course, this would mean taking on some big interests, but we need to do that if we are going to make our already effective and efficient system more efficient.


We need to make sure that we resist the temptation—the great folly—of assuming that moving towards a user-pays system, introducing a price signal, is going to make the system any more efficient. It will not. You only need to look at the international evidence—to look at those countries that base their health system on fair taxation and universal access versus those that adopt the notion of user-pays in health—to be able to see a recipe not just for a less fair system, which is obviously something I am concerned about, but also a much more expensive system. That is why the US spends double what we do on health care and gets much worse health care as a result.


This is bad policy. It is unfair, inefficient and it must be stopped.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:31):  I am really pleased that the Senate has decided today to discuss this issue as a matter of public importance, because this issue is one of utmost public importance. 


While the Liberal government is pre-occupied with creating knights and dames, and looking to protect hate speech, it is the government's unfair $7 GP tax and their hike in the price of PBS medication that Australians are really concerned about. It is what the people of Australia are talking about with their friends and their families. It is one of the most loathed facets of a budget that is still being talked about four months after it was handed down in May. This government is utterly out of touch with the Australian community. They are utterly out-of-touch with Australian values.


If the Liberal government had campaigned on a platform of introducing a $7 GP tax, protecting hate speech and reinstating knights and dames, the Australian people would not have let the Liberal and National parties anywhere near the government benches. Even if Mr Abbott and his Sydney, North Shore Treasurer Joe Hockey do not understand the devastating impact this will have on the health of those with chronic disease, the mentally ill, the unemployed, seniors and pensioners, the people of Australia do. And the Australian people are very concerned that this government wants to turn Australia into a place where you do not help out a sick mate, and where we turn our back on a fundamental egalitarian belief that quality health care should be available for all, based on need, not income or postcode. Australians do not want an Australia like this. 


Recently the Senate Community Affairs References Committee tabled a report into out-of-pocket costs in Australian healthcare. I was pleased to participate in this inquiry and to have the opportunity to speak in this place last week on its report. Senate inquiries are an important part of the process of government, because they are a mechanism to allow expert advice to inform debate on proposed measures.


It was important to hear this expert advice to the Senate Community Affairs Committee, because Mr Abbott did not bother to consult the experts when drafting this ill-informed policy disaster. And the expert advice on the government's $7 GP tax and their $5 hike to pharmaceutical benefit scheme medications was absolutely damning. The inquiry showed that the $7 GP tax is a disastrous thought bubble, which will have a severe impact on the health of pensioners, the poor and the chronically ill.


Submitters and witnesses to this inquiry expressed concern that an increase in out-of pocket costs in the form of a co-payment for GP services would result in people delaying seeking medical treatment. In its review of health care in Australia, the COAG Reform Council found that nationally, in 2012-13, 5.8 per cent of people delayed or did not see a GP for financial reasons. That is 5.8 per cent of people—mainly pensioners, the poor and the chronically ill—who have had to choose between eating and having their health looked after. Adding an additional co-payment will only make this situation worse. It will impact disproportionately on individuals with the greatest healthcare needs, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, elderly people, women, people on low or fixed incomes, and people with chronic illnesses. It will exacerbate their conditions and increase their suffering. Mr Abbott and the Liberal-Nationals government may not care about the health of people in these groups, or their suffering, but we on this side—the Labor Party—certainly do.


The government says that the $7 tax is to prevent unnecessary visits to the doctor. However, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners provided the following evidence as to why the policy would not be effective in reducing healthcare costs:


… international studies demonstrate that, with the exception of the most vulnerable patients, there is limited evidence that co-payments actually reduce health service use. The economic rationale for implementing co-payments is further confounded by evidence suggesting that healthcare costs increase due to preventable conditions not being treated and poorer control of chronic disease and greater hospitalisations


Primary health care is the most efficient part of the health system. It allows for the early diagnosis, management and prevention of disease. Early diagnosis and effective management is extremely economical compared to emergency treatment or continual, ongoing treatment because an illness was not caught early.


The inquiry heard that countries with strong primary healthcare systems report the best health outcomes at the most efficient cost. The AMA told the committee:


Now is not the time to strip money out of primary health care. It is the time to invest in primary care to ensure sustainability of the healthcare system. People need access to general practitioners to know what their healthcare needs are. General practitioners need access to pathology and imaging services in order to diagnose conditions early and put treatment plans in place.


The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners also observed that there is no economic benefit in dissuading patients from seeing their GP. They said:


In fact there is good evidence to suggest that there is a negative economic impact with patients using more expensive health care through the hospital system that could be delivered by general practice at a fraction of the cost. General practice has been, and remains, the most efficient component of the healthcare system, with general practice costs per patient remaining steady over the past 20 years, while hospital costs have continued to rise. 


Submitters and witnesses argued in general that co-payments may affect other parts of the health system in a number of ways—for example: by placing increased stress on the public health system, particularly emergency departments, as patients seek hospital treatment to avoid paying a GP co-payment; by shifting responsibility for primary care to community pharmacies; and by reducing the number of patients undertaking all required pathology and diagnostic testing.


This policy is a short-term approach to fix a budget emergency that does not exist. It will lead to more suffering by patients, worse management of disease and more severe and expensive treatment. It is as if this policy were designed to artificially spiral health costs out of control to destroy the viability of our healthcare system. And we all know it is the first step in the Abbott government's quest to destroy Medicare. The Liberals have abolished Medicare before, so they should not be trusted to protect it into the future.


Submitters to the inquiry also overwhelmingly rejected an increase in the PBS co-payment. An increase in the co-payment for medicines will again lead to worse health outcomes for Australians. The Consumers Health Forum of Australia provided evidence about the impact of the 2005 increase on individuals, saying:


Studies have shown that, following the January 2005 increase in PBS copayments, there was a significant decrease in dispensing volumes observed across 12 of the 17 medicine categories, including anti-epileptic medication, anti-Parkinson's treatments, combination asthma medicines, insulin and osteoporosis treatments. Importantly, we also know that the copayment increase had a particular impact at that time on medicine utilisation by concessional patients.


By increasing the co-payment on medicines again, we will see a decrease in the number of people who are able to afford their medication to treat their chronic illnesses. I shudder to think what would happen to a young person under 30 who has no income because they are unemployed who might need medication. I do not think the other side has thought about the areas this will impact on at all. This will lead to suffering, poorer health outcomes and further increases in emergency treatment for manageable diseases.


As a member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, I was also particularly concerned about the evidence given that the $7 GP tax and other proposed government measures would have on my home state of Tasmania. The President of the AMA, Associate Professor Owler, has said:


Tasmania has a higher burden of chronic disease and higher smoking rates, and we need to do more to encourage preventive health care and chronic disease management. That is why I think the co-payment is probably going to affect Tasmanians more than it affects people in other jurisdictions.


I do not see those Liberal senators opposite from Tasmania standing up and saying why they support a policy which will lead to worse health outcomes and suffering for Tasmanians. I would like to see those Tasmanian Liberal senators stand up and say why they support a policy which will lead to longer delays at the Royal Hobart and Launceston General emergency departments. And I would like to see the Liberal senators from Tasmania stand up and say why they support a policy which will lead to the state of Tasmania paying more for its health system while at the same time delivering worse health outcomes.


This government need to start listening to what the Australian people want, not just what their friends in the IPA tell them. We are a generous, caring country. We care about those in our society who need a little bit of extra help. This Abbott government are out of touch and utterly indifferent to the disastrous impacts their GP tax and medicine price hikes will have on pensioners, the poor and the chronically ill.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:41):  I rise to address this matter of public importance that has been raised by Senator Moore on behalf of the Labor Party. As a member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, I am happy to speak on this MPI because it provides an opportunity to remind the Senate how, after six years of Labor's waste and inefficiency in health, the coalition is moving to repair the damage and ensure Australia's health system remains effective and sustainable into the future.


Contrary to the assertions of those opposite, this government's measures are laying the foundations for a stronger health system for all Australians. The simple but, I know, very uncomfortable truth for those opposite is that health expenditure is growing faster than the economy. This is unsustainable for Australian taxpayers. Despite assertions to the contrary by the previous speaker, central to our election campaign was dealing with the budget mess those opposite left us—$123 billion in projected deficit. It does exist, no matter how often they now try to deny it.


I believe all in this place have an obligation on behalf of all Australians to ensure that their taxpayer funds are most effectively and efficiently spent and that the expenditure matches revenue. I believe this is the most responsible approach for all of us in this place to take. The growth in health expenditure has been so rapid that the Commission of Audit saw health as the Commonwealth's single largest long-term budget challenge. To give you all an example of the exponential rise in the healthcare system, 10 years ago the government spent $8 billion on Medicare. This financial year, the government is spending $20 billion. This is projected to rise to more than $34 billion in 10 years time. Put simply, this is unsustainable growth.


Unlike the previous government, this government are putting in place a number of measures to address this unsustainability and are moving to modernise and strengthen both Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. On this side, we are ensuring the continued sustainability of Medicare and ensuring it is able to provide first-class health care to future generations of Australians. Yes, we are asking Australians to make a small contribution to the cost of their own health care, but again I remind those opposite that we were not the first to consider this. In fact, it was the Labor Party that first introduced a Medicare co-payment in 1991.


I listened very closely to the evidence presented at the recent community affairs committee hearings, and I am left wondering if I was at the same hearings as those opposite. In the recent committee inquiry, we heard evidence from a number of stakeholders on the out-of-pocket health costs in Australia. Significantly, we heard from the Australian Medical Association that:


In the decade to 2012–13, the percentage of medical services attracting out-of-pocket costs has either stayed the same or declined.


I will say that again: it has stayed the same or declined. That was the evidence from the AMA.


We also heard from the Department of Health. They advised that the proportion of total health expenditure funded by out-of-pocket payments in 2011-12 was largely unchanged from that of a decade ago. That is despite the fact that today in Australia these out-of-pocket expenses include in their definition cosmetic surgery, complementary medicines, complementary therapies and a range of vitamins and supplements. The Department of Health also noted that the largest and fastest growing area of out-of-pocket expenses or costs is in the non-prescription and over-the-counter medicines; this includes complementary medicines and vitamins. These are nearly a third of the total out-of-pocket expenses. Evidence to the community affairs committee also shows that the claim by those opposite, that health care expenditure is increasing dramatically for the average Australian, is simply not true.


I have to address one of the things the previous speaker noted. She was attributing people not going to the doctor or to fill their prescriptions to these proposed changes. The evidence to the community affairs committee hearings was that clearly, that was not the case; there are many reasons people delay filling their prescriptions or going to the doctor.


The government is also ensuring the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In the last decade alone, the cost of the PBS has increased by a staggering 80 per cent. It is expected to continue to increase by four to five per cent annually. A PBS co-payment is not a new measure. It has existed since the 1960s and Labor has, until now, consistently supported this policy. Again, in the community affairs committee hearings, we heard that the alarmist rhetoric of those opposite was in fact unsupported by the facts. The department advised us that for general patients, the increase amounts to $5 per script and for a concessional patient, 80c per script. The department also advised that this will amount to an average increase per year of $10 for general or non-concessional patients. I will say that again: an increase of $10 for the average, general nonconcessional patient and $13.60 for those with a concession card. That is very different from what you have heard from those on the other side of the chamber today.


Most people would agree that this is a small price to pay—I say again, $10 per year or $13.60 per year—for the long-term sustainability of the PBS. Despite what you might believe from what has been said on the other side of the chamber, in the 12 short months since coming to government the coalition has already listed 220 new medicines on the PBS. We are listing medicines twice as fast as the previous government, now averaging over 20 listings per month. This can only be good for Australians. Where previously a patient would have had to pay full price for these medicines, they can now get them through the PBS.


The simple fact is the coalition government is working to ensure the health system is sustainable for future generations of Australians. We are also working towards cleaning up the fiscal mess that was left behind by the Labor government. In opposing the government's health reform measures, Labor's irresponsibility in government continues. These reforms proposed by the government will ensure that all Australians have access to world-class health care. This government is committed to ensuring we spend precious health dollars in the most efficient way possible, ensuring every dollar of taxpayers' money is directed towards improving patient outcomes. We are committed to ending the wasteful and inefficient spending in the health portfolio incurred under the previous government and we are modernising and strengthening the health system for all Australians. The reality is that those on the other side, who created this mess, are now refusing to let us clean it up.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:49):  I also rise today to speak in relation to this important matter of public interest. After hearing from the other side, what is really happening in health in this country is that we are just continuing on from where Tony Abbott gutted health: when he was minister, he took a billion dollars out of health. That is exactly the road we are heading back down when it comes to this government and their policies on health.


I am speaking because I am really concerned about the impact it is going to have on my home state of Tasmania. This short-sighted tax on GP visits, and the medicine price increases, will hit pensioners, low-income families and those with chronic illnesses particularly hard. Let's just remember what Tony Abbott said to the Australian people before the election. He promised his government would be a government of no surprises and no excuses—no new taxes and no cuts to health. That is without the promises and commitments he supposedly gave to the Australian people that there would be no cuts to education and no changes in aged care. We all know what happened when it came to aged care—cutting the supplement for those people with the most chronic forms of dementia in this country. What did they do? They came into this place on 26 June and they cut that supplement without any consultation or discussion with those who provide that invaluable care for the most vulnerable in our community.


It has been proven that every single week over the very long 12 months this government has been in power, they have broken at least one promise. That list of broken promises is continuing. We know that this Prime Minister has ripped up Labor's historic health and hospitals agreement with the states, slashing more than $50 billion out of the public hospitals. He also wants to slap a $7 tax on everyone who visits a GP, everyone who has a pathology test and everyone who has to have an MRI. This equates to a $3.5 billion tax hike on health. It might be fine for those people on the other side to say, 'Well, that's on average $10 or $13 for the Australian people'—but we all know there is no such person as an average person in this country who only spends $10 extra a year on hospitals, or going to visit the GP, or having a prescription filled. The reality, if you get out into the real suburbs of Australia and listen to people, is they will have to make a choice. If they have four children at home and they are all sick—which is generally what happens, because most families are caring and sharing and when they bring something home from school they share it around—what are they going to do? Do they say, 'Okay, the two youngest can go to the doctor, but we cannot afford for the two eldest children to go'. Or, 'We can't send mum or dad along to the doctor because we can't afford it.' That is the reality of life in the real Australia. I ask those people on the other side, those people who represent the electorate of Bass, Braddon and Lyons—the three amigos who are always talking about writing in to save the world—where are they when it comes to standing up for Tasmanian families? Where are they when those people who can least afford it have to make some very tough decisions about filling their prescriptions? They will say that they already know there are people who have gone into pharmacies and said, 'Look, I cannot afford it if this government is going to continue to raise the price of medicines. I just want to know if I really need to take these tablets every day or can I just take them every second day?' That is the reality, because people are really fearful. They are really concerned about what impact this budget is going to have on their health and well-being.


Those opposite can try to trivialise it and say it is $10 a week. When you are a family struggling to make ends meet already, that $10, which we know is not a realistic figure, is very important to your weekly budget. Those on the other side of the chamber have decided this in the interests of a supposed budget crisis. It is really interesting that when the minister was in New Zealand recently, he said that the Australian economy was sound and robust. Yet when he is in this country the government wants to put a tax— (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:54):  I rise today to put on the record that it is interesting that we have been hearing a lot of debate from the other side about the badness of this so-called co-payment policy. Even Senator Brown, in her opening remarks, made the comment that it was bad health policy. It is tremendously interesting that it was actually the Labor Party that first introduced a Medicare co-payment, back in 1991. Their current shadow Assistant Treasurer, Andrew Leigh, has strongly advocated for a co-payment. He is quoted as saying:


As economists have shown, the ideal modelling involves a small co-payment. Not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc.


The idea is hardly radical, so I find it really quite bizarre that we are having this debate right now about the co-payment being such bad policy when it started life as Labor Party policy. In relation to the PBS, it is the same thing. We have had a co-payment on the PBS since 1960. That is 50 years for which we have had a co-payment. Right through this entire time the Labor Party has supported this co-payment measure. In 1986, the Labor government increased the general co-payment on the PBS from $5 to $10—a 100 per cent increase. In 1990, the Labor government introduced for the very first time a PBS co-payment on pensioners. In 2004, the Labor opposition, with Julia Gillard as the shadow health minister, supported a $4.90 increase in the general PBS co-payment and an 80c increase in the concessional PBS co-payment. As you can see from these comments, this is hardly a new thing. This has not been a bolt out of the blue or some radical new policy that nobody has ever heard of or ever considered. The fact remains: why is the coalition government having to introduce any of these policies in the first place? It is simply because we have a budget mess that needs to be fixed.


Everybody would like to think that we could go on in life with universal health care, with universal education and with all these wonderful things that over the last 20 years Australians have come to accept as a given. Unfortunately, the credit card is maxed out. That is exactly what has happened here. The Australian Labor Party, in the six years they were in government, maxed out Australia's credit card. There comes a time when all responsible fiscal managers—and that includes the Greens if they are going to play in this space—realise that we cannot continue to spend beyond our means. When the coalition government came to power in September last year, we realised we had a number of things we had to do. One was to get the budget situation back into some semblance of order.


Another thing we realised we needed to do for the long-term benefit of all Australians was to make sure that we have a sustainable ongoing Medicare system. To do that, we obviously had to make some changes, because the rapid growth of expenditure that was occurring in the health space was completely and utterly unsustainable. Those opposite can go on all they like about there not being a budget emergency, but in the medical benefits sphere the growth in spending had gone from $8 billion a decade ago to $20 billion today and was projected to be $34 billion in 10 years time. You do not have to be an economist, like Andrew Leigh, to work out that that is an unsustainable trajectory in terms of growth and the growth in expenditure. What we needed to do, and what we have done, is come up with a policy—it is not a radical new policy, but a policy in the past of those opposite, and one that in some instances is still a policy of those opposite—so that we can build a sustainable long-term medical system, understanding that we have to make sure that it is as affordable today as it was in the past and into the future.


To correct the record in relation to the constant carping about cuts to the health budget: we have not cut the health budget.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Of course you have.



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left. 




Senator RUSTON:
  Funding to the states for hospital services has increased by nine per cent, or $1.3 billion a year, next year. That is not a cut in health spending. In 2015-16, we see a further increase and it continues on over the forward estimates of this government's forward estimates budget. I say to Senator Bilyk, who was carrying on about how people on welfare could afford all these things, that the best form of assistance that we can give to those people that are unemployed is to give them a job.


The idea that big government and spending will get us out of this mess has proved over the last six years to be a complete and utter disaster. Big governments and governments spending their way out of an economic disaster zone are no way to correct the economy. The best way that we can help Australians to be better able to afford to pay this small, modest co-payment—




Senator Kim Carr:
  Modest! On your wage, I suppose it is modest. On a senator's wage, I suppose it is modest.




Senator RUSTON:
  That is how, Senator Carr—through you, Mr President—it was described by one of your shadow ministers, Mr Andrew Leigh. The best way that we can make co-payments affordable for Australians is not to continue to put the burden on government but to get the economy moving again. If we can put more money in the pockets of these people, they can make their own choices. I do not believe that I am best placed to make decisions on behalf of Australians. I think that Australians are best placed to make decisions on behalf of themselves. It is the height of hypocrisy to be standing here and saying that this 'small, modest co-payment'—to quote Mr Leigh—is some terrible thing. It is absolutely hypocritical! (Time expired)

Introduction



The purpose of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Repeal) Bill 2014 is to repeal the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011 (the Act). 


Australia is blessed with a diverse energy mix. Along with the traditional energy sources such as coal, which has powered our economy and our society for decades, we also have rich gas reserves which supply domestic power and through our exports make Australia an energy superpower.


Renewable energy also plays a role in our energy mix.


Ensuring Australia's energy security and addressing long-term questions relating to energy policy are a key priority for the Australian Government.


Australia is making significant investments in renewable energy.


$1 billion dollars of taxpayer funds have already been committed to nearly 200 ARENA projects across a suite of renewable energy types.


Industry has matched this investment with a further $1.8billion, taking the investment in Australian renewables to a total of $2.8billion as a result of the programme. 


This is a very significant amount of money and comes on top of direct and indirect support that has occurred through the Renewable Energy Target scheme and various other state and territory renewable energy schemes. 


The Government has been very clear that we are facing a Budget emergency and savings have to be achieved to return the Budget to surplus. 


Passage of the Bill will transfer management and decision-making on Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) functions to the Minister and Department of Industry. 


It is anticipated to deliver savings of almost $1.3 billion, as identified in the 2014-15 Budget.


The investments of more than $1 billion in projects will continue under this new arrangement. Contrary to what some may claim, Australia is not walking away from renewable energy. 


I'll say again—$1 billion in taxpayers' funds, and another $1.8 billion in private funds has been invested in renewable energy projects under the ARENA banner. 


By any definition, in any industry, that's a lot of skin in the game.


Established on 1 July 2012, ARENA's objectives were to improve the competitiveness and increase the supply of renewable energy and related technologies. 


Financial assistance, largely through grants, has been provided to nearly 200 renewable energy developments including the construction of renewable energy projects, the research and development of various technologies and methods of deployment, and activities to capture and share knowledge gained through all these projects to advance the sector towards full commerciality. 


ARENA has made significant progress towards achieving its objectives. 


The investments have been made to support renewable energy projects across all stages of the innovation chain – from research in the laboratory to large scale technology demonstration projects. 


The total value of these projects is around $2.8 billion. Some examples of projects currently being supported by ARENA include:


the large solar photovoltaic project by AGL at Nyngan and Broken Hill—the largest solar project in Australia—a project that was granted $166million of taxpayer funds through ARENA;


the Carnegie wave energy project offshore from Garden Island in West Australia—a project currently at demonstration phase that has received ARENA funding totaling $13 million;


the King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project which uses a unique combination of several renewable technologies and has benefitted from over $6 million of ARENA funding; and


a facility at James Cook University that received $5 million to demonstrate biocrude production from seaweed.


The Government is keen to see outcomes from these and the many other projects currently funded under ARENA. 


I would like to take the opportunity to thank the CEO of ARENA—Ivor Frischknecht, the Chair of the ARENA Board Greg Bourne and the three other Board Members Dr Brian Spalding, Judith Smith, and Betsy Donaghey who have been thoroughly professional in executing their duties under the ARENA Act. Under the Board's direction, ARENA has played an important role of increasing the competitiveness of technologies and the supply of renewable energy in Australia.


The Government will be ensuring that each project is well managed, meeting its' contracted milestones and contributing to the advancement of an industry that has seen considerable Government and customer funded investment in recent years. 


This Government believes in providing the policy framework where Australian businesses can grow and compete in an increasingly competitive global marketplace without relying on hand-outs. 


We will be ensuring that $1 billion of existing investment and the knowledge shared as a result of this investment gets us closer to this goal. 


This focus over the life of these projects will be to make sure that the investments that are already made help progress the renewable energy industry.


Delivering on these projects will allow Australia to take a pragmatic approach, focussing our capabilities to ensure that Australia is well positioned to take up technologies that work as they become commercial. 


This Government supports renewable energy and acknowledges the important role it plays in Australia's diverse energy mix. 


And this Government is making the tough choices to address Labor's debt and deficit disaster, returning $1.3 billion to the Budget as a result of this Bill.


But despite Labor's appalling record in managing the country's finances over their six years in Government, we still want to ensure the $1 billion of Government investments in the renewable energy industry provide projects with every chance to succeed to help advance the industry.




Specifics of the Bill



I now turn to the specific aspects of the Bill.



The Bill repeals the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011.


The Bill provides for the transfer of all of ARENA existing contracts and commitments to the Commonwealth, with the Department of Industry to assume management on the commencement of this Bill.


Those applications for financial assistance from ARENA which are undecided by the commencement time will lapse.


This Government supports the energy and resources sector. It is one our economy's most significant drivers of jobs, private sector investment and national revenue.


We recognise and value the sector's depth and its diversity and will continue to build a long-term framework that will seize our advantages, build on our strengths and consolidate Australia's global standing as an energy superpower.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-09-02,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:07):  I am continuing my contribution by expressing the Greens' opposition to this bill. We consider that it will have adverse outcomes for job seekers and we do not believe this is the appropriate approach. In fact, we believe the evidence to the committee showed that this bill would discourage people from re-entering the workforce quickly, and we know that is vital for positive outcomes. We believe this bill is overly punitive and there is no need for this type of change.


I left off by saying that we are concerned about some of the adverse human rights impacts of this legislation; I was also talking about some of the issues raised by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. We also need to be considering this particular piece of legislation in light of other changes the government is proposing to make and in light of the circumstances that people are currently facing. We are concerned about the community impacts of a number of pieces of legislation on job seekers and that the government is, once again, relying on charities to respond to and solve the crises that people will face. 


While the government perpetrates the myth that people have to be forced into work, witnesses to the inquiry clearly said that people actually want to work. Dr Falzon articulated his concerns about the bills, but also said:


As opposed to the set of assumptions that this legislation is predicated on, people do want to work and they love the opportunity to meaningfully participate economically and socially


The truth of the matter is that job seekers far outnumber the available jobs. We received evidence that there are ten times as many job seekers as people on Newstart, Youth Allowance and the Disability Support Pension who have the capacity to work and whom the government is encouraging into work. We also have to look at the number of people who are in the labour market but under-employed at the moment. I found one of Senator Abetz's answers in question time today incredible. I partly understand where he is coming from, but he implied that many of the jobs that people get are not advertised. A lot of the information we received in the inquiry was about advertised jobs. However, to suggest that there are nearly enough jobs out for the people who cannot find work is just ludicrous and lends no credibility to the government's argument of encouraging people in employment. The simple fact is that there are no enough jobs out there for the people who are currently unemployed. 


In his evidence to the committee, Professor Mallett said: 


My experience, as well as in the research evidence, suggests that people are highly motivated to build independent lives. They actually do not, for the most part, want to be reliant on income support; they want to build independent, sustainable lives.


This issue is not a behavioural issue; it is a structural issue. Those jobs are not there, and it is ludicrous to try to suggest that simply looking hard enough will find you a job. We know that there are a high number of people who are currently unemployed, particularly young people. We know that youth unemployment is growing; it is not that young people do not want to work. They do want to work and, as evidence to the inquiry pointed out, they want to build independent lives. They do not actually want to live in poverty and they do not want to be stuck on the $36 a day from Newstart. People do not actively choose that lifestyle; they want to find work and they need some support to overcome barriers they have to employment. One of the issues that arose in the speech pathology inquiry was that having information and communication disorders impacts on people's ability to engage with the workforce or learning to engage with the workforce. These are the sorts of things that we need to be looking at. The prevalence data indicates that this is a significant issue. My point there is that there are many things that are barriers to people's employment. 


This kind of tough approach is not an incentive, but punitive and acts as a disincentive. They have perverse outcomes. I have had constituents calling my office with concerns about these and other changes that the government is bringing in. These reforms we are deeply concerned will have negative impacts that are counterproductive to supporting job seekers into work. People who have worked in this area for a long time have had experience and evidence that shows that this approach does not work and will not work. As the president of National Welfare Rights Network, Ms O’Halloran told the inquiry:


Our network opposes the introduction of the bill before you, fundamentally on the ground that we question the purpose of the bill—whether it is actually to punish people or to help people into paid work. We would think that we would all be united in the view that helping a person who is unemployed into paid work should be the goal, and we do not believe that this bill will achieve that goal—in fact, we think it will be counterproductive. That is based on our casework experience with the heavy penalty system introduced in 2006 and the many changes to that system since that time.


If the aim is to get job seekers to comply with requirements and move into employment, it seems unwarranted to punish people once they have complied or intend to comply. Dr Mestan told the inquiry:


Worse than ineffectual, the policy is likely to be counterproductive because, once a person is sanctioned, they have no incentive to meet requirements, whereas in the current regime, where payments are recommenced upon compliance, there is a strong incentive for a sanctioned person to quickly meet requirements.


We know from the evidence that punitive approaches do not work. We need to be looking at how we support people entering employment while recognising the structural barriers in terms of the labour market and also the other barriers to employment that people face. The government should be looking at those, rather than continuing down this ideological route that demonises people, takes a punitive approach and does not recognise the value that people place on finding work. The government should recognise that people do engage with work when they are given support to overcome the barriers to employment and when they are provided with a case management and individualised approach that does not treat people as simply a number on a piece of paper. Such an approach treats them as individuals and recognises that they each have their own concerns, needs, barriers to employment and need for particular areas of support. Ms O'Halloran also said:


If you look at the number of appeals, the appeals also dropped. Our casework experience was that people were getting penalties but they stopped appealing because it was a much faster, better route for them to just re-engage and do a compliance activity.


The point being made to the inquiry was that people do engage with the current regime. You are better off taking that approach than taking a punitive approach like the one that is outlined in this bill. We will not be supporting this bill. We will continue to oppose a punitive approach, because we do not believe that it produces the best outcomes.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,19,1
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:16):  I find the criticisms of those opposing the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill to be quite extraordinary and not based on any sort of fact. What I saw during the inquiry into this bill was a regime that gives every opportunity for those genuinely seeking work to get the support they need and to continue to receive benefits. The only ones we are talking about in this bill are those who simply, after being given umpteen chances, refuse to help themselves. Those are the people we are talking about. We are not talking about people who are genuinely looking for work and genuinely complying with their obligations.


We heard from Senator Siewert, Senator Cameron and others. Senator Cameron did not address the bill in his speech. Senator Siewert at least addressed the bill. She had the right bill. Senator Cameron, the shadow minister, was talking about something completely different. I can address some of what Senator Siewert had to say in terms of those who are looking for work, those who are doing their best. The good news is that this bill does not impact on those people. It does not impact on those people in the slightest. I will read a little bit from the evidence we had from the department about who it actually applies to. I will talk the Senate through how many chances someone has to be given under this legislation before a penalty can even potentially be applied. It is important that we get these facts on the table because I think, if most Australians heard how many chances people had, they would easily dismiss some of the criticisms that we have heard from some people in this chamber and other people who appeared before the committee. Just to put people's minds at rest, I will quote from some of the evidence that we had from the department:


The bill will not impact job seekers who cannot get work despite their best efforts. It will not impact those whose failure to meet their participation requirements is beyond their control and of course it will not impact the 98 per cent of job seekers who do not incur these types of failures. Rather, the bill targets those who have received but refused an offer of suitable work without a reasonable excuse or have been found after an in-depth assessment by the Department of Human Services to have been persistently and wilfully non-compliant.


That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about people who are doing their best and we are not talking about people who make the odd mistake in their efforts to try and find a job. We are talking about people who simply refuse work when it is offered to them or who simply refuse time after time to comply with their obligations. It is absolutely critical that we get this on the record, because some of the commentary in some of the speeches has given a completely misleading impression about what we are talking about here. The coalition believes that we should support those who are looking for work and this legislation will continue that support. But it will not do what the former Labor Party did and effectively provide no penalty in the end when people persistently and wilfully do not comply with their obligations. We believe that at some point, after rigorous process, there does need to be some direct incentive. 


Taxpayers deserve better than what they were given under the Labor Party. They deserve better than the statistics we have seen. I will touch on some of the statistics. This is not about the 98 per cent; it is about the two per cent who persistently and wilfully do the wrong thing. When we lump all of these people together, it undermines those who are genuinely seeking work and who are genuinely using their best endeavours to get a job in difficult circumstances. This bill does not affect them. The approach that the Labor Party are advocating is a slap in the face to those genuine jobseekers who do try to do the right thing. But there are some in our community who simply will not. They are given more and more chances and eventually we have to say, 'Well, there does have to be a penalty.' We saw the statistics and we heard from the department, who said in their evidence:


In 2008-09, the year before the introduction of waivers, 644 penalties were applied for refusing work. In 2012-13, 1,718 penalties were applied for refusing work and 1,227 of these were waived. This means that on 1,227 occasions job seekers who had been offered a job refused that job and returned immediately to income support payment. For this reason, it is intended that job seekers who refuse work should not be able to have their penalty waived and return immediately to payment. We hope that this will provide sufficient incentive for job seekers to accept work when they are offered it.


Let us look at the overall penalties when we are talking about persistent non-compliance. Again quoting from the department:


In 2012-13 there were 28,237 penalties applied for persistent non-compliance; 73 per cent of these were waived and 30 per cent of these waivers were the job seeker's second or subsequent waiver. This indicated that unlimited waivers is undermining the deterrent effect of penalties by allowing a significant number of job seekers to persist in their non-compliant behaviour without consequence.




Senator Bilyk:
  Do you ever look at vulnerability indicators? 




Senator SESELJA:
  Indeed we do. I will touch on vulnerability indicators. This goes to how many safeguards there are. It is worth talking people through what it takes for someone to get to a point where they could potentially have a penalty applied for persistent and wilful non-compliance. It does not happen the first time, it does not happen the second time and it does not happen the third time. It happens after a series of occasions and a series of reviews. What has to happen is that a job seeker has to fail to comply with their obligations three times in six months. But it goes much further than that; there is a process all along the way to get to that point. What we know is that we have service providers working with job seekers—we heard from some of those service providers, and I do not doubt that those service providers are compassionate. Many of them are in the not-for-profit sector, but regardless of whether they are from the not-for-profit sector or otherwise they are compassionate and they are doing their best to help job seekers to find work.


We know that for someone to get to the three breaches in six months they have to go through a first process, because there is discretion from that service provider as to whether it then goes to the department. In all likelihood, by the time it gets to the department it has happened a few times, because the service provider is not going to refer them to the department on the first occasion if there is a good excuse. They are going to work compassionately and as best they can. So by the time they are getting to the department's attention, where we are talking about the first strike, this is a person who, in all likelihood, has failed to comply on several occasions. We do not know exactly how many, but there is a discretion there, and we know that many of these service providers are doing their best. I do not think anyone in this chamber thinks the service providers we heard from would capriciously be reporting someone to the department. There has to be a level of non-compliance over a period of time before they come to the department.


Then it gets to the department, and at each level it is reviewed. Sometimes there will be a good excuse, but this is about three occasions where it is deemed there is no reasonable excuse. By the time they get to that third occasion in six months where they are deemed to have not complied with no reasonable excuse, you can safely say that that individual has likely been non-compliant in a significant way on a significant number of occasions. Then we have a further process where these non-compliances are reviewed. We were told there were about 75,000 in the last financial year who got to this point. Then that gets a detailed review, where a number of factors are considered. Even though they have failed to comply several times, we have a situation where a comprehensive review is done to see whether it is a genuinely systemic problem and there is genuinely persistent and wilful non-compliance. Of those 75,000, we heard that only one-third were then potentially having penalties applied to them. Two-thirds, who have failed to comply on many occasions, will never be subject to a penalty. Let us be clear on that—they will never be subject to a penalty. Then we have a situation where those one-third are able to have the penalty waived. In fact, that will continue under this legislation. They will still be able to have that penalty waived. Then we have a situation where the individual has the ability to appeal the decision. If the department has acted in an unreasonable way, they can appeal that and the decision can be overturned. 


Any reasonable observer would say that that is a lot of chances. We are not talking about someone who gets right to the end of that process and has a penalty applied—they can still have that waived under the new system. They just cannot have it waived on multiple occasions, which is what has been happening under the current legislation. Surely, any reasonable observer or any reasonable member of the Australian community—be they a job seeker, be they in paid employment, be they low- or middle-income earners—would look at this and say, 'That is a fair go.' 


We are doing our bit to support people. We are giving them every chance to continue to have that support. All this bill does in regard to persistent and wilful non-compliance is to say that you go through those umpteen chances, decisions are reviewed that many times, and the two-thirds who have persistently not complied are reviewed and two-thirds of them might have some reasonable excuse. We have applied the vulnerability indicators, which look at a range of things that might be affecting someone. Whether it is someone suffering from homelessness or mental illness or a whole range of other things, those vulnerability indicators are applied. Then there is an appeals process. We are saying that if someone has had that many chances and they get the penalties, they can have them waived once but they cannot have them waived on multiple occasions. We talked about the 25,268 serious failures for repeated non-compliance, and of these the penalty was waived in 73 per cent of cases. And this is an important point—of those waived, nearly one-third were for a job seeker's second or third episode of non-compliance. This is right at the end of that process I have outlined.


The Labor Party, the Greens and others are saying that, in the end, there should be no penalty and that you can just persistently, time and time again, not meet your requirements. Surely, we should demand better. Surely, we should say that, after you have had that many chances and had the penalty waived once, we are not going to waive it again. We are not going to waive it a second and a third and a fourth time, as is occurring in some cases. Surely, that is not good enough. The Labor Party, the Greens and others have tried to put out this story that it is somehow unjust. I do not think the average taxpayer would see it as unjust if, after umpteen chances and after a waiver, we say, 'Enough. You can't have multiple waivers. You can't just keep doing the same thing. We are eventually holding you to a standard that the community expects.' I think that that is a reasonable way to go.


We heard very compelling evidence on the statistics that I mentioned and the process that I mentioned. We talk about the vulnerability indicators. That is a detailed process that is there to make sure that we do not penalise someone who has had a minor failure to comply—that is not who we are talking about. We are not talking about the 98 per cent of job seekers; we are talking about the two per cent of job seekers who refuse to do the right thing. After giving them so many chances, we should hold them to a standard.


The Labor Party used to be the party of workers. They are now the party, in arguing the case that they have argued, of defending dole bludgers. That is what we are talking about.




Senator Carol Brown:
  That is outrageous!




Senator SESELJA:
  No, it is not, actually. What you do is lump all job seekers together. Ninety eight per cent of them are trying to do the right thing. Two per cent consistently refuse to do the right thing, and that is what you defend.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators, please come to order!




Senator SESELJA:
  I see the sensitivity across the aisle about what they are defending when you put it out there as to what they are defending. You go out to your community. Go out to the hardworking people in your community and say, 'I'm not going to just defend them on one, two, three or five occasions; I'm going to defend them on as many occasions when they breach their obligations as they like. There will be no penalties under the Labor Party. They will consistently have those penalties waived.'


What we are saying is that, after you have been through all those processes and had all those chances—you have had your appeals and had your penalty waived once—we are not going to waive it twice or a third time. Surely, that is a reasonable thing. Take a good look at what you are defending. In the speeches by senators from the Labor Party, we did not actually hear you talk about the legislation—and I am not surprised you did not talk about the legislation.




Senator Carol Brown:
  You've just said exactly what your government thinks about the unemployed.




Senator SESELJA:
  Your response to this, Senator Brown, indicates your sensitivity on this point. Senator Cameron, your shadow spokesman, did not mention this legislation. He did not mention one aspect of this legislation; he did not mention one clause of this legislation—and there is a reason for that. The reason is that it is very hard to defend your claims when you go to the detail. You can talk in abstract, but, when we put the facts on the table about how detailed the process is and about how many chances people have, surely it is reasonable that we eventually hold them to a standard. That is what the coalition is advocating here—nothing more, nothing less.


We will continue to have all of those safeguards so that the vast bulk, the 98 per cent of job seekers who do the right thing, want to get a job and are trying their best, will not be affected by this legislation. But the Labor Party's argument is that there should be no standards. We should not hold anyone to account at any stage. We take a different view and we do not shy away from it. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:34):  Prior to the last election, Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised to create one million jobs within the next five years and two million jobs within the next 10 years. If the Prime Minister was on track at all to meet his promise, by now more than 166,000 jobs would have been created. But what we have instead is the highest unemployment rate in 12 years and labour force figures which show the government well short of this target. It is little surprise to us on this side that the government fails so miserably when it comes to job creation. Having created close to one million jobs, despite the largest global economic downturn since the Great Depression, Labor has the runs on the board when it comes to job creation and when it comes to looking after those who are looking for work. We know what is needed.


You can imagine how frustrated people are when they listen to Senator Seselja misrepresent what the legislation before us today will actually do. They make every effort on that side to sideline those who are vulnerable and may have trouble finding work because there is not enough work available. What is really frustrating is when they stand idly by and watch thousands of jobs go, as they did, from Alcoa, Qantas, Holden, Toyota, SPC, Electrolux and Gove. Even in my home state and that of Senator Brown, who is in the chamber, Tasmania, we are watching jobs go at Mount Lyell and the Henty mines, while those on the other side, especially the Liberal member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, do nothing for those 350 workers affected.


I have heard Mr Abbot speak about the government being like a fire crew fighting the fire. When it comes to job creation and helping people get jobs, this government is more like the pyromaniac who turns up to the house fire with a deckchair and sits to watch it. There is evidence emerging from economists that many of the cruel cuts in this budget will add fuel to the fire and actually damage the economy and kill jobs. What do the government do when they are confronted with their abject failure on jobs? They try to blame someone else. That is their modus operandi. Of course, they will blame the previous Labor government—they have spent a whole year blaming the previous Labor government for everything that ever happened—despite our job creation record and the decisive action during the GFC. But they will have to really turn their thoughts to how they will deal with people who cannot seek work, and they will have to do it in a way other than what they have suggested so far, which is so punitive and unfair, especially to those who are vulnerable. They cannot avoid the inconvenient truth that they are failing to create jobs, so why not just blame the unemployed and say that the unemployed are not looking and are too lazy and unmotivated to get up and get work. To suggest that anyone would be happy to live on $35 a day, if it meant not having to get off the couch and do any work, is absolutely ludicrous. It is also ludicrous to suggest that all they really need is a good kick in the pants. It was this kind of attitude that was behind the Abbott government's ridiculous proposal that would have seen Australian businesses, including small businesses, swamped with a million job applications a day.


When Senator Abetz was asked by the ABC's 7.30 presenter, Emma Alberici, whether there would be enough positions to apply for in a place like my home state of Tasmania, where jobs are sparse—and Senator Urquhart, another Tasmanian senator, who has just joined me in the chamber, will also understand this—Senator Abetz replied:


When jobs are sparse, it means that you've got to apply for more jobs to get a job.


That is what they think: 'There are not many jobs, but you just have to apply for more.' They do not take into account people's skills, development, ability to do work, or the fact that people might not be able to get a job for reasons that include, for example, psychological issues. Those on the other side just simply say, 'If you have not got a job, you are not trying hard enough.' Never mind whether you are living in an area of high unemployment; never mind that you might not have the financial means to relocate; never mind that moving might mean leaving your family or your support network. Once again, if you are one those vulnerable people who perhaps have a psychological illness, you will need your family around you. Just packing up and moving is not the way to go. Never mind that there are few training opportunities available or that you are struggling to learn because of poor literacy or numeracy. No, if you want a job, then you can apply for a job—any job.


We heard from Senator Abetz in question time today the fact that most jobs are not advertised. I cannot remember the exact quote but I thought that was pretty funny. So you can just want a job and just apply for it. I would suggest a lot of people start applying for Senator Abetz's job, because I am sure that people could do a lot better than those Liberal senators representing Tasmania. If you do not have a job in this day and age, according to the government it is all your own fault.


We are talking about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill. I just want to talk about an article published in The Australian a couple of weeks ago. It featured an excellent profile of a young man from Burnie—his name was Josh Smith—and the challenges that he faces. I quote:


His prospects of finding work are grim. He doesn’t have a driver’s licence because he’s never had access to a car, or someone to teach him to drive, and he can’t afford lessons; there are no trains and the bus service is patchy. He left school in Year 8 and while he’s done a couple of courses, he has no real qualifications.


The article revealed that in Burnie job vacancies in entry-level positions such as waiting tables or stacking shelves can each attract up to 200 applications. Josh Smith lives with his ex-partner and they have a three-year-old daughter. The article poses some interesting and quite useful questions. It goes on to say:


So where does someone like Josh Smith move to? Would anyone employ him? And what about his kid? And, if he doesn’t move, what happens if he loses his dole payment for six months?


What does happen, I wonder, if he loses his dole payment for six months? Well, I suppose he will find it pretty hard to feed his child, let alone himself.


These are really important questions. But as far as this government is concerned the difficulties faced by the Josh Smiths of the world are their own fault. That is why if you are under the age of 30 this government wants to cut your income completely—your social safety net—for a period of six months. That is right—completely. Under this cruel proposal, job seekers under 30 would have to live on nothing but fresh air for half a year. Who knows what they would have to do for food, rent and utilities, or to provide for their children, let alone how they would afford simple things like postage stamps, the paper to submit their job applications, or bus fares or petrol to get to job interviews.


This government is trying to introduce these changes under the cover of mutual obligation. But what this government seeks to do goes way beyond mutual obligation and into the realms of punishment—punishing job seekers for their failure to get a job. It is easier for the Abbott government to punish a vulnerable group in society, one that simply does not have the means to fight back, than it is for them to create the jobs that they have promised. This bill is just one in a suite of proposals to deliver this cruel punishment.


Before I get to the provisions of the bill I will briefly explain the current situation. Under the current provisions of the Social Security (Administrative) Act, job seekers in receipt of a participation payment may incur an eight-week non-payment penalty for serious failures. The main participation payment is Newstart, but the term also encompasses youth allowance, parenting payment and special benefit. Serious failures can include things like refusing suitable work or persistent noncompliance with their participation obligations, such as turning up to meetings with their job service provider.


A penalty is not applied when the job seeker has a reasonable excuse. Reasonable excuses can include such circumstances as the death of a family member, imprisonment, family violence, mental illness, disability or caring responsibilities. Now, quite reasonably, the act also has some waiver provisions through which the public can, for certain reasons, stop short an eight-week non-payment penalty. These include, for example: that a job seeker may start to comply with their participation obligations during the non-payment period; that a job seeker may end up in serious financial hardship if the non-payment period was applied; or that the job seeker may not have had the capacity to comply with a serious failure requirement. What the government is seeking to do with this bill is to make a couple changes under the guise of strengthening this framework. The bill provides that job seekers who incur an eight-week no-payment penalty for refusing suitable work will no longer have the penalty waived.


My Tasmanian colleague, the member for Franklin and shadow minister for employment service, Julie Collins, has been briefed by the Department of Human Services on provisions of this bill and has come to the inescapable conclusion that it is unnecessarily harsh. In her second reading speech, Senator Collins emphasised the point that these changes would discourage re-engagement. Discouraging re-engagement seems to be completely at odds with the aims of getting jobs seekers into work. If the participation obligations are aimed at encouraging job seekers to actively look for work, then why not offer some incentive to reengage? Instead, this bill consigns those job seekers to the too-hard basket.


These changes mean that job seekers who refuse suitable work will serve the eight-week non-payment penalty regardless, unless they have a reasonable excuse. So there is no waiver—no consideration for whether the job seeker is re-engaging with their participation obligations, no consideration of their capacity to comply with the requirement, and no consideration of whether they would experience financial hardship if the penalty is applied. 


The other changes in this bill provide that job seekers who persistently fail to comply with participation obligations will only be able to have the penalty waived once during each period of continuous receipt of the participation payment. There were questions asked in Senate estimates to determine exactly what the effect of this provision would mean. The department revealed that even when Newstart recipients were undergoing a six-month period of no income, as is proposed in the government's cruel budget changes for job seekers under the age of 30, they will be regarded as still being a Newstart recipient, but one who is in receipt of a nil payment. So not only could they be penalised while not receiving any income, but the one waiver restriction could continue to apply for years, depending on how long the job seeker remains unemployed. If they incur the eight-week penalty during their six months of not receiving any income, then the penalty simply extends the period of non-payment. 


The changes to social security for young people under the age of 30 are one of the cruellest measures contained in the budget, but if you combine the six-month non-payment period with the provisions of this bill we could potentially see some long-term job seekers going without a payment for up to 11 months. That gives them only one month before they head into the next six-month period of non-payment. In other words, they would have one month of income support during an 18-month period. So I ask those opposite: is that not just the absolute height of cruelty? These harsh changes will have the greatest impact on some of the most vulnerable job seekers in Australia. 


Senator Seselja was quite happily sprouting statistics when it was his turn to speak. Let me give a few statistics. Last year Centrelink applied 5,263 eight-week non-payment penalties to job seekers with Centrelink vulnerability indicators on their files—that is right; they had vulnerability indicators on their files. This included 1,483 with psychiatric problems or mental illness, 1,149 with homelessness flags on their files, 131 just released from prison, 107 who had experienced a recent traumatic relationship breakdown, and 102 job seekers with a cognitive or neurological impairment.


I heard Senator Abetz recently, in a debate on a disallowance motion, refer to all the reasonable-excuse provisions that apply, such as suffering a mental illness, having family responsibilities and so on. But let me just point out that vulnerability indicators were on the files of those people to whom the penalty was applied. In other words, their mental illness, homelessness, relationship breakdown et cetera was not considered a factor in the serious failure for which they received their penalty. Let me just point that out for those opposite: their vulnerability indicator issues, such as mental illness, homelessness, relationship breakdown et cetera, were not considered factors in the serious failures for which they received their penalties.


We can see from these figures that, despite the reasonable excuse provisions, the penalties were still disproportionately applied to the most vulnerable job seekers. No matter what those on the other side of the chamber say, or try to spin, that is how it was. As at 31 March this year, there were just over 118,000 job seekers with vulnerability indicators on their files. If this bill passes the parliament these job seekers will be at greater risk than others of having their payment suspended. 


Indigenous job seekers have traditionally also been over-represented among those penalised. Over the 2012-13 period, there were 6,895 eight-week penalties applied to Indigenous job seekers, compared with 29,563 for non-Indigenous job seekers. So Indigenous job seekers represented almost one-fifth of those receiving an eight-week penalty. The restrictions of waivers would disproportionately impact some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Are these the people—people with mental illness, people experiencing homelessness—that Australia should reach out a hand and support? Are these the people that Joe Hockey described— (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-09-02,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:07):  I am continuing my contribution by expressing the Greens' opposition to this bill. We consider that it will have adverse outcomes for job seekers and we do not believe this is the appropriate approach. In fact, we believe the evidence to the committee showed that this bill would discourage people from re-entering the workforce quickly, and we know that is vital for positive outcomes. We believe this bill is overly punitive and there is no need for this type of change.


I left off by saying that we are concerned about some of the adverse human rights impacts of this legislation; I was also talking about some of the issues raised by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. We also need to be considering this particular piece of legislation in light of other changes the government is proposing to make and in light of the circumstances that people are currently facing. We are concerned about the community impacts of a number of pieces of legislation on job seekers and that the government is, once again, relying on charities to respond to and solve the crises that people will face. 


While the government perpetrates the myth that people have to be forced into work, witnesses to the inquiry clearly said that people actually want to work. Dr Falzon articulated his concerns about the bills, but also said:


As opposed to the set of assumptions that this legislation is predicated on, people do want to work and they love the opportunity to meaningfully participate economically and socially


The truth of the matter is that job seekers far outnumber the available jobs. We received evidence that there are ten times as many job seekers as people on Newstart, Youth Allowance and the Disability Support Pension who have the capacity to work and whom the government is encouraging into work. We also have to look at the number of people who are in the labour market but under-employed at the moment. I found one of Senator Abetz's answers in question time today incredible. I partly understand where he is coming from, but he implied that many of the jobs that people get are not advertised. A lot of the information we received in the inquiry was about advertised jobs. However, to suggest that there are nearly enough jobs out for the people who cannot find work is just ludicrous and lends no credibility to the government's argument of encouraging people in employment. The simple fact is that there are no enough jobs out there for the people who are currently unemployed. 


In his evidence to the committee, Professor Mallett said: 


My experience, as well as in the research evidence, suggests that people are highly motivated to build independent lives. They actually do not, for the most part, want to be reliant on income support; they want to build independent, sustainable lives.


This issue is not a behavioural issue; it is a structural issue. Those jobs are not there, and it is ludicrous to try to suggest that simply looking hard enough will find you a job. We know that there are a high number of people who are currently unemployed, particularly young people. We know that youth unemployment is growing; it is not that young people do not want to work. They do want to work and, as evidence to the inquiry pointed out, they want to build independent lives. They do not actually want to live in poverty and they do not want to be stuck on the $36 a day from Newstart. People do not actively choose that lifestyle; they want to find work and they need some support to overcome barriers they have to employment. One of the issues that arose in the speech pathology inquiry was that having information and communication disorders impacts on people's ability to engage with the workforce or learning to engage with the workforce. These are the sorts of things that we need to be looking at. The prevalence data indicates that this is a significant issue. My point there is that there are many things that are barriers to people's employment. 


This kind of tough approach is not an incentive, but punitive and acts as a disincentive. They have perverse outcomes. I have had constituents calling my office with concerns about these and other changes that the government is bringing in. These reforms we are deeply concerned will have negative impacts that are counterproductive to supporting job seekers into work. People who have worked in this area for a long time have had experience and evidence that shows that this approach does not work and will not work. As the president of National Welfare Rights Network, Ms O’Halloran told the inquiry:


Our network opposes the introduction of the bill before you, fundamentally on the ground that we question the purpose of the bill—whether it is actually to punish people or to help people into paid work. We would think that we would all be united in the view that helping a person who is unemployed into paid work should be the goal, and we do not believe that this bill will achieve that goal—in fact, we think it will be counterproductive. That is based on our casework experience with the heavy penalty system introduced in 2006 and the many changes to that system since that time.


If the aim is to get job seekers to comply with requirements and move into employment, it seems unwarranted to punish people once they have complied or intend to comply. Dr Mestan told the inquiry:


Worse than ineffectual, the policy is likely to be counterproductive because, once a person is sanctioned, they have no incentive to meet requirements, whereas in the current regime, where payments are recommenced upon compliance, there is a strong incentive for a sanctioned person to quickly meet requirements.


We know from the evidence that punitive approaches do not work. We need to be looking at how we support people entering employment while recognising the structural barriers in terms of the labour market and also the other barriers to employment that people face. The government should be looking at those, rather than continuing down this ideological route that demonises people, takes a punitive approach and does not recognise the value that people place on finding work. The government should recognise that people do engage with work when they are given support to overcome the barriers to employment and when they are provided with a case management and individualised approach that does not treat people as simply a number on a piece of paper. Such an approach treats them as individuals and recognises that they each have their own concerns, needs, barriers to employment and need for particular areas of support. Ms O'Halloran also said:


If you look at the number of appeals, the appeals also dropped. Our casework experience was that people were getting penalties but they stopped appealing because it was a much faster, better route for them to just re-engage and do a compliance activity.


The point being made to the inquiry was that people do engage with the current regime. You are better off taking that approach than taking a punitive approach like the one that is outlined in this bill. We will not be supporting this bill. We will continue to oppose a punitive approach, because we do not believe that it produces the best outcomes.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-09-02,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:16):  I find the criticisms of those opposing the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill to be quite extraordinary and not based on any sort of fact. What I saw during the inquiry into this bill was a regime that gives every opportunity for those genuinely seeking work to get the support they need and to continue to receive benefits. The only ones we are talking about in this bill are those who simply, after being given umpteen chances, refuse to help themselves. Those are the people we are talking about. We are not talking about people who are genuinely looking for work and genuinely complying with their obligations.


We heard from Senator Siewert, Senator Cameron and others. Senator Cameron did not address the bill in his speech. Senator Siewert at least addressed the bill. She had the right bill. Senator Cameron, the shadow minister, was talking about something completely different. I can address some of what Senator Siewert had to say in terms of those who are looking for work, those who are doing their best. The good news is that this bill does not impact on those people. It does not impact on those people in the slightest. I will read a little bit from the evidence we had from the department about who it actually applies to. I will talk the Senate through how many chances someone has to be given under this legislation before a penalty can even potentially be applied. It is important that we get these facts on the table because I think, if most Australians heard how many chances people had, they would easily dismiss some of the criticisms that we have heard from some people in this chamber and other people who appeared before the committee. Just to put people's minds at rest, I will quote from some of the evidence that we had from the department:


The bill will not impact job seekers who cannot get work despite their best efforts. It will not impact those whose failure to meet their participation requirements is beyond their control and of course it will not impact the 98 per cent of job seekers who do not incur these types of failures. Rather, the bill targets those who have received but refused an offer of suitable work without a reasonable excuse or have been found after an in-depth assessment by the Department of Human Services to have been persistently and wilfully non-compliant.


That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about people who are doing their best and we are not talking about people who make the odd mistake in their efforts to try and find a job. We are talking about people who simply refuse work when it is offered to them or who simply refuse time after time to comply with their obligations. It is absolutely critical that we get this on the record, because some of the commentary in some of the speeches has given a completely misleading impression about what we are talking about here. The coalition believes that we should support those who are looking for work and this legislation will continue that support. But it will not do what the former Labor Party did and effectively provide no penalty in the end when people persistently and wilfully do not comply with their obligations. We believe that at some point, after rigorous process, there does need to be some direct incentive. 


Taxpayers deserve better than what they were given under the Labor Party. They deserve better than the statistics we have seen. I will touch on some of the statistics. This is not about the 98 per cent; it is about the two per cent who persistently and wilfully do the wrong thing. When we lump all of these people together, it undermines those who are genuinely seeking work and who are genuinely using their best endeavours to get a job in difficult circumstances. This bill does not affect them. The approach that the Labor Party are advocating is a slap in the face to those genuine jobseekers who do try to do the right thing. But there are some in our community who simply will not. They are given more and more chances and eventually we have to say, 'Well, there does have to be a penalty.' We saw the statistics and we heard from the department, who said in their evidence:


In 2008-09, the year before the introduction of waivers, 644 penalties were applied for refusing work. In 2012-13, 1,718 penalties were applied for refusing work and 1,227 of these were waived. This means that on 1,227 occasions job seekers who had been offered a job refused that job and returned immediately to income support payment. For this reason, it is intended that job seekers who refuse work should not be able to have their penalty waived and return immediately to payment. We hope that this will provide sufficient incentive for job seekers to accept work when they are offered it.


Let us look at the overall penalties when we are talking about persistent non-compliance. Again quoting from the department:


In 2012-13 there were 28,237 penalties applied for persistent non-compliance; 73 per cent of these were waived and 30 per cent of these waivers were the job seeker's second or subsequent waiver. This indicated that unlimited waivers is undermining the deterrent effect of penalties by allowing a significant number of job seekers to persist in their non-compliant behaviour without consequence.




Senator Bilyk:
  Do you ever look at vulnerability indicators? 




Senator SESELJA:
  Indeed we do. I will touch on vulnerability indicators. This goes to how many safeguards there are. It is worth talking people through what it takes for someone to get to a point where they could potentially have a penalty applied for persistent and wilful non-compliance. It does not happen the first time, it does not happen the second time and it does not happen the third time. It happens after a series of occasions and a series of reviews. What has to happen is that a job seeker has to fail to comply with their obligations three times in six months. But it goes much further than that; there is a process all along the way to get to that point. What we know is that we have service providers working with job seekers—we heard from some of those service providers, and I do not doubt that those service providers are compassionate. Many of them are in the not-for-profit sector, but regardless of whether they are from the not-for-profit sector or otherwise they are compassionate and they are doing their best to help job seekers to find work.


We know that for someone to get to the three breaches in six months they have to go through a first process, because there is discretion from that service provider as to whether it then goes to the department. In all likelihood, by the time it gets to the department it has happened a few times, because the service provider is not going to refer them to the department on the first occasion if there is a good excuse. They are going to work compassionately and as best they can. So by the time they are getting to the department's attention, where we are talking about the first strike, this is a person who, in all likelihood, has failed to comply on several occasions. We do not know exactly how many, but there is a discretion there, and we know that many of these service providers are doing their best. I do not think anyone in this chamber thinks the service providers we heard from would capriciously be reporting someone to the department. There has to be a level of non-compliance over a period of time before they come to the department.


Then it gets to the department, and at each level it is reviewed. Sometimes there will be a good excuse, but this is about three occasions where it is deemed there is no reasonable excuse. By the time they get to that third occasion in six months where they are deemed to have not complied with no reasonable excuse, you can safely say that that individual has likely been non-compliant in a significant way on a significant number of occasions. Then we have a further process where these non-compliances are reviewed. We were told there were about 75,000 in the last financial year who got to this point. Then that gets a detailed review, where a number of factors are considered. Even though they have failed to comply several times, we have a situation where a comprehensive review is done to see whether it is a genuinely systemic problem and there is genuinely persistent and wilful non-compliance. Of those 75,000, we heard that only one-third were then potentially having penalties applied to them. Two-thirds, who have failed to comply on many occasions, will never be subject to a penalty. Let us be clear on that—they will never be subject to a penalty. Then we have a situation where those one-third are able to have the penalty waived. In fact, that will continue under this legislation. They will still be able to have that penalty waived. Then we have a situation where the individual has the ability to appeal the decision. If the department has acted in an unreasonable way, they can appeal that and the decision can be overturned. 


Any reasonable observer would say that that is a lot of chances. We are not talking about someone who gets right to the end of that process and has a penalty applied—they can still have that waived under the new system. They just cannot have it waived on multiple occasions, which is what has been happening under the current legislation. Surely, any reasonable observer or any reasonable member of the Australian community—be they a job seeker, be they in paid employment, be they low- or middle-income earners—would look at this and say, 'That is a fair go.' 


We are doing our bit to support people. We are giving them every chance to continue to have that support. All this bill does in regard to persistent and wilful non-compliance is to say that you go through those umpteen chances, decisions are reviewed that many times, and the two-thirds who have persistently not complied are reviewed and two-thirds of them might have some reasonable excuse. We have applied the vulnerability indicators, which look at a range of things that might be affecting someone. Whether it is someone suffering from homelessness or mental illness or a whole range of other things, those vulnerability indicators are applied. Then there is an appeals process. We are saying that if someone has had that many chances and they get the penalties, they can have them waived once but they cannot have them waived on multiple occasions. We talked about the 25,268 serious failures for repeated non-compliance, and of these the penalty was waived in 73 per cent of cases. And this is an important point—of those waived, nearly one-third were for a job seeker's second or third episode of non-compliance. This is right at the end of that process I have outlined.


The Labor Party, the Greens and others are saying that, in the end, there should be no penalty and that you can just persistently, time and time again, not meet your requirements. Surely, we should demand better. Surely, we should say that, after you have had that many chances and had the penalty waived once, we are not going to waive it again. We are not going to waive it a second and a third and a fourth time, as is occurring in some cases. Surely, that is not good enough. The Labor Party, the Greens and others have tried to put out this story that it is somehow unjust. I do not think the average taxpayer would see it as unjust if, after umpteen chances and after a waiver, we say, 'Enough. You can't have multiple waivers. You can't just keep doing the same thing. We are eventually holding you to a standard that the community expects.' I think that that is a reasonable way to go.


We heard very compelling evidence on the statistics that I mentioned and the process that I mentioned. We talk about the vulnerability indicators. That is a detailed process that is there to make sure that we do not penalise someone who has had a minor failure to comply—that is not who we are talking about. We are not talking about the 98 per cent of job seekers; we are talking about the two per cent of job seekers who refuse to do the right thing. After giving them so many chances, we should hold them to a standard.


The Labor Party used to be the party of workers. They are now the party, in arguing the case that they have argued, of defending dole bludgers. That is what we are talking about.




Senator Carol Brown:
  That is outrageous!




Senator SESELJA:
  No, it is not, actually. What you do is lump all job seekers together. Ninety eight per cent of them are trying to do the right thing. Two per cent consistently refuse to do the right thing, and that is what you defend.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators, please come to order!




Senator SESELJA:
  I see the sensitivity across the aisle about what they are defending when you put it out there as to what they are defending. You go out to your community. Go out to the hardworking people in your community and say, 'I'm not going to just defend them on one, two, three or five occasions; I'm going to defend them on as many occasions when they breach their obligations as they like. There will be no penalties under the Labor Party. They will consistently have those penalties waived.'


What we are saying is that, after you have been through all those processes and had all those chances—you have had your appeals and had your penalty waived once—we are not going to waive it twice or a third time. Surely, that is a reasonable thing. Take a good look at what you are defending. In the speeches by senators from the Labor Party, we did not actually hear you talk about the legislation—and I am not surprised you did not talk about the legislation.




Senator Carol Brown:
  You've just said exactly what your government thinks about the unemployed.




Senator SESELJA:
  Your response to this, Senator Brown, indicates your sensitivity on this point. Senator Cameron, your shadow spokesman, did not mention this legislation. He did not mention one aspect of this legislation; he did not mention one clause of this legislation—and there is a reason for that. The reason is that it is very hard to defend your claims when you go to the detail. You can talk in abstract, but, when we put the facts on the table about how detailed the process is and about how many chances people have, surely it is reasonable that we eventually hold them to a standard. That is what the coalition is advocating here—nothing more, nothing less.


We will continue to have all of those safeguards so that the vast bulk, the 98 per cent of job seekers who do the right thing, want to get a job and are trying their best, will not be affected by this legislation. But the Labor Party's argument is that there should be no standards. We should not hold anyone to account at any stage. We take a different view and we do not shy away from it. I commend this bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,2
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:34):  Prior to the last election, Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised to create one million jobs within the next five years and two million jobs within the next 10 years. If the Prime Minister was on track at all to meet his promise, by now more than 166,000 jobs would have been created. But what we have instead is the highest unemployment rate in 12 years and labour force figures which show the government well short of this target. It is little surprise to us on this side that the government fails so miserably when it comes to job creation. Having created close to one million jobs, despite the largest global economic downturn since the Great Depression, Labor has the runs on the board when it comes to job creation and when it comes to looking after those who are looking for work. We know what is needed.


You can imagine how frustrated people are when they listen to Senator Seselja misrepresent what the legislation before us today will actually do. They make every effort on that side to sideline those who are vulnerable and may have trouble finding work because there is not enough work available. What is really frustrating is when they stand idly by and watch thousands of jobs go, as they did, from Alcoa, Qantas, Holden, Toyota, SPC, Electrolux and Gove. Even in my home state and that of Senator Brown, who is in the chamber, Tasmania, we are watching jobs go at Mount Lyell and the Henty mines, while those on the other side, especially the Liberal member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, do nothing for those 350 workers affected.


I have heard Mr Abbot speak about the government being like a fire crew fighting the fire. When it comes to job creation and helping people get jobs, this government is more like the pyromaniac who turns up to the house fire with a deckchair and sits to watch it. There is evidence emerging from economists that many of the cruel cuts in this budget will add fuel to the fire and actually damage the economy and kill jobs. What do the government do when they are confronted with their abject failure on jobs? They try to blame someone else. That is their modus operandi. Of course, they will blame the previous Labor government—they have spent a whole year blaming the previous Labor government for everything that ever happened—despite our job creation record and the decisive action during the GFC. But they will have to really turn their thoughts to how they will deal with people who cannot seek work, and they will have to do it in a way other than what they have suggested so far, which is so punitive and unfair, especially to those who are vulnerable. They cannot avoid the inconvenient truth that they are failing to create jobs, so why not just blame the unemployed and say that the unemployed are not looking and are too lazy and unmotivated to get up and get work. To suggest that anyone would be happy to live on $35 a day, if it meant not having to get off the couch and do any work, is absolutely ludicrous. It is also ludicrous to suggest that all they really need is a good kick in the pants. It was this kind of attitude that was behind the Abbott government's ridiculous proposal that would have seen Australian businesses, including small businesses, swamped with a million job applications a day.


When Senator Abetz was asked by the ABC's 7.30 presenter, Emma Alberici, whether there would be enough positions to apply for in a place like my home state of Tasmania, where jobs are sparse—and Senator Urquhart, another Tasmanian senator, who has just joined me in the chamber, will also understand this—Senator Abetz replied:


When jobs are sparse, it means that you've got to apply for more jobs to get a job.


That is what they think: 'There are not many jobs, but you just have to apply for more.' They do not take into account people's skills, development, ability to do work, or the fact that people might not be able to get a job for reasons that include, for example, psychological issues. Those on the other side just simply say, 'If you have not got a job, you are not trying hard enough.' Never mind whether you are living in an area of high unemployment; never mind that you might not have the financial means to relocate; never mind that moving might mean leaving your family or your support network. Once again, if you are one those vulnerable people who perhaps have a psychological illness, you will need your family around you. Just packing up and moving is not the way to go. Never mind that there are few training opportunities available or that you are struggling to learn because of poor literacy or numeracy. No, if you want a job, then you can apply for a job—any job.


We heard from Senator Abetz in question time today the fact that most jobs are not advertised. I cannot remember the exact quote but I thought that was pretty funny. So you can just want a job and just apply for it. I would suggest a lot of people start applying for Senator Abetz's job, because I am sure that people could do a lot better than those Liberal senators representing Tasmania. If you do not have a job in this day and age, according to the government it is all your own fault.


We are talking about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill. I just want to talk about an article published in The Australian a couple of weeks ago. It featured an excellent profile of a young man from Burnie—his name was Josh Smith—and the challenges that he faces. I quote:


His prospects of finding work are grim. He doesn’t have a driver’s licence because he’s never had access to a car, or someone to teach him to drive, and he can’t afford lessons; there are no trains and the bus service is patchy. He left school in Year 8 and while he’s done a couple of courses, he has no real qualifications.


The article revealed that in Burnie job vacancies in entry-level positions such as waiting tables or stacking shelves can each attract up to 200 applications. Josh Smith lives with his ex-partner and they have a three-year-old daughter. The article poses some interesting and quite useful questions. It goes on to say:


So where does someone like Josh Smith move to? Would anyone employ him? And what about his kid? And, if he doesn’t move, what happens if he loses his dole payment for six months?


What does happen, I wonder, if he loses his dole payment for six months? Well, I suppose he will find it pretty hard to feed his child, let alone himself.


These are really important questions. But as far as this government is concerned the difficulties faced by the Josh Smiths of the world are their own fault. That is why if you are under the age of 30 this government wants to cut your income completely—your social safety net—for a period of six months. That is right—completely. Under this cruel proposal, job seekers under 30 would have to live on nothing but fresh air for half a year. Who knows what they would have to do for food, rent and utilities, or to provide for their children, let alone how they would afford simple things like postage stamps, the paper to submit their job applications, or bus fares or petrol to get to job interviews.


This government is trying to introduce these changes under the cover of mutual obligation. But what this government seeks to do goes way beyond mutual obligation and into the realms of punishment—punishing job seekers for their failure to get a job. It is easier for the Abbott government to punish a vulnerable group in society, one that simply does not have the means to fight back, than it is for them to create the jobs that they have promised. This bill is just one in a suite of proposals to deliver this cruel punishment.


Before I get to the provisions of the bill I will briefly explain the current situation. Under the current provisions of the Social Security (Administrative) Act, job seekers in receipt of a participation payment may incur an eight-week non-payment penalty for serious failures. The main participation payment is Newstart, but the term also encompasses youth allowance, parenting payment and special benefit. Serious failures can include things like refusing suitable work or persistent noncompliance with their participation obligations, such as turning up to meetings with their job service provider.


A penalty is not applied when the job seeker has a reasonable excuse. Reasonable excuses can include such circumstances as the death of a family member, imprisonment, family violence, mental illness, disability or caring responsibilities. Now, quite reasonably, the act also has some waiver provisions through which the public can, for certain reasons, stop short an eight-week non-payment penalty. These include, for example: that a job seeker may start to comply with their participation obligations during the non-payment period; that a job seeker may end up in serious financial hardship if the non-payment period was applied; or that the job seeker may not have had the capacity to comply with a serious failure requirement. What the government is seeking to do with this bill is to make a couple changes under the guise of strengthening this framework. The bill provides that job seekers who incur an eight-week no-payment penalty for refusing suitable work will no longer have the penalty waived.


My Tasmanian colleague, the member for Franklin and shadow minister for employment service, Julie Collins, has been briefed by the Department of Human Services on provisions of this bill and has come to the inescapable conclusion that it is unnecessarily harsh. In her second reading speech, Senator Collins emphasised the point that these changes would discourage re-engagement. Discouraging re-engagement seems to be completely at odds with the aims of getting jobs seekers into work. If the participation obligations are aimed at encouraging job seekers to actively look for work, then why not offer some incentive to reengage? Instead, this bill consigns those job seekers to the too-hard basket.


These changes mean that job seekers who refuse suitable work will serve the eight-week non-payment penalty regardless, unless they have a reasonable excuse. So there is no waiver—no consideration for whether the job seeker is re-engaging with their participation obligations, no consideration of their capacity to comply with the requirement, and no consideration of whether they would experience financial hardship if the penalty is applied. 


The other changes in this bill provide that job seekers who persistently fail to comply with participation obligations will only be able to have the penalty waived once during each period of continuous receipt of the participation payment. There were questions asked in Senate estimates to determine exactly what the effect of this provision would mean. The department revealed that even when Newstart recipients were undergoing a six-month period of no income, as is proposed in the government's cruel budget changes for job seekers under the age of 30, they will be regarded as still being a Newstart recipient, but one who is in receipt of a nil payment. So not only could they be penalised while not receiving any income, but the one waiver restriction could continue to apply for years, depending on how long the job seeker remains unemployed. If they incur the eight-week penalty during their six months of not receiving any income, then the penalty simply extends the period of non-payment. 


The changes to social security for young people under the age of 30 are one of the cruellest measures contained in the budget, but if you combine the six-month non-payment period with the provisions of this bill we could potentially see some long-term job seekers going without a payment for up to 11 months. That gives them only one month before they head into the next six-month period of non-payment. In other words, they would have one month of income support during an 18-month period. So I ask those opposite: is that not just the absolute height of cruelty? These harsh changes will have the greatest impact on some of the most vulnerable job seekers in Australia. 


Senator Seselja was quite happily sprouting statistics when it was his turn to speak. Let me give a few statistics. Last year Centrelink applied 5,263 eight-week non-payment penalties to job seekers with Centrelink vulnerability indicators on their files—that is right; they had vulnerability indicators on their files. This included 1,483 with psychiatric problems or mental illness, 1,149 with homelessness flags on their files, 131 just released from prison, 107 who had experienced a recent traumatic relationship breakdown, and 102 job seekers with a cognitive or neurological impairment.


I heard Senator Abetz recently, in a debate on a disallowance motion, refer to all the reasonable-excuse provisions that apply, such as suffering a mental illness, having family responsibilities and so on. But let me just point out that vulnerability indicators were on the files of those people to whom the penalty was applied. In other words, their mental illness, homelessness, relationship breakdown et cetera was not considered a factor in the serious failure for which they received their penalty. Let me just point that out for those opposite: their vulnerability indicator issues, such as mental illness, homelessness, relationship breakdown et cetera, were not considered factors in the serious failures for which they received their penalties.


We can see from these figures that, despite the reasonable excuse provisions, the penalties were still disproportionately applied to the most vulnerable job seekers. No matter what those on the other side of the chamber say, or try to spin, that is how it was. As at 31 March this year, there were just over 118,000 job seekers with vulnerability indicators on their files. If this bill passes the parliament these job seekers will be at greater risk than others of having their payment suspended. 


Indigenous job seekers have traditionally also been over-represented among those penalised. Over the 2012-13 period, there were 6,895 eight-week penalties applied to Indigenous job seekers, compared with 29,563 for non-Indigenous job seekers. So Indigenous job seekers represented almost one-fifth of those receiving an eight-week penalty. The restrictions of waivers would disproportionately impact some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Are these the people—people with mental illness, people experiencing homelessness—that Australia should reach out a hand and support? Are these the people that Joe Hockey described— (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (18:51):  I would like to use this evening's adjournment debate to reflect positively on two fantastic young Western Australians who are living and working out in regional Western Australia. 


The first is Mr Tim Lefroy, who this year, 2014, was the winner of the West Australian of the Year Award. This accolade is a powerful demonstration and endorsement of Tim's excellent hard work and efforts, and recognises his contribution to the community through his varied roles—most particularly, through his active sporting roles as a coach and West Australian Football League umpire and athlete. 


It was interesting to read about Tim's story and his career goal to become a leader in the development of public policy, with a special interest in policies affecting agriculture and education in Western Australia. When Tim responded to my letter of congratulations he said, 'Senator, I have enjoyed my involvement in the community immensely over the past few years, and it has made me appreciate how lucky we are in Western Australia to have such strong and diverse communities.' I certainly agree with those sentiments.


In addition to that, he said to me: 'Growing up on a farm in Moora has given me a desire to fulfil a career developing agricultural economic policy. I believe sustained economic growth will see an elevation of agriculture to a position of strategic importance over the next decade to address the increasing challenges of providing a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food to the world. I see a career developing agricultural policy as an opportunity to address these global food security and social concerns.' I cannot help but think that Mr Timothy Lefroy is a name that we might start to hear more of across Western Australia and, in the future, I would not be surprised if we heard more in this place about his contribution to community and agricultural life.


I would also like to congratulate and recognise Tanya Dupagne, who is the Shire of Kulin's Camp Kulin manager. This year Tanya was awarded the 2014 Constable Care Child Safety Award. I am pleased to advise that Tanya also won both the local government and employee award categories. As a sign of Tanya's graciousness, when she won the award she said, 'I am so incredibly honoured to receive this award, but I am really accepting it on behalf of all of our team, which includes 64 volunteers, shire staff and the community.' Camp Kulin's innovative program—which I am very familiar with, having met Tanya a few years ago—has supported over 500 kids from across rural and regional Western Australia, and some young people from the cities. The camp's internationally recognised program, which was initiated by Tanya Dupagne, empowers and protects WA's most vulnerable by teaching trust, respect and confidence, with the ultimate goal of breaking the generational domestic violence cycle. It also runs programs and camps which are open to any child seeking to develop essential life skills and leadership skills. I congratulate Tanya Dupagne on the work she does.


She wrote to me just recently and shared this with me. She said: 'It has been a big couple of months, Senator, for us, winning three categories of the Constable Care Child Safety Awards, including the overall award, and being shortlisted for the Premier's Awards for Excellence in Public Sector Management. A number of our camp counsellors have also won scholarships and awards and have represented Camp Kulin at state and national conferences. We are looking forward to the coming months with the further development of our school programs, corporate programs and, of course, our summer camp programs. We are also currently fundraising to build a Camp Kulin low ropes course, which will further enhance the skills learnt by our campers while at camp. Thank you again for your support of the Camp Kulin program and, if you are ever near Kulin'—which I regularly am—'we would love to have you come and visit us.'


I think these two examples are very powerful demonstrations of the great work young people are doing and the great contributions they are making not only in our country but particularly in regional communities across Western Australia. I want to use my brief opportunity tonight to recognise the fantastic contribution of both Mr Timothy Lefroy and Ms Tanya Dupagne.
