Today I present the 29th report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament, together with 24 petitions and seven ministerial responses to petitions previously presented.


Among the petitions I present today are three paper petitions of varying topics. One of these petitions requests that the House take action in relation to a building that has previously housed a military museum. With over 17,000 signatures, it is clear that paper petitions still have an important role in capturing local sentiment on community based issues.


In the bundle today are also three e-petitions with over 1,400, 2,500 and 7,700 signatures respectively. The e-petitions platform has ensured that the traditional process of petitioning remains relevant to all Australians, many of whom conduct a large part of their lives online, so it's encouraging for the committee to witness the continuing popularity of both paper and electronic petitions throughout the 45th Parliament. The committee seeks to further strengthen the public engagement with petitioning as it inquires into the future of petitioning in the House.


I look forward to updating the House further on the work of the Petitions Committee.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (10:02):  I move:


That this House notes that:


(1) the R U OK? Conversation Convoy began on 30 July 2018 to raise awareness that a conversation could change a life, and the Convoy will:


(a) travel across 14,000 kilometres and 25 communities to show Australians that every day is the day to ask: Are you Ok?; and


(b) conclude in Sydney on 13 September 2018 which is also R U OK? Day, an important day which was first established in 2009 to raise awareness around suicide prevention and mental ill health;


(2) the statistics around suicide and mental ill health are heartbreaking and confronting:


(a) in 2016, 2,866 Australians lost their lives to suicide;


(b) research reveals that around 65,000 Australians attempt suicide every year and hundreds of thousands of people are impacted by each suicide death; and


(c) one in five Australians experience mental ill health in any year;


(3) all levels of government and the community are urged to work together to reduce the impact of suicide and mental ill health in our society; and


(4) work must continue towards reducing stigma and raising community awareness around suicide prevention and mental ill health.


Many people in this place would be familiar with R U OK? Day. This year's R U OK? Day marks 10 years from when Gavin Larkin first came up with the concept of 'R U OK?', and the Conversation Convoy has been happening for the last few years. They take cars around the country and they go to regional and remote parts of the country as well as the cities and invite people to start the conversation: 'Are you okay?' . Of course, it's one thing to start the conversation 'Are you okay?', but it is, of course, very important to listen. The four simple steps that R U OK Day are seeking are that you ask the question, you listen, you then encourage action if the person is not okay and you check in to make a difference to someone who may not be okay or who you think is behaving differently to their usual behaviour.


This year's convoy travelled over 14,000 kilometres and visited 25 communities, beginning in Geelong and finishing off in Sydney just last week. It visited some of the more remote communities in Australia, as I have mentioned. Indeed, I've been pleased to see it in my home state, although not this year. It was there this year, but I was unable to attend. The previous year, it came to Hobart.


Slowly but surely, initiatives like 'R U OK?' are actually helping to reduce the stigma around mental ill health. They are encouraging people to put up their hand to say, 'I'm not okay,' or, 'I'm struggling, or, 'I need some help.' What's important is that, when we do that, help is available. I know from talking to government members that many people on their side understand that some of this help is not always available and we need to do better, working with our state and local government colleagues and the not-for-profit sector to ensure that we can do that. 


Labor has a very proud history when it comes to supporting people with mental ill health. We increased the budget very substantially when we were in government, with $200 million over five years for 30 new headspace centres. I know the current government has also made increases to headspace since coming into office. There is absolute bipartisanship when it comes to dealing with mental ill health and access for people with mental ill health, but it's not an easy task. 


Far too many Australians still lose their lives to suicide—indeed, over 2,800 in 2016. That's almost eight a day. We need to do better. It's almost double the national road toll. That's without the attempts of suicide, the number of which is also extraordinarily high. We can and we should do better, and I know that everybody in this place wants to do better. We continue to be inspired by individuals like Gavin Larkin, who created R U OK?, and the current community people but also the corporate sponsors of R U OK? The campaign relies primarily on corporate donations and philanthropy to run the conversation convoy to have these important conversations. I know there are many businesses and businesspeople around Australia today supporting those community not-for-profit organisations that are making a big difference when it comes to mental ill health. We believe that all levels of government should focus on this. It's the role of not just the federal government but the state and local governments and the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. 


We have also created recently in this place the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention. It's now in its second year. Again, there is wonderful bipartisanship, with the member for Berowra, Julian Leeser, and Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, on our side, cohosting that parliamentary friends group. It is a really important group that is taking advice and talking to people in the community about what we as members of this place can do further to reduce that terrible suicide number each and every year, because there is so much to be done. 


Offering bipartisanship, of course, does not mean that we do not from time to time criticise some of the things we think the government does or doesn't do. One of those was in relation to the suicide prevention trial sites. At the time of the last election, Labor had a commitment to 12 trial sites. We called on the government to extend their commitment from eight to 12 trial sites, and we were really pleased that they did. It did take a little while, but I welcomed the Minister for Health extending those trial sites, because this is really important. In mental ill health, the data and the evidence about what works are missing. We need those suicide prevention trial sites and that data to make sure that what we are spending at both the Commonwealth and the state level with governments—hundreds of billions of dollars—is the very best spend to save as many Australians as we possibly can, and we need to continue to do that together.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (10:08):  I would like to thank the member for Franklin for raising this vitally important conversation, which can save lives. I speak today about an issue that faces one in every three Australians—an organisation that travels across 14,000 kilometres reaching 25 communities to reiterate that same all-important question: 'Are you okay?' The 13th of September last week was R U OK? Day—the day we all stop to check in on our friends, family and colleagues to make sure they aren't weighed under by the burden of mental health issues. The R U OK? campaign is one of the primary organisations aiding the mental health issue in Australia. This health issue is serious, has drastic consequences for our communities and poses a great risk to the wellbeing of our people. The statistics are heartbreaking and deeply disturbing, such as the 65,000 attempted suicides in the year 2016 and, sadly, the 2,866 Australians who took their own lives in the last year. 


This year we took the conversation on the road, with the R U OK? Conversation Convoy, which travelled across Australia, making sure everyone was aware of the conversation we need to have. This year's theme was 'Make every day R U OK? Day', recognising that we need to be checking in on our friends every day of the year, not just on 13 September. We must all spread the message that it is perfectly fine to be struggling with the toils of life and that your family, friends and health services are there to take care of you. Considering that one in five Australians experience some form of mental health every year, it is of the utmost importance that, as a nation, we are there to support those who are not coping—that we are there to help our mates and family over the line and that we are there to talk to our fellow Australians who may not be doing so well. It is for these reasons that I support R U OK? and remind all of us that it's our duty to decrease the stigma around mental health and raise community awareness around preventing suicide. This can be as simple as pulling your friend aside and asking that easy and important question. I call on the rest of government at all levels to put their best foot forward and prevent the tragedy of suicide. Tell all the people we know that we are there for them through the best and the worst.


Suicide affects Australians every day of the year. In the last fortnight, members of my office have been touched by the loss of a great friend and great talent, Luke Liang. Luke was one of the up-and-coming stars of the music industry, a session musician who played on stages around the world with the likes of Alex the Astronaut, Jarryd James, Montaigne and many more. But more important than his great talent was his great humility and kindness. I'm told he was one of the most genuine, decent people anyone could ever hope to meet. But what matters for this debate today is that Luke seemed fine. He was always smiling and seemed carefree. The world was at his feet and he was capable of anything. We can never forget that mental health issues don't necessarily look like mental health issues, and that is why we must ask: 'Are you okay?'


The R U OK? organisation is leading the charge to reduce stigma and invite the mentally unwell to ask for support through those closest to them, and they deserve our highest respect. I thank the organisation dearly for the lives they have saved and the awareness they have spread. I hope that one day we will no longer need this day to remind us to check in on our friends; it will simply be a part of our conversation.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (10:12):  Last Thursday, 13 September, was R U OK? Day. Now in its 10th year, R U OK? Day aims to nurture social responsibility and belonging by encouraging people to meaningfully connect with others by simply asking: 'Are you okay?' The four simple steps—ask, listen, encourage action and check in—can make a difference to someone who may be struggling. It's such a simple message—a simple gesture that costs us nothing, yet, when we ask someone if they are okay, the difference it can make to a person who's feeling overwhelmed can be life changing. Well done, therefore, to the R U OK? Conversation Convoy that began its journey of raising awareness on 30 July, traversing 14,000 kilometres and 25 communities before reaching Sydney on 13 September.


In my electorate, I am proud to have so many people and organisations who make it their business to promote R U OK? Day by holding a number of events on the day, thus ensuring that, as a community, we are working together to promote mental health and wellbeing and to reduce the stigma of suicide and mental health. This year, throughout all of last week, Northern Health, a health service provider with many locations in my electorate, including Broadmeadows Hospital and Craigieburn pharmacy, held a week of conversations on mental wellness as part of their psychological wellbeing strategy. Northern Health does a great job of recognising and representing the objectives of R U OK? Day. It has adopted a psychological wellbeing strategy as an initiative to protect the mental health of its staff, promote wellbeing and intervene to address mental health concerns. Its many events, including talks from guest speakers, fundraising events, yoga sessions and pastoral care sessions, held all across the Northern Health centres, involved a guest speaker last Monday who discussed the impact of suicide on families and communities, talking from personal experience and looking at how discussion can lead to empowerment of others. Guest speakers from beyondblue and Treat health care were also on hand to begin conversations about mental health among families, friends and work colleagues. The local TAFE, Kangan Institute, holds R U OK? Day events every year for staff and students on their campuses. 


I want to give a big shout-out this morning to my young constituent Puneet Gulati, who is the founder and managing director of One World Family Inc. Puneet has a distinguished list of commendations, ranging from Hume Young Citizen of the Year 2015, White Ribbon Ambassador, Bully Zero Australia Foundation Ambassador, AFL Multicultural Community Ambassador 2015-16 and regional adviser for North West Metropolitan Melbourne on the Victorian Multicultural Commission. These are all well-deserved recognition of the tremendous level of volunteer work he does in promoting the need to be aware and to support people in our community who live in adversity.


Puneet came to Australia from his native India in 2007 and initially lived alone, like thousands of other migrants, as he would say. But one thing he learnt in that time is: 'Living alone and feeling alone are two different scenarios.' Adapting to life in a new country was challenging, but a serious car accident which left him very badly injured compounded the depression he had already been suffering from. It was the support of his family and friends that helped him turn his life around. He has wanted to give back to community by reciprocating the support he has received. Puneet said:


I wanted to do something that empowers people, the world has plenty of discouragers but we need more Encouragers for a peaceful and meaningful life.


Puneet Gulati epitomises what R U OK? is all about, and he profoundly believes, 'Our little gestures can change, really change, the way someone is feeling'.


I had the pleasure of seeing a video clip Puneet recently produced. Its message is simple: We should never give up on our friends. It's okay to fail at times. We can be a survivor throughout it if we choose to live life on the positive side. Puneet, who is now studying acting at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne, uses his many artistic talents to help convey important messages and, as he says, to:


… name and shame bullying and harassment, educate each other by talking about mental health ... we may sometimes feel that we can never do enough but what matters is that we don't stop.


It's very important that we take comfort from people like Puneet Gulati and others, who give their time to help other people, to ask if people are okay and then to follow through and make sure they actually are okay.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:17):  'G'day mate, how are you going?' needs to be more than just a greeting. We need to stop, listen to the response and check on our friends. It saddens me deeply to rise to speak on this motion on a subject that has touched far too many in our great Australian family. Suicide is a terrible tragedy not just for those who are the victims but also for those who are left behind. While I cannot begin to appreciate the desperation, abandonment or isolation a person must feel prior to ending their life, I do feel so very distressed by the fact this can occur, and continues to occur, in today's communities. It troubles me greatly that, in a country as full of opportunity as ours, some people feel so isolated that they believe suicide is the only available path to peace. In more recent years, we've even heard of self-harm and suicidal ideations from children and teenagers. For me—and I'm sure everyone here agrees—this offers a grim reality of what some younger Australians accept as their fate.


Every year, more than 65,000 Australians attempt suicide. More than 2,500 Australians die by suicide, and more young Australians die by suicide than through road deaths. This is simply not good enough. Not one person in this place could say that they have not had experience with mental illness or suicide, no matter how close or far from them. The Ryan electorate is home to Gallipoli Barracks and has a large veteran population. Unfortunately, suicide is far too prevalent within our returned services community. While the rate of suicide in the ADF is no greater than the rate in the general populace, it troubles me that people with easy access to quality care and counselling still choose to end their lives rather than to seek help.


There are, however, support groups in the Defence community similar to R U OK? which also help to ease the burdens many are living through. For example, Wounded Heroes, an organisation of which I'm proud to be a patron, funds support services for deployed personnel, the wounded and their families. Services like this could potentially be the difference between current personnel or veterans choosing to live a full contributing life or leave their loved ones behind. We must do more to end the stigma surrounding not only suicide but, more importantly, seeking help for what are in most cases treatable illnesses. Volunteer groups like Meals on Wheels are more than just a meal. In keeping with the true spirit and premise of R U OK?, Meals on Wheels is an effective welfare check on individuals who may not otherwise have much contact with others. The Red Cross Telecross service provides a daily telephone call to check on people's wellbeing. This provides peace of mind if they are at risk of an accident or illness that may go unnoticed. One of the most recognisable services is Lifeline's Crisis Support and Suicide Prevention service. If someone is listening to me speak at the moment and needs support, please contact 131114.


On the subject of today's motion, R U OK?, there is nothing shameful about asking for help. A plea for help might be what saves a life and could be the difference between a family losing a parent or sibling and seeing that the individual receives the necessary assistance to treat them through their mental torment. Suicide and mental illness are concerns that have an impact upon all Australians. As a country we must take it upon ourselves to address the leading cause of death among men aged under 44 and women aged under 34. As a nation we have a suicide problem. Talking about it here and acknowledging the issue is a good start, but we must do more. I acknowledge and offer my heartfelt gratitude to organisations like R U OK? which inspire and empower people to connect with others around them and support those struggling through life's ups and downs. R U OK? is up-front in its acknowledgement that suicide prevention is not a simple, prescribed process. In fact the very question 'Are you okay?' could well be the connection a person craves long before they consider suicide. We may sit on opposite sides of the House, but mental illness and suicide do not have political boundaries. I commend the mover of the motion to the House and I thank the member for Franklin for drawing attention to the issue of suicide prevention and raising awareness of the work of R U OK? 'G'day mate; how are you going?' could save future lives.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (10:22):  I chose to speak on this motion on Wednesday last week. Over a five-year period from 2012 to 2016 the average number of suicide deaths per year was 2,795. 2016 preliminary data showed a total of 2,866 deaths by suicide. That is approximately seven per day, and 178 people attempt per day. Since last Wednesday 890 people have thought they had no other choice available to them but to attempt suicide and 35 have lost their lives and are lost to us, their families and their communities—people who deserve to be more than a statistic. The ripples through our community run from each completed suicide. Many ask the question 'Why?' In addition to that we often feel a certain sense of helplessness and of what might have been. 'What if' scenarios abound. Sometimes the sense of loss and of responsibility in turn create their own problems as the ripples of loss create further effects disturbing lives in unforeseen ways.


I remember now how that felt to me15 years ago. A young, vibrant and hardworking employee went home to an empty house. For whatever the final reason she could not bear her life and elected to take steps which resulted in her death. I know it's hard for her family to accept she may have intended suicide. I made successive calls to her workmates that awful day, the emotion of each call like a stab through the heart—shock, disbelief and regret. Some staff members were in turn deeply affected, showing in very real terms what the ripples of disturbance from suicide mean in practice. Counselling and support services help but don't replace the loss or salve the pain, even when that pain is a shared experience. In preparing this speech the memories came flooding back, at times so vivid that I cannot contemplate what it's like for a person to lose their daughter, a partner or a loved one.


On Friday I received a message which again emphasised the immediacy and currency of this issue, another friend, a colleague, a highly respected leader and mentor to many, was lost. The media reported, 'died suddenly', that awful code. Again, there was shock, disbelief and even anger, with colleagues again lamenting a departed, respected friend.


R U OK? is intended to empower us to ask that difficult question, but the alternative to asking that difficult question is, indeed, much worse: the inevitable disbelief and the 'why' when someone attempts and completes the act of suicide. Better to ask the difficult question, to ask whether a friend or a colleague is okay, than to regret not asking the question. Better to activate your better instincts and judgement as to a person's outward appearance. If things appear not quite right, ask the question, 'Are you okay?' The question may prompt a response which in turn demands further action, but if R U OK? is to be effective to save lives and prompt a friend or colleague to say no then each of us bear the responsibility to act.


What does acting in response to your question look like? Suggestions published in connection with R U OK? Day include: ask what is going on in their lives, listen actively and ask, 'How can I help or is there something I can do for you right now?' Sometimes it's about keeping them company, providing practical support or linking them with health professionals. Direct questions, in particular about self-harm, can be asked. It's okay to ask whether somebody has considered killing themselves. In asking those questions it is better to be nonjudgemental rather than clothing questions around, 'Don't do anything silly.'


Finally, consider doing a course on mental health first aid. Like with traditional first-aid techniques, the training teaches people how to offer additional support until appropriate professional help is received or until a crisis is resolved. It's possible to be the person who is able to act coolly in a crisis. It is possible for that person to ask the question, 'Are you okay?'

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (10:27):  Around eight Australians take their own lives each and every single day. For every one that does take their own life around 30 people attempt it. That's about 240 Australians every day. Those figures are really mind blowing when you think about it. In 2016 there were 2,866 recorded deaths by suicide. Suicide was the 15th leading cause of death in 2016.


The impact of poor mental health goes much, much broader for our communities. Nearly half of all Australians will experience mental illness in their lifetime and at least one in five experience some form of mental illness in any given year.


R U OK? Day is a national day of action dedicated to inspiring all people to ask each other, 'Are you okay?', and to encourage conversations with those around us who are struggling and need support. R U OK? Day is about saying to everybody: 'It's fine to say that you need some help. It's fine to talk about the challenges that you might be experiencing.' A conversation with someone who is struggling can sometimes be all that is needed to make a difference. R U OK? Day encourages a four-step conversation—ask, listen, encourage action and check in. R U OK? Day has been and continues to be a phenomenal success. Seventy-eight per cent of Australians are now aware of the R U OK? message, with 63 per cent believing that the campaign has made people more willing to ask friends about what's troubling them.


In a project that's close to my own heart, R U OK? Day has worked closely with MATES in Construction to raise awareness for mental health within the construction, mining and energy industries. More than 35,000 workers on 736 worksites took part in their Fly the Flag Day campaign to raise awareness of the 190 construction workers who die by suicide every year. We lose six times more workers to suicide than workplace accidents, and MATES in Construction are doing a fantastic job of trying to turn that statistic around.


The government's total expenditure for mental health is estimated at $4.3 billion in 2017-18, which is the highest on record. The Australian government has provided funding specifically for R U OK? Day since its inception in 2009. This September, the Minister for Health announced additional funding for R U OK? Day, and it will receive up to $749,000 on top of the $937,000 it's currently receiving. More broadly, the government funds the National Suicide Prevention Leadership and Support Program, which is providing $43.9 million from April 2017 to June 2019. Suicide prevention is one of the three projects funded by the federal government in my own electorate of Fisher, with $5 million provided to the Thompson Institute. We're also providing $48 million for the National Suicide Prevention Trial, which is running in 12 priority sites across Australia. This will improve our understanding of what strategies are most effective in preventing suicide at a local level and for at-risk populations.


Suicide is, unfortunately, something that touches many, many families and many workplaces. I have, unfortunately, personal experience of this at a personal level and at a work level. If anybody is listening that is struggling right now, I really encourage you to put your hand up and ask for help, and hopefully you'll have someone that is trying to touch base with you. We blokes tend to be the worst at this: 'She'll be right. We'll get through it'. Put your hand up and say that you're struggling, and hopefully someone will be there to help you.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (13:30):  I rise today to speak on the aged-care crisis, which has developed under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, and specifically to speak on this coalition government's cuts to aged care. The reality is that the Liberal Party's latest Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is to blame for the shocking state of aged care in this country. He, after all, has been the architect of the savage cuts which have rocked this crucial sector.


The people will not forget that as Treasurer Scott Morrison was responsible for ripping $1.2 billion from the care of older Australians in his very first budget. His track record speaks for itself. The sight of him on television announcing a royal commission just made me feel they were complete crocodile tears from Mr Morrison.


It comes as no surprise to me that after five years in which the Prime Minister, and his out of touch Liberal government, have cut almost $2 billion out of our aged-care system, that the system is definitely in crisis, which is what we've been saying. We've been saying it all along. With such savage cuts the government should have been able to predict a reduction in quality. You can't fix aged care by cutting from it, yet the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, signed off on a $1.2 billion cut to aged care in the 2016 budget. He should do the right thing now, fund it properly and own up to his own mistakes. This is a tragedy unfolding and we must do better.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:10):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities, I present the committee's report on its inquiry into the development of cities, Building up and moving out, together with the minutes of proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ALEXANDER:
  by leave—Today I present the report of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities' inquiry into the Australian government's role in the development of cities, titled Building up and moving out.


Australia is undergoing rapid change. Population growth, urbanisation, the ageing of the population and the transformation of the economy towards service and knowledge based industries are causing profound changes in the urban and regional landscape. The outcome of these changes will depend on how they are managed. In recent decades, there has been no plan for how to accommodate the growth in our cities and population. Managing these challenges requires a national vision—a national plan of settlement.


The national plan of settlement must set out a vision for our cities and regions for the next 50 years and beyond. It must take account of the fact that Australia's cities and regions are not sustainable in their current form and will become less sustainable as the population grows and ages. Achieving the required economic, social and environmental outcomes for the sustainability of our cities and regions will require a high level of integrated planning. This is not achievable without the coherent vision which comes from master planning both land use and facilitating infrastructure.


The successful development of both cities and regions is intrinsically linked. Regional development needs to be seen as part of a broader pattern of national development, with cities, towns and regions being developed as part of an integrated whole. Greater connectivity is an essential element of this joint development. Well-connected cities and regions means that opportunities can be distributed across a wider population. High-speed rail can bring distant communities within close proximity of each other. This in turn would enable a more dispersed pattern of settlement and the creation of polycentric cities, without the attendant vices of urban sprawl.


Value capture should be part of the conception of any infrastructure project to equitably capitalise on taxpayers' funds invested. It should be incorporated organically into its planning and development. Suitable value capture mechanisms should be identified and applied from the outset. Ideally, this should involve coordination between different levels of government and project developers to ensure a maximum return on investment. The potential for value capture to contribute to the development of infrastructure was discussed at length in the committee's previous report, Harnessing value, delivering infrastructure. The committee considers that the recommendations in that report are more relevant than ever and should be adopted by the Australian government.


Parliamentary inquiries are an underappreciated tool that gathers on-the-ground evidence for the benefit of ministers and departments. Months of work have gone into this document both from the deeply committed secretariat and from the scores of Australian organisations who felt the need to give their independent and critical insights in this vitally important policy area. This is a good, substantive report that contains a strong evidence based plan for how to solve the many problems of our settlement. Previous reports by this committee have received delayed and token responses from the department; I strongly recommend this one is given better consideration.


In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this inquiry. The governing of Australia is at its best when representatives from both sides can come together to determine the facts and deduce the best course of action in consideration of only one thing—the wellbeing of the Australian people now and in the future. I am, therefore, indebted to my deputy chair, the Hon. Sharon Bird MP, and equally grateful to each member of the committee.


We have, I believe, produced a bipartisan vision for the future settlement of Australia.


On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House. I move:

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (15:15):  I take great pleasure in commending this report to members of the parliament; to the government; as the esteemed chair of the committee said, to the departments that have contributed to it but also, we would hope, will work with the government to respond to the report; and, in particular, to all of those various organisations and individuals across the country who, through the period of time, took the time and effort to put submissions in and raise their issues. I won't canvass again some of the key issues that the chair of the committee, the member for Bennelong, has just addressed, other than to say I think the report brings together a very in-depth, well-considered proposition for the government to look at ways in which, at a federal level, we can go beyond the national planning of infrastructure—which is something that we believe is critically important—and take into consideration a national plan of settlement as well so that, across our great country, we can actually get better, more effective and more committed to looking at population growth and its disparity across the nation. Some places—including, clearly, our two major capital cities Sydney and Melbourne—are struggling under the pressure of that, while other places have potential that's being unrealised. Bringing those two things together—population settlement, whether it's internal movement or new arrivals, and infrastructure planning—in a way that fosters the opportunities across the nation is a really solid proposition, and there are a number of recommendations in this report that go to that issue.


I also want to, for the parliament's interest, draw people's attention to the fact that there are quite a lot of recommendations in this report around sustainability and livability as well. We know that places are under a lot of pressure. We heard great evidence of really innovative actions in terms of water management, waste management, smart cities and the capacity for technology to revolutionise the way that people are living in cities, but we also heard about some of the challenges. Just a simple example is that, with more people using online purchasing, we heard about the challenges that creates for small courier based companies trying to move around our cities, because people expect things to be delivered to their front door, but also the broader freight challenge and the impact that's having on our cities.


I think the power of the report is the fact that it looked across capital cities and, obviously, the challenges that they are facing, it looked across our regional areas and it also looked at our regional cities. That's a space where I think—maybe I'm biased coming from Wollongong with my own perspective—there is capacity for regional cities if they're properly supported through hard infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure and communications infrastructure, but also what we might call the soft infrastructure—the placement of universities and TAFEs in those places, the development of community facilities and the assurance that health facilities are available. Those things allow the potential of those regions to be realised so that, beyond just governments looking at decentralising jobs, they're actually set up to really get the private sector interested and investing into those regional capitals.


We heard some great evidence of where that's happening. One example is the connections into the Melbourne centre that Bendigo and Ballarat now have and how they're developing expertise in particular areas of the economy that complement well the capital city. We have a network of cities, and the regional cities servicing their regional hinterlands are just as important to be considered. I think that's a great strength of this report. There are 37 recommendations. There is something for everybody in there if you're interested in our cities and support for our regions.


I thank all my colleagues on the committee. I particularly thank the chair, the member for Bennelong, who brings to this role what I would call the traditional view of the parliamentarian, which is to interrogate the evidence and let it stand on its own two feet. To reach an evidence based bipartisan outcome is a great commendation of his leadership. I also thank all the members of the committee, who were a great pleasure to work with. It was a really good group of people. I also acknowledge Lyn Ducker, Bill Pender and Samantha Leahy from the committee, who did an enormous amount of work, because it was a big report—we could be a bit troublesome, but they persevered with cheerful positivity through our more demanding times—and Cathy Rouland and Kelly Burt from the secretariat. We appreciate their very professional support, as we always get from our committee secretariat. If you're a bit light on reading, I think this report will take you a good month, so I encourage people to get a copy and have a look at it.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:10):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities, I present the committee's report on its inquiry into the development of cities, Building up and moving out, together with the minutes of proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ALEXANDER:
  by leave—Today I present the report of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities' inquiry into the Australian government's role in the development of cities, titled Building up and moving out.


Australia is undergoing rapid change. Population growth, urbanisation, the ageing of the population and the transformation of the economy towards service and knowledge based industries are causing profound changes in the urban and regional landscape. The outcome of these changes will depend on how they are managed. In recent decades, there has been no plan for how to accommodate the growth in our cities and population. Managing these challenges requires a national vision—a national plan of settlement.


The national plan of settlement must set out a vision for our cities and regions for the next 50 years and beyond. It must take account of the fact that Australia's cities and regions are not sustainable in their current form and will become less sustainable as the population grows and ages. Achieving the required economic, social and environmental outcomes for the sustainability of our cities and regions will require a high level of integrated planning. This is not achievable without the coherent vision which comes from master planning both land use and facilitating infrastructure.


The successful development of both cities and regions is intrinsically linked. Regional development needs to be seen as part of a broader pattern of national development, with cities, towns and regions being developed as part of an integrated whole. Greater connectivity is an essential element of this joint development. Well-connected cities and regions means that opportunities can be distributed across a wider population. High-speed rail can bring distant communities within close proximity of each other. This in turn would enable a more dispersed pattern of settlement and the creation of polycentric cities, without the attendant vices of urban sprawl.


Value capture should be part of the conception of any infrastructure project to equitably capitalise on taxpayers' funds invested. It should be incorporated organically into its planning and development. Suitable value capture mechanisms should be identified and applied from the outset. Ideally, this should involve coordination between different levels of government and project developers to ensure a maximum return on investment. The potential for value capture to contribute to the development of infrastructure was discussed at length in the committee's previous report, Harnessing value, delivering infrastructure. The committee considers that the recommendations in that report are more relevant than ever and should be adopted by the Australian government.


Parliamentary inquiries are an underappreciated tool that gathers on-the-ground evidence for the benefit of ministers and departments. Months of work have gone into this document both from the deeply committed secretariat and from the scores of Australian organisations who felt the need to give their independent and critical insights in this vitally important policy area. This is a good, substantive report that contains a strong evidence based plan for how to solve the many problems of our settlement. Previous reports by this committee have received delayed and token responses from the department; I strongly recommend this one is given better consideration.


In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this inquiry. The governing of Australia is at its best when representatives from both sides can come together to determine the facts and deduce the best course of action in consideration of only one thing—the wellbeing of the Australian people now and in the future.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (15:22):  The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement was touted as a wonderful thing in this place and in both the Financial Review and The Australian. The whole agreement was about the beef, sugar and dairy trades with America. I happen to be the representative of the electorate in Australia with arguably the biggest cattle numbers, the second-biggest sugar-producing area and certainly the most concentrated dairy area, so I watched the free trade agreement with great interest. I was intrigued and looked on with curiosity because in all of my adult life, nearly 50 years both as a member of parliament representing the heartland of the cattle industry and having had cattle on a quarter-of-a-million acres up in the Gulf Country for a while, I've never heard a single person complain to me about our access to the American market. In fact in many years we've had difficulty getting enough beef to fulfil our quota, and the Americans have been very fair as far as free trade goes. Their industry gets subsidised, but as far as access goes I've never had any complaints.


The second thing I will say is that Tony Abbott stood up in this place when the China-Australia Free-Trade Agreement was announced and led a spontaneous standing ovation for the minister who later on gave the green light to the sale of the Port of Darwin to the Chinese and then went on to earn nearly $900,000, according to the newspapers, in income from the Chinese company to which he had given the green light. So, the Americans' only deepwater port in the South Pacific was handed over to what may be—and we hope is never—their potential enemy, the Chinese. I'm sure they were very pleased about that. And President Obama expressed that he was not happy about that.


But when Tony Abbott stood that applause, I said—and I don't know whether it went into Hansard—'Tony, you just signed your own death warrant.' The people in Australia have had it up to here with this. They know it's lies. They know it's rubbish. And to do that—well, a few months later he was gone. I'm not saying it was on account of that, and I say it with regret, because I like Tony personally, and I respected him as Prime Minister. 



In question time last week I said to the Treasurer, 'After three years of deregulation and privatisation, electricity prices have risen from $670 a year for 11 straight years.' Once we deregulated and privatised, it went straight through the roof, up to $2,400. Well, what a magnificent success story! Privatisation and deregulation—a 300 per cent increase. I said, 'Similarly, housing has skyrocketed, from $5,600 a year to $15,000 a year', and that is a result of a free trade approach to visa entrants coming into this country—namely, section 457 workers—amongst other issues. Free market policy in food resulted in only two people buying and selling food in Australia, when this rubbish started. Those two had 50.5 per cent— (Time expired)

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Defence Industry) (15:26):  In summation on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill 2018, I thought I'd just touch upon some of the comments that have been made, and I thank the member for Kennedy for his contribution and his almost-kind words about me—certainly kinder words about my parents. As someone who did grow up in Far North Queensland and with a strong affection for regional Australia, I appreciate his comments.


I thought I would just address some of the comments with respect to the tobacco industry in my birth town of Mareeba and the suggestion of the member for Kennedy that the passing of the tobacco industry was a consequence of deregulation. Well, that may have been a factor, but there can be no doubt that the single-biggest driver of the wholesale change away from tobacco was actually the introduction of laws to stop people smoking. The way in which we have clamped down significantly on tobacco abuse has seen wholesale transformation of the industry in that part of the world—not a function of deregulation but, rather, a function of changing consumer patterns and habits and the fact that the percentage of the population that now smokes has declined to if not below 10 per cent then very, very close to that. That has been the single-biggest driver.


But here's the good news. When I go back to Mareeba, as I do relatively frequently, I see a community now that has transformed into a whole range of new crops. I see lychee farmers, mango farmers and sugar farmers. Indeed, the town's population has continued to grow. That's not to say that it's not been faced with significant economic challenges. It has been faced with economic challenges. But one of the key drivers of that community has been the precise opportunity to develop new market access for those farmers in that part of the world who now have been able to diversify into different crops, away from tobacco, and be assured that their mangoes, whether they be Bowen or R2E2 mangoes, can get into new export markets, that their sugarcane can get into new export markets, that the beef coming from western Queensland can get into new markets. That is the very example of market access that the TPP-11 is going to continue to provide. That is precisely the reason why I say in good faith to the member for Kennedy that this deal is the right deal for Australia. It continues to open up market opportunity for us.


Can I also address some of the other comments that were made, given that we're debating the amendment that has been moved by the member for Melbourne. Frankly, we have seen absolutely hysterical claims being made about trade deals—not exclusively by the member for Melbourne, but he does give voice to some of the most excessive claims that are completely groundless in terms of fact. He made a comment about there being big, gaping holes in labour and migration laws as a result of trade deals—I think those were his precise words. How completely and utterly absurd. There are no gaping laws in labour and migration laws as a consequence of these trade deals. In fact, the only waiver that's provided in relation to labour market testing is that: labour market testing. The full suite of domestic laws in relation to minimum rates of pay and non-exploitation of workers continues to apply. The waiver is only in relation to advertising domestically. Do you know the reason why that's done? It's done because we get the same market access in return in those other 10 countries with whom we've done this deal. In other words, we have done a deal that says to the other 10 countries involved: 'It's like for like. You give us access and we'll give you access.' Most importantly, we have very narrowly defined the opportunities in which that waiver will apply.


In fact, it was the Australian Labor Party, when they were last in government, that implemented a number of these labour market testing waivers. There's not even any new territory in this for the coalition. In fact, on LMT, labour market testing, we've effectively implemented the same waivers that the Australian Labor Party implemented when they were last in government. Labor's position has clearly changed, and I acknowledge that Labor's position on that has changed. Nonetheless, there's nothing new about this that hasn't been done previously by the Labor Party. The waiver doesn't apply to domestic laws, the waiver doesn't apply to minimum wages, the waiver doesn't apply to standards and the waiver doesn't apply to all of the requirements that are incumbent upon employers in relation to employees. None of those are waived. The only waiver that applies in this particular case with respect to labour market testing is that requirement, and that's in return for having done the deal.


When I hear members opposite talk about how this was a huge sacrifice to make and ought not to have been done—well, the consequence of that would be that they wouldn't do the deal. Any trade deal does require some give and some take, but the consequence is that in net terms, in aggregate terms, the benefits are there to be seen. The benefits in this case are substantial: benefits that drive economic growth, drive exports and drive jobs in this country. It is trade that has delivered us one of the highest standards of living in the world. It is trade that is driving prosperity in regional Australia. It is trade that is ensuring that more Australians have job opportunities than ever before. It is trade which has delivered record volumes of wine exports to markets like China. When I hear people complain about their concerns on aspects of trade deals that are done—yes, they can point to some concerns they may have in limited and discreet areas, but they conveniently ignore the multitude of benefits which have driven this economy, driven jobs and made Australians richer as a direct consequence. That is the benefit that flows from trade deals.



Mr Bandt interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  When I hear, again, the member for Melbourne with his hysterical claims on ISDS, I note once again that not once did he address the concerns that apply with respect to Australian businesses operating abroad. The focus is always this spurious claim that, under these deals, using ISDS, investor-state dispute settlement, there'll be opportunity for evil multinationals to sue the Australian people. That's always the claim that's made: 'This enables foreign businesses to sue the Australian government if we change any laws.' That is wrong as a claim not only because we have complete carve outs on matters such as the environment, defence and small business—a whole host of different areas where we include the carve out in the trade deal—but also because it's not Australia that needs to be concerned. We don't go about flagrantly disregarding our obligations to businesses, be they domestic or foreign. No, we uphold the rule of law and we seek to ensure that we always have a low sovereign risk profile. The reason you have ISDS is to make sure that we look after Australian businesses operating overseas. That's why you have ISDS. 


This preoccupation among certain elements of the Australian Labor Party, and indeed the member for Melbourne, to suggest that in some way we have lost control of our national sovereignty on matters in relation to public policy is completely and utterly false—a false claim that I will take this opportunity and every opportunity to comprehensively reject, because it is completely false. We retain the full discretion of public policy because there are exemptions in place. But do you know what I will not do? I will not turn my back on Australian businesses, on Australian investors, on the superannuation of ordinary Australians, invested in multinationals and invested in Australian businesses—for example, BHP—that want to take their processes offshore, that want to open a new mining operation abroad or something like that. I won't turn my back on those Australians businesses, on those mums and dads from Australia who deserve to have their investment dollars protected. If that means that we can bring an action against a foreign government who may not abide by the same principles as the Australian government, then I say we should bring that action. The consequence of the policy that's been espoused by the member for Melbourne and, indeed, some elements of the Australian Labor Party, would be to abandon Australian companies and Australian investors. That's the consequence of the noninclusion of ISDS—to walk away from Australian businesses that operate internationally—and  at the very time when we see more Australian businesses than ever before moving offshore and diversifying their businesses. 


We want the Australian economy to grow. We're a relatively modest market—25 million people. In the context of the globe, we are very modest indeed. Yet we have businesses that can be global champions and globally competitive, and we need our Australian businesses to go offshore. When they go offshore, guess what? That's export income to this country. When they go offshore, guess what? That's more employment in this country as more Australians get opportunities to work in those foreign markets. Yet, despite all of those benefits, we hear from the member for Melbourne and from certain elements of the Australian Labor Party the desire to walk away from those businesses and not give them the right to bring an action against a foreign government who might say, 'We don't care what you've done; we're nationalising it—tough luck.' How absurd, how preposterous and what a debasement of debate in this chamber that they would twist and manipulate it to make it a debate about Australia's sovereign capability and conveniently never mention the explicit public policy carve-outs contained in these trade deals. 


I will always take every opportunity to absolutely knock on the head and reject the ridiculous arguments that are made around ISDS, because they are plainly false. No clearer example need be mentioned than the unsuccessful action of Philip Morris against the former Australian Labor government in relation to the plain packaging of cigarettes, which they lost. Since then, we have actually even further refined and improved the public policy exemptions in our trade deals. So let's deal with facts and not deal with the kind of emotive rubbish that we hear in amendments like this, not grounded in fact and conveniently ignoring the multitude of benefits that flow to Australian businesses, to Australian investors and to Australian workers as a direct consequence of this government standing up for Australian businesses that are operating abroad. We will continue to do that, and I make no apology for its inclusion not only in relation to the TPP-11 but in other subsequent trade deals that have been done or will be done. It's the right thing for this country, the right thing for Australian businesses, the right thing for Australian workers. Having made those comments, I commend this bill to the House.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (15:47):  It's almost like we live in outer space here. Is the minister, the government and the opposition aware—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  You listen, your motor vehicle industry is completely gone. Your whitegoods industry is gone. Forty per cent of your cement industry, when you're constructing a house, is gone. Forty per cent of your steel industry, when you're constructing a house, is gone. Your glass industry is gone. Your textile industry is gone. What do you say, this is a success story?


You keep making reference to rural Australia. There could be many speakers in this place that might question my intelligence or my abilities, as they do very often, but they don't question the fact that I represent rural Australia. As a person that has had cattle all of my life—half my class at school were sugar cane farmers and are still my very best friends to this very day—I know all these industries intimately.


How good have we done in agriculture? Our beef numbers are down about 20 per cent the last time I looked. Our dairy industry is down 30 per cent in its production the last time I looked. The sugar industry is down 17 per cent. The sheep herd is down 70 per cent—a direct result of Mr Keating's deregulation of the wool industry. We are net importers of seafood and pork. Where the hell was the benefit for rural Australia in all this great free trade? Point out to me where it was.


Let me be very specific about the North American Free Trade Agreement, both the Fin Review and The Australian said this is all about dairy, beef and sugar: 'The value now to a dairyman is the equivalent of one ice cream a week.' So we get nothing out of the dairy agreement. I think it is in 14 years time that the restrictions on beef will be removed. I've represented the beef industry. I probably have more beef cattle than everyone else in this place. I've owned cattle all of my adult life—some 50 years—and I've never heard a single beef cattle man say to me, 'We have problems in entering the American market.' The American market's been a very open market, so there was never anything to be gained in the beef industry. The third industry was sugar. We were wiped like a dirty rag. And the minister said, 'There will be no agreement without sugar.' He came into this place and moved for the acceptance of the American free trade deal without sugar in it. Is it any wonder that the National Party does not exist in Queensland anymore? They're affiliates of the Liberal Party, not the National Party. Is it any wonder that the people have walked away?


Where is the benefit? It's not in the motor vehicle industry, the whitegoods industry, the textiles industry, the glass industry, the steel industry or the cement industry. It's not in beef, dairy, sugar, sheep, seafood or pork. Where the hell is the benefit? And are you telling me that these countries are going to honour their agreements? These are countries very noted for the rule of law. Countries like Brunei, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam are hallmarks of the rule of law. And they're going to honour this agreement? Are you serious? I repeat, because there are a number of members here who weren't here previously—and I have a very great respect for Tony Abbott; I liked him personally and I think he was a good Australian, whatever his shortcomings may be—that when Tony Abbott stood up in this place and led the applause on the free trade deal with China, I interjected: 'You just signed your own death warrant, my friend. There is no-one in Australia who is cheering for this except you imbeciles over here.' They are the only people who are cheering this one on. The people over here can start looking at their endorsements because the trade union movement has had a gutful of them. They sold out the worker lock, stock and barrel. It was not the Liberals that introduced s. 457 visas; we know it was Labor that introduced the s. 457 visas. I was there when the federal president of the CFMEU said, 'We will not brook any further s. 457s coming into this country.' The architects have been the Labor Party even more than the Liberal Party—

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (15:22):  The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement was touted as a wonderful thing in this place and in both the Financial Review and The Australian. The whole agreement was about the beef, sugar and dairy trades with America. I happen to be the representative of the electorate in Australia with arguably the biggest cattle numbers, the second-biggest sugar-producing area and certainly the most concentrated dairy area, so I watched the free trade agreement with great interest. I was intrigued and looked on with curiosity because in all of my adult life, nearly 50 years both as a member of parliament representing the heartland of the cattle industry and having had cattle on a quarter-of-a-million acres up in the Gulf Country for a while, I've never heard a single person complain to me about our access to the American market. In fact in many years we've had difficulty getting enough beef to fulfil our quota, and the Americans have been very fair as far as free trade goes. Their industry gets subsidised, but as far as access goes I've never had any complaints.


The second thing I will say is that Tony Abbott stood up in this place when the China-Australia Free-Trade Agreement was announced and led a spontaneous standing ovation for the minister who later on gave the green light to the sale of the Port of Darwin to the Chinese and then went on to earn nearly $900,000, according to the newspapers, in income from the Chinese company to which he had given the green light. So, the Americans' only deepwater port in the South Pacific was handed over to what may be—and we hope is never—their potential enemy, the Chinese. I'm sure they were very pleased about that. And President Obama expressed that he was not happy about that.


But when Tony Abbott stood that applause, I said—and I don't know whether it went into Hansard—'Tony, you just signed your own death warrant.' The people in Australia have had it up to here with this. They know it's lies. They know it's rubbish. And to do that—well, a few months later he was gone. I'm not saying it was on account of that, and I say it with regret, because I like Tony personally, and I respected him as Prime Minister. 



In question time last week I said to the Treasurer, 'After three years of deregulation and privatisation, electricity prices have risen from $670 a year for 11 straight years.' Once we deregulated and privatised, it went straight through the roof, up to $2,400. Well, what a magnificent success story! Privatisation and deregulation—a 300 per cent increase. I said, 'Similarly, housing has skyrocketed, from $5,600 a year to $15,000 a year', and that is a result of a free trade approach to visa entrants coming into this country—namely, section 457 workers—amongst other issues. Free market policy in food resulted in only two people buying and selling food in Australia, when this rubbish started. Those two had 50.5 per cent— (Time expired)

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Defence Industry) (15:26):  In summation on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill 2018, I thought I'd just touch upon some of the comments that have been made, and I thank the member for Kennedy for his contribution and his almost-kind words about me—certainly kinder words about my parents. As someone who did grow up in Far North Queensland and with a strong affection for regional Australia, I appreciate his comments.


I thought I would just address some of the comments with respect to the tobacco industry in my birth town of Mareeba and the suggestion of the member for Kennedy that the passing of the tobacco industry was a consequence of deregulation. Well, that may have been a factor, but there can be no doubt that the single-biggest driver of the wholesale change away from tobacco was actually the introduction of laws to stop people smoking. The way in which we have clamped down significantly on tobacco abuse has seen wholesale transformation of the industry in that part of the world—not a function of deregulation but, rather, a function of changing consumer patterns and habits and the fact that the percentage of the population that now smokes has declined to if not below 10 per cent then very, very close to that. That has been the single-biggest driver.


But here's the good news. When I go back to Mareeba, as I do relatively frequently, I see a community now that has transformed into a whole range of new crops. I see lychee farmers, mango farmers and sugar farmers. Indeed, the town's population has continued to grow. That's not to say that it's not been faced with significant economic challenges. It has been faced with economic challenges. But one of the key drivers of that community has been the precise opportunity to develop new market access for those farmers in that part of the world who now have been able to diversify into different crops, away from tobacco, and be assured that their mangoes, whether they be Bowen or R2E2 mangoes, can get into new export markets, that their sugarcane can get into new export markets, that the beef coming from western Queensland can get into new markets. That is the very example of market access that the TPP-11 is going to continue to provide. That is precisely the reason why I say in good faith to the member for Kennedy that this deal is the right deal for Australia. It continues to open up market opportunity for us.


Can I also address some of the other comments that were made, given that we're debating the amendment that has been moved by the member for Melbourne. Frankly, we have seen absolutely hysterical claims being made about trade deals—not exclusively by the member for Melbourne, but he does give voice to some of the most excessive claims that are completely groundless in terms of fact. He made a comment about there being big, gaping holes in labour and migration laws as a result of trade deals—I think those were his precise words. How completely and utterly absurd. There are no gaping laws in labour and migration laws as a consequence of these trade deals. In fact, the only waiver that's provided in relation to labour market testing is that: labour market testing. The full suite of domestic laws in relation to minimum rates of pay and non-exploitation of workers continues to apply. The waiver is only in relation to advertising domestically. Do you know the reason why that's done? It's done because we get the same market access in return in those other 10 countries with whom we've done this deal. In other words, we have done a deal that says to the other 10 countries involved: 'It's like for like. You give us access and we'll give you access.' Most importantly, we have very narrowly defined the opportunities in which that waiver will apply.


In fact, it was the Australian Labor Party, when they were last in government, that implemented a number of these labour market testing waivers. There's not even any new territory in this for the coalition. In fact, on LMT, labour market testing, we've effectively implemented the same waivers that the Australian Labor Party implemented when they were last in government. Labor's position has clearly changed, and I acknowledge that Labor's position on that has changed. Nonetheless, there's nothing new about this that hasn't been done previously by the Labor Party. The waiver doesn't apply to domestic laws, the waiver doesn't apply to minimum wages, the waiver doesn't apply to standards and the waiver doesn't apply to all of the requirements that are incumbent upon employers in relation to employees. None of those are waived. The only waiver that applies in this particular case with respect to labour market testing is that requirement, and that's in return for having done the deal.


When I hear members opposite talk about how this was a huge sacrifice to make and ought not to have been done—well, the consequence of that would be that they wouldn't do the deal. Any trade deal does require some give and some take, but the consequence is that in net terms, in aggregate terms, the benefits are there to be seen. The benefits in this case are substantial: benefits that drive economic growth, drive exports and drive jobs in this country. It is trade that has delivered us one of the highest standards of living in the world. It is trade that is driving prosperity in regional Australia. It is trade that is ensuring that more Australians have job opportunities than ever before. It is trade which has delivered record volumes of wine exports to markets like China. When I hear people complain about their concerns on aspects of trade deals that are done—yes, they can point to some concerns they may have in limited and discreet areas, but they conveniently ignore the multitude of benefits which have driven this economy, driven jobs and made Australians richer as a direct consequence. That is the benefit that flows from trade deals.



Mr Bandt interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  When I hear, again, the member for Melbourne with his hysterical claims on ISDS, I note once again that not once did he address the concerns that apply with respect to Australian businesses operating abroad. The focus is always this spurious claim that, under these deals, using ISDS, investor-state dispute settlement, there'll be opportunity for evil multinationals to sue the Australian people. That's always the claim that's made: 'This enables foreign businesses to sue the Australian government if we change any laws.' That is wrong as a claim not only because we have complete carve outs on matters such as the environment, defence and small business—a whole host of different areas where we include the carve out in the trade deal—but also because it's not Australia that needs to be concerned. We don't go about flagrantly disregarding our obligations to businesses, be they domestic or foreign. No, we uphold the rule of law and we seek to ensure that we always have a low sovereign risk profile. The reason you have ISDS is to make sure that we look after Australian businesses operating overseas. That's why you have ISDS. 


This preoccupation among certain elements of the Australian Labor Party, and indeed the member for Melbourne, to suggest that in some way we have lost control of our national sovereignty on matters in relation to public policy is completely and utterly false—a false claim that I will take this opportunity and every opportunity to comprehensively reject, because it is completely false. We retain the full discretion of public policy because there are exemptions in place. But do you know what I will not do? I will not turn my back on Australian businesses, on Australian investors, on the superannuation of ordinary Australians, invested in multinationals and invested in Australian businesses—for example, BHP—that want to take their processes offshore, that want to open a new mining operation abroad or something like that. I won't turn my back on those Australians businesses, on those mums and dads from Australia who deserve to have their investment dollars protected. If that means that we can bring an action against a foreign government who may not abide by the same principles as the Australian government, then I say we should bring that action. The consequence of the policy that's been espoused by the member for Melbourne and, indeed, some elements of the Australian Labor Party, would be to abandon Australian companies and Australian investors. That's the consequence of the noninclusion of ISDS—to walk away from Australian businesses that operate internationally—and  at the very time when we see more Australian businesses than ever before moving offshore and diversifying their businesses. 


We want the Australian economy to grow. We're a relatively modest market—25 million people. In the context of the globe, we are very modest indeed. Yet we have businesses that can be global champions and globally competitive, and we need our Australian businesses to go offshore. When they go offshore, guess what? That's export income to this country. When they go offshore, guess what? That's more employment in this country as more Australians get opportunities to work in those foreign markets. Yet, despite all of those benefits, we hear from the member for Melbourne and from certain elements of the Australian Labor Party the desire to walk away from those businesses and not give them the right to bring an action against a foreign government who might say, 'We don't care what you've done; we're nationalising it—tough luck.' How absurd, how preposterous and what a debasement of debate in this chamber that they would twist and manipulate it to make it a debate about Australia's sovereign capability and conveniently never mention the explicit public policy carve-outs contained in these trade deals. 


I will always take every opportunity to absolutely knock on the head and reject the ridiculous arguments that are made around ISDS, because they are plainly false. No clearer example need be mentioned than the unsuccessful action of Philip Morris against the former Australian Labor government in relation to the plain packaging of cigarettes, which they lost. Since then, we have actually even further refined and improved the public policy exemptions in our trade deals. So let's deal with facts and not deal with the kind of emotive rubbish that we hear in amendments like this, not grounded in fact and conveniently ignoring the multitude of benefits that flow to Australian businesses, to Australian investors and to Australian workers as a direct consequence of this government standing up for Australian businesses that are operating abroad. We will continue to do that, and I make no apology for its inclusion not only in relation to the TPP-11 but in other subsequent trade deals that have been done or will be done. It's the right thing for this country, the right thing for Australian businesses, the right thing for Australian workers. Having made those comments, I commend this bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (15:54):  I have spoken already of the disgrace of modern slavery and how it is, sadly, still happening today. I welcome the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, although I do have some concerns that it still has some deficiencies. I note the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, has moved some amendments to correct those deficiencies. I support those amendments.


Although modern slavery takes many shapes, one form relies on us as consumers to continue its business model. This is the modern slavery that occurs in the supply chain of the goods that we buy. In almost everything we purchase—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, our household items and building materials—modern slavery may be present in those supply chains. It is almost impossible for us, as consumers, to know it is present. Anti-Slavery Australia told the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act that:


It is difficult to estimate the extent of practices of human trafficking and slavery in global supply chains. This is due to the clandestine nature of human trafficking and slavery, combined with the lack of transparency regarding supply chains at both the Australian and international level.


It is often very difficult to determine just where a product was produced and exactly how an element of a product has been made. For example, Ms Kate Nicholl, an independent supply chain consultant and lecturer at the University of Melbourne, gave the inquiry the example of a shirt made in Bangladesh that is sold by an Australian retailer:


The back of this shirt will say 'made in Bangladesh' but what that actually means is that this shirt was assembled in Bangladesh. The fabric, the cotton, the dye, if there is a zip in it, if there is a button in it—all of those materials that go into assembling that product in Bangladesh can be sourced from elsewhere, of which there is largely not a lot of transparency. It can be up to three tiers or four tiers in a supply chain, and that is where the workers are vulnerable to exploitation.


This bill will establish a modern slavery reporting requirement. It will require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make annual modern slavery statements to the responsible minister. The bill provides for mandatory reporting for Australian entities that have annual revenue of $100 million or more. Entities with lower annual revenue will not be compelled to make the statements but may do so voluntarily, and concerned consumers should consider asking them to so do. Many stakeholders have expressed concern that the threshold for mandatory reporting is too high and that entities with lower annual revenue should be compelled to make annual reports.


One of the deficiencies in this bill, which particularly troubles me, is the lack of any penalties for noncompliance with the act. A mandatory scheme with no penalty regime is like a tiger without teeth: it would soon starve to death. Why would a company report if there were no penalties for not reporting? There are some costs associated with reporting, so if your competitor chooses not to report, why would you? This is why Labor has moved an amendment to the bill to include penalties in the act. We cannot leave big business to police themselves. That has been made abundantly clear in evidence emerging from the banking royal commission, an inquiry that Prime Minister Morrison voted against 26 times and that he called a 'populist whinge'.


In the United Kingdom, where there are no penalties attached to reporting, only around 30 per cent of businesses who are supposed to be reporting actually report. That is fewer than one in three. That is not good enough. I would have hoped that our government would have learnt from that lesson from the United Kingdom and made sure that our modern slavery act actually had some teeth. Modern slavery in the supply chain is not something that is going to disappear overnight. It is going to take perseverance and a consistently strong response to those that continue to allow it to happen.


Australia is a trading nation. Our economic growth is underpinned by our ability to sell our goods and services overseas and to buy from the rest of the world too. It is important that we nurture our relationships with our trading partners, if for no other reason than for our own economic prosperity. But there is a secondary and equally important reason for nurturing these trading relationships: by promoting open and transparent relationships between our trading partners, we are better able to monitor and influence the transition to ethical supply chains in those countries. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, debated today, between the 11 signatory countries provides an opportunity to engage with our trading partners in a forum that is mutually advantageous. There are many clauses in the TPP that I would personally not have supported. However, if handled well, it should allow trust to develop between Australia and our trading partners.


Australia has just signed a trade agreement with Indonesia. The previous Labor government launched negotiations with Indonesia in 2012 because we recognise that our trading relationship with Indonesia has been extremely limited. Indonesia is the fourth-largest country in the world by population, and by 2050 it's projected to be the world's fourth-largest economy. It is one of our nearest geographical neighbours, yet it is currently our 13th-largest trading partner. Trade between Indonesia and Australia has actually gone backwards over the past five years. Tragically, other ties have followed suit. There are now fewer Australians speaking Bahasa than in the 1970s, and that is a disgrace. The contrast between two of our near neighbours could not be greater. More than 18,000 Australians export to New Zealand, and only about 2,000 export to Indonesia—one country, about five million people, and the other country, Indonesia, about 270 million. As one of our closest next-door neighbours, Indonesia barely gets a glance over the fence.


This does not bode well for building an open and transparent relationship. When it comes to making sure that our supply chains are free from modern slavery, such relationships are critically important. Ensuring that Australia has mutually beneficial trading relationships is crucial. Labor is conscious of the importance of these relationships. A Shorten Labor government, should it be elected, has committed to boosting transparency and analyses of trade agreements by improving the process of negotiation right from the start. A Shorten Labor government would also introduce laws that prohibit governments from signing trade agreements that waive labour market testing. That is important in the context of this bill to prevent modern slavery. The Liberals have eroded Australia's trust in trade by signing trade agreements that allow companies to bring in foreign workers without first checking whether there's an Australian who can do that job. Sadly, the Liberals have let labour market testing requirements be waived. Where there is already an Australian worker willing and able to do the job, there is no need to bring in workers from other countries—unless, obviously, an unscrupulous employer is intending to exploit the foreign worker and thus undermine local wages and conditions.


Sadly, migrants are most at risk of experiencing forms of modern slavery in Australia. In recent years authorities have discovered that men and women who have been trafficked here have been exploited in areas of work such as domestic work, hospitality, and agriculture and construction industries as well as in the sex industry. Submissions to the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia last year gave evidence of cases of modern slavery in areas including migrant workers in the agricultural construction and meat processing industries, backpackers in the agricultural industry, a domestic worker trafficked by a foreign diplomat, and private domestic workers. Limiting the ability to bring workers to Australia to those who can work in industries where there are not enough Australian workers able to fill those vacancies will go at least some way to eliminating this form of exploitation.


As I've said, I support this bill. It is more than time that we eradicated modern slavery everywhere we can. I spoke recently in this House about gender inequality. Modern slavery impacts on many more women than men. In 2014 over 70 per cent of the 17,752 victims of human trafficking were women or girls; 54 per cent of those victims suffered sexual exploitation. Australia is primarily a destination country for human trafficking. Women from Asia are trafficked here to be put to work in the sex work industry, amongst others. I have met with the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans on many occasions here in Parliament House, and I greatly admire the work ACRATH does. In the past 12 months alone they have assisted 28 trafficked women through their companionship program. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. Organisations including ACRATH have joined Labor in calling for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


Anti Slavery Australia has also recommended that the bill include the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner. They say that the commissioner should monitor, oversee and coordinate Australia's response to human trafficking and slavery; raise awareness and provide education and guidance on human trafficking and slavery; conduct inquiries of systemic abuses in Australia; and receive and investigate complaints from individuals and organisations that have a sufficient interest. Labor again, as we did earlier in the year, call on the government to establish an independent antislavery commissioner to assist victims. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government instead set up a business engagement unit to assist big business, when their resources would be much more efficient helping the victims of slavery. Labor continues to call on the Morrison government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner to help victims of modern slavery and stamp out this sickening crime. With that I welcome this bill.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:05):  I speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Hotham. The amendment has been moved because what the government is proposing with the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 doesn't go far enough and, unfortunately, ignores the recommendations of several inquiries, particularly around the appointment of an independent commissioner to look at these issues. Quite simply, slavery is shocking. That we as a nation aren't doing all we can to prevent slavery is saddening. As a country and as a parliament we must do more to prevent slavery, servitude, forced labour, deceptive recruiting, trafficking in persons, debt bondage, forced marriage and organ trafficking. Forced labour is barred everywhere in the world, yet tens of millions are subject to this appalling practice. The vast majority of modern slaves are working in factories, on construction sites, on fishing boats and in agricultural industries across the world. It's estimated that a quarter of such exploitation is happening outside of a victim's country of origin.


Australia is not immune to the scourge of slavery. The Global Slavery Index estimates that up to 15,000 people are struggling in conditions of modern slavery here in Australia. This includes forced labour, sexual exploitation of adults and children, and forced marriages. It's quite shocking and saddening. To most Australians it would be unbelievable that these sorts of things still occur in modern society, but there's no emotion involved for those who commit these most heinous of human rights abuses. Slavery is underpinned by a simple business model: reduce the cost of labour to something close to zero and reap the benefits of that toil. Slavers enjoy these fruits despite the bitterness of terror and tears. Both violence and threats of deception are the business strategy of the cold, calculating slaver. Psychological abuse, coercion and mental manipulation play a significant role in the recruitment and control of modern-day slaves, particularly in relationships where there is an imbalance of power between the slavers and those being exploited. Perpetrators often live and work with their victims, watching and managing their movements, taking them to work and collecting them. Victims of slavery don't travel alone. Their identity papers and passports are often taken away when they enter the country in which these actions take place.


Our fellow humans are forced by people into work they would not otherwise do, yet modern slavery's business model goes beyond the simple reduction of labour costs. Researchers at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom have highlighted that modern slavers are also deriving revenue from the sale of additional goods and services to workers under their control. This is the 'slaves as consumers' aspect of modern slavery. This can include accommodation, food and transport provided at monopoly prices to workers with no other choices. It's all upside for those doing the exploiting, but for the workers it's a continued spiral into deeper debt. This too can provide more opportunity for the slavers to turn the screws. In order to service the debt, workers may then secure funds from family members abroad or instant loan services which enable their exploiters to generate additional revenue. This business model of despair encourages slavers to deliberately take on more workers than they need for the work they expect to get done. This is the ugly face of the 'growth despite the costs' mantra.


It is also a reflection of the constant innovation in the business models of those doing the exploitation. That's why we talk of modern-day slavery. It is because of the innovative aspects of what's being done and the techniques that are being used to exploit people. But whether it was back in the 18th century or is in the modern 21st century, the principle is still the same—that is, the shocking and horrible abuse of human rights and exploitation of people for economic advantage. That may help to explain why there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other point in modern history.


The slavers are also increasingly using social media, particularly to recruit migrant labourers. They use platforms such as Facebook to promise unrealistically high pay and share only a very general description of the work involved, and, of course, there's very little information on workers' rights, recruitment fees or deceptive recruitment. The challenge is that it can be difficult to identify exploitative recruitment online. Detailed conversations with dodgy employers are usually taking place in private and illegal activity often happens alongside what seems like and constitutes legal behaviour. The slavers often use aggressive, credible threats to create anxiety, despair and humiliation to ensure compliant behaviour. This non-physical type of control means that modern slavery is easy to conceal. It's harder to see. It's encouraging to see that some of organisations, like Facebook, are working with the United Nations and grassroots organisations to raise awareness of human smuggling, trafficking and forced labour.


It is clear that businesses here in Australia can also play a major role in either facilitating modern day slavery or helping to eradicate it. Companies can be culpable by driving down supplier prices or demanding ever-quicker production. These actions can play a big role in pushing suppliers to pursue cheap labour solutions and illicit subcontracting. A supply chain shouldn't be based on workers shackled in chains. Slavery is indeed a weak link in corporate supply chains. Forced labour was once a niche human rights matter for many large companies but today it needs to be at the forefront of corporate concerns.


One year ago, Labor committed to modern slavery legislation with penalties and, importantly, an independent anti-slavery commissioner. Our announcement was warmly greeted by business, civil society and unions and we're deeply disappointed that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have put forward a modern slavery bill without those penalties and have chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent anti-slavery commissioner. The absence of penalties in this bill is also quite baffling. We cannot leave it to big business to police themselves on slavery. There have to be penalties for the serious breaches of human rights that we have seen constituting modern slavery. We can't leave it to big business simply to police themselves on this one. Evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the United Kingdom, where there is a similar regime without penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported still hovers at around 30 per cent of those that supposedly have an obligation to do so.


Civil society groups have also argued the need for penalties for companies that breach the Modern Slavery Act. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry put in their submissions that this was a necessary must-have in any legislation when it came to modern slavery legislation. Those organisations include the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam. They've all called for penalties to be included in this bill. That's why Labor, despite supporting this bill, will continue our fight to ensure that we get a decent set of provisions that do provide an active deterrent to slavery in this country and, importantly, provide deterrent penalties for those who breach their human rights obligations and who undertake slavery in the modern context. I don't think there would be one Australian who would believe that it would be acceptable to exploit people and abuse their human rights in this manner. If that is the case, then there should be stiff penalties for those who do and there should be an independent body, in the form of an independent anti-slavery commissioner, that has oversight and makes sure that the laws and penalties are enforced.

One sector in particular that we spent a lot of time on was in the textile and clothing sector. Many people hear reports about sweatshops and Third World conditions, and what they probably don't realise is that, in many cases here in our backyards, we have people working on a similar basis. The people who are making clothes might be getting paid as little as $3 or $4 an hour in Australia, in flats in Richmond in my electorate or out in Springvale or elsewhere around the country, and those are clothes that go on to sell for a few hundred dollars. They're often some big brand names and they're often sold right here in Australia. 


The companies who sell those clothes for enormous profit, paying very, very low wages—clothes usually made by older women, but not exclusively, who speak a language other than English as their first language—get away with this through things called contracting chains. The companies at the top, big brand names, will say to a middle company, 'We want you to make us some clothes.' Of course, you've got to abide by all the relevant legal requirements, but they then turn a blind eye to whether those things actually happen or not. The companies in the middle go off and then may, in turn, contract someone else. There could be two or three steps before you actually get to the worker at the end. The worker at the end, who will be sewing the brand name onto the garment, may have no legal relationship with that label. There are two or three intermediary steps—sometimes four or five—in between that allow the big company at the top to wash its hands of what's happening but that result in the person down the bottom working for below award wages and conditions and often under a significant threat. The companies in the middle say to them: 'You can complain if you like. You can try and organise or try and demand the basic things that you're entitled to under the law, but, if you do that, we'll just go and get someone else to do the work.' So, as a result, you end up in an extraordinarily vulnerable position and you will get paid below award wages. That happens here in Australia. 


The Textile Clothing and Footwear Union has done enormous work not only in organising those people and taking those companies to court but also in changing the law, saying: 'No. If you're sitting at the top of the chain making a lot of money out of this, you bear some responsibility. There will now be the ability to take you to court if it turns out that the person who's doing the work is doing it in conditions that Australia wouldn't agree with.' That is a good principle. What we know is that that same system that leads to exploitation here in Australia applies now across the whole world, because, of course, capital is quite mobile and is able to go and engage in contracts overseas. And, in many instances, where wages are much lower even than you can get away with paying under those extraordinary arrangements I've just spoken about in Australia, they will go and do it. 


We also know that a problem in Australia that is an especially big problem overseas is that many people work in what could only be described as slave-like conditions. That touches Australia very, very deeply. For example, in my electorate we have a very large representation from the Eritrean community. There have been some significant changes in Eritrea and Ethiopia during the course of this year, and a lot of people are looking at that with great hope and hoping that some of those changes, including around conscription but also around border disputes, will lead to some long-lasting peace and an improvement in human rights in the region. People have such hope because, in the many years before that, some horrific stories have come out of these regions. What is said systematically is that people are forced into slave labour and forced labour arrangements.


This happens when you've got an extraordinarily vulnerable population where you have wars. In many instances, as we are seeing famines and droughts sweeping through the region, you have people desperate for the basic freedoms that we would take for granted. They are forced into a position where they're told: 'Well, not only don't you have a government against which you can assert basic human rights but also we are now going to come and make you work, sometimes'—this was previously alleged, and Amnesty International and the UN have said this—'with the government's support. We're going to put you into a form of forced labour.' The reason that's important for Australia is that many Australian mining companies operate in Africa, particularly in some of those Horn of Africa countries and right across the region.


Just as it's no longer acceptable for companies in the clothing industry to say, 'You might be sewing the label onto our clothes, but we have no legal relationship with you, so we're going to turn a blind eye,' now it's no longer defensible, nor should it be legally acceptable, for Australian companies, including Australian mining companies, to have interests in the Africa region and to turn a blind eye to whether or not forced labour is being used to dig up their resources and have them shipped across to Australia. We've seen terrible examples of companies from Australia going abroad to try and defend governments' abuses of human rights overseas. In Canada, Canadian mining companies have actually found themselves taken to court because of claims of forced labour in Africa. It's only a matter of time before it happens in Australia as well. You would think, in light of knowing what we know about slavery in Australia, slavery around the world and the potential exposure of Australian companies, the government might seize that opportunity to come here with a bill that would actually do something and have a significant chance of winding it back.


It is good that we are debating a modern slavery bill in this parliament. That is a good thing. But, just as we needed laws that held large companies like Nike and Adidas to account and enabled them to be taken to court, we need laws in this country that have teeth. To pass modern slavery legislation but then outsource effective compliance of that to the very same people that this is meant to be regulating raises the question about whether the bill is going to work at all. That is why during the course of the inquiry into this matter and elsewhere the Greens, others and the opposition have said, 'You really need an independent commissioner to be able to have oversight over this, because otherwise how can you be assured that anything is going to change?' We have also heard the likes of the Law Council front up and say: 'Why are there no penalties in this bill? How is it that this bill seeks to impose obligations on people, yet there is no penalty if they breach them?' I will come back to this in a minute.


There are a number of other things that need to be changed in this bill. During the course of the Senate inquiry, we made the point that, at a minimum, this act should be reviewed on a regular and ongoing three-yearly basis by a statutory antislavery commissioner. We think that the first of those reviews, if there were to be an antislavery commissioner, should consider lower thresholds, the targeting of businesses in high-risk industries regardless of annual turnover, appropriate and commensurate resourcing of the commission and penalties for noncompliance. That has to be considered soon.


We also call on the government to amend this bill to include a public register of compliance for entities over the reportable threshold and a requirement in the act that entities over the reportable threshold comply with the act to be eligible for tender for government contracts, because we know that government, to the extent that it holds the purse strings, has the ability to drive very significant change. What should also be considered—it's not in this bill but it needs to be considered—are the needs, scope and application of a national victim support and compensation scheme as the next tranche of modern slavery legislation in Australia.


All of those things would be useful improvements to the bill, and I expect that the bill will pass in some form, and that will be good. But we've got an opportunity to make it better. And as we're making it better, the simple test we should apply is: is this bill actually going to drive change? I think everyone is agreed now on the need to take measures to stamp out modern slavery, but the question's got to be not whether we're debating a bill that's simply got 'modern slavery' in the title but whether we're going to bring about change in the sector.


As I've said, we've heard some very distressing examples of Australian companies—and the Human Rights Law Centre has shone the spotlight on this—being prepared to stand next to regimes whose human rights records would be questionable at best in countries where forced labour is going on and not only not say anything about it but actually throw their weight behind the current arrangements. That is a grave concern. And as Australian interests expand—mining interests in Africa in particular—we are going to need some independent oversight of this to ensure that it has teeth, because those businesses are operating a long way away. They might be based in Australia and headquartered in Australia, but the operations take place a long way away. It is very difficult, simply from behind a desk, to monitor that. And I would suggest that it is nonsensical to simply say, 'Well, we're going to rely on self-reporting' to say that there are no problems, because we've seen that that hasn't worked so far. There is very much a need for someone with teeth to be able to go in and investigate what is happening and whether or not, under the name of Australian companies, forced labour is taking place elsewhere.


I reiterate that in looking at what's happening in Eritrea and Ethiopia a lot of people are hoping that recent changes might ameliorate some of that, but that's happening independent of what Australia can do. That's no excuse for Australia not to do everything that we possibly can to ensure that those supply chains do not allow companies to turn a blind eye to what is happening. As this bill progresses through the Senate, Senator Nick McKim will be making further comments about the Greens position with respect to this bill. But I'll say now that I sincerely hope that we don't miss this opportunity, where attention is focused on modern slavery—something that is very real, and greater than many people think—to actually put in place laws that have teeth and that will drive real change. It would be an extraordinary pity if the government simply said that they're concerned only about a facade of action, when we could be doing a bit better than what the government has proposed.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:27):  Slavery is a very serious problem that many Australians would imagine has decreased in scope over the last years or decades or centuries. But in fact it's estimated that over 40 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery—a higher number of people trapped in slavery today than at any other time in human history, and two-thirds of those people are in our region. Slavery is supported by supply chains of products and services that many of us use every day. We know that modern slavery occurs in many forms—wage theft, dangerous and unpaid work, abuse, imprisonment and deprivation. It's vulnerable people, including foreign and seasonal workers, students, casualised and marginalised workers, and people with social, economic, language and cultural barriers, who are most at risk, and we know that many of these are women.


Labor's position on this is clear: we will not tolerate the exploitation of these workers and the human rights abuses that go along with this exploitation. Modern slavery is often obscured by those who profit from it. As a society, we won't be able to end it unless we have laws dedicated to preventing it and to stopping it and resources to support that legislation. Last year, after lengthy consultation with advocates, activists and other stakeholders, Labor announced a modern slavery policy. I want to take a moment to recognise the extraordinary work of the shadow minister for justice, Clare O'Neil, in developing Labor's position. Clare really did terrific work in this area. Business, civil society and the union movement have all helped inform Labor's policy. Labor is committed to establishing a modern slavery act to make supply chains transparent, to apply penalties for noncompliance and to establish a statutory, independent antislavery commissioner. We called on the government to match our commitment.


Of course we support this legislation, but, sadly, this legislation does not match the commitments that Labor has made in this area. After significant pressure, the government brought forward this bill. The bill, sadly, does not adequately address all of the advice and information that Labor took into account when we developed our approach in this area. Most importantly, the bill doesn't provide for penalties for companies that breach the provisions within the bill, and the government has proposed a watered-down business engagement unit instead of establishing an independent antislavery commissioner. Those weaknesses in this bill are disappointing. The government has shown time and again that it is too weak to tackle important issues like this, especially when it comes to regulating the businesses that are profiting from modern slavery. We can and must do better.


Labor has moved amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act and we're also calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. Labor acknowledges the genuine passion that many in the business community have shown for this issue and the broad commitment within the Australian community to work against slavery. But where companies don't comply with the bill in its current form there should be penalties attached. The proposed business engagement unit is toothless and it has no enforcement powers. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU, have joined Labor in calling for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


Modern slavery is often difficult for authorities to detect, investigate and prosecute. There are also significant gaps in the support services for victims of modern slavery. An independent antislavery commissioner would help fill those gaps, firstly, by working with victims of slavery to receive inquiries and complaints. Secondly, it would assist businesses in building best practice to protect their supply chains. Thirdly, it would work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Lastly, it would allow us to enhance our global efforts to fight slavery, including by working with other countries and with international organisations that are working to end slavery.


Labor is very concerned that the bill also includes forced marriage as one of the forms of exploitation that business would report on. Forced marriage is one of the most serious forms of exploitation, human being of human being. Forced marriage is often accompanied by sexual abuse for extended periods of time, isolation and the taking of victims overseas against their will. It is extremely serious. But to include it in this bill might have unintended consequences—a view expressed by a number of organisations that are active in this area—including potentially driving forced marriage further underground. Our view is based on advice from advocates who work every day on preventing forced marriage and assisting people who are at risk of forced marriage. Australia's current approach to forced marriage isn't working. Under the Turnbull government there was not one successful prosecution of forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government financial support. So earlier this year, to deal specifically with forced marriage, Labor committed to establishing a regime of force marriage protection orders, increasing funding for civil society organisations, establishing a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to support services and government agencies, and providing assistance for Australians who have been taken overseas to be married against their will.


We are also committed to removing the cooperation requirement. Currently victims of forced marriage who want to access government funded support have to agree to cooperate with law enforcement. You can imagine how difficult it becomes when you're talking about a young person potentially having to give evidence against their parents or other family members. Having to testify against their own family in order to access critical support might actually prevent a person making a complaint in the first place or accessing support. We don't believe that's adequate. The government recently announced a limited trial to improve these support services, but that trial doesn't go nearly far enough. We believe that the government should match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment, not risk driving this practice further underground.


I acknowledged the work by Clare O'Neil, the shadow minister for justice, on modern slavery, and I should also acknowledge her work in the area of forced marriage. It really has been first rate, but, of course, there are many people in the Australian community who've been working on these issues for many years. I'd particularly like to acknowledge Dr Jennifer Byrne and her team at Anti-Slavery Australia and the many civil society and faith based organisations that are active in this area, including the Uniting Church; the Salvation Army; members of the Australian Freedom Network; STOP THE TRAFFIK; Fiona McLeod SC and Morry Bailes from the Law Council of Australia; the Walk Free Foundation, particularly Andrew Forrest and his family, who have been very active in this antislavery area; and my friend and former colleague former Senator Chris Evans. The Australian Council of Trade Unions and individual unions have also been extraordinary in their fight against the extreme exploitation of workers in industries as diverse as textiles, clothing and footwear; agriculture; transport; domestic; child care; and construction—particular parts of the construction industry have been very much at risk of slave-like conditions for some of the workers. So I acknowledge the very fine contribution of these organisations over many years.


I just want to finish by speaking a little bit about Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans. ACRATH have really done extraordinary work in this area of modern slavery and also in the area of trafficking of people. They have been fierce and persistent advocates for the victims of trafficking. As well as their advocacy work, they provide services that have been a lifeline to trafficked individuals in Australia and in our region. ACRATH has been instrumental in shining a light on the slavery that exists today, including the fact that Australia is a destination for trafficked people. ACRATH gives people who have been trafficked hope, and it gives them a voice.


Today, I want to particularly acknowledge the work that ACRATH has done on forced marriage. ACRATH has produced materials for use in the school curriculum to improve awareness of the practice of forced marriage in Australia and to make sure that all students know that forced marriage is illegal and know where they can turn if they believe they or a friend or someone they know is at risk of forced marriage. These materials were piloted in schools across three Australian states—South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. Evaluation of the pilot shows that the materials were very effective. The program evaluation report says, 'Schools provide the potential for tens of thousands of young people to be educated about human rights and the way that the practice of forced marriage violates these rights.' The program empowers young people to advocate for their own rights and for the rights of their peers. The funding for this was absolutely minuscule: $60,000 was what they needed to run this program. Unfortunately, ACRATH now have uncertainty about whether they'll be able to continue this work, because there is no certainty about their ongoing funding. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the government to make sure that programs like this can be given a certain future and that organisations like ACRATH are properly supported to continue and to expand their work to eliminate trafficking in all its forms, including forced marriage.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (16:40):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate this week on this important bill. We're united on both sides of this House in our shared commitment to combating modern slavery, and I'd like to thank the many people who have contributed not just in this debate but in the committee which considered this matter at great length, chaired so well by the member for Dunkley. I thank him and all of his colleagues on the committee.


The Modern Slavery Bill 2018 is a vital milestone in our response to this crime. It will shine a light into the dark corners of global supply chains and transform the way businesses respond to modern slavery. Today we've heard a range of suggestions in relation to potential amendments to this bill, including removing forced marriage from the definition of modern slavery; introducing a punitive penalty regime; requiring annual reporting to parliament, including a list of all reporting entities; and establishing an antislavery commissioner. The government is confident that the bill is appropriate for the Australian context in its current form and does not require amendment in the House. The government has carefully crafted this bill through a 10-month consultation process to ensure that it is practical, sensible and effective, and those consultations were indeed extensive. There were meetings with over 170 business and civil society experts across 16 roundtable meetings, as well as over 70 direct meetings. During those extensive consultations, the government worked closely with business and civil society to consider the issues of relevance to this bill. We also thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its inquiry into the bill, and the government is carefully considering the five recommendations made by that Senate committee.


In conclusion, the importance of this bill must not be understated. This is a matter of great importance. The business community and broader civil society both support government taking action on this issue, and this bill will be a powerful catalyst for change. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hotham has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment, as moved by the member for Hotham, be agreed to.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:54):  by leave—I move:


(1) Clause 4, page 4 (line 15), after ""Criminal Code"", insert "", other than an offence against section 270.7B of the Criminal Code (forced marriage offences)"".


(2) Clause 4, page 4 (line 17), after ""Divisions"", insert ""(other than an offence against section 270.7B)"".


Thank you for the opportunity to move these amendments to the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. We're delighted to be making some proposed changes that we think will strengthen this bill and make sure it is effective as it can be. Amendments (1) and (2) circulated in my name relate to forced marriage, which, as it currently stands, is a definition of slavery to which this modern slavery act would eventually be subject. Whether we should include forced marriage in the legislation before us is a complicated question. Under Australia's Criminal Code, forced marriage is considered one of the types of slavery that is outlawed under Australian law, but that doesn't really help us to answer the question as to whether it should in fact be subject to a modern slavery bill.


Labor has spoken to stakeholders quite extensively about this issue and we're concerned that the inclusion of forced marriage in this bill will have unintended consequences, including driving forced marriage further underground. Good Shepherd in its submission to the Senate inquiry said, 'There is a likelihood that the reporting requirement may function as a barrier to prevention.' The Salvation Army said in its submission, 'There is a risk that requiring entities to assess risk of this practise may lead to unintended negative consequences, including racial or religious profiling of some of their staff.'


It might assist the House and those in the gallery for me to step back a little and contextualise what we're talking about here. The bill that's before the parliament is to introduce a requirement on big companies that are operating into Australia. What we're saying to these big companies is that for the first time under Australian law they will be required to make a statement about what it is that they've done to make sure that slavery is not a part of their supply chain. It's a very important reform because for a long time we've had big business in Australia tell us that what happens in their supply chain is none of their business. That has to change. It's a really exciting moment for this parliament to stand together on this question of obligation, because we are saying that we do expect companies to look. To not know is no excuse.


The question, though, is how broadly we define slavery under this act, and, specifically, whether we want to put an obligation on big companies in this country that they investigate forced marriage, as a form of slavery, which would then subject to the reporting requirements that we are discussing? It may come to pass in the future that we will consider that this is an important part of the act, but Labor believes that under this first go at the Australian Parliament legislating on this matter it is not appropriate to include forced marriage. The reason for this is that we don't want to give big companies effectively a social licence, and in fact a legal licence, to inquire into the personal lives of their employees. We don't want, for example, big companies to see that under this bill the parliament is telling them that they should be talking to their employees about their marriage and how their marriage came to pass. There may be instances where a forced marriage becomes part of some type of human trafficking that brings slavery into the supply chain of companies, but our view, in listening to the experts, is that at this stage we would prefer to err on the side of caution and not include forced marriage in the definition under this law. What that means is that big Australian companies will have to comply with this law—they will have to make sure they make statements about whether there is slavery in the supply chain, but we won't be asking them to tell us about what they've done to prevent forced marriage, because we believe that in doing so we may actually drive this very significant social problem further underground.


We on this side of the House are very concerned about forced marriage. Earlier this year I was very lucky to stand with the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and member for Sydney as we announced a very fresh, new and different approach to tackling forced marriage that a future Shorten Labor government would put in place. That would include establishing a Forced Marriage Unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to the support they need. It would include increasing funding for civil society to support victims and, crucially, it would involve the full removal of the cooperation requirement. Today the cooperation requirement is a mechanism under Australian law that effectively requires victims of forced marriage, literally some of the most vulnerable people in our whole country, to get government support to escape from that marriage. We effectively require them to report against their own parents, and you can imagine that most are not willing to do that. It is a very complex issue, a very important one, and we don't believe that it belongs in this modern slavery act.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (16:59):  The government does not support the proposed amendment and the removal of forced marriage from the definition of modern slavery. We've carefully considered this issue in consultation with over 100 experts in the business community and broader society. The broad feedback was strongly in favour of the inclusion of forced marriage within the definition of modern slavery. This is because some entities may directly contribute to forced marriage through their business activities. We believe that should be captured within the definition under the act. For example, a mining company may report on forced marriage risks because it runs remote overseas accommodation camps for workers who are forcibly marrying women. The bill will also apply to entities that may choose to include information in their statements about their actions to ensure that forced marriages don't occur as part of their services. The bill doesn't require entities to investigate or assess the private activities of their employees, which is important to note. Our approach to forced marriage is consistent with the way we will require entities to report on other modern slavery risks linked to their business activities. For example, members have highlighted the potential vulnerability of some private domestic workers to modern slavery. Under this act we will expect companies that provide domestic workers for their overseas employees to report on what they are doing to ensure these workers are not exploited. For these reasons the government does not support the proposed amendment.

Liability of Crown



(5) Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, as it applies in relation to subsection 16A(1) or (2) of this Act, does not make the Crown liable to a pecuniary penalty.


I do so because, while we are very pleased to be in this chamber this evening debating the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, there is something crucially important missing from the bill that's before us. That is the issue of penalties. So Labor is moving amendments to this bill to introduce immediate penalties for companies that fail to submit a modern slavery statement and penalties for companies that submit inadequate modern slavery statements with a two-year delayed start. We will also be moving amendments to require the minister to report to parliament on the operation of the act annually, including the list of companies the minister believes are required to report and those the minister believes are noncompliant.


We do this in the full knowledge that there are a number of very big companies around this country that are doing everything they can to fight modern slavery. We are, in part, instituting a report to the parliament because we want the parliament to draw the public's attention to companies that are doing the right thing—and there are a lot of them. But it is also the case that there are big companies in this country that are not doing what we believe is required to fight modern slavery.


In this parliament, we make laws and all of us in this chamber are subject to those laws. The bill before us will introduce a regime which requires big public companies to report on what they're doing to fight modern slavery, yet effectively the government are making the regime optional. This is slavery we are talking about, one of the grossest infringements of human rights that there is. We believe that, when it comes to making laws in this parliament, we need to make a crystal clear statement about what is acceptable and what is not. If we introduce the Modern Slavery Bill through this parliament, all we will be doing is introducing a requirement that big companies merely report on what it is they are doing to fight modern slavery. It is not that onerous a requirement. I don't want to downplay it: for really big companies, it is going to take some time and resources. But we are talking about slavery here and all we are requiring of these companies is that they make a statement. If big companies in this country cannot be bothered to look into their supply chains to do what we as a parliament are saying is their obligation as corporate citizens then they deserve to be punished. They deserve to have their names brought forward to the people of Australia so they know which companies are doing the right thing and which are not and they deserve a financial penalty. Part of the purpose of a modern slavery act is this parliament, for the first time, laying down in black-and-white letters what the obligations are of these companies to human rights in this country. I believe, and the Labor Party believes, that it is perfectly reasonable to expect companies to comply with Australian law and, if they don't comply with Australian law, just like if we didn't follow the law, penalties should be the result.


We also know from experience in the UK where a similar piece of legislation applies what happens when we don't have a penalties regime. What we found in the UK version of the modern slavery act is that only half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations that are required to report under the act actually produce a slavery and human trafficking statement. It's not very hard. All they need to do is look at their supply chains and provide a report as to what they've done and what they've seen, and yet half of the big companies in the UK cannot be bothered complying with this act. This is meant to be a legal obligation, and the Labor Party believe that it's perfectly reasonable for companies that are going to be subject to this act to be forced to comply with this law. So we are moving amendments to the bill to make sure that there are penalties as a consequence of failure to comply with it. We believe that's fair and reasonable given that we are talking about something that is so crucially important to everyone in this parliament, and that is tackling modern slavery.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (17:14):  The government does not support the proposed amendments. The feedback from the extensive consultation process undertaken for the introduction of this important legislation was that reputational risk and reward will drive compliance far more effectively than any penalty regime. The proposed regime would be complex, would be resource intensive and would likely require a new regulatory enforcement body. The proposed penalties wouldn't address the most likely reason for noncompliance over the first three years of the bill, being a lack of understanding of the new regime.


What the government is doing is establishing a business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs resourced with some $3.6 million to advise on the new requirements under the modern slavery act and to support those businesses in fulfilling the requirements of the act. Importantly, the legislation provides for a three-year review, and at that time there will be an opportunity to review the evidence about reporting rates. It's also notable that this issue of penalties was considered by the Senate committee recently, who took a range of submissions from civil society and business. Importantly, after considering the evidence, the Senate committee supported the government's approach on penalties. Rather than immediate penalties, the Senate committee recommended, similar to the government's position, that this issue be assessed after the three-year period has elapsed.


The member for Hotham talked about noncompliance rates in the UK, but it is important to understand that the UK application has a very, very broad application to UK businesses and quite a low threshold, which has driven up the noncompliance rate. Importantly, the UK government did not actually establish a government body to provide support for the introduction of this new regime. That's precisely what we've done with the business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs. We think there's an important distinction to be made there. For those reasons, the government does not support the amendments as proposed by the member for Hotham.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that amendments (3) to (6) moved by the member for Hotham be agreed to.



The SPEAKER:  The question now is that this bill be agreed to.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (15:54):  I have spoken already of the disgrace of modern slavery and how it is, sadly, still happening today. I welcome the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, although I do have some concerns that it still has some deficiencies. I note the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, has moved some amendments to correct those deficiencies. I support those amendments.


Although modern slavery takes many shapes, one form relies on us as consumers to continue its business model. This is the modern slavery that occurs in the supply chain of the goods that we buy. In almost everything we purchase—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, our household items and building materials—modern slavery may be present in those supply chains. It is almost impossible for us, as consumers, to know it is present. Anti-Slavery Australia told the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act that:


It is difficult to estimate the extent of practices of human trafficking and slavery in global supply chains. This is due to the clandestine nature of human trafficking and slavery, combined with the lack of transparency regarding supply chains at both the Australian and international level.


It is often very difficult to determine just where a product was produced and exactly how an element of a product has been made. For example, Ms Kate Nicholl, an independent supply chain consultant and lecturer at the University of Melbourne, gave the inquiry the example of a shirt made in Bangladesh that is sold by an Australian retailer:


The back of this shirt will say 'made in Bangladesh' but what that actually means is that this shirt was assembled in Bangladesh. The fabric, the cotton, the dye, if there is a zip in it, if there is a button in it—all of those materials that go into assembling that product in Bangladesh can be sourced from elsewhere, of which there is largely not a lot of transparency. It can be up to three tiers or four tiers in a supply chain, and that is where the workers are vulnerable to exploitation.


This bill will establish a modern slavery reporting requirement. It will require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make annual modern slavery statements to the responsible minister. The bill provides for mandatory reporting for Australian entities that have annual revenue of $100 million or more. Entities with lower annual revenue will not be compelled to make the statements but may do so voluntarily, and concerned consumers should consider asking them to so do. Many stakeholders have expressed concern that the threshold for mandatory reporting is too high and that entities with lower annual revenue should be compelled to make annual reports.


One of the deficiencies in this bill, which particularly troubles me, is the lack of any penalties for noncompliance with the act. A mandatory scheme with no penalty regime is like a tiger without teeth: it would soon starve to death. Why would a company report if there were no penalties for not reporting? There are some costs associated with reporting, so if your competitor chooses not to report, why would you? This is why Labor has moved an amendment to the bill to include penalties in the act. We cannot leave big business to police themselves. That has been made abundantly clear in evidence emerging from the banking royal commission, an inquiry that Prime Minister Morrison voted against 26 times and that he called a 'populist whinge'.


In the United Kingdom, where there are no penalties attached to reporting, only around 30 per cent of businesses who are supposed to be reporting actually report. That is fewer than one in three. That is not good enough. I would have hoped that our government would have learnt from that lesson from the United Kingdom and made sure that our modern slavery act actually had some teeth. Modern slavery in the supply chain is not something that is going to disappear overnight. It is going to take perseverance and a consistently strong response to those that continue to allow it to happen.


Australia is a trading nation. Our economic growth is underpinned by our ability to sell our goods and services overseas and to buy from the rest of the world too. It is important that we nurture our relationships with our trading partners, if for no other reason than for our own economic prosperity. But there is a secondary and equally important reason for nurturing these trading relationships: by promoting open and transparent relationships between our trading partners, we are better able to monitor and influence the transition to ethical supply chains in those countries. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, debated today, between the 11 signatory countries provides an opportunity to engage with our trading partners in a forum that is mutually advantageous. There are many clauses in the TPP that I would personally not have supported. However, if handled well, it should allow trust to develop between Australia and our trading partners.


Australia has just signed a trade agreement with Indonesia. The previous Labor government launched negotiations with Indonesia in 2012 because we recognise that our trading relationship with Indonesia has been extremely limited. Indonesia is the fourth-largest country in the world by population, and by 2050 it's projected to be the world's fourth-largest economy. It is one of our nearest geographical neighbours, yet it is currently our 13th-largest trading partner. Trade between Indonesia and Australia has actually gone backwards over the past five years. Tragically, other ties have followed suit. There are now fewer Australians speaking Bahasa than in the 1970s, and that is a disgrace. The contrast between two of our near neighbours could not be greater. More than 18,000 Australians export to New Zealand, and only about 2,000 export to Indonesia—one country, about five million people, and the other country, Indonesia, about 270 million. As one of our closest next-door neighbours, Indonesia barely gets a glance over the fence.


This does not bode well for building an open and transparent relationship. When it comes to making sure that our supply chains are free from modern slavery, such relationships are critically important. Ensuring that Australia has mutually beneficial trading relationships is crucial. Labor is conscious of the importance of these relationships. A Shorten Labor government, should it be elected, has committed to boosting transparency and analyses of trade agreements by improving the process of negotiation right from the start. A Shorten Labor government would also introduce laws that prohibit governments from signing trade agreements that waive labour market testing. That is important in the context of this bill to prevent modern slavery. The Liberals have eroded Australia's trust in trade by signing trade agreements that allow companies to bring in foreign workers without first checking whether there's an Australian who can do that job. Sadly, the Liberals have let labour market testing requirements be waived. Where there is already an Australian worker willing and able to do the job, there is no need to bring in workers from other countries—unless, obviously, an unscrupulous employer is intending to exploit the foreign worker and thus undermine local wages and conditions.


Sadly, migrants are most at risk of experiencing forms of modern slavery in Australia. In recent years authorities have discovered that men and women who have been trafficked here have been exploited in areas of work such as domestic work, hospitality, and agriculture and construction industries as well as in the sex industry. Submissions to the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia last year gave evidence of cases of modern slavery in areas including migrant workers in the agricultural construction and meat processing industries, backpackers in the agricultural industry, a domestic worker trafficked by a foreign diplomat, and private domestic workers. Limiting the ability to bring workers to Australia to those who can work in industries where there are not enough Australian workers able to fill those vacancies will go at least some way to eliminating this form of exploitation.


As I've said, I support this bill. It is more than time that we eradicated modern slavery everywhere we can. I spoke recently in this House about gender inequality. Modern slavery impacts on many more women than men. In 2014 over 70 per cent of the 17,752 victims of human trafficking were women or girls; 54 per cent of those victims suffered sexual exploitation. Australia is primarily a destination country for human trafficking. Women from Asia are trafficked here to be put to work in the sex work industry, amongst others. I have met with the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans on many occasions here in Parliament House, and I greatly admire the work ACRATH does. In the past 12 months alone they have assisted 28 trafficked women through their companionship program. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. Organisations including ACRATH have joined Labor in calling for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


Anti Slavery Australia has also recommended that the bill include the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner. They say that the commissioner should monitor, oversee and coordinate Australia's response to human trafficking and slavery; raise awareness and provide education and guidance on human trafficking and slavery; conduct inquiries of systemic abuses in Australia; and receive and investigate complaints from individuals and organisations that have a sufficient interest. Labor again, as we did earlier in the year, call on the government to establish an independent antislavery commissioner to assist victims. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government instead set up a business engagement unit to assist big business, when their resources would be much more efficient helping the victims of slavery. Labor continues to call on the Morrison government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner to help victims of modern slavery and stamp out this sickening crime. With that I welcome this bill.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:05):  I speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Hotham. The amendment has been moved because what the government is proposing with the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 doesn't go far enough and, unfortunately, ignores the recommendations of several inquiries, particularly around the appointment of an independent commissioner to look at these issues. Quite simply, slavery is shocking. That we as a nation aren't doing all we can to prevent slavery is saddening. As a country and as a parliament we must do more to prevent slavery, servitude, forced labour, deceptive recruiting, trafficking in persons, debt bondage, forced marriage and organ trafficking. Forced labour is barred everywhere in the world, yet tens of millions are subject to this appalling practice. The vast majority of modern slaves are working in factories, on construction sites, on fishing boats and in agricultural industries across the world. It's estimated that a quarter of such exploitation is happening outside of a victim's country of origin.


Australia is not immune to the scourge of slavery. The Global Slavery Index estimates that up to 15,000 people are struggling in conditions of modern slavery here in Australia. This includes forced labour, sexual exploitation of adults and children, and forced marriages. It's quite shocking and saddening. To most Australians it would be unbelievable that these sorts of things still occur in modern society, but there's no emotion involved for those who commit these most heinous of human rights abuses. Slavery is underpinned by a simple business model: reduce the cost of labour to something close to zero and reap the benefits of that toil. Slavers enjoy these fruits despite the bitterness of terror and tears. Both violence and threats of deception are the business strategy of the cold, calculating slaver. Psychological abuse, coercion and mental manipulation play a significant role in the recruitment and control of modern-day slaves, particularly in relationships where there is an imbalance of power between the slavers and those being exploited. Perpetrators often live and work with their victims, watching and managing their movements, taking them to work and collecting them. Victims of slavery don't travel alone. Their identity papers and passports are often taken away when they enter the country in which these actions take place.


Our fellow humans are forced by people into work they would not otherwise do, yet modern slavery's business model goes beyond the simple reduction of labour costs. Researchers at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom have highlighted that modern slavers are also deriving revenue from the sale of additional goods and services to workers under their control. This is the 'slaves as consumers' aspect of modern slavery. This can include accommodation, food and transport provided at monopoly prices to workers with no other choices. It's all upside for those doing the exploiting, but for the workers it's a continued spiral into deeper debt. This too can provide more opportunity for the slavers to turn the screws. In order to service the debt, workers may then secure funds from family members abroad or instant loan services which enable their exploiters to generate additional revenue. This business model of despair encourages slavers to deliberately take on more workers than they need for the work they expect to get done. This is the ugly face of the 'growth despite the costs' mantra.


It is also a reflection of the constant innovation in the business models of those doing the exploitation. That's why we talk of modern-day slavery. It is because of the innovative aspects of what's being done and the techniques that are being used to exploit people. But whether it was back in the 18th century or is in the modern 21st century, the principle is still the same—that is, the shocking and horrible abuse of human rights and exploitation of people for economic advantage. That may help to explain why there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other point in modern history.


The slavers are also increasingly using social media, particularly to recruit migrant labourers. They use platforms such as Facebook to promise unrealistically high pay and share only a very general description of the work involved, and, of course, there's very little information on workers' rights, recruitment fees or deceptive recruitment. The challenge is that it can be difficult to identify exploitative recruitment online. Detailed conversations with dodgy employers are usually taking place in private and illegal activity often happens alongside what seems like and constitutes legal behaviour. The slavers often use aggressive, credible threats to create anxiety, despair and humiliation to ensure compliant behaviour. This non-physical type of control means that modern slavery is easy to conceal. It's harder to see. It's encouraging to see that some of organisations, like Facebook, are working with the United Nations and grassroots organisations to raise awareness of human smuggling, trafficking and forced labour.


It is clear that businesses here in Australia can also play a major role in either facilitating modern day slavery or helping to eradicate it. Companies can be culpable by driving down supplier prices or demanding ever-quicker production. These actions can play a big role in pushing suppliers to pursue cheap labour solutions and illicit subcontracting. A supply chain shouldn't be based on workers shackled in chains. Slavery is indeed a weak link in corporate supply chains. Forced labour was once a niche human rights matter for many large companies but today it needs to be at the forefront of corporate concerns.


One year ago, Labor committed to modern slavery legislation with penalties and, importantly, an independent anti-slavery commissioner. Our announcement was warmly greeted by business, civil society and unions and we're deeply disappointed that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have put forward a modern slavery bill without those penalties and have chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent anti-slavery commissioner. The absence of penalties in this bill is also quite baffling. We cannot leave it to big business to police themselves on slavery. There have to be penalties for the serious breaches of human rights that we have seen constituting modern slavery. We can't leave it to big business simply to police themselves on this one. Evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the United Kingdom, where there is a similar regime without penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported still hovers at around 30 per cent of those that supposedly have an obligation to do so.


Civil society groups have also argued the need for penalties for companies that breach the Modern Slavery Act. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry put in their submissions that this was a necessary must-have in any legislation when it came to modern slavery legislation. Those organisations include the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam. They've all called for penalties to be included in this bill. That's why Labor, despite supporting this bill, will continue our fight to ensure that we get a decent set of provisions that do provide an active deterrent to slavery in this country and, importantly, provide deterrent penalties for those who breach their human rights obligations and who undertake slavery in the modern context. I don't think there would be one Australian who would believe that it would be acceptable to exploit people and abuse their human rights in this manner. If that is the case, then there should be stiff penalties for those who do and there should be an independent body, in the form of an independent anti-slavery commissioner, that has oversight and makes sure that the laws and penalties are enforced.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-09-17,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:15):  Before coming to this place, I had the immense privilege of working as a lawyer representing a number of low-paid workers and their unions across this country. One sector in particular that we spent a lot of time on was in the textile and clothing sector. Many people hear reports about sweatshops and Third World conditions, and what they probably don't realise is that, in many cases here in our backyards, we have people working on a similar basis. The people who are making clothes might be getting paid as little as $3 or $4 an hour in Australia, in flats in Richmond in my electorate or out in Springvale or elsewhere around the country, and those are clothes that go on to sell for a few hundred dollars. They're often some big brand names and they're often sold right here in Australia. 


The companies who sell those clothes for enormous profit, paying very, very low wages—clothes usually made by older women, but not exclusively, who speak a language other than English as their first language—get away with this through things called contracting chains. The companies at the top, big brand names, will say to a middle company, 'We want you to make us some clothes.' Of course, you've got to abide by all the relevant legal requirements, but they then turn a blind eye to whether those things actually happen or not. The companies in the middle go off and then may, in turn, contract someone else. There could be two or three steps before you actually get to the worker at the end. The worker at the end, who will be sewing the brand name onto the garment, may have no legal relationship with that label. There are two or three intermediary steps—sometimes four or five—in between that allow the big company at the top to wash its hands of what's happening but that result in the person down the bottom working for below award wages and conditions and often under a significant threat. The companies in the middle say to them: 'You can complain if you like. You can try and organise or try and demand the basic things that you're entitled to under the law, but, if you do that, we'll just go and get someone else to do the work.' So, as a result, you end up in an extraordinarily vulnerable position and you will get paid below award wages. That happens here in Australia. 


The Textile Clothing and Footwear Union has done enormous work not only in organising those people and taking those companies to court but also in changing the law, saying: 'No. If you're sitting at the top of the chain making a lot of money out of this, you bear some responsibility. There will now be the ability to take you to court if it turns out that the person who's doing the work is doing it in conditions that Australia wouldn't agree with.' That is a good principle. What we know is that that same system that leads to exploitation here in Australia applies now across the whole world, because, of course, capital is quite mobile and is able to go and engage in contracts overseas. And, in many instances, where wages are much lower even than you can get away with paying under those extraordinary arrangements I've just spoken about in Australia, they will go and do it. 


We also know that a problem in Australia that is an especially big problem overseas is that many people work in what could only be described as slave-like conditions. That touches Australia very, very deeply. For example, in my electorate we have a very large representation from the Eritrean community. There have been some significant changes in Eritrea and Ethiopia during the course of this year, and a lot of people are looking at that with great hope and hoping that some of those changes, including around conscription but also around border disputes, will lead to some long-lasting peace and an improvement in human rights in the region. People have such hope because, in the many years before that, some horrific stories have come out of these regions. What is said systematically is that people are forced into slave labour and forced labour arrangements.


This happens when you've got an extraordinarily vulnerable population where you have wars. In many instances, as we are seeing famines and droughts sweeping through the region, you have people desperate for the basic freedoms that we would take for granted. They are forced into a position where they're told: 'Well, not only don't you have a government against which you can assert basic human rights but also we are now going to come and make you work, sometimes'—this was previously alleged, and Amnesty International and the UN have said this—'with the government's support. We're going to put you into a form of forced labour.' The reason that's important for Australia is that many Australian mining companies operate in Africa, particularly in some of those Horn of Africa countries and right across the region.


Just as it's no longer acceptable for companies in the clothing industry to say, 'You might be sewing the label onto our clothes, but we have no legal relationship with you, so we're going to turn a blind eye,' now it's no longer defensible, nor should it be legally acceptable, for Australian companies, including Australian mining companies, to have interests in the Africa region and to turn a blind eye to whether or not forced labour is being used to dig up their resources and have them shipped across to Australia. We've seen terrible examples of companies from Australia going abroad to try and defend governments' abuses of human rights overseas. In Canada, Canadian mining companies have actually found themselves taken to court because of claims of forced labour in Africa. It's only a matter of time before it happens in Australia as well. You would think, in light of knowing what we know about slavery in Australia, slavery around the world and the potential exposure of Australian companies, the government might seize that opportunity to come here with a bill that would actually do something and have a significant chance of winding it back.


It is good that we are debating a modern slavery bill in this parliament. That is a good thing. But, just as we needed laws that held large companies like Nike and Adidas to account and enabled them to be taken to court, we need laws in this country that have teeth. To pass modern slavery legislation but then outsource effective compliance of that to the very same people that this is meant to be regulating raises the question about whether the bill is going to work at all. That is why during the course of the inquiry into this matter and elsewhere the Greens, others and the opposition have said, 'You really need an independent commissioner to be able to have oversight over this, because otherwise how can you be assured that anything is going to change?' We have also heard the likes of the Law Council front up and say: 'Why are there no penalties in this bill? How is it that this bill seeks to impose obligations on people, yet there is no penalty if they breach them?' I will come back to this in a minute.


There are a number of other things that need to be changed in this bill. During the course of the Senate inquiry, we made the point that, at a minimum, this act should be reviewed on a regular and ongoing three-yearly basis by a statutory antislavery commissioner. We think that the first of those reviews, if there were to be an antislavery commissioner, should consider lower thresholds, the targeting of businesses in high-risk industries regardless of annual turnover, appropriate and commensurate resourcing of the commission and penalties for noncompliance. That has to be considered soon.


We also call on the government to amend this bill to include a public register of compliance for entities over the reportable threshold and a requirement in the act that entities over the reportable threshold comply with the act to be eligible for tender for government contracts, because we know that government, to the extent that it holds the purse strings, has the ability to drive very significant change. What should also be considered—it's not in this bill but it needs to be considered—are the needs, scope and application of a national victim support and compensation scheme as the next tranche of modern slavery legislation in Australia.


All of those things would be useful improvements to the bill, and I expect that the bill will pass in some form, and that will be good. But we've got an opportunity to make it better. And as we're making it better, the simple test we should apply is: is this bill actually going to drive change? I think everyone is agreed now on the need to take measures to stamp out modern slavery, but the question's got to be not whether we're debating a bill that's simply got 'modern slavery' in the title but whether we're going to bring about change in the sector.


As I've said, we've heard some very distressing examples of Australian companies—and the Human Rights Law Centre has shone the spotlight on this—being prepared to stand next to regimes whose human rights records would be questionable at best in countries where forced labour is going on and not only not say anything about it but actually throw their weight behind the current arrangements. That is a grave concern. And as Australian interests expand—mining interests in Africa in particular—we are going to need some independent oversight of this to ensure that it has teeth, because those businesses are operating a long way away. They might be based in Australia and headquartered in Australia, but the operations take place a long way away. It is very difficult, simply from behind a desk, to monitor that. And I would suggest that it is nonsensical to simply say, 'Well, we're going to rely on self-reporting' to say that there are no problems, because we've seen that that hasn't worked so far. There is very much a need for someone with teeth to be able to go in and investigate what is happening and whether or not, under the name of Australian companies, forced labour is taking place elsewhere.


I reiterate that in looking at what's happening in Eritrea and Ethiopia a lot of people are hoping that recent changes might ameliorate some of that, but that's happening independent of what Australia can do. That's no excuse for Australia not to do everything that we possibly can to ensure that those supply chains do not allow companies to turn a blind eye to what is happening. As this bill progresses through the Senate, Senator Nick McKim will be making further comments about the Greens position with respect to this bill. But I'll say now that I sincerely hope that we don't miss this opportunity, where attention is focused on modern slavery—something that is very real, and greater than many people think—to actually put in place laws that have teeth and that will drive real change. It would be an extraordinary pity if the government simply said that they're concerned only about a facade of action, when we could be doing a bit better than what the government has proposed.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:27):  Slavery is a very serious problem that many Australians would imagine has decreased in scope over the last years or decades or centuries. But in fact it's estimated that over 40 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery—a higher number of people trapped in slavery today than at any other time in human history, and two-thirds of those people are in our region. Slavery is supported by supply chains of products and services that many of us use every day. We know that modern slavery occurs in many forms—wage theft, dangerous and unpaid work, abuse, imprisonment and deprivation. It's vulnerable people, including foreign and seasonal workers, students, casualised and marginalised workers, and people with social, economic, language and cultural barriers, who are most at risk, and we know that many of these are women.


Labor's position on this is clear: we will not tolerate the exploitation of these workers and the human rights abuses that go along with this exploitation. Modern slavery is often obscured by those who profit from it. As a society, we won't be able to end it unless we have laws dedicated to preventing it and to stopping it and resources to support that legislation. Last year, after lengthy consultation with advocates, activists and other stakeholders, Labor announced a modern slavery policy. I want to take a moment to recognise the extraordinary work of the shadow minister for justice, Clare O'Neil, in developing Labor's position. Clare really did terrific work in this area. Business, civil society and the union movement have all helped inform Labor's policy. Labor is committed to establishing a modern slavery act to make supply chains transparent, to apply penalties for noncompliance and to establish a statutory, independent antislavery commissioner. We called on the government to match our commitment.


Of course we support this legislation, but, sadly, this legislation does not match the commitments that Labor has made in this area. After significant pressure, the government brought forward this bill. The bill, sadly, does not adequately address all of the advice and information that Labor took into account when we developed our approach in this area. Most importantly, the bill doesn't provide for penalties for companies that breach the provisions within the bill, and the government has proposed a watered-down business engagement unit instead of establishing an independent antislavery commissioner. Those weaknesses in this bill are disappointing. The government has shown time and again that it is too weak to tackle important issues like this, especially when it comes to regulating the businesses that are profiting from modern slavery. We can and must do better.


Labor has moved amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act and we're also calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. Labor acknowledges the genuine passion that many in the business community have shown for this issue and the broad commitment within the Australian community to work against slavery. But where companies don't comply with the bill in its current form there should be penalties attached. The proposed business engagement unit is toothless and it has no enforcement powers. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU, have joined Labor in calling for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


Modern slavery is often difficult for authorities to detect, investigate and prosecute. There are also significant gaps in the support services for victims of modern slavery. An independent antislavery commissioner would help fill those gaps, firstly, by working with victims of slavery to receive inquiries and complaints. Secondly, it would assist businesses in building best practice to protect their supply chains. Thirdly, it would work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Lastly, it would allow us to enhance our global efforts to fight slavery, including by working with other countries and with international organisations that are working to end slavery.


Labor is very concerned that the bill also includes forced marriage as one of the forms of exploitation that business would report on. Forced marriage is one of the most serious forms of exploitation, human being of human being. Forced marriage is often accompanied by sexual abuse for extended periods of time, isolation and the taking of victims overseas against their will. It is extremely serious. But to include it in this bill might have unintended consequences—a view expressed by a number of organisations that are active in this area—including potentially driving forced marriage further underground. Our view is based on advice from advocates who work every day on preventing forced marriage and assisting people who are at risk of forced marriage. Australia's current approach to forced marriage isn't working. Under the Turnbull government there was not one successful prosecution of forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government financial support. So earlier this year, to deal specifically with forced marriage, Labor committed to establishing a regime of force marriage protection orders, increasing funding for civil society organisations, establishing a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to support services and government agencies, and providing assistance for Australians who have been taken overseas to be married against their will.


We are also committed to removing the cooperation requirement. Currently victims of forced marriage who want to access government funded support have to agree to cooperate with law enforcement. You can imagine how difficult it becomes when you're talking about a young person potentially having to give evidence against their parents or other family members. Having to testify against their own family in order to access critical support might actually prevent a person making a complaint in the first place or accessing support. We don't believe that's adequate. The government recently announced a limited trial to improve these support services, but that trial doesn't go nearly far enough. We believe that the government should match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment, not risk driving this practice further underground.


I acknowledged the work by Clare O'Neil, the shadow minister for justice, on modern slavery, and I should also acknowledge her work in the area of forced marriage. It really has been first rate, but, of course, there are many people in the Australian community who've been working on these issues for many years. I'd particularly like to acknowledge Dr Jennifer Byrne and her team at Anti-Slavery Australia and the many civil society and faith based organisations that are active in this area, including the Uniting Church; the Salvation Army; members of the Australian Freedom Network; STOP THE TRAFFIK; Fiona McLeod SC and Morry Bailes from the Law Council of Australia; the Walk Free Foundation, particularly Andrew Forrest and his family, who have been very active in this antislavery area; and my friend and former colleague former Senator Chris Evans. The Australian Council of Trade Unions and individual unions have also been extraordinary in their fight against the extreme exploitation of workers in industries as diverse as textiles, clothing and footwear; agriculture; transport; domestic; child care; and construction—particular parts of the construction industry have been very much at risk of slave-like conditions for some of the workers. So I acknowledge the very fine contribution of these organisations over many years.


I just want to finish by speaking a little bit about Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans. ACRATH have really done extraordinary work in this area of modern slavery and also in the area of trafficking of people. They have been fierce and persistent advocates for the victims of trafficking. As well as their advocacy work, they provide services that have been a lifeline to trafficked individuals in Australia and in our region. ACRATH has been instrumental in shining a light on the slavery that exists today, including the fact that Australia is a destination for trafficked people. ACRATH gives people who have been trafficked hope, and it gives them a voice.


Today, I want to particularly acknowledge the work that ACRATH has done on forced marriage. ACRATH has produced materials for use in the school curriculum to improve awareness of the practice of forced marriage in Australia and to make sure that all students know that forced marriage is illegal and know where they can turn if they believe they or a friend or someone they know is at risk of forced marriage. These materials were piloted in schools across three Australian states—South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. Evaluation of the pilot shows that the materials were very effective. The program evaluation report says, 'Schools provide the potential for tens of thousands of young people to be educated about human rights and the way that the practice of forced marriage violates these rights.' The program empowers young people to advocate for their own rights and for the rights of their peers. The funding for this was absolutely minuscule: $60,000 was what they needed to run this program. Unfortunately, ACRATH now have uncertainty about whether they'll be able to continue this work, because there is no certainty about their ongoing funding. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the government to make sure that programs like this can be given a certain future and that organisations like ACRATH are properly supported to continue and to expand their work to eliminate trafficking in all its forms, including forced marriage.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (16:40):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate this week on this important bill. We're united on both sides of this House in our shared commitment to combating modern slavery, and I'd like to thank the many people who have contributed not just in this debate but in the committee which considered this matter at great length, chaired so well by the member for Dunkley. I thank him and all of his colleagues on the committee.


The Modern Slavery Bill 2018 is a vital milestone in our response to this crime. It will shine a light into the dark corners of global supply chains and transform the way businesses respond to modern slavery. Today we've heard a range of suggestions in relation to potential amendments to this bill, including removing forced marriage from the definition of modern slavery; introducing a punitive penalty regime; requiring annual reporting to parliament, including a list of all reporting entities; and establishing an antislavery commissioner. The government is confident that the bill is appropriate for the Australian context in its current form and does not require amendment in the House. The government has carefully crafted this bill through a 10-month consultation process to ensure that it is practical, sensible and effective, and those consultations were indeed extensive. There were meetings with over 170 business and civil society experts across 16 roundtable meetings, as well as over 70 direct meetings. During those extensive consultations, the government worked closely with business and civil society to consider the issues of relevance to this bill. We also thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its inquiry into the bill, and the government is carefully considering the five recommendations made by that Senate committee.


In conclusion, the importance of this bill must not be understated. This is a matter of great importance. The business community and broader civil society both support government taking action on this issue, and this bill will be a powerful catalyst for change. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hotham has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment, as moved by the member for Hotham, be agreed to.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (19:30):  The Electoral Commission has renamed my seat from Wakefield to Spence, and it's caused me to reflect on the 11 years I've spent representing what has been a unique seat by South Australian standards. It is not unique in the history of the Federation, of course—there are many seats that have country, regional and urban or peri-urban areas in the Commonwealth—but for South Australia it has been quite a unique experience. I thought I might just reflect on that fact and what an honour it has been for the last 11 years to represent the seat of Wakefield. 


Wakefield was, of course, a rural seat when I grew up in Kapunda. I went to high school there. Wakefield was one of the safest Liberal seats in the country, certainly in South Australia. It stretched from Gawler up through the Yorke Peninsula and the Riverland. In 2004, it was changed fundamentally because of the abolition of Bonython and really created the seat that I've represented, which stretched from the Brahma Lodge Hotel to the Clare and Gilbert valleys, across to the Barossa Valley and the coast, up to Port Wakefield. It's been a unique experience to represent that seat through pretty harrowing experiences like the Pinery fire or the floods at Stockport. 


There are a number of people I've got to thank for their support over those years: Mayor Bill O'Brien, the Light Regional Council; Mayor Tony Flaherty, the Adelaide Plains Council; Marcus Strudwicke, who has also been a mayor of the Adelaide Plains Council; Joe and Jasmin Danielle; Margaret Williams of Williamstown; Midge Wallace; the late John Fitzgerald; Susan Cunningham and Simon Pringle; Peter Anderson from Clare; Tony Bell of Hamley Bridge; Mark Nappa of Hamley Bridge; Guy Ballantyne, who was in Clare and now is in the city; Lindsay Simmons, who is up in the Clare and Gilbert valleys; Rita Roy and Doug Handley; Sue and Ron Wurst, who are great citizens of the Clare Valley; David Newsome of Balaklava; Louise Drummond; Pat Thompson, who is a great historian from the town of Dublin; Caroline Cordon, who is a wonderful poet; Ross Voigt from my home town of Kapunda; and of course, my neighbours at Greenock until recently, Tim and Kylie, and the Kalleske family—I thank them for being very good neighbours in the country, which is an important thing. I'd like to thank Andrew and Les of the Plains Producer; Tony Robinson from The Leader; the crew at the Northern Argus; and of course the crew at the Barossa Herald. 


All these individuals and the rural communities and rural towns they represent have been a big part of my life for the last 11 years. I don't think I'll miss the long drives in the country between appointments or between functions. They do give you time to reflect, which can be a dangerous thing for a politician! I do think though that I will get back to the Clare Valley, I do think I will get back to the Adelaide Plains and I do think I'll get back to the Barossa, despite them being removed from my electorate, because they are truly wonderful communities; they're truly wonderful country towns. I can hear my colleague the shadow Treasurer talking about the Barossa Valley. I'm sure he'll visit the Barossa Valley. I'm sure members of this House will have cause to go there. I will miss the Barossa Valley, particularly the little town of Grennock. It is a truly lovely place, a truly beautiful place, particularly in the winter, and in the summer. It is just one of those beautiful parts of South Australia. It's been a wonderful opportunity to represent those people. 


The seat of Spence is a different seat. It's an urban seat. It has its own challenges and, of course, it will have its own unique character. I look forward, if I'm so privileged to be elected as the member for Spence, to serving those communities. But I will miss the country areas and I will miss the Barossa Valley. I will miss the truly unique experience that it was to be the member for Wakefield.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (10:30):  I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the first assisted-passage migrants from Turkey to Sydney and Melbourne. Their arrival, in 1968, was the product of a groundbreaking agreement signed on 5 October 1967 by the Turkish and Australian governments, thus ending the White Australia policy. This anniversary marks a successful migration story in which Turkish migrants have gone on to become active citizens of Australia participating in all aspects of Australian civil society while maintaining their identity, language and culture. I want to use this anniversary as an opportunity to pay tribute to the large Turkish-speaking community in the electorate of Calwell and thank them for the significant contribution they have made to the community and to so many different professions and industries, such as business, sport, politics and the arts. In addition, 2018 is being celebrated by the Turkish Cypriot community as the 70th anniversary of the arrival in Australia of Cypriot migrants.


To mark this auspicious occasion, the Moreland Turkish Association, together with other community organisations, has developed a program of events. The activities kicked off this weekend with a soccer game on Saturday and the Turkish Sofra Festival yesterday. The festival, held at the Immigration Museum, also marked the opening of the Kimlik exhibition, which celebrates and documents the contribution of the Turkish community to Australian life while preserving many valuable memories and stories of those first arrivals—stories that are part of our contemporary Australian migration history. The program of events will include festivals, exhibitions, seminars and conferences, concerts and sporting activities. A program such as this not just is for the Turkish community but provides an opportunity to build relationships with the broader multicultural Australian community.


While on the subject of writing our stories, I note I had the pleasure of attending the official launch of the Margaret Egan Young Writers Award at the Hume Global Learning Centre in Broadmeadows last Friday. Sponsored by the author of the book Back to Broady, Caroline van de Pol, and supported by the Hume City Council and Writers Victoria, the award is themed 'memoirs of Broadmeadows' and encourages all students of Broadmeadows to write about their experiences and understanding of their wonderfully diverse suburb. The winner will receive financial and mentoring support as well as the honour of being named the first Margaret Egan Young Writers Award recipient.


Launching the award along with Caroline was fellow writer and former Broadmeadows neighbour Nick Gleeson, author of the book The Many Ways of Seeing. The two shared their memories of growing up in Broadmeadows in the hope that they would inspire the next generation of young writers. One such writer is Penola Catholic College student Marco, who impressed me so much on the day with his understanding of the written form, especially the way he uses books as a means to understand and make sense of the world around him. Writing is such an important tool in expressing one's thoughts and feelings and also in describing experiences of places and people.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (11:01):  I move:


That this House


(1) notes that:


   (a) 2019 marks the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Greta Army Camp and the 70th anniversary of its transition to a migrant training and reception centre—Greta Migrant Camp;


   (b) around 60,000 soldiers of the Second Australian Imperial Force trained at the Camp between 1939 and 1945;


   (c) more than 100,000 new arrivals passed through the Greta Migrant Camp between 1949 and 1960;


   (d) the army training centre played a significant role in Australia's outstanding contribution to the Second World War;


   (e) the Greta Migrant Camp played a major role in delivering on the objectives and commitments of the Government's humanitarian and nation building programs; and


   (f) the Hunter region and Australia more generally remain enriched by the contribution of those who spent time living at the Greta Migrant Camp; and


(2) calls on the Government to ensure the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Greta Army Camp and the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Greta Migrant Camp are appropriately commemorated and celebrated anniversaries.


The year 2019 marks the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Greta Army Camp in the Hunter electorate. It also marks the 70th anniversary of its transformation into a migrant camp. Throughout the course of World War II, up to 60,000 soldiers of the 2nd AIF trained in Greta. It was one of the Army's largest camps. That means that Greta played a significant role in the war effort and its history is certainly worth commemorating. Then, between 1949 and 1960, 100,000 new arrivals passed through the former Army barracks. Most were fleeing war-torn Second World War and post-Second World War Europe. They came originally from Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and various Baltic states. Later, under a broader migration program, people from Italy, Greece, Macedonia, Russia and many other countries made the camp their temporary home. In all, people in the camp represented some 18 nationalities. Originally, the camp's residents were transferred from other Australian camps, but later they came directly. On 19 August 1949, more than a thousand displaced persons arrived in Newcastle Harbour on the Fairsea and were transferred to Greta by rail. 


Our post-World War II migration program shaped modern Australia, and Greta played a big part in our national development. The camp's residents learned both English and our way of life while in the camp. Happily, we learned much from them too. We embraced much of their culture and, of course, their food. We are a richer country for the experience. Sadly, a visit to the site of the camp provides no hint of its national significance. Those with family links to the camp who make a pilgrimage to their place of heritage will find no marking on the site, let alone a sign signifying its previous national significance. We are all indebted to former Newcastle Herald journalist Alek Schulha, who wants this changed. Alek was born in the camp to Yugoslav and Ukrainian parents. They were the first couple to be married in the camp's Orthodox church, and Alek was christened there. Alek is completing a book on the history of the camp and has interviewed more than 100 people with direct connections and links with the former camp. The book will be launched next year to coincide with the anniversary.


Our local communities remain enriched by the ongoing presence of many of the new arrivals, their children and their grandchildren. In addition to commemorating and celebrating the 70th anniversary, we hope to ensure that people who have an affinity with the former camp have somewhere and something prominent to visit. We must facilitate their pilgrimage and keep the memories and histories alive.


In the main street of Greta there is a small monument, which is respected and appreciated. I think next year would be a good time to enlarge that monument, to make it more visible to passing visitors. I think the camp could be a driver of significant tourism for the town as more and more people come to understand the local area's significance in our history.


I also think that Alek Schulha is right: those seeking to make the pilgrimage would easily drive past the site. These are the great-grandchildren of the camp's original residents and it is a difficult place to find on a lonely road. We do need to help them establish and find the site. One of the challenges is that it's on private land and we don't know what the land's future holds. This will largely be a matter for the council, and I'm reaching out to the council to help us work through these issues. Of course, the roadside verge—or the area between the road and the property—might be an opportunity, but, certainly, we need to mark that site so that people can find it easily.


The other key objective of my motion is to ask the national government here in Canberra to do all it can to ensure that these two very important anniversaries next year are appropriately and properly commemorated and celebrated.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (11:06):  I rise today to second the member for Hunter's motion to commemorate the anniversaries of the establishment of the Greta Army Camp in 1939 and the Greta Migrant Camp in 1949.


Driving towards Greta in New South Wales along Camp Road you would be forgiven for not knowing that in 1949 the Greta Migrant Camp was the biggest of its kind, housing 100,000 refugees. June 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the first draft of migrants to arrive—refugees escaping war-torn Europe. Today there is little or no trace on the site of the Greta Migrant camp and the lives of those refugee families who stayed until changes to the Migration Act of 1955 saw the camp finally dissolve in 1960.


At one point in time there were 19 different nationalities living in cramped quarters, sharing accommodation and facilities. People came from the Ukraine, Slovenia, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Italy, Austria and Hungary, with many arriving at the camp in the middle of summer. Their first sight of the shining nissen huts lined up in the field, surrounded by the Australian bush, must have come as such a shock, especially on a 40-degree-plus day. Many people thought they would die from the heat, and, of course, a corrugated iron hut was not ideal in Australia's bush conditions. However, the camp, as happens in adversity, over time became a truly thriving community. Its residents adapted to Australia's heat and started to rebuild their lives. Migrants arriving in Greta brought with them skills and resilience. Over time they got jobs, learned the language and even started businesses. Their families grew up and were educated, and while some of them moved away many stayed to build their lives in Greta and the Hunter region.


Living in the camp was not a free ride, and families were expected to pay rent. Some men were lucky and secured work at BHP in Newcastle. Most men, however, travelled to work on the Snowy Mountains Scheme and in sugarcane fields in Queensland. They travelled to wherever they could find secure work, something many workers today can relate to if they are fly in, fly out workers. Perhaps these were among our first FIFOs in Australia. Sunday afternoons would see family groups head to the Greta Railway Station to farewell loved ones who they may not see for months at a time.


Elizabeth Lodo, now Liz Matt, was three years old when her family travelled from Germany and arrived in Australia in 1950. But their journey was far from over. After moving from camps in Bathurst to Parkes and then Cowra, Liz and her family finally arrived in Greta in 1952 when Liz was just five years old. Liz remembers the early days as being very hard, but she also has many fond memories of that camp. Her school years were fantastic, because of a woman called Mrs Rose.


Mrs Rose, of course, had no experience teaching children who spoke little or no English and who came from such diverse backgrounds, and every day she'd ask the children a question. Gradually, their English improved and with that their understanding of the Australian way of life. Mrs Rose recalls those years as the best of her teaching career.


When the camp closed in 1960, Liz's family moved towards the township of Greta, a town that I share with the member for Hunter. Orient Street in Greta is in fact our boundary. Sadly, Liz's father, Joseph, passed away shortly after moving from the camp to Greta, leaving Maria, his wife, to raise their large family alone. As was a reflection of the time, the community rallied behind the Matt family and helped them through those very tough years. Liz's mother, Maria, lived in Greta until she passed away at the age of 93. Liz and her family still call Greta home.


There is a part of the camp's history that many people might not know about. The Greta Army Camp was initially the site of one Australia's largest army camps and provided a great deal of training during the Second World War. It was one of several initially built for the concentration and training of the 6th Division of the AIF, because existing military facilities were already occupied by militia units. The first unit to move into the camp was the 2/11th Battalion, who arrived on 15 December 1939, and they were later joined by the 2/10th Battalion. Eventually the facilities were improved.


When it was a migrant camp, it was known as 'Chocolate City' and 'Silver City' because of the brown-coloured weatherboard buildings and the Nissen huts. Those Nissen huts can still be found in my home town of Kurri Kurri as you drive around, although, thankfully, many have been renovated.


It is so important that we mark this anniversary. Australia prides itself on its multicultural background, and Greta can be proud of what it's contributed.

In the election before that they were going to build dams. And there are no dams built. We can't go to three elections hoping they're going to build dams! As Peta Credlin said on national television, there have been $5,000 million sitting there for six years to build dams, and nothing has been built. And nothing is going to get built between now and the next election—except for three shovel-ready projects in northern Australia. Hughenden is ready to go. The Prime Minister could go in there with a hard hat on and get the dozers working tomorrow, if he said, 'Go.' The NAIF people have said: 'Three problems: process, proponent, profitability.'

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (16:56):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that National Police Remembrance Day will be observed on 28 September;


(2) acknowledges the significant role police officers across Australia play in our local communities and the great deal of risk and sacrifice that comes with their duty;


(3) honours the lives and memories of those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the course of their duty, and tragically this year we specifically honour Constable Dennis Green of the Western Australian Police Force, who was killed during pursuit training in West Toodyay;


(4) pays tribute to the families and friends of police officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout our nation's history;


(5) commends the good work of Police Legacy, who look after the loved ones of police officers that have fallen; and


(6) reaffirms its support for the nation's police officers and honours their courage, commitment and dedication to ensuring the peace and safety of our communities.


'A hero can be someone who gave up his or her life so that someone else can live. This definition is a pure example of my dad. To the world you may be one person, but to our family you were the world.' That is a statement from Emma, the daughter of Senior Constable Brett Forte, a Queensland Police officer who was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty last year. It puts in perspective the inherent dangers of everyday policing and the significant toll it takes on the families of police officers.


This year, National Police Remembrance Day will be observed on 28 September. This is one of the most significant days on the national police calendar. As a nation, we pause on this day to remember the police officers who lost their lives in the execution of their duty, and we honour the courage, commitment and dedication of all police members who have sworn to protect our community. 


Policing comes with a high degree of risk and with dangers that, thankfully, most of us will never have to encounter. It truly takes a special type of person and a special type of courage to wear the police uniform; we are forever indebted to those fine men and women who have chosen to do so. We recognise their commitment to ensuring the peace and security of our communities, a duty which should never be taken for granted. Our safety and that of our families as well as the security of our homes, businesses and, indeed, our democracy are all reliant on law enforcement, a task which primarily falls to our police.


This year's service will also see the total number of police officers listed on the National Police Memorial regrettably rise once again. This year we recognise the tragic loss of First Class Senior Constable Dennis Michael Green of the Western Australia Police Force. Constable Green was killed in a motorcycle crash, during pursuit training in West Toodyay. Constable Green was a highly respected member of his community and a decorated former soldier in the British Army, having served 20 years with the Royal Engineers. For the last seven years he had been a police officer of the Western Australia Police Force. 


The death of Constable Green highlights the inherent danger involved in police work—not knowing what they are likely to encounter every time they commence their shift. In recognition of his service in the Western Australia Police Force Constable Green has been posthumously awarded the National Police Service Medal, the Western Australia Police Star and the Western Australia Police Medal. Constable Green, tragically, leaves behind a wife, Michelle, and two sons, James and Ryan, who I met on the weekend at the National Police Memorial in Canberra. 


National Police Remembrance Day is, therefore, also a time for all of us to reflect on the loved ones who have been left behind and the families and friends whose lives have been affected forever. While we mourn them, we thank and honour all police officers and their families, whose unconditional support allows these fine men and women to serve our community. We owe it to the fallen to look after their families, which is why the work of Police Legacy is of particular importance and deserving of our full support. In this regard, I'm happy to say I attended again the annual police Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance on the weekend, raising much needed funds to assist in this great effort of Police Legacy. 


Tragically, this year we also lost a distinguished Victorian police officer, Detective Senior Sergeant Victor Kostiuk, who was killed while participating in this charity ride. He was riding with his son to support fallen police colleagues. I pay tribute to his distinguished and long career in the Victorian police force, and I will have more to say about him at another time. 


To Constable Green, to all those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and to all our past and current members of our respective police forces, we honour you and we profoundly thank you for your service. Above all, be comforted in the knowledge that you have made a difference for the better in our communities.

(2) acknowledges the significant role police officers across Australia play in our local communities and the great deal of risk and sacrifice that comes with their duty;


(3) honours the lives and memories of those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the course of their duty, and tragically this year we specifically honour Constable Dennis Green of the Western Australian Police Force, who was killed during pursuit training in West Toodyay;


 (4) pays tribute to the families and friends of police officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout our nation's history;


(5) commends the good work of Police Legacy, who look after the loved ones of police officers that have fallen; and


(6) reaffirms its support for the nation's police officers and honours their courage, commitment and dedication to ensuring the peace and safety of our communities.


Of all the occupations in our society today, the occupation of police officer is one where, when people  sign on to start their shift, they do not know what will happen or the personal risks that they will face. They may have to go to a car accident where there has been a fatality. They may have to make an arrest of someone who has committed an assault. They may have to turn up to a violent domestic dispute. They may have to apprehend armed robbers. Most concerning of all is the trend that we have seen over recent years: the blue uniform that our police officers wear puts them at risk because we have segments of the Australian community who, unfortunately, see that blue uniform as a target. That is what every police officer around the nation faces today.


We need in our society, I believe, to have a greater respect for police officers. Too often we see people using the word 'cops' to refer to police officers. Often those who denigrate police officers are the very first ones to call for their help when they are in trouble. So I commend the member for Fowler for moving this motion today. We thank every police officer in our nation. We thank them for their bravery. We thank them for their determination. We thank them for their honourable conduct. We send, from this parliament, our love, our support and our encouragement.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (17:17):  I rise to support this motion. 'To serve and protect'—that's why National Police Remembrance Day is such a significant day for us. In the Northern Territory, like in other jurisdictions around the country, we stop to remember those members—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 
17:18
 to 
17:28





Mr GOSLING:
  Following what I was saying, I want to thank my friend, the member for Fowler, Chris Hayes, for bringing this important motion for debate. In Darwin, I'll be attending the ecumenical service at my parish church, St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral, on 28 September. I will pay my respects to the men and women of the NT Police Force who were either killed in the execution of their duties or who died while serving. I know that the thoughts of many this year will be with the Noonan family, who had to say goodbye to retired Senior Constable Williams Thomas Barney Noonan, who, sadly, lost a long-running battle with cancer.


It's not easy to be a police officer anywhere, but in the NT, with road fatalities, break-ins and dealing with alcohol related crimes, police see some of the worst that the Territory has to offer. In a normal year, police in the Territory respond to over 100,000 triple 0 requests and close to 25,000 incidents related to domestic violence, and breath test close to 180,000 drivers.


It's important that we recognise the work of the police and the vital role that they play in our community. It's a bit of a personal irritation of mine that the levels of disrespect towards the police have increased in my electorate in Darwin and Palmerston. I'd like to add my support for the action taken by the Northern Territory Labor government and their commitment to restore school based constables, which had been cut by the previous government.


I'd especially like to acknowledge the work done by the rank-and-file men and women who are on the ground, at the coalface, working around the clock to make our communities safe. The work they do is tough. It's not a nine-to-five job, and it's mostly done as shiftwork, which makes it even tougher. By now, we should all be aware of the terrible effect that this prolonged shiftwork has on the body, both physically and emotionally. Shiftwork, coupled with the at times tragic work undertaken by our police men and women is, to be quite frank, a recipe for terrible mental health outcomes. I know from my own experiences in the Defence Force that prolonged experience of trauma destroys families and ruins lives. I can't imagine the compounding effect that trauma would have on a police officer who has served for 30 years and the effect it would have on their family. It must be massive.


I'd like to take a brief moment to commend the great work done by the Police Association in the Northern Territory and by Police Legacy in the NT. As I said, it's not easy being a police officer, let alone being a family member of one. The NT Police Legacy scheme assures police families that there is an organisation prepared to assist them with their emotional, financial, education and welfare needs should anything happen to their loved ones in the line of duty. Last week, I saw off the second contingent of Territory motorcycle riders that left our police memorial in Darwin and started riding to Canberra with the Wall to Wall Ride event, with funds raised going to Police Legacy. It's important work.


The damaging effect of the type of work done by first responders and Defence personnel is why I'm pushing for funding to be put towards the construction of a support centre for these groups in Darwin, because the NT doesn't have such a support centre. Often, when I'm talking to my old Army comrades, they're the first ones to say that the police are on the tools every day—and, by saying they're 'on the tools', I mean they're on the job every day. As I say, there is a compounding effect of that sort of work. My own brother is a fireman in the Northern Territory. When they turn up to scenes of vehicle accidents, it is traumatic.


We need to do more to make sure that first responders like the police have that mental health support and other support around them. As a community, that's what we need to be doing. This support is vital. Support is needed for these people who serve us and protect us. Again, I thank the member for Fowler for reminding us all of the services that our police force provide to our community.

"O'Brien, Llew, MP",Nats,2018-09-17,"



Mr LLEW O'BRIEN
 (Wide Bay) (17:33):  It's a great pleasure to rise to support this motion. This week is a very special week in the Australian police calendar. The Police Federation of Australia's inaugural Police Week starts this week. It commenced with the Wall to Wall motorcycle ride and will conclude with National Police Remembrance Day. Police Week will also see the inaugural Australian National Police Bravery Awards presented at a formal dinner on 19 September. These awards are very special in that they are selected by police for police, the recipients truly being national heroes.


This year I was again honoured to participate in the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance with my daughter Yve. We rode from Canberra after the ceremony and returned from Goulburn to Canberra. The Wall to Wall is a special remembrance motorbike ride where police and their families and friends meet at special places and memorial sites in their jurisdictions and ride to the National Police Memorial, in Canberra. The ride promotes motorcycle safety awareness and raises funds for charity. The main beneficiary of the charity this year is Police Legacy, who do an amazing job looking after the families of those officers who have lost their lives while serving, in the line of duty. And I must pay tribute to Detective Senior Sergeant Vic Kostiuk, who tragically lost his life in Victoria while travelling with his son to the memorial. He gave 40 years of service. He was a great man, and his is a great loss to society. 


Police Remembrance Day is a solemn occasion when we commemorate and pay tribute to those police who have lost their lives in the line of duty. On 29 September, around the country, we recall the names of every police officer who has made the ultimate sacrifice protecting and serving their community. The role of a police officer is a very challenging but also very rewarding one. Every day police officers put their lives on the line as they go about their duty, serving their community whilst upholding the highest levels of professionalism, often in very, very difficult circumstances. A police officer never knows what scene they'll be confronted with when they start their shift, and, tragically, some police officers don't make it home. That's why it is so important to remember those people who have lost their life in the line of duty and also to pay respect to those serving us every day. This year I'll attend the Police Remembrance Day service on the Sunshine Coast. 


Policing is an incredibly honourable vocation where your function is to help and serve, and, in doing so, it gives you a front row seat to every aspect of life. In Australia, it's a job performed in one of the most peaceful, modern societies on the planet, where the rights and freedoms of individuals are precious and you're charged with protecting life and property and upholding those principles and values. As a former police officer, I understand the difficulties that police encounter every time they put on their uniform. It's a job where, at the beginning of the shift, you have the incredibly weighty task of loading bullets into a weapon—a weapon whose primary purpose is to stop human beings—followed by the even weightier task of then walking out into everyday life with no certainty as to what serious challenges you are going to be asked to solve. 


Policing is a job where most members of society are happy to see you. Once they see the blue uniform, they want to have a chat. More often than not they'll strike up that conversation for no particular reason. It's just that they like seeing the police out and about doing their job, walking the beat and keeping the peace. It's a diverse job. At one time, you could be attending an incident of domestic and family violence, where every policing skill that you possess is called upon to resolve a highly charged situation, and, later in that same shift, you may find yourself at a day care centre, sitting on the carpet with the kids, explaining to them why they need to hold Mum's and Dad's hand when they're crossing the road. It truly is a diverse job. It's a job where your own physical and mental wellbeing is regularly placed on the line to help others and where the highs of success are often matched by the lows of tragedy. 


Police are expected to be brave. They're expected to be able to perform without fear. They're expected to serve their community without hesitation. I convey my respects to all police, past and present, and commend them for the job that they do.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (17:38):  It's a great honour to rise and speak today in support of the motion of the member for Fowler, and I wish to commend him for his ongoing dedication to this important day of remembrance and, indeed, to his continued advocacy in all areas of policing. The member for Fowler and I have spoken many times on similar motions in the House, because this day does have a very special significance for the wider police family. As I've mentioned before, I was proud to previously serve as a general duties police officer in the Queensland Police Service. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank my other parliamentary colleagues who I know share a deep commitment to highlighting the significant role of police officers right across Australia and the great risk and sacrifice that comes with that duty. 


National Police Remembrance Day is being observed this year on 28 September. It's a solemn and important day for police officers, their loved ones and the wider police family. It's also an important day on which the community can also reflect on the invaluable service provided by our brave policemen and policewomen. This is a time that we pause to honour the lives  and memory of all the fine men and women who, in their work protecting our community, have had their lives tragically cut short. This year we specifically honour and remember Constable Dennis Green of the Western Australia Police Force. Constable Green had been with the WA police for seven years and was based at the Warwick police station with the traffic enforcement group. He'd also served more than 20 years with the Royal Engineers in the UK before joining the police. Tragically, in December last year, Constable Dennis Green was killed in a motorbike incident during pursuit training. I wish to extend my greatest sympathy to his family and friends and colleagues. 


As we've heard, tragically, just last Friday, Detective Senior Sergeant Vic Kostiuk died when a car veered across the road and struck his motorcycle in Victoria whilst he was taking part in the police charity motorcycle ride, the Wall to Wall Ride, which remembers fallen officers. I extend my sincere condolences to his family.


It is tragedies like this that remind us of how important is the work of Police Legacy for families suffering bereavement. Like the police forces themselves, Police Legacy is separated by state jurisdictions. However, they all perform much the same vital functions in their respective states.


New South Wales Policy Legacy supports bereaved police families following the loss of their loved one, and they also extend support to police officers and their families experiencing challenging times in their lives. I commend all those involved with Police Legacy for the vital work that they do within our policing communities.


As a former general duties police officer myself, I've seen firsthand some of the situations and complexities that police officers face, day in, day out, whilst serving their communities in the execution of their duties. It's important to acknowledge that these individuals are out there working hard to keep our communities safe. They do often have to face very difficult and, indeed, very dangerous situations. It is during these times that police are faced with terrible tragedy—events that, so unfortunately, are a part of our everyday lives. These are the tragedies, fatal accidents or family losses that we so often hear about. It is often those police officers who are the ones to break this terrible news to parents, to children and to partners when such horrific incidents occur.


I continue to raise, as I know many members in this House do, some of these issues that put pressures and challenges upon our police, so that there is always an awareness of the incidents they face. There are particular challenges in regional areas like mine on the New South Wales north coast. I have called many times and continue to call for more support and resources for these police. I also encourage locals in my area and across the country to take a moment on 28 September this year and think about the role that police officers play within our community. I say to those police in my local area: thank you for your service.


Finally, I want to mention an important recent event in my electorate. Our local police officers helped to organise the very successful inaugural Police and Community Charity Ball, which was jointly hosted by the Queensland Police Service, the New South Wales Police Force and the Australian Federal Police. It was great to see more than 600 people attending this wonderful inaugural event. More than $65,000 was raised. All profits went to the children's wards at the Tweed Heads hospital and also at the Gold Coast hospital. So thanks to everyone involved with organising that event. I would really like to congratulate all of them. The event was a great success, and it showcased what an integral part our police play, not just in protecting us every day in our communities but also, as members of our community, in raising important funds for charity.


Today, I would like to thank all police for the wonderful, brave work that you do. I especially thank and acknowledge those officers serving in commands on the New South Wales north coast, and I look forward to joining many of those on 28 September at Coolangatta, at Saint Augustine's Church, in which National Police Remembrance Day will be honoured in my area. I thank all those police for the great work they continue to do right throughout our community. This is an important occasion for all of us to come together and recognise that. I particularly commend the member for Fowler for this motion and commend all those who have been speaking as we remember the great work that our police do.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-09-17,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (17:43):  I rise to support the member for Fowler in this motion, and I join with the remarks that have been made by both sides of the House in relation to remembering the importance of the men and women who serve our communities in uniform, particularly around National Police Remembrance Day. The case of Constable Dennis Green this year, the death last year of Senior Constable Brett Forte and the unfortunate death of Senior Sergeant Victor Kostiuk just last Friday remind us of the dangers involved in being a policeman or an emergency service worker. I want to thank my good friend the member for Wide Bay, who gave so much of his life to serving his community as a policeman before taking a higher calling to come into this place—although some might argue with that! But I think it's important on days like this to really acknowledge the service of those who have pulled on the uniform. We often talk in this place about the importance of recognising our ADF personnel, which is very, very important and should be done. But, when you look at the carnage and the horrible things that people like the member for Wide Bay will have seen over their years in the police service, compared to what a member of the ADF might see if they deploy, it's very, very difficult to compare the two when you deal with death and destruction every single day over a 30-year period.


My brother is a MICA ambo in Victoria, and he and I have often spoken about the pain and agony that he goes through just by virtue of the sheer weight of numbers of the death and destruction that he has seen. I've only been involved in that in a very small way as a counsel assisting in coronial inquiries, and I have been impacted by just the photographs—let alone actually turning up to the incidents with all your senses and the sights and smells. I was only seeing it in 2D, months and sometimes years afterwards. I can't imagine what it's like to be there on the day or on the night.


It's very, very important that we acknowledge these guys. Equally, it's important that we acknowledge them after the event, after they leave the service. We care for our veterans to a very high quality standard. Sometimes that standard doesn't meet our joint expectations. How we care for our emergency service workers after they leave their service is equally telling.


I want to acknowledge a gentleman in my electorate by the name of Neil Reid, who approached me very early on in my extensive parliamentary career of 2½ years, trying to get support for emergency service workers like the support we provide to ADF members. When you look at that life of service and what they go through over a long period of time, we as a nation—we as a collection of states and territories—do not look after our emergency service workers anywhere near like we look after our ADF personnel. I've met with numerous ministers to try and look at this issue, to look at some sort of uniformity of approach about how we care for our emergency service workers once they hang up that uniform, because many of them do struggle. If we are able to help them post—I won't say 'discharge'—service, we will reduce the number of suicides by these men and women. It's the least we can do as a community and as a government to try and push for better access and better service for these men and women who have given us so much.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Gee
):  I thank the member for Fisher. I also acknowledge and welcome those ADF members we have in the chamber this afternoon who are here as part of the observers program.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-09-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (17:48):  I support the motion put forward by the member for Fowler regarding how, on National Police Remembrance Day, we honour officers who have lost their lives in service. The Queensland Police Service Roll of Honour includes officers who have been killed as a consequence of the actions of an offender or who died while attempting to save lives. There are currently 32 entries on the Queensland Roll of Honour, spanning 150 years of service. Sadly, the most recent entry is Senior Constable Brett Forte, who was shot and killed near Toowoomba just last year. I acknowledge the service and bravery of all 32 Queensland police officers on the Queensland Police Service Roll of Honour.


I would also like to acknowledge today each and every Queensland police officer who, every day, knowingly walks in harm's way to make us safer. Policing is a high-risk job. Almost every year an officer is killed somewhere in Australia, and many others are assaulted or suffer work-related illnesses. It is high stress. Beyondblue ran a specific program for police and emergency services in an effort to address this reality. Not only do police and emergency service personnel routinely face life and death challenges, but they also witness the worst of humankind.


Beyondblue says that police and emergency personnel who retire or leave the job have higher rates of anxiety, depression and, sadly, suicide. Although they are not formally recognised on the service roll of honour, more officers have died as a result of suicide than those killed in the line of duty. The villains pursuing them were no less real, their bravery in the face of death no less courageous and the reason they were stolen from their families no less the result of crimes they witnessed and criminals they confronted.


I'd like to particularly acknowledge today a family member of my chief of staff, Michelle Howe. Her cousin Detective Senior Constable Russell Sheehan ended his life in 2015 after serving more than 32 years in the Queensland Police Service. Russell was from a large Brisbane police family; his father, uncles and grandfather all served in the Queensland Police Service. He was brought up with a stoicism that was almost a way of life in those families; selflessly just getting on with the job and being there for everyone else.


But, like many, Russell's service to the Queensland police included many experiences that could not be unseen, unheard or unfelt. Russell Sheehan spent four years of his service in the police Child Protection Unit. A letter from one victim of child abuse sent to Russell's family tells of the compassion and strength Russell demonstrated when this victim revealed for the first time the terrible abuse he had endured. He said that Russell saved his life at that time.


Emotional and physical stress were ever present in Russell Sheehan's job. Russell was the first responder to the Childers Palace Backpackers Hostel fire back in 2000, in which 15 people lost their lives. And while on a solo patrol, Russ encountered a man brandishing a lighter who threw petrol over him. He received the Commissioner's Certificate for Bravery for that incident. We can watch physical scars heal but, tragically, the invisible scars continue, festering and unseen. There is an urgent need to improve the health, safety and wellbeing of the police. Service unions, including the Queensland Police Union, together have recognised this and are taking action with the Our People Matter Strategy.


There are many families who have generations of service like the Sheehan family. Many go into the service proudly, to follow in their parents' footsteps. One such police officer on the south side of Brisbane is Senior Sergeant Murray Crone. He entered the force at 19 and, coincidentally, his first placement as a young police constable was with Russell Sheehan. Murray has told me that he could never understand why his mum was so worried about him being a copper. He said that to him it was the best job ever—great people, fun and exciting. But after a few years in the service, Murray had a different perspective. An academy squad mate was shot through the chest and killed at Wynnum. He was in his early 20s. In the same year, another colleague was killed in a crash while pursuing a stolen vehicle in the suburb of Fortitude Valley. After 32 years service, sadly, Murray has lost count of the number of funerals he has attended—all of them good men and women taken too early and well before their time, including those who have, tragically, taken their own lives. Murray says that the sound of bagpipes now make the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.


Being a police officer is no ordinary job; it takes lives and leaves families heartbroken. So on National Police Remembrance Day this year, let's pause; let's remember all the brave police who've been taken from their families—those for which the sun set too early:


We will remember.


We will remember.


Hasten the dawn.
