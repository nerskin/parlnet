"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-09-10,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present report No. 104 of the committee, Treaties tabled on 20 August 2009, and move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Question agreed to.
—I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Mr President, I present Report 104 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The report recommends binding treaty action be taken in relation to the following treaties:
the Proposed Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund to Enhance Voice and Participation in the International Monetary Fund;
the Proposed Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund to Expand the Investment Authority of the International Monetary Fund; and
the Proposed Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to Enhance Voice and Participation in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr President, the Committee has taken the unusual step of making an interim recommendation that binding treaty action be taken while the Committee undertakes a more detailed examination of the three treaty amendments involved.
The Treasurer wrote to the Committee on 27 August 2009, asking that the Committee give urgent consideration to the treaty actions.
The treaties in question have the common aim of improving the effectiveness and legitimacy of the membership based international financial institutions, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Australia was a co-chair of the G20 working group on IMF reform, and was instrumental in developing the reforms embodied in these treaties.
The reforms will be an important agenda item at the next G20 Leaders’ Summit, to be held on 22-24 September. The Treasurer advised that in order for Australia to perform the leading role expected of it in relation to this matter, Australia will have to take binding treaty action before 10 September.
While the Committee has already taken evidence from the Treasury in relation to the proposed treaty actions and is convinced that taking binding treaty action in relation to these matters is in Australia’s best interests, we recognise that this will truncate the opportunity for interested persons to make submissions about the proposed treaties. The Committee will therefore consider any other issues in the framing of its final report, which it intends to table at a later date.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-09-10,"—I move:
That the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No. 24 and made under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, be disallowed.
This motion disallows the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009, as contained in the Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No. 24 made under the Aviation Transport Security Act. While many of the provisions within this legislative instrument are worthy measures, two key components are not acceptable—hence my move to disallow.
These two provisions are internationally unprecedented and unacceptable. The first provision can be found in regulation 4.67E, where a pilot allowing an ineligible person into the cockpit is subject to an offence of strict liability. This is a significant departure from global safety practice, where airlines are always responsible for the actions of their pilots. I note that the Australian and International Pilots Association here in Australia sought advice from Bret Walker, an eminent Senior Counsel, and his advice was that the effect of these regulations is to create an offence of strict liability committed by a pilot in command if the cockpit door is not locked during flight or an ineligible person enters or remains in the cockpit during flight.
Previously, it was the operator of the aircraft rather than the pilot in command of the aircraft who would commit an offence in such circumstances. Bret Walker SC went on to say that if the position had been that there were no such existing provisions then it would be difficult not to agree with the government that some such provisions would be necessary, but the opposite is the case. There were ample provisions—and they remain in effect—to sanction regulated cockpit access before these new regulations were made. That is the case. What the government is attempting to do is unprecedented. It is also interesting to note that there has been a lack of consultation by the government with airline pilots, contrary to standard practice, in relation to this.
This provision not only covers entry but also makes a pilot responsible if a door is left unlocked or if another person leaves the door open. Pilots should be focusing on flight safety, not flying while looking over their shoulders to see if the door is closed. More importantly, at no time has it been made clear why this provision is so necessary. I have had considerable discussion with pilot representatives about the issue and they are strongly opposed to the measure. We have a system that is operating well—it is similar to others overseas—so why do we need the change?
It is interesting that I received information from the pilots in relation to this. They have indicated to me that, in a review of overseas aviation practices, advice was sought of pilot association representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand, South Africa, France, Germany, Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, China and Israel regarding the respective airline aviation authority provisions on access to the flight deck. They found that what we are doing is unprecedented. It is interesting to note that that applies even to Israel. Anyone who has been to an Israeli airport knows what they are like in terms of security measures. We know how strict they are. That degree of strictness also applies to the flight deck, no doubt, yet even the Israelis are not going down this path. This is totally unnecessary and counterproductive.
There have been concerns about who can access the cockpit, and it would be good to see guidelines that stipulate pilots, crew and operators as those suitable for entry. However, one important group has not been included—that is, off-duty pilots. When emergencies occur, passengers want to know that every available resource is employed to ensure their safety. Data provided to me by a pilots association in the United States lists multiple instances where having a pilot in the jump seat has had important positive safety ramifications.
There have been a whole swag of recent jump-seat contributions. For instance, in June 2009 in an A300 there were fumes in the cabin. The note from the pilots indicated:
During climb our jump-seater stated that they smelled an oily caustic smell on takeoff roll and that it was still present. We declared an emergency and turned back for landing.
That is a case where it was a jump-seater who picked up on something. There was another instance involving the left-main cabin door of an A300 in July 2007:
A crew member in the jump seat called from the courier area. He reported the left door alarm in one position indicated between the locked green and unlocked red. There was no e-cam warning in the cockpit.
That was picked up by the jump-seat operator. That could have been a serious incident. There have been other incidents: right-inner tank fuel loss, locks being down, an unsafe pin-pull, a hydraulic leak, a gauge error, hydraulic system problems, jammed flight controls and crew member incapacitation. All those were occasions where the jump-seat pilots actually made a very positive and important contribution. These are things that we will miss out on with these particular changes. Further, a letter from the Australian and International Pilots Association reports that when similar measures to the ones proposed were attempted in the United States they adversely affected safety and security and had to be changed.
Put simply, the proposal will not make our skies safer; it will make air travel more dangerous. Further, the Australian pilots association has provided information that confirms 14 nations, which I have listed, allow jump-seat access for pilots. Unfortunately, we cannot amend this legislative instrument to add a new category of current off-duty pilots. This leaves us with the only option to disallow this regulation and call on the government to introduce it in a more appropriate form. The government will no doubt respond by saying that this will mean that we will revert back to the old system for the next six months. That is the not case. The fact is that, if the government wants to bring back a new regulation, if it wants to do so with the consent of the Senate, it can do so. It can fix this up by consulting with pilots and by consulting with the experts who know and with whom we entrust our safety. However, if the new instrument is substantially different, as I believe it must be, it could be reintroduced immediately. My understanding of Senate procedure is that we can rescind this regulation and deal with it and not be fettered by the six-month rule in relation to it. I would support the government if it chose to bring back a suitable legislative instrument, and I also strongly urge my colleagues to support rescinding the six-month rule. The government can handle this swiftly and without fuss, if it wishes, and I would encourage it to do so.
What the government should not do is use this issue to chase easy headlines about security compromises. In fact, if the government wants to talk about genuine airline security issues then I suggest that it looks to the front pages of the Australian from earlier this week. If it did, it would see retired Customs officer, Mr Allan Kessing, being persecuted and pursued for exposing serious breaches in airport security four years ago. Also, I note that Mr Kessing, in his revelations at a media conference earlier this week, went to the office of the shadow transport spokesman, now the minister, four years ago, before publication in the Australian of his concerns. Mr Kessing confirmed this week that many of the shortcomings in the process still exist today. So I say to the government: fix real security problems and do not make problems by trying to change procedures that are working. I think everyone in this chamber trusts a pilot with their life every time they come to Canberra. Surely, we should trust them when they say that there are practical problems with this proposal. I urge all senators to support this disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-09-10,"—The Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009 close a dangerous loophole in our aviation security law. The key purpose of the regulation is to restrict who can enter the cockpit of an aircraft. The regulation makes it clear that the cockpit is reserved for persons with an operational, safety, security or training need. Hardened cockpit doors and restricting cockpit access are the last lines of defence to prevent a terrorist from using the aircraft as a weapon in an attack. Consequently, stringent rules must apply to who can open the hardened cockpit door and enter the cockpit.
The debate we are having today is essentially about one thing—that is, whether the rules of governing who can open hardened cockpit doors and enter the cockpit should be made by parliament or whether this matter should be left to the discretion of pilots. Senators know that planes have been used by and are targets of terrorists. It is well known how al-Qaeda’s Hamburg cell of terrorists trained to become pilots. Mohamed Atta was one of those pilots and senators well know his terrible deeds on 11 September 2001. On Monday this week, three people were convicted in Britain of plotting to murder thousands of people by downing at least seven airlines bound for the USA and Canada in what was intended as the largest terrorist attack since September 11. Early today, in Mexico City, a plane with 104 passengers was hijacked. It is the responsibility of the government and this parliament to ensure the security of all Australians, and with terrorists targeting planes we must ensure that aviation security measures are strong and tight.
Australia’s aviation security regime relies on a number of layers of security measures that, operating together, ensure that the travelling public is safe. The layers are designed to prevent a catastrophic event caused by persons gaining control of or destroying an aircraft. Specific measures required by legislation include screening of passengers and baggage to prevent explosives, prohibited items or weapons from getting into the cabin of an aircraft. These are things that could destroy an aircraft or be used to gain control of it.
A critical layer of aviation security is the hardened cockpit door. This is the final layer of security preventing unauthorised persons from gaining access to the cockpit and control of an aircraft. Hardened cockpit doors were part of an enhancement in aviation security around the world in 2002. On 26 November 2003 the previous government determined that, from 1 July 2004, all regular passenger transport and open-charter aircraft of 30 seats or more were to install hardened cockpit doors. This measure was seen as important enough for the previous government to fully fund the installation of hardened cockpit doors for all non-jet regional aircraft registered at the time the decision was announced.
The regulations which some senators want to disallow remove the unfettered discretion previously granted to pilots to permit any person to open the hardened cockpit door and access the cockpit. Under the cockpit access rules set out in these regulations, only people with a genuine safety, security, operational or training requirement may be permitted to enter and remain in the cockpit of an aircraft. The regulations create a strict liability offence for a pilot or company who lets an unauthorised person into the cockpit. However, importantly, the regulations make specific provision to ensure a pilot can let a person into the cockpit to protect the safety or security of the plane or its passengers. In the unfortunate situation where there is a medical or some other emergency on an aircraft, the pilot’s judgment to allow a person to access the cockpit is not fettered by this regulation.
As I noted earlier, these regulations close a loophole in the aviation transport security regulations which commenced on 10 March 2005. The previous government’s policy intention for cockpit access was to prevent persons without a security, operational or safety need from accessing the cockpit of an aircraft fitted with a hardened cockpit door. However, due to a drafting error, the 2005 regulations effectively allowed a person to enter and remain in the cockpit of an aircraft if he or she was permitted to by the pilot in command. The previous government knew about the loophole that existed late in 2005. The then Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Truss, stated in a letter to the pilots association on 16 November 2005:
It is the government policy that only those people with a genuine safety, security or operational need have access to the flight deck.
The previous government knew there was a loophole, but they did not take action to fix it. If these regulations are disallowed, the legislation regarding cockpit access will return to the state it was in prior to the commencement of the regulation on 12 March this year. There will be no legal restriction on who can enter a cockpit and there will be no penalties for unauthorised access to the cockpit. If these regulations are disallowed, access to the cockpit will effectively be left to industry self-regulation. It is completely unsatisfactory for such an important measure in such a vital regulatory regime to rely on industry regulating itself. The government has made it clear to the pilots association, to the opposition and to Senator Xenophon that it will look closely at the issue of access of off-duty pilots and also at the strict liability offences in the regulations.
The government will continue to work on these matters with relevant stakeholders, including the Australian and International Pilots Association. If an agreed position can be reached, and further assessment by the Office of Transport Security determines that the integrity of the aviation security regime would not be compromised, the government will consider amending the regulations accordingly. Until that time, the Senate has a choice as to what the security regime will be for hardened cockpit doors and access to the cockpit of a plane. These regulations are important for aviation security and they should be allowed to stand, particularly while the government has said that it can work with those associations to ensure that there is consultation. More importantly, it is necessary to ensure the continued safety of airline passengers. That is the focus which the government has on this issue.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-09-10,"—I am disappointed to hear Senator Ludwig’s speech. He has done precisely what Senator Xenophon, in moving the motion, asked him not to do; he is indicating that, because the majority of senators will be opposing this—I think they will; although I am not sure of the Greens’ position, at least one of the Independents will oppose this—we will be opening the gates to airline insecurity. We, along with all senators who will be voting for the motion to disallow the regulations, reject that out of hand. It is disingenuous for the minister to have raised that in his speech.
Before I state the grounds upon which the opposition will be supporting the motion to disallow, I indicate to Senator Wortley, the chair of the committee which put in the original disallowance motion, that I congratulate her on her courage and on her contribution to Australia in doing what is right. Senator Wortley acted very appropriately and was very courageous in carrying out her duties as chair of the committee. Not many people in the Labor Party would be prepared to stand up to Mr Albanese and wear the wrath which we know would be imposed upon those who dare to cross him, but it is good to see that there is a senator who is prepared to put her duties to the Australian public and to the Australian parliament ahead of any other consideration.
I also congratulate Senator Chris Back. As I understand—I was not a member of the committee and I am not sure how secret the dealings of the committee are—it was Senator Back who, in this committee, first raised the issue of lack of consultation and, as a result, convinced the committee that a disallowance motion should be moved. The coalition has attempted very consistently and strongly to work with the government to get a resolution to this issue. As Senator Ludwig said, some of the issues raised in the regulation are issues which our government instituted in the first instance. It was all towards making airline travel safer and securing the cockpit, making it safer for Australians to travel by air. When we saw this regulation, we were concerned about it initially. Mr Truss, as shadow transport minister, made a mighty effort to work cooperatively with Mr Albanese in relation to the regulation. As I understand, all of the loopholes—we concede there is a loophole—could be fixed on Monday with a bit of goodwill from Mr Albanese, but he has chosen to proceed with this regulation knowing that it is flawed.
The concern is that, had the minister done what he is required to do and consulted widely, we would not be in this situation today. It is because the minister did not do what he was required to do and chose to ignore those who are most involved in this—the airline pilots themselves—that we are in this situation today. The airline pilots association have made their view very clear. They do not want to widen the class of persons who have cockpit access. They do not want to include general entry to family members or friends, as is being suggested by the minister. The airline pilots association have also noted that such a general class of persons are not permitted to enter the flight deck of an airline in any flight in Australia at this time in any case. They further point out in their submissions that Australia’s professional pilots would not support any widening of the access. So we in the coalition dismiss any assertion that somehow we are compromising the security of the flight deck by supporting the disallowance motion. Access to the flight deck is suitably limited and will remain so in the immediate future.
Qantas now only permits its employees access to the jump seat in the cockpit, and then only at the pilot’s discretion. Prior to our government restricting access to the flight deck in 2005, it was commonplace for passengers to visit the flight deck at the pilot’s discretion. This was often permitted. But, as we know so well, times have changed since 11 September 2001, and the coalition government moved to responsibly restrict access to only those the airline felt appropriate to enter their flight deck. In providing airlines with the discretion to decide who entered the flight deck, the coalition in 2005 recognised the emerging world’s best practice concept of outcome based safety regulations. This concept is today the foundation principle underpinning Australia’s approach to aviation regulations and is recognised globally as the most effective way for delivering the best safety in critical industries such as aviation.
Airlines know far more about operating large aircraft worldwide than our government. That is a self-evident fact, of course. In the case of Qantas they have been doing it for nearly 90 years. Outcome based safety systems tap into this extensive knowledge and allow the airlines to figure out how to run their businesses safely and effectively. The coalition recognises this principle by permitting airlines to develop their own flight deck access plan. I am conscious of the fact—
—That is just the silliest thing I have ever heard.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Just move on and keep speaking, Senator Macdonald.
—Thank you. I am not sure why I would ever be interrupted by anything Senator O’Brien might say. I do not think he has made a worthwhile contribution to any debate for a long time, but I am sure we will hear his expert opinion on this matter later. I was going on to say that I am conscious of the fact that there are a number of my colleagues who want to speak on this issue. Accordingly, I will not be taking my full allowable time so that we do not delay the Senate unnecessarily.
We are concerned about the strict liability issue. If the government feels it necessary to close a possible legal loophole that may give undue discretion to a pilot in permitting access to the cockpit of the plane with a secure door, then clearly the coalition supports this. The coalition, like the government, is committed to a robust aviation security regime and is prepared to work constructively with the government to this end.
In dealing with this loophole the regulations impose a penalty of strict liability upon the airline company if they permit a person onto the flight deck outside of the prescribed class, and the coalition is happy with this provision. However, the regulations also impose a strict liability offence of 50 penalty units upon the pilot if they permit an ineligible person to enter the flight deck. In both these cases—the imposition of the penalty of strict liability upon the pilot regarding an unlocked door and ineligible access to the flight deck—we believe the regulations have gone too far. The people most involved in this are of course those who fly the planes and they have made very good submissions on why this is so.
I could refer the Senate to the legal advice on these regulations prepared by one of Australia’s leading barristers, Mr Bret Walker SC, that strict liability unreasonably places the burden of evidence upon an individual pilot in command, and to the coalition this seems unreasonable. It also seems unduly harsh to impose a strict liability offence upon the pilot where the state of mind is not a defence. In the normal operational flying environment pilots are harnessed in their seat and are occupied with the demands of flying. In many cases they cannot even reach around and close the door. While pilots are extremely mindful of cockpit security—probably more so than anyone else—to hold them strictly liable for any transgression, rather than their employer, seems unreasonable and excessive. Mr Walker also quite correctly points out that the imposition of criminal sanctions upon pilots is disproportionate and unnecessary. He points out that the increasing risk of these punitive sanctions upon skilled professionals such as pilots only diminishes safety as it increases the fear of self-incrimination. This would obviously inhibit self-reporting—one of the key safety features of a mature aviation safety system. By inhibiting reporting, these security provisions actually reduce safety.
I further point out Mr Walker’s point that the shortcomings of paragraph 227(1A)(b) of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 that may give undue discretion to pilots in determining flight deck access could have been dealt with by just amending it so that pilot permission could be only for a safety, security, operational or training purpose. We believe, as most independent observers do, that the making of regulation 4.67E, which removes the application of paragraph 227(1A)(b) and includes a penalty of strict liability, is unnecessary and excessive. The transference of criminal liability also undermines an important global principle that airlines are responsible for the operational actions of their pilots. It must be remembered that airlines control flight operations, standards, training and checking, and any other approach runs the risk that airlines could attempt to duck their responsibility for accidents. There is a lot more that could be said and will be said by my colleagues.
I finish by indicating again that we will be supporting the motion for disallowance. I plead with the government to properly consult not only with the airline pilots but with other senators in this chamber and the shadow minister, Mr Truss, who stands willing, as he has over the last several days and several weeks, to get a resolution to this issue. I would urge the government to work with goodwill with other parties to ensure that we can get regulations that are fair and reasonable and ensure the safety and security of the travelling public.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-09-10,"—I rise today to support the disallowance. The reason for this is pretty clear to me, having worked in a number of workplaces in my life. The best way to encourage increased performance is to have a culture in which people can talk about ways to improve what they do and cite examples of where things have not been done as well as they might. If you have a culture of self-improvement then you have a culture in which people report on where mistakes have been made and how things can be done better. If you introduce a criminal sanction for individuals, as this does by bringing in a criminal sanction against a pilot who for some reason does something such that the cockpit door is unlocked or some issue occurs in relation to cockpit security, then they will not report. If they know that by reporting on that they will incriminate themselves and then be liable for a serious criminal offence, you are going to introduce a culture of secrecy and cover-up and at best people turning a blind eye to things that have happened, because they do not want other people to suffer criminal consequences over matters that might be inadvertent and quite innocent.
It is appropriate that the companies have liability, because it is up to the corporation to have a culture of self-improvement and improved safety standards and it is up to airlines to institute that with their pilots. But I really do not like a scenario where a criminal sanction is introduced such that it is not in the pilot’s interests to report and to engage in real self-monitoring of the security system. It is pretty clear to me that you are changing from a culture of encouraging appropriate monitoring and appropriate self-evaluation and improvement to a culture of secrecy and cover-up. That is not in the best interests of security.
It will also cause a lot of conflict, I believe, because there will be people who think that something ought to be reported but who are reluctant to report it because they know that someone is going to suffer the consequences of criminal sanctions and so on and so forth. Everybody is clearly interested in airline security.
I concur with what Senator Macdonald has said. I have been on many flights across Bass Strait in the old days of the Focker Friendships when the pilot encouraged children on board to visit the cockpit. When we got underway, parents would ask whether their children could come up and have a look in the cockpit. That was organised. It was a pleasant and exciting thing for young people—especially if they had never been in a plane before—and it let them learn new things. It was a way of encouraging them to feel safe and secure in flying, and so on. Things have changed. Security is critical. We have to make sure that the travelling public is protected. But the best way of protecting the travelling public is to encourage a culture of openness, transparency, self-evaluation and improvement. I do not think that putting criminal sanctions on pilots is the way of doing that. In fact, it is counterproductive in an age in which we need people to be very upfront about mistakes that are made, so that we can correct those mistakes immediately and not make the travelling public vulnerable rather than cover mistakes up and perpetuate them, which might in the end lead to a disaster.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-09-10,"—It was not my intention to speak in this debate, but a couple of the matters raised by Senator Macdonald provoked my intervention. Firstly, there was a suggestion that somehow it was wrong for the government to think that its view should prevail over the view of an airline, which  seems to me to fly in the face of the proposition that we should have a government backed regulator telling the airlines what to do in the interests of safety. The suggestion advanced by Senator Macdonald has no weight at all. It is, frankly, ridiculous to say that government is not the responsible entity to enforce the safety regime for the airline industry. It is in this country. It has been for many years. It is in the rest of the world, effectively. I am not sure what provoked the senator to make the quite ridiculous suggestion that he made.
The other matter that he raised was the suggestion that Mr Truss was very keen to be involved in negotiations and consultation about this regulation and that somehow the government had failed to consult with Mr Truss about this regulation. My advice is that there have been significant consultations with Mr Truss and his staff and that of the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, I understand that there was an understanding reached earlier this week that, on the basis of undertakings which the government was prepared to give about returning to some aspects of these regulations that are complained of, the opposition would support the passage of the regulations and not support this particular disallowance motion. For it to be suggested that somehow we have not dealt with the opposition in good faith in any way on this is preposterous and is not true. The minister, I can tell you, is quite outraged at the suggestion that there has not been proper consultation about this. And we believed that there was an agreement to pass this legislation, because some of the critical issues we were quite happy to return to.
But in the interests of aviation safety, if there are matters that can be addressed following the promulgation of this regulation, then that is the way it should be done. This should not be left in a void whilst the matters are resolved. This matter is being dealt with today because it is the last day for it to be dealt with and that has put some time pressure on things. Frankly, it would be better in the government’s opinion if the regulation were to be not disallowed and we quickly got on with dealing with some of the issues that, whilst important, are less important than the issue that underlies the whole regulation. Given that it is not something that can be resolved in a five-minute exercise, I think that would be a better outcome. It sounds as though that will not happen and the regulation will be disallowed. We think that that is a very bad thing. It really is made worse by the fact that we thought that the opposition was going to be much more responsible and reasonable on this matter.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech

In relation to Senator O’Brien’s comments, I will need to re-check the Hansard but I do not remember at all any commentary from Senator Macdonald that would indicate that there had not been consultation with the opposition spokesman in relation to this matter. In fact, there has been quite considerable discussion and I did not hear anything in Senator Macdonald’s comments that indicated otherwise.
In relation to the comments of Senator O’Brien, the two issues that he refers to are not separate to the issues that underpin this regulation; they are actually pivotal to them. They are absolutely an imperative and integral part of the safety discussion. There is no-one in this chamber and no-one in the other place who is not absolutely passionately committed to security on aeroplanes. It would beggar belief to think that we would be anything other than as one on ensuring the safety of passengers and ensuring that nothing is done to compromise it.
The residual issue in relation to off-duty pilots is absolutely fundamental to that security question. So this is not a matter that should be debated after the event. It should not be a matter that might be the subject of further amendment. It actually completely and utterly underpins the security aspect upon which the regulations are based. That is the real issue—and we have seen information from the Australian and International Pilots Association. Senator Xenophon has quite rightly referred to it. They are public documents and I would encourage people to have a look at the very examples of where passenger safety was improved by the presence of off-duty pilots. They actually save lives both in the air and on the ground. I am completely and utterly stunned about a number of things. As Senator Milne said, why would you not consult with the very group of people who you will demand to implement the policy that you want to bring in? On what basis could you not actually consult with the very group of people around which the regulation is based, to ensure passenger safety? It beggars belief as to why that was not done.
Passenger safety will actually be improved by the admission of off-duty, licensed pilots into the cockpit. Our view—and this has been expressed by Mr Truss—has been that we believe that the definition of who can have access is too narrow because it does not enable those people to have access to and join their fellow pilots in the cockpit. This ridiculous notion that was floated earlier in relation to this matter—that it was about pilots protecting rights to have family up the front of the plane in the cockpit—is quite obscene and is simply not true. The pilots themselves have made it very, very clear that they are not talking about the access of family to the cockpit. Those days are long gone, and so they should be in the current context of the threats to passenger safety. They have quite rightly said: ‘We were not consulted. We are the ones with whom the ultimate buck stops in relation to this issue with this regulation, and we were not consulted.’
The second aspect is that they are absolutely adamant that passenger safety will be improved by the ability of off-duty pilots to have access to the cockpit. That will actually improve passenger safety. I am not for one minute suggesting the government is not concerned about passenger safety and I take it at face value what the rationale for these regulations is. I do not attack the minister for the rationale behind the regulations. But I do ask: how can you not consult those who you are imposing a liability upon? And why would you not maximise passenger safety by having access of those off-duty pilots? Why would you compromise passenger safety by their not having a right to do so?
The third part of the argument, which Senator Xenophon, Senator Milne and Senator Macdonald referred to—and passenger safety is clearly paramount—is the imposition of strict liability on the pilots when they may in some cases actually be operating an aircraft and sitting in the cockpit when requests are made in relation to access. This is public documentation, to the extent that it has been widely circulated—I am very circumspect about discussions in the committee. Paragraph 29 of the opinion of Bret Walker SC reads:
The way in which the offences under Reg 4.67E are created, as offences of strict liability, is that the pilot in command will commit such an offence by permitting a person to enter or remain in the cockpit, in flight, if the person does not meet the requirements of subreg 4.67E(3) or subreg 4.67E(4): subreg 4.67E(1). The requirement for operator’s authorization does not readily adapt to circumstances that may arise during flight, and it is not necessarily the case that the general dispensing provisions of sec 10A of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 will avail the pilot in command. Certainly, invidious questions may arise as to whether the person protected by subsec 10A(1) includes the pilot in command whose conduct may absolve such a person under those provisions. As well as that legal question, there is a factual question, equally invidious, whether the conduct of a pilot in command could be seen as “reasonable in the circumstances”, within the meaning of para 10A(1)(d), if eg the pilot did not inspect ID or documentation concerning authorization, or did not scrutinize purported ID or documents in order to detect forgery.
This regulation refers to real-life situations. It is not someone sitting in a company’s office for a week or so prior to a flight taking off where there might be the ability for the pilot to check matters. These are real-life, real-time situations where the pilots are required to make split-second decisions and they are entitled to rely, in my view, upon what they have been given. But, under this, there is a very real risk that the pilots themselves, because of the strict liability provisions, will wear the outcome personally.
In my view it is simply not good enough to say that the test of reasonableness will be imposed. You are actually putting the onus back onto the pilots to prove that their actions were reasonable. The strict liability puts the onus back onto those pilots to say that their actions were reasonable. How can you impose strict liability upon a person who is about to take off or is in the air? I think it is totally unreasonable.
The strict liability question and the off-duty pilot issue should have been resolved this week. It was made quite clear by the opposition, the pilots, the Greens and Senator Xenophon that these are the two pivotal issues. My view is that to say, ‘We will closely look at the strict liability and the off-duty pilot issues’—to quote the minister—is, quite frankly, not good enough because, once this goes through, that strict liability is imposed upon those pilots immediately.
There has to be a sense of fairness in relation to government regulation and legislation. You cannot impose upon an individual those sorts of strict liability requirements and say that you may well look at them more closely further down the track. I do not think that is fair to the individuals involved. This should have been resolved. This should have been removed. It should have been replaced with a regulation which addressed both of these issues and then we would not be here today on the back of that.
I have had some pretty serious barneys with the pilots association over the years. I had some pretty serious barneys with them over the Qantas Sale Act and the Senate committee surrounding that. I come to this completely with clean hands, but I come here to defend the rights of individuals in this country to not have strict liability imposed on them in circumstances where they are not the masters of their own destiny, and no-one would reasonably believe that they were the masters of their own destiny.
From what I have read and heard, the pilots association have made it quite clear that the fundamental issue for them is to make sure that we improve passenger safety and not minimise it. We can improve passenger safety by having access to those off-duty pilots. The second issue is—and I will repeat it again—the strict liability offence. I think it is totally unreasonable for this parliament and legislators to impose upon a group of people, such as the pilots in this situation, this strict liability offence.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2009-09-10,"—I also rise to speak on the disallowance of the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1). I want to make the point initially that, as all of us in this chamber travel often, we do not need to be lectured by Senator Ludwig on aspects of airline safety. We all have a keen interest in ensuring that airline safety is at its maximum at all times for everybody in this country, both aircrew and passengers. We certainly would not dispute the right of the government of the day to legislate to ensure this, but neither does this go to that point.
I congratulate the Chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I have learnt enormously under her chairship. I draw attention to a point made already in the chamber this morning, and that is that this matter could have been dealt with expeditiously and quickly had the responsible minister taken the advice and the suggestion of the Hon. Warren Truss and dealt with this matter prior to it actually coming before us. It is not a difficult matter to finally resolve and it is disappointing that the time of the Senate is being taken this morning on this particular matter. I do not wish to repeat at length comments made already by Senator Xenophon and others, except to say this goes to a principle of equity, the principle of equity being that pilots were to have removed from them the right to determine who would be in the cockpit of their aircraft but, worse than that, criminal liability was to transfer from the airline operator to the pilot for actions over which they did not have a say and were not consulted. I have not long been in the Senate. I have long been an employer and an employee, and I certainly looked at this and said to myself: is this fair? If I were in that position, firstly, I would have been denied the opportunity to be informed of or to have commented on something that was going to affect me and, secondly, criminal liability was going to transfer to me from my employer for actions over which I had no control. I certainly took the position that that was not fair and should be dealt with.
Senator Ronaldson made some comments about the pilots. A position put to me was that, under these regulations, a pilot could fly an aircraft from Los Angeles to Sydney and then be a passenger on another aircraft of the same company from Sydney to his or her home in Melbourne and be an ineligible person. How they could be an ineligible person and not be allowed to be in the cockpit at the request of the pilot of that aircraft was just simply beyond me.
We did what the regulations required, and that was to consult with the association. Criminal liability has been outlined by Senator Ronaldson. We looked at the 50 penalty points associated with, for example, the door to the cockpit being left open. We could potentially have a situation in which a member of aircrew goes into the cockpit and the pilot, who at the time might be very busy in the midst of a storm, tells that person from the aircrew, ‘Make sure you close the door on the way out because I’m busy doing something else, I’m strapped into my seat, I’m concentrating on the instruments,’ and that person, whether deliberately or inadvertently, fails to close the cockpit door. Under these regulations, we have a scenario in which the pilot would then be criminally liable for the fact that the door had not been closed. Criminal liability, of course, turns to that person losing their employment and losing their future capacity to be able to fly commercial aircraft.
I say again, without taking more time of the Senate, that this could all have been dealt with outside this chamber had common sense prevailed. I am sure common sense will prevail so that we can return to the scenario of the government enacting correct regulations in this matter.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2009-09-10,"—I think all that needs to be said has probably been said, but I would just like to make a couple of remarks and to declare an interest as I am probably the only pilot who is taking part in this debate.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Joe has got one, has he? Well, there you go! I got my pilots licence in 1965.
—Now I’m scared about flying!
—Yes, I know—it was a pretty scary bush experience for anyone that came flying with me! Four pound 10 an hour it cost. The poor bloke that taught me to fly, the late Dick Cuthbert—
—Are you current?
—No, I am not current. It would not be hard. All I would have to do is go back for—
 (Senator Bernardi)—Senator Heffernan, please address your comments through the chair.
—Talking about aviation safety, Dick Cuthbert got killed giving an endorsement on a Twin Comanche when the student pilot feathered one engine and turned the fuel off to the other.
I would like to clarify a couple of things about the disallowance motion by Senator Xenophon. This really is not about anyone saying we should not have the ultimate in security in airlines. That is not what this is about. This is about several issues, including the pilots. If anyone thinks that there is anything wrong with the security of Qantas or that Qantas is not a great airline, go and fly on American Airlines. If you want to frighten yourself, go and fly on some of the other overseas airlines in their domestic situation—they are scary. This is not about lowering the safety standards. This is about not being obstinate. This is not about the old days when if you wanted to impress your girlfriend you took her up the front and put her in the jump seat, or about any passenger that was a bit starry eyed asking to go up and sit next to the pilot. This is about common sense. This is about assisting pilots who want to get home when there is no room in the back of the plane. This is about adding to security, not taking away from security.
The shadow minister, Warren Truss, did write to the minister and ask for a written commitment to extend the prescribed class of persons able to enter the aircraft to include off-duty crew or employees of the aircraft operator, not to someone who had taken a fancy to someone in the back of the plane. And if anyone thinks there is something wrong with the qualifications and the ability of airline pilots to be in command of the aircraft then they should not be flying in the aircraft. Our pilots are well qualified and well drilled in emergency procedures, and that has been demonstrated many times in recent days. Mr Truss also asked for a written commitment to be provided to remove the strict liability provisions. I will not go on about those because enough has been said. The pilots, in writing to the minister, simply set out a similar position. Obviously, the pilots who have been to see me were disappointed they were not consulted in the way they should have been. I have here the opinion of Bret Walker SC, which I have distributed and I would like to table in due course.
I do not doubt that Minister Anthony Albanese wants to maintain security at the highest level and I do not doubt that there has been a bureaucratic trail of indecision on this. That has been demonstrated this week. This could have been fixed up earlier in the week, as many people have said, and I think that it can be brought back in six months. As I understand it, if anyone thinks that prior to February this year there was not the security that there is now, they ought to think again. But in talking about airport security, I have full confidence in the pilot to make the right decisions and full confidence in our air security officials to make sure that security levels are high.
But there is a doubt level—not as to aircraft but as to airports. There is an ICAC inquiry underway in Sydney as to the qualifications of some of the so-called security guards who do other guard duties—not the internals of the aircraft though they are the last people to leave the aircraft after the cleaners. These people are subject to an inquiry. If the government wants to do something useful, instead of attacking the pilots, who are well-qualified, they could go and have a look at some of the airport security people who do dodgy tests where the answers are supplied to the questions before you get the questions. That has been demonstrated many times. The same companies that provide some of the labour to these security situations also provide it to the military installations. I will not name the companies to the point of embarrassment because the matter is the subject of an ICAC inquiry, but there are some dubious practices at other levels in security.
But one area where there are no dubious practices and where there is full focus on the safe flying of aircraft and the safety of the passengers and the provision of good service is in the cockpit. So this is not about airport security. I think that it has been a bureaucratic blunder and it ought to be sorted out.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-09-10,"—I thank my colleagues for their contributions and I think that Senator Heffernan summed it all up pretty well. This is a bureaucratic blunder and it needs to be sorted out. Let us look at where the priorities are. I will just comment on what Senator Ludwig said. I trust Senator Ludwig on most things because he is a trustworthy person, but if it is a question of aircraft security I will trust the pilots. Senator Ludwig says that this will close a dangerous loophole. Well, it is dangerous for this regulation to stand given what the airline pilots have said about it.
I also think that it is very unfortunate that the government has gone down the path of invoking the terrible events of the September 11 terrorist attacks and those who were convicted only recently in the United Kingdom who were planning to blow up a number of transatlantic aircraft. So do not invoke September 11. Do not invoke terrorist attacks and planned terrorist attacks as some sort of shield to say that this is a good piece of regulation. I think it is clear that all of us want to maximise airline security and safety of passengers, but it is about how we do it and the best way of achieving it.
If the government wants to fix this up, it involves, effectively, two lines in the regulations: get rid of strict liability, and allow other pilots to sit in the jump seat—and this can be brought back very quickly. Let us reflect on what the airline pilots have said. They have said that there has been a lack of consultation and what I have been told by Australian airline pilots in relation to this is that there was no consultation on the development of these regulations with the airline pilots as required by the Legislative Instruments Act. Australian airline pilots were not advised of the development of this legislative instrument or given the opportunity to contribute to the development of a regulation that relates directly to their area of expertise and imposes criminal liability upon them. Going back to what Senator Ronaldson said about those split-second decisions, let the pilots do their job. Don’t let them have the spectre of strict liability, criminal liability, against them in terms of this.
There was no regulatory impact statement, according to the pilots, by the Office of Best Practice Regulations as required by government policy. And in terms of what Senator Back has said, Bret Walker SC has indicated that this regulatory change could have been achieved by minor amendments, but the government has not gone down that path. We have got a situation here where the pilots say that this will reduce rather than increase airline safety, that these regulations are punitive and that the regulatory change is inconsistent with global best practice. To this extent, I commend the work of Senator Wortley and Senator Back and all those who worked on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee because they have revealed what I see as significant problems with these regulations.
The Airline Pilots Association International has 58,000 members. It is based in Washington DC, and this is what they said about these proposed changes. They said:
We struggled with the issue of cockpit access here in the United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The initial government response was similar to what you are facing in Australia in the ban of all nonoperational crew members from the cockpit.
They went on to say:
We found that contrary to the intent of our regulators and legislators it did not increase safety and security but, in reality, adversely affected it.
So that is what we need to look at.
I think that what Senator Milne said about the issue of the culture of safety is important. What this will do is shift responsibility away from airline management and onto airline pilots. It is entirely counterproductive. That would be a retrograde step in terms of safety. I think that Senator Macdonald also made a number of important points in terms of the process here: it can be fixed with, effectively, two lines to resolve this once and for all.
I think that we need to sort this out. We need to do our job in the Senate to knock out these punitive regulations. They will be counterproductive in terms of airline safety. The government can go back to the drawing board and with some simple, clear and relatively minor amendments we can sort this out once and for all, and I urge all honourable senators to disallow these regulations.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,12,1,speech

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2009-09-10,"—I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2009 and the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009. The first thing that I would like to do is thank the minister for the expeditious way he has dealt with a very unfortunate and not entirely unforeseen event—the High Court striking down, in the case of Lane v Morrison, the hybrid military justice court that was established in 2007. The minister has been confronted with a very significant problem, given that people have been prosecuted and are suffering detention and that some people have left the service because of charges pursued in the court. The High Court finding the court to be unconstitutional has created, for the Minister for Defence, a very significant difficulty, one which the opposition is very keen to assist him in resolving.
I would like to revisit a little bit of the history here, because the parliament has been very, very clear, I believe. The parliament has sought to set out a path for the Australian Defence Force on this vital subject and has, to some degree, been ignored—not to a great degree but to a degree—and here we are today with the premier judicial court of the ADF having been struck down by the High Court.
We have, in the last decade, observed substantial changes in the administration of military justice in comparable jurisdictions around the world, particularly the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Australia has been conspicuous—or had been conspicuous, I should say—in not following the trend. There were very, very serious problems in Australia with respect to military justice. Indeed, many senators know this, having sat through a number of hearings and inquiries over the last seven years since I became a senator. We have seen: in 2002 and 2003, the State Coroner of Western Australia’s investigation into the Westralia fire; the 2001 Burchett inquiry into military justice in the Australian Defence Force; the 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade ‘rough justice’ inquiry; the 1999 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade military justice procedures in the ADF inquiry; the 1998 Commonwealth Ombudsman own motion investigation into how the ADF responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences; and the 1997 Abadee study into the judicial system and the Defence Force Discipline Act. They are the principal points of reference in what has been, I think, a very troubled and troubling history of military justice in the Australian Defence Force.
I remember the plight of an SAS soldier who was accused of war crimes. As a last resort and through his own strengths—and, I dare say, experiences—he came before the Senate committee and gave in-camera evidence as to what happened to him, and senators received a very wide-eyed understanding of what perils confront a person who gets on the wrong side of a process that is not equitable or just. We saw the parents and families of suicide victims inside the ADF. We saw the parents and families of those who had been victimised. We saw people who had been the subject of sexual harassment. And so it went on—a very sorry blot on what is an otherwise outstanding Defence Force.
The then Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee set about the task of trying to improve the situation. Indeed, in 2005, we set out a number of recommendations, including calling for an independent director of military prosecutions. We made 40 recommendations, and I want to talk about what some of those recommendations were. Recommendation 18 stated:
The committee recommends the Government amend the DFDA to create a Permanent Military Court capable of trying offences under the DFDA currently tried at the Court Martial or Defence Force Magistrate Level.
This was the next recommendation, 19:
The Permanent Military Court to be created in accordance with Chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution to ensure its independence and impartiality.
Judges should be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;
Judges should have tenure until retirement age.
So the parliament, including now-opposition senators, took a big, leading role through that committee, trying to chart a proper course so that we too could have someone like—if I can put it in common parlance—Major Mori, who stood up for David Hicks without fear or favour for his own career, because his Judge Advocate General’s Corps was completely separate from the military chain of command in the Marine Corps. Now, we cannot have a Major Mori in Australia, because what this hybrid court sought to do was stay within the chain of command.
A number of senators said to the department, and the government did the department’s bidding, ‘This will not work.’ We put them on notice that this was problematic. You cannot have judicial powers unless you adopt them pursuant to the Australian Constitution. But no; as is common, the Defence Force knew better! So here we are, with the Minister for Defence put in a most invidious position—I have the utmost sympathy for him and again I congratulate him on the way he has shouldered this burden that has been cast upon him—with the mess this has created for people, with penalties that have been dealt out illegally, unconstitutionally.
So it comes to this legislation. Now, the legislation is not perfect, and my good friend and colleague Senator Brandis will take up the cudgels to point to where there is cause for concern. Suffice it to say, this is the best that we could do as a transition. I give the minister my undertaking to assist him in whatever way I and we in the opposition can—and those members of the committee who are still very interested in this area—to assist in formulating a chapter III court that works properly, that is independent, so that we do not revisit this mess.
There are a number of concerns and issues with the method of resolution, none of which we can do much about. We simply offer words of caution. I will say what I am sure my friend and colleague Senator Brandis will say: detention is an area of great concern, as to whether we can substantially adopt what has gone before without acting judicially. So there are very technical issues here, but we want to be seen assisting, certainly not standing on the hose. In closing, the lesson to be learned is that the parliament was ignored and so here we are today.",SENATE,<title>MILITARY JUSTICE (INTERIM MEASURES) BILL (NO. 1) 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-09-10,"—I rise to make a brief contribution, which I think will be in substantial agreement with the previous contribution, on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2009 and the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009. The Australian Greens acknowledge the importance of acting very quickly to address the implications of the High Court invalidation of the Australian Military Court. We certainly appreciate the extreme importance of a functioning military justice system. The Australian Greens will therefore be supporting the government’s interim measures. The measures include reintroducing the former system of trials by court martial and Defence Force magistrates, and the interim legislation will also give effect to punishments—other than imprisonment—and orders that were imposed by the former Australian military court.
It is important to acknowledge, though, that the military justice system we are temporarily reverting to was abolished because it was deemed unsatisfactory. While the interim measures will seek to transpose some of the improvements adopted by the AMC—and we acknowledge that those attempts have been made—the system remains flawed and should be relied on only as a truly interim measure. So the key contribution from me this morning is really that we are seeking assurances from the government that it will be as brief an interim measure as is legislatively possible.
In establishing the AMC, the military justice system was subject to extensive review, as has been indicated, by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Following the recent High Court decision, the committee’s work, specifically the committee’s recommendation that the AMC be constituted as a chapter III court, has attracted considerable attention, as it has effectively been shown to be correct. It has also shown the importance of Senate inquiries and Senate review of these sorts of matters. The work of the committee and its recommendations should now, obviously, be revisited by the government and used to enable the government to act as quickly as possible to establish an impartial, transparent and independent military justice system.
Lane v Morrison has prompted a need for quick action, as these interim measures are. It has equally prompted a need to ensure that an effective and enduring military justice system be established. To balance the need to act, on the one hand, quickly and, on the other hand, effectively and put this matter to rest once and for all, it is essential that we recall our obligations under the ICCPR to ensure that all Australians are provided with the right to a fair trial. It is essential that we ensure that our military justice system meets the minimum guarantees for a fair trial, consistent with best practice in the civilian justice system and indeed with our obligations under international human rights law.",SENATE,<title>MILITARY JUSTICE (INTERIM MEASURES) BILL (NO. 1) 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-09-10,"—As my colleague Senator Johnston has indicated, the opposition supports both of these bills. They are of a bipartisan character, and I want to congratulate the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner, for addressing this urgent issue with appropriate dispatch. The origin of the bills, as Senator Johnston has indicated, lies in the decision of the High Court on 26 August in Lane v Morrison, when the High Court held that the Australian Military Court, which was not established under chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution, could not validly exercise judicial power for that reason and, because it was purporting to do so, its determinations were invalid.
There is a package of two bills, both of them interim. The first bill, the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2009, proposes to reinstitute on a temporary basis the pre-existing system of courts martial. The second bill, the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009, in effect deems determinations by the Australian Military Court in relation to sentence but not in relation to findings of guilt to always have been valid. As I said, the opposition supports both bills, but I just want to say a word or two about the second bill—that is, the retrospective deeming of the validity of the imposition of penalties by the Australian Military Court. I must say that it occurred to me, when I heard of the government’s intention, that there may be a constitutional problem here because the imposition of penalties is not a legislative act but a judicial act on ordinary concepts. Therefore, the imposition of penalties by the parliament would seem to be ultra vires section 1 of the Constitution, which, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, confers upon this parliament legislative power but not judicial power. Nevertheless, at my request, Senator Faulkner has been good enough to furnish to the opposition access to advice taken from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Mr Gageler SC, which addresses this matter.
The method of this legislation and the approach taken to overcome that potential constitutional problem are set out on page 5 of the explanatory memorandum, in the second paragraph. The key clause in the No. 2 bill—that is, the deeming order in relation to punishments—is clause 5. The explanatory memorandum says:
The clause is modelled on the legislative approach upheld in The Queen v Humby; Ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 131. The clause does not change the status of the punishments and orders invalidly imposed or made by the AMC, but rather effects a direct legislative alteration of rights and liabilities in the exercise of the legislative power conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament under s 51(vi) of the Constitution. The purported punishments and orders of the AMC are merely historical facts by reference to which to the clause’s alteration of rights and liabilities is made to occur.
So the approach has been by this statute—that is, the No. 2 bill—to declare that punishments that were imposed were valid not because they were the result of a judicial act which the High Court said in Lane v Morrison was invalid but rather as an exercise of the defence power under section 51(vi) of the Constitution.
I have had a look at the principal decision relied upon in support of that approach, the decision of the High Court in 1973 in Humby; Ex parte Rooney, which was a case arising under the old Matrimonial Causes Act. In that case it had been earlier held that decisions by masters of state supreme courts in relation to matrimonial causes orders were, for various reasons which I do not need to go into, invalid. So section 5(4) of the Matrimonial Causes Act was enacted, containing provisions somewhat resembling clause 5 of this bill, deeming such orders always to have been valid. The basis of it was that, under the matrimonial causes and divorce power in section 51(xxii) of the Constitution, it was competent for the Commonwealth parliament to make orders altering the status of parties and that that was not an exercise of judicial power but an exercise of legislative power under, as I said, section 51(xxii).
The opposition, let me emphasise again, supports the bill, but I do flag a concern that there is a significant difference between a legislative enactment altering or giving retrospective effect to declarations of alteration of status and a legislative enactment giving retrospective effect to penalties. The three categories of penalties which apparently have been imposed by the Australian Military Court are demotions, fines and periods of internment. I can readily accept that a demotion is an administrative act, notwithstanding that, in the historical circumstances in which these demotions occurred, they were imposed as a result of an invalid judicial determination. Plainly, the parliament, under the defence power, could give retrospective effect to a demotion without validating the purported judicial act upon which the decision had initially, but only historically, been based. Plainly as well, as it seems to me, the imposition of a fine, as long as it did not constitute the acquisition of property on other than just terms and thus violate section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, would also be regarded, well arguably, as an administrative act or perhaps a disciplinary act, not a judicial act.
I have a little more of a problem with treating an order for the internment of a person as other than a penalty imposed in consequence of a judicial act. I would of course respect of the confidentiality of Mr Gageler’s opinion, which was the basis on which it was furnished to the opposition, but appropriately the opinion was guarded in relation to that matter, although on balance he concluded that that would also fall within the type of legislative scheme approved by the High Court in Humby; ex parte Rooney. The opposition will support this legislation and we hope that it is constitutionally valid.
In closing, let me make one other point. In May this year, the government announced that it would abolish the Federal Magistrates Court. The reason given by the Attorney-General when he announced the government’s decision to abolish the Federal Magistrates Court was entirely to do with the relationship between the family law jurisdiction exercised by that court and the Family Court of Australia. So the report upon which the government’s decision was based, the so-called Semple report, concluded that the Federal Magistrates Court should be abolished because that would promote efficiencies in the family law system. As I said at the time and I say again, the government, in making that decision, gave the wrong answer to the wrong question. The question that it should have addressed is whether it was useful or serviceable for the Commonwealth to have a chapter III court of general jurisdiction in summary matters, not merely family law matters but all summary matters.
I know my friend Senator Faulkner is now seized with considering what is to happen after the interim measures expire and how the military justice system can be re-established on a surer footing. It seems to me, with respect, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this, the Lane v Morrison decision, is as plain an example as anything could be of the unwisdom of doing away with the Federal Magistrates Court, of doing away with a federal court of general summary jurisdiction. When the interim measures expire and the government has to decide with what judicial apparatus to replace the Australian Military Court and take over from the interim measures embodied in these bills, the obvious solution would be to have a military division of the Federal Magistrates Court or certain dedicated federal magistrates to deal with military justice matters.
This is but one example of the tremendous utility to the Commonwealth of having a general federal court of summary jurisdiction that can be divisionalised and can deal with all matters, including military justice matters, arising under Commonwealth law. Because of the government’s decision to do away with that court, it would seem that that option—the obvious option—has now been foreclosed. I should say that no legislation has yet been introduced into the parliament to give effect to the government’s decision to terminate the existence of the Federal Magistrates Court. I invite the government, on the basis of the lessons we have all learned from the Lane v Morrison decision of the High Court and for the reasons I have explained, to revisit that decision.",SENATE,<title>MILITARY JUSTICE (INTERIM MEASURES) BILL (NO. 1) 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-09-10,"—The two bills before us today, the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2009 and the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009, are quite urgent. I am sure the government appreciates the cooperation of the opposition in facilitating their speedy passage. The bills, as has been said by a number of speakers, are urgent simply because the High Court has found the Australian Military Court is constitutionally invalid. That is because, as we all know now, it is not established under chapter III of the Constitution but under the Defence Force Discipline Act. As a consequence, every action taken by the court since its inception is necessarily invalid. Those actions are to be revalidated by these bills, as made clear by both the EM and the various speakers to date.
I have spoken numerous times on this matter over the last five or six years, including on the adjournment earlier this week, to put some context into the debate, so today I will be very brief. The first bill re-establishes the previous court martial system for an interim period until a chapter III court can be legislated for. The second bill aims, necessarily of course, to maintain the continuity of military discipline in the meantime. The first bill reinstates courts martial and Defence Force magistrates. It establishes the positions of Chief Judge Advocate and the Registrar of Military Justice. It also includes the establishment of reviews and petitions in respect of summary trials and trials by magistrates and courts martial. It also re-establishes reviewing authorities.
The Judge Advocate-General effectively plays the role of the former Chief Military Judge. In this context, it has been very interesting to revisit the original report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and go through its findings chapter by chapter. That original report, which is really the genesis of everything that has occurred since then, made serious findings as to the administrative systems, the disciplinary system and, more particularly, the investigatory services at the root of all the problems that latterly emerged in both the administrative and the disciplinary systems. There certainly have been significant reforms to date, on both the admin side and the disciplinary side, although it is fair to comment that the work to fix up ATFIS and the investigatory services is but a work in progress and best described as slow progress. Hence it has been necessary to recreate, as an interim measure and hopefully only for a short period of time, the old systems of courts martial and Defence Force magistrates, both of which had very adverse findings made against them in that Senate report in 2005. Whilst there are probably now different personnel and there have been behavioural and cultural changes with new organisational patterns put into place, I suspect that if there was any suggestion to go back to the old system, other than as an interim measure, it would be simply unacceptable to go down that path.
The bills make provision for the transition of appeals on foot, but other consequential amendments to other acts are also required. These are set out in part 2 of the bill and relate to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act, the Judges’ Pension Act and the Migration Act. Again, there is a change in the terminology with ‘court’ to ‘court martial’ or ‘military tribunal’. In other words, the first bill seeks to restore much of the previous judicial machinery in the invalid legislation, but within the authority of a military tribunal, not a court. We surmised that for many years but we have now been reminded that that is a fact.
The second bill seeks to deal with penalties under the new interim regime to make sure that they are consistent with the invalid scheme. This is important for the sake of continuity. Importantly, the second bill seeks to preserve the disciplinary measures formally imposed by the now invalid court. The explanatory memorandum on clause 5 states:
In respect of punishment purportedly imposed or order purportedly made, the clause declares the rights and liabilities of all persons to be, and always to have been, the same as if the amended DFDA had been in force and the punishment had been imposed by a general court martial ...
For those concerned at the law on this matter, I refer them to page 5 of the EM. And for those who might think that just as the court has been invalidated so too are its penalties, let me again quote the EM. It says:
... the rights and liabilities of all persons are ... the same as if the punishment or order of the AMC had been imposed or made by a properly constituted court martial and confirmed by command review.
It is likewise for dismissal.
No doubt this interim bill of stopgap measures will contain some uncertainties, but at least a gap in the military discipline scheme has been filled. In my view—and this has been made clear by opposition speakers and will be made clear by the minister in due course—there is no other option in the short term, but it is salutary to acknowledge that not all of the reforms will be wasted by this means.
Finally, it is appropriate at this stage, as we enter a new chapter in addressing the problems of military justice, to place on record—and in no particular order—the fine work that has been done by Senator Hutchins, former Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Marise Payne and Senator David Johnston in their former capacities and lives. They have over many years taken a continuing interest in matters associated with military justice. They have devoted many hours to this work and have participated in various inquiries concerning it. They have all made significant and sustained contributions to this issue over time, and it is worthwhile to place that on the record.",SENATE,<title>MILITARY JUSTICE (INTERIM MEASURES) BILL (NO. 1) 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-09-10,"—in reply—In summing up the debate on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2009 and Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009 I want to begin by thanking those senators who have contributed to the second reading debate and also the Senate for supporting what is a very urgent piece of legislation.
As we have heard, on 26 August 2009, the High Court declared that the provisions establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid. The purpose of bill No. 1 is to return to the service tribunal system that existed before the creation of the Australian Military Court. In summing up on the bills, I want to stress: this is an interim measure. These two bills contain those very important words in their titles. This is an interim measure until the government can legislate for a chapter III court, which it will do as a matter of priority.
To re-establish an effective military justice system, the pre-2007 Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 will be reinstated. These measures include courts martial and Defence Force magistrates, positions of Chief Judge Advocate, judge advocates and the Registrar of Military Justice, reviews and petitions in respect of both summary trials and trials held by courts martial or Defence Force magistrates and reviewing authorities.
Transitional provisions will be inserted into the DFDA to cover all matters that have been referred to the AMC but were not concluded prior to 26 August 2009. The provisions will also address the AMC office holders, including among other things provisions for their automatic transition to the relevant positions of Chief Judge Advocate, members of the Judge Advocates Panel and Registrar of Military Justice.
The main object of bill No. 2 is to maintain the continuity of discipline in the Defence Force in the light of the High Court’s decision. The principal mechanism by which this bill seeks to maintain the continuity of discipline within the ADF is by imposing disciplinary sanctions on persons corresponding to punishments imposed by the AMC and, to the extent necessary, summary authorities in the period between the AMC’s establishment and the declaration of invalidity by the High Court of Australia.
This bill does not purport to validate any convictions or punishments imposed by the AMC, nor does the bill purport to convict any person of any offence. Rather, the bill, by its own force, purports to impose disciplinary sanctions. The bill does not purport to impose any liability in relation to imprisonment and further, consistent with the exclusively disciplinary purpose of its provisions, the bill is expressed to have effect for service purposes only. In other words, the bill will not affect an individual ADF member’s civilian rights and entitlements. The bill recognises that there may be circumstances in which a person affected by a disciplinary liability imposed by the bill wishes to contest whether that liability should remain imposed. The bill gives all affected persons a right to seek review of their case and whether they should remain liable under the act, and the reviewing authority is given power to discharge persons from such liability. In cases where the disciplinary liability imposed by the bill relates to detention, a serious disciplinary measure—I think it is fair to say it is peculiar to the ADF—the bill requires automatic review by the reviewing authority to determine whether that disciplinary liability should be discharged.
Senator Brandis mentioned, in his contribution, legal advice the government has received from the Solicitor-General. The legal advice from the Solicitor-General, I can say to the Senate, is that the Commonwealth parliament can, in the exercise of the defence power, directly alter the rights and liabilities of members of the Defence Force by imposition of disciplinary punishments and orders.
The No. 2 bill is modelled, as we have heard, on a legislative approach upheld by the High Court in R v Humby; Ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR, and that was again endorsed in Re Macks; Ex parte Saint (2000) 204 CLR 158. Sentences of imprisonment awarded by the AMC were served in civilian prison facilities but the punishment of detention is a peculiarly military punishment. It is served in dedicated detention facilities such as No. 1 Defence Force correctional establishment at Holsworthy and has as its primary purpose to rehabilitate ADF members  back into the Australian Defence Force.
As I have mentioned, and I want to restate very clearly to the Senate in this second reading debate, the government is in the process of establishing a military justice court which complies with chapter III of the Constitution. I can also assure the Senate again that it is my intention and the government’s intention that that be done as a matter of priority. I again thank senators for the contributions they have made to debate on this bill. I thank the opposition and those who sit on the crossbenches for their cooperation in enabling this bill to be dealt with as a matter of urgency in the Senate. I conclude m remarks by commending the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-09-10,"—I rise to speak in response to the proposed Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 4) Bill 2009 and confirm that the coalition will be supporting this bill. It amends various tax laws and has five schedules. I want to address each of them briefly. The first schedule deals with increases to the research and development expenditure cap for determining eligibility for the R&D tax offset from $1 million to $2 million. It should be noted here that the R&D tax offset was an initiative of the Howard government in order to assist innovation amongst small businesses, a constituency we support, and to assist those small businesses that do not benefit from the R&D tax concession, especially those in a tax loss position. This is because we do understand very clearly the importance of cash flow to small businesses and the difficulties it can pose when small business is seeking to invest in R&D.
The second schedule improves the integrity of prescribed private funds. The changes effectively mean that such funds will now be treated similarly to other fundraising organisations known as public ancillary funds. To reflect this change, the prescribed private funds will be renamed as public ancillary funds. We note that within this schedule provisions exist for the Treasurer to issue guidelines governing the creation and regulation of these funds, and a range of administrative penalties have been introduced which may be applied to enforce the guidelines. However, we further note that the schedule does not provide for any changes to the mandatory distribution rate which many in the not-for-profit industry have been concerned about, as it does severely affect the ongoing nature of these funds. It is our understanding that Treasury has undertaken consultation relating to draft guidelines. I think it was during July of this year.
The coalition encourages the government to listen carefully to industry concerns regarding this matter in order to avoid any of the funds being frozen, as opposed to setting off on a course with their own policy prescriptions. We only need to look at the problems which arose from the changes to employee share schemes back on budget night as an illustration of the fact that not listening carefully to industry and to stakeholders can have very unintended and very adverse consequences.
The third schedule provides capital gains tax relief to members of friendly societies which demutualise. Such changes help to ensure that these societies are treated the same as standalone private health insurers or life insurers if they decide to demutualise. This schedule effectively means that friendly societies which demutualise into a for-profit entity will not be liable for capital gains tax on any shares they may receive; as well as providing amendments to ensure that those who receive cash through demutualisation are treated exactly the same as those who receive shares and immediately sell them.
The fourth schedule allows for the losses of an entity joining a consolidated group to be transferred to the head company of that group. It is interesting that changes to the consolidation regime just keep coming. I well remember kicking off the whole process of consolidation. With such a major change it is to be expected that there would be some need to continue finetuning, and that will happen with this amendment. It is a retrospective change to the consolidation regime which takes effect from 1 July 2002. The amendment will allow the head company to use the tax loss to reduce a net forgiven amount derived under the commercial debt forgiveness rules; any capital allowance that has been adjusted using the limited recourse debt rules; and any capital gain in the situation where a capital gains tax event L5 occurs when the joining entity then leaves the consolidated group.
The final schedule deals with minor amendments addressing some areas and anomalies within the existing tax legislation. It is a tidying up schedule. I again confirm the coalition’s support for the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 4) Bill 2009. It is a very sensible process, even though it sometimes can be difficult for those members of the public who are not closely engaged in some of the minutiae and technicalities of the operation of the tax law to understand the so-called TLABs. But it is a necessary ongoing process to improve the operation of the tax law and it has the coalition’s support.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-09-10,"—I rise today to indicate that the Greens will be supporting the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 4) Bill 2009 but we will be moving some amendments. Senator Brown has some amendments that will be moved in the Committee of the Whole and I wish to now foreshadow an amendment that I will be moving in the Committee of the Whole in conjunction with Senator Joyce, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate. I welcome the fact that Senator Joyce is joining me and that the Greens and the Nationals are again working together on the issue of carbon sink forests.
I remind the Senate that when the government determined to provide a 100 per cent upfront tax deduction for the planting of carbon sink forests in Australia I mounted a considerable campaign against that, as did the Nationals at the time. I indicated that the managed investment schemes had been a disaster for rural Australia and that carbon sink forests would essentially be managed investment schemes on steroids. Unfortunately, at the time the government and the Liberal Party combined to argue that the managed investment scheme and carbon sink tax deductions were warranted, in spite of the evidence to the contrary.
I alerted the Senate to the fact that every time a tax bill came before the Senate henceforth I would stand up and move the same amendment until such time as the parliament recognised the disaster that is happening in rural Australia because of the tax rorts that have been set up by successive governments. It was the coalition that brought in the managed investment scheme tax deduction and it is the Labor government that has brought in the carbon sink forest tax deduction. Together they continue to support what is effectively a completely failed scheme.
The reality is that plantation managed investment schemes have quadrupled the cost of growing wood in Australia. They are an unnecessary drain on the public purse. Plantation managed investment schemes are boom and bust by nature, because the investment in wood is driven by the demand for tax minimisation, not wood market realities. The combination of investment driven by demand for tax minimisation and highly profitable MIS plantation companies receiving their income upfront has generated a hardwood chip glut.
An investigation of late 1990s hardwood plantation prospectus documents—and this is according to Dr Judith Ajani—revealed a wide chasm between chip and paper market expectations and actual market realities. With prospectus company profits not pinned primarily to revenue from wood sales, there is little commercial motivation for them to invest in rigorous market research or to respond to wood market realities. Dr Ajani points out that, if the Commonwealth government decides to engage in tackling the woodchip glut and acknowledging its substantial hand in creating the arrangements that generated the glut, it will need to attend to the entrenched alliance between the bureaucracy and the forest lobby groups. In particular, it must rise above a handful of lobbyists who peddle perceptions of wood shortages, including on the domestic front, through misrepresenting the wood and wood products trade deficit despite the hardwood chip glut.
What she recommends is that the Commonwealth government terminate immediately the arrangements enabling plantation managed investment schemes. Further, she recommends that the Commonwealth terminates its policy of tripling Australia’s plantation estates by 2020, that the Commonwealth should engage in tackling the woodchip glut by stopping the logging of native forests in Australia, that plantation managed investment schemes should be investigated more deeply than has occurred in the parliamentary committees and that the carbon sink forest legislation be revisited in the light of the plantation MIS corporate and system failure.
That is what I am doing today. I am revisiting in this Senate the fact that the MISs failed and that from one end of Australia to another—from the Queensland sugar fields to the Tasmanian dairy industry—there is ample evidence that agricultural land prices go up, water scarcity occurs with higher water prices in the water market, there is a loss of viability in rural towns and there is a loss of land to food production. And instead of addressing it and stopping it, we now have a Senate report saying that the 100 per cent tax deduction for managed investment schemes should stay and the carbon sink forests investment should say.
People might wonder why the Greens would be opposed to carbon sink forests. They are not carbon sink forests; they are plantations. There is no requirement for these forests to be biodiverse in nature—none at all. The regulatory framework is that of the states, and we have seen a complete failure of the states to regulate. We still do not have groundwater assessments in a state like Tasmania. We still do not know what the implications for groundwater are. We have seen catchments cleared of native forest and planted with plantations. Now, under the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, not only would you be able to get a 100 per cent tax deduction for planting a carbon sink forest but you would also be rewarded under the CPRS in terms of the credits that you would get—never mind what that might do to water in the community, food production, the viability of those rural communities or the whole ecosystem.
There is no doubt that there are parts of Australia that should be planted with biodiverse plantings for the longer term. But there are no specifications in these carbon sink forests provisions that the trees have to be in the ground for anything like 100 years, that they have to be diverse or that they have to be on marginal land. We hear the government say, ‘Oh, it’s not going to be very much in terms of hectares, therefore you’re worrying unnecessarily.’ Wrong—absolutely wrong. There is no restriction. What we know is that the best land with the best rainfall grows the best trees. If you want to maximise the carbon that you store in a carbon sink forest for the purposes of carbon trading then you will be putting those carbon sink forests on the land where you bulk up the carbon fastest. That is the reality. Just like with managed investment schemes, you will get a whole lot of sharks operating as middlemen in this market. You will see people operating in the carbon market and growing the trees for the carbon and not being in the least bit interested in what the ramifications are for the rural communities in which they operate.
I cannot emphasise enough that the government refused to negotiate on these matters and in relation to biodiversity in particular. Since the legislation came in, we have now had a whole analysis of greenhouse gas mitigation and carbon biosequestration opportunities for rural land use. It sounds great. But when you go into it you find that the estimates of area that could be covered in carbon sink forests are huge. If you look at this report, you see a figure of 20 million or 30 million hectares that they are proposing will be used for carbon sink forests. Where in Australia are you going to have the rainfall to cover 20 million hectares of land, that is not currently in some form of agricultural production, with these so-called carbon sink forests? And why would I assume for a moment that these plantings would be biodiverse? There is no substance at all in this claim. Yet again, the plantation industry companies have another rort coming. You would have thought that this parliament might have learnt something from the collapse of Timbercorp and of Great Southern. But, no, apparently we have learnt nothing and want to continue with 100 per cent tax deductions for planting more plantations while at the same time adding this on top of it.
The government says that it cannot be rorted like the managed investment schemes. Yes, it can, because it allows the aggregation upfront of all of the costs associated with establishing a carbon sink forest. Just as with managed investment schemes, you can include all of the costs, including water licences and land. The government says, ‘No, you can’t include land’, but, as the Senate will recall, I brought in advice from a senior tax barrister in Australia saying that the capital cost of land is included, plus the cost of water, plus the establishment costs—all of the costs associated can be put together and claimed upfront as a 100 per cent tax deduction. That is why I said that you will get exactly the same rorts appearing, along with the middlemen and the commissions being paid. All the costs will be aggregated upfront so that the 100 per cent tax deduction is there and so on and so forth. I cannot emphasise to the Senate enough what a terrible idea this is. I find it extraordinary. There is no rational explanation out there at all as to why this parliament is continuing with the 100 per cent tax deduction for MIS plantations and adding this on the back of it.
I note in today’s Financial Review that there is a push on from the Victorian and New South Wales governments to include offsets for a voluntary carbon trading system and offsets for agricultural land in terms of carbon stores. I say to these people: watch what you ask for, because you might get it—and, if you do, you are going to be in real trouble because a voluntary carbon market that allows people to opt in is going to continue to exacerbate this problem. And it is only going to be for a small amount of time because you will have to account for your emissions. It is all very well to say, ‘We will get a credit for the carbon sink forest upfront’, but you will also be given the cost of your emissions, and when there is a drought rural Australia releases huge amounts of carbon emissions. If people think that you can just get credit for the carbon you take up but you are not penalised for the carbon you release, think again because any accounting system that has any integrity has to have both sides of the equation. So be careful here because, if you want to rush in with half of it, you might get governments to be supportive of you in the short term but you will find that full carbon accounting is what is required. Therefore, you have to add up what your net emissions are likely to be in that balance and go out and get some assessment done of the real emissions coming out of rural Australia in the midst of a drought.
I think there are some very great issues to be considered here. That is why the Greens have said all along that we think agriculture should be out and there should be a parallel mechanism for green carbon, which is a fully autonomous system that rewards the right things and penalises emissions. It will actually provide some internal consistency and not just allow the opting in of plantations, which will drive investment in plantations in these carbon sink forests. Because the current accounting system does not account for the logging of forests you are going to end up with the plantations being grown for wood production ending up as carbon stores and the native forests, which ought to be carbon stores, are going to have logging driven deeper and deeper into them because the accounting system does not require you to account for the emissions from that logging. That is completely the reverse of what was supposedly talked about with this plantation vision. The whole idea behind it was that Australia would get its wood products from plantations and not from native forests—we would get out of native forests. That has not happened and this is going to drive a further complete distortion in the market.
I return to the point that I was making at the beginning in terms of profitability here. Everyone is rushing around assuming that these plantations are going to be profitable, either in the carbon market or in the wood market, in terms of managed investment schemes, and that there is absolutely no justification, when you have a look at what is actually happening on the global market, to substantiate the claims in terms of hard cash realities and returns.
I think it is time we had a very good look at who the government is listening to. We have a greenhouse mafia in Australia where people go in a revolving door from the coal industry into ministerial offices, then become lobbyists and then go into the department for a while—and round and round they go, giving one another the same advice. We have exactly the same thing here: from government to forest lobbying. Alan Cummine, for example, used to be an adviser to environment minister Ros Kelly. He went across to the forest lobbies through Australian Forest Growers, Treefarm Investment Managers Australia, and Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council. Allan Hansard went from ABARE and DAFF across to the National Association of Forest Industries. Miles Prosser went from state forests in New South Wales over to NAFI, Plantations Australia and A3P. Richard Stanton from DAFF and state forests in New South Wales went over to NAFI and then A3P, the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council. Phil Townsend went from DAFF across to NAFI, to Tree Plantations Australia and then to ANU—round and round the revolving door goes. And what a surprise that they all give one another the same advice! Not only do they go round and round but they spin off occasionally into the carbon fossil sector, where you have Robin Bain, who used to work for NAFI, for Timber Communities, which used to be called the Forest Protection Society or whatever. She has gone across to be the chief lobbyist for the cement industry. It is a beautiful thing—round and round they go, giving one another the advice they want to hear.
I think it is about time the government actually had a look at the real economies that are facing people in the plantation sector. Contrary to the idea that we need more plantations, we actually have a glut of plantations. Isn’t it time someone actually had a look at the realities of that? We do not want to complicate matters further by giving people a 100 per cent tax deduction to drive the investment for tax minimisation purposes and not because they are the least bit interested in doing anything about the climate or ecosystem resilience. No, just as we have managed investment schemes, the primary interest is going to be tax minimisation. Once you take away the investor from the outcome by putting tax minimisation in the middle, you end up with rorting of the system, and that is exactly what is going to happen here. So I implore the Senate to join the Greens and the National Party in using this opportunity in this tax bill to get rid of the 100 per cent tax deduction for carbon sink forests. I would be more than happy to take an amendment from the government or the Liberal Party to amend it further to get rid of the 100 per cent tax deduction for managed investment schemes, while I am at it. I would be very happy to accommodate that should anyone decide to assist me in this process and move that.
Nevertheless, this is just adding insult to injury. I urge the Senate to support the opportunity that is given here to the people of Australia through their parliament to stop this rort and go back and recognise that, if we are to deal with climate change, and deal with it sensibly in terms of land use, the first thing we would do is stop the logging of native forests around Australia and rehabilitate native forest areas that are degraded. The next thing we would do is stop land clearance of native vegetation. The next thing we would do is build resilience in those ecosystems by getting connectivity in the landscape and creating jobs in rural and regional Australia in those rehabilitation activities.
You could give people on the land a payment for their stewardship of dealing with weeds and feral animals and restoring native vegetation on their properties. That could be a mechanism. Anything to do with green carbon needs to support people doing the restoration work that is needed to be done in rural Australia. So many people are already doing this through Landcare and voluntary programs, but if they were supported in doing it then they would be able to do it in a more comprehensive way than they currently are able to.
You would plant out some biodiverse areas as carbon in the longer term to give you improvements in productivity on your property and to improve biodiversity, but this is not the way to do it. A tax rort will not guarantee any environmental, biodiversity or carbon outcomes; all it will guarantee is more land being taken out of food production, exacerbating the problems that are already out there because of MISs. We will see them on an even grander scale because this continues to stand.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-09-10,"—The National Party have been very clear on the measures pertaining to carbon sink forests. In fact, we lost Senator Nash from her shadow position because of our position on this. It is extremely important that we remain consistent in our opposition to carbon sink forests. We are not going to be fighting every time a TLAB comes up. We have put our position on the record twice. I think everybody can work out from that exactly where we stand. We do not intend for it to be used as a wedge in the future. In this instance we were happy to approach Senator Milne when we saw the amendment on sheet 5906 tabled because it does reflect our sentiments.
The amendment relates to tax deductibility for carbon sinks. I say to the people who sent us here that we will not be supporting—and we will do everything in our power to make sure this does not happen—taking prime agricultural land out of food production and moving it to a carbon sink. That is wrong. It works against market principles. It is against ethical principles. It is an infliction on the local economies where this comes about, and I refer specifically to Tully and other cane-growing areas. A mill needs certain tonnage for it to operate. Policies such as these put that under threat. Last time this came up we tried as hard as we possibly could to get an exemption for prime agricultural land, but it went nowhere. Therefore, we had no other option but to oppose it.
Unless humankind is going to evolve into a higher form of termite, there is no point in carbon sink legislation taking prime agricultural land out of production. There is the potential for 20 million hectares to become carbon sink forests. In the regular parlance of regional areas, that is 50 million acres. That is larger than our wheat crop. This is an absurd predicament for our nation to be put in.
We looked at the legislation at the start—and there was discussion around it—and it did say that capital expenditure was tax-deductible upfront for a carbon sink forest. Expenditure is either capital or income—there is no other place for it to be. Capital expenditure includes the price of the land. It is a capital item. It goes on the books as capital. We asked for that to be better prescribed in the legislation, but it was not, so it remains there. This remains a problem.
It is terribly important when people like Senator Nash lose their position over this that our position remains consistent. The National Party has no problems with carbon sink forests. If people want carbon sink forests, they can have carbon sink forests, but why do they have to have an upfront tax deduction for them? If they believe they stand the test of market principles then put them on the market with other things, such as sugarcane, pineapples, beef, wheat and sheep.
When you create an imperfection in the marketplace you put other people who live in the same district and have to compete with them at a distinct disadvantage. It is peculiar that on one side of a fence a person will be growing food to feed a very hungry world and be involved in the tax system like everybody else while on the other side of the fence a person will plant a forest and produce nothing for the hungry world but get an upfront tax deduction. That is bizarre. We have to bell the cat on this one and say, ‘If you want a carbon sink forest, go right ahead, but stand in line with everybody else and make sure that it stands the principles for which it is put forward.’
If this legislation achieves its objective of 20 to 30 million hectares of carbon sink forests, it could bring about the decimation of so many regional towns. Sugar mills will reach their critical mass of tonnage and shut down. All the rest of the sugar farmers will suffer because of the sins of some who exploit a perverse section of the tax act. People will go out of business not because of the global recession or global warming but because of a peculiarity in the tax act. That is not right. That is not just. Obviously, once the sugar mill closes, the chemist will leave and the school will close. The National Party will always fight for the people who are left behind, even though they are small in numbers, in these enclaves of poverty and destitution that are brought about by the unnecessary hand of government coming into their lives.
Similarly, the wholesale or complete purchase of water licences in a certain area causes massive problems. You can purchase some of a water licence from an area, but if you go into an area and purchase the whole of the water licence, then it is all very well for the person whose water licence is sold but it is not very good for all the people who live in the fibro-and-iron or weatherboard-and-iron houses in the towns that surround it. They are left with no hope and with no future. It is not a fair or a just outcome.
In the case of this legislation, it is not about purchasing the water licence; it is about a mechanism for turning the construct and the application of the land into something which does not support the regional economy in any way, shape or form. If it is a carbon sink forest, I imagine we are not milling it, therefore there are no timber jobs. If it is a carbon sink forest, therefore we are not cultivating it; therefore we do not need an economist, we do not need a sugar mill, we do not need a chemist, we do not need a school, we do not need the infrastructure. In the National Party we believe in the support of regional towns and we are the party of regional Australia, so as a core position we could not support a movement in the tax act that would be completely and utterly to the detriment of people living in that regional area. And, to add insult to injury, the benefactor of the carbon sink forest will possibly be someone living in an urban metropolitan area, maybe even overseas. It would be taking the wealth associated with that area that benefited the people in that area and, by a movement in the tax act, moving the benefaction of that area to a person in an urban area or overseas and, in the same breath, removing the capacity to produce food to feed a hungry planet. It just does not stack up as a piece of legislation.
We implored the government to be part of the process of moving strategic amendments so that that would not be the case. We were willing to find a middle ground. We said: ‘If you want to have a carbon sink forest on lesser agricultural land, sure, let’s work out how we can do that. If mankind can put a man on the moon, I am sure we can devise an amendment that will fulfil that proposition.’ But we ran up against an almost die-in-the-ditch mentality, one of: ‘Thou shalt not discern or describe prime agricultural land. We can’t go forward with this amendment because it’s too difficult.’ Apparently it is not too difficult to give people an upfront tax deduction, but it is far too difficult to excise prime agricultural land so that we can go back to these regional towns and say, ‘You are not at threat; this is going to be used on lesser agricultural land.’ Everybody always used as a metaphor that it was only going to use lesser agricultural land, that it was going to be used in deserts and up ridges and in caves which no-one goes to, and they would say, ‘Don’t worry, it’ll never affect you.’ The reality is that it does. The reality is that the application of the legislation has been and is being seen as applying to prime agricultural land. That is where it is going. Why? Because people want to utilise what provides the greatest capacity to increase their potential for a carbon credit by bringing about the greatest increase in the weight of carbon per acre of land. Where are you going to do that? You are going to do that in areas which enable the growth of carbon, which is seen in trees, and that is land with the appropriate soil, the appropriate rainfall and the appropriate area—and, ladies and gentlemen, that is prime agricultural land.

Senator Milne interjecting—

—It is similar to MISs. To be honest, MISs have been a big problem in many areas. I can understand that there are arguments, and I will not disagree with the Greens on this, of the worth of MISs maybe in Tasmania, but in other areas they have been a huge problem. They are an unnecessary influence once more of the hand of government coming in and prescribing winners and losers and creating differentiation and opportunity by reason of a fence line—and that is strange. If people want to go to undeveloped areas in undeveloped markets, then maybe you have an arguable case. But to go to an area which is developed and has a developed market, and the effect of your legislation is to swamp the market with a product, then that just works against all the other people who have made sacrifices to be in that market. That is a kind of badness, but at least they are generally producing something that has an employment outcome or a food outcome. So it is the lesser of two evils because at least you have a food outcome or an employment outcome or some form of production coming off that land. What carbon sink legislation does is just throw the whole lot out the window. What you are left with is towns in the form of Hansel and Gretel destitution: the house in the middle of the forest is apparently the desired outcome. That is entirely unfair for the people who live in the area.
So today we will once more stand to repeal section 40J of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. That is the capacity for upfront tax deduction and the tax deductibility status of carbon sink forests. There are other amendments proposed by the Greens; with due respect, we will not be supporting those. But we are making a clear statement that will spell out once more to the Australian public that this is an issue that we brought up at the start and that we have been consistent about. We have voted in a consistent way and we will vote in a consistent way today. I acknowledge also the sacrifice that Senator Nash has made because of her stand on this. For the future it is on the record once we have dealt with this today and the Australian people will know where we stand. Every time this issue comes up we are not going to vote in this way because it then becomes a wedge and it is used as a wedge mechanism. By doing this today we are clearly saying to the Australian people and to this chamber: we must once more readdress this carbon sink issue. We are pleading for a more pragmatic and practical approach to this: go into it, find a definition of prime agricultural land, excise prime agricultural land so it is not covered by this and then you will solve so many problems. Once we have that definition of prime agricultural land then, yes, there are other areas in agriculture that could be utilised.
In the history of land tenure in such places such as New South Wales, once an area had been cultivated mining was proscribed. Provisions such as these, over a period of time, have been whittled away and whittled away, but we have a responsibility, as one of the great food-producing nations of this lonely planet, to produce food to feed people. We have a responsibility to make sure that those people who make the sacrifice to produce the food are looked after. We have a responsibility to promote that production of food as something that is morally good, just and right. The efforts of this chamber should be to engender a sense of support for the people who produce the food that feeds the planet.
But when we come up with legislation like this we might hear someone who is probably doing it extremely tough in a regional area saying: ‘I get up every morning and I work with my hands to fix the tractor—to put new pistons in it—and to feed the stock. I live on the barest minimum of a margin. My family’—it is the case in many instances—‘live at the lower end of the social spectrum because of the effort they put in.’ Instead of saying: ‘We know the sacrifice you make. What you are doing is incredibly just and good and should be promoted and we will stand by you because of that,’ we say to them: ‘We will give an upfront tax deduction to the person who does nothing but plants trees in the paddock next door so that that area can grow wild and be infested with pigs. We put more worth on that forest—that scrub or, in many cases, that mess—than we do on your getting out of bed in the morning and trying to achieve a just outcome by feeding Australia and the world.’ We make that statement when we put up pieces of legislation like this.
It is our job in the National Party to say, ‘No, that is not the metaphor that we will sell to the Australian people.’ We are saying that it is more just and proper to give a tax deduction to the person who feeds people—who puts food on the Australian table—than to have an arbitrary, uninspired tax deduction that has come out of the workshop of some inner-city accountants and found its way onto our nation’s books as legislation. That is not what this country is about. That is why the National Party today says: ‘No, we will reinvest in this message. We will sell it back to the Australian people. We will say, “For goodness sake, this is ridiculous.”’ As I said at the start, unless you believe that the Australian people will develop into a higher form of termite then you have nothing in this legislation but a problem for them.
It is unusual that the National Party and the Greens are as one on an issue but today is the day that I concur with their remarks. It just goes to show, also, the dynamism of this chamber and that this chamber has the capacity, on issues, to reflect the intent of those people who sent us here. It shows that this chamber has the capacity to make sure that those people who sent us here are supported through the way we vote. At a later stage, in the Committee of the Whole, I will commend this amendment and I will call on the government to see sense, to promote justice and not to stand by a proposition that a tax deduction for an urban constituent who will never actually see the farm is more just and worthwhile than supporting a person who works on the barest minimum margin and puts their family and their life in an area where they at an inherent financial disadvantage. We would be adding insult to injury to say, ‘Not only do we believe that you can live almost in poverty and destitution because your margins are so tight—you are being squeezed out by the margins of the major retailers and other such people who stand over you—but we believe that the government should be standing over you and rubbing your nose in it.’ The government will be saying, ‘If you did nothing but planted trees and wandered away, that would be an inherently better outcome than your producing food and feeding people.’",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-09-10,"—Last year I crossed the floor on this issue because I absolutely believe that there should not be tax deductions for carbon sink forests. And over the intervening period of time I have not changed my view one bit. I fully support the amendment that is being put forward today and concur with all of the remarks that my leader, Senator Joyce, has just put forward to the chamber.
Colleagues, we need to have a debate in this country about whether or not we want a sustainable rural and regional Australia, because it certainly seems, from the actions that are being put forward through the instigation of the tax breaks for carbon sink forests, that we are completely ignoring the future of regional Australia. This is about the sustainability of regional communities. This is absolutely about having a viable future for rural and regional Australia. And we need that. As my very good colleague Senator Joyce has already pointed out, we are feeding not only ourselves but the rest of the world, and our capacity to be able to do that has to increase, not decrease.
When you look at what the legislation does you see that it is completely unfair and inequitable in how it treats regional communities. We are not saying, and we never have said, that there should not be carbon sink forests. We are absolutely supportive of them. What we have said is that there should not be a tax break to put those forests in that goes to the big end of town. Why on earth would we do that? Our role as the National Party is to make sure that we stick up for, and go into bat for, regional communities and make sure that there is fairness and equity for the people and the working families living in those communities. The legislation that is in place simply does not do that. Why on earth would we expect the taxpayers of Australia—the working mums and dads—to give a tax break to the big end of town to put in carbon sink forests?
These forests are on our prime agricultural land. This is one of the key issues. The population across the globe is going to increase by, I think, 50 per cent by 2030. We are one of the few countries that actually has the ability to increase its productive capacity. So not only do we have a responsibility to ensure that we can feed ourselves as a nation; we have a particular responsibility to provide for developing nations across the world also. Yet we have a piece of legislation in place which does precisely the opposite. As someone mentioned to me just a couple of weeks ago, we are at risk of becoming a nation of forests, energy plants and mines. We do not want that to happen. We need to ensure that the productive capacity is there. Why on earth would we put at risk our food security?
We are very supportive, obviously, of this amendment today to get rid of this tax break on carbon sink forests. As my good colleague Senator Joyce has already pointed out, we are not going to go on and on with this every time it comes back to the chamber, but it is extremely important that people across this nation, particularly people in rural and regional communities, know that we are absolutely rock-solid in our view that those communities need our assistance and know that we will stand up for them in this place time and again to make sure that they get the fairness and equity and the bright and sustainable future that they deserve. They are the ones that feed and clothe and provide for this nation, and it is about time the farmers across this nation got the respect they deserve for what they do. It is very easy to say, ‘We’ll whack in a whole lot of carbon sink forests; that prime agricultural land disappearing doesn’t really matter too much.’ But it does matter. Unless we want to become a nation that predominantly imports, we need to look after those farmers on the land who are producing for us.
Let us look at the scenario if we did become a predominantly importing nation. There are two very clear and distinct reasons we should not do that. One is about security in the quality assurance of those foods that come into this nation. You only have to look at the melamine issue in China to know that we do not have the capacity here to ensure that quality assurance is going to be undertaken across the board 100 per cent of the time. There is also the issue of security of supply. If we become a predominantly importing nation, what security will we have in terms of supply into the future? They are key issues that we need to recognise, as we are doing today, to make sure that the productive capacity is there and that the prime agricultural land is there to do what it does best, and that is produce food and fibre for this nation.
We need to respect those communities that work so hard to provide for this nation. You only have to look at many of the regional communities that have gone through years and years of drought. That is by no means an issue that has fallen off the agenda. The drought that many of our regional communities have experienced continues in many areas. We know that a lot of our farmers have their backs against the wall. I was recently up in the North Coast of New South Wales with a group of farmers who very clearly and succinctly pointed out that they could not go on, that there was no future for them. What they wanted to know was that we would be in this place batting for them, making sure that we did everything possible to assist them to have a sustainable future.
That is exactly why we are standing here today with the amendment. It is not right and it is not fair to have a tax break for those people in the cities to put in carbon sink forests while at the same time potentially taking away that productive capacity from the regions. It is simply stupid, it is wrong and it lacks common sense. This is about having fairness. It is about having a level playing field. As I said at the outset, we are not against carbon sinks—not by any stretch of the imagination—but why on earth should our farmers in regional communities have to be pitted against a tax break for the big end of town? It is just not right.
Another interesting thing surrounding this is that no hydrological studies have been done on the impact of the interception. We all know that these forests are going to exponentially explode and yet there is no work being done at all. We have a government on the other side that consistently jump up and down about the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin, and yet they are prepared to stand there and support this legislation when they know that no hydrological work has been done. They are completely inconsistent and they have no understanding of how this is going to impact the regions. There has also been no work done on the socioeconomic impact of carbon sink forests and what they will do to regional communities—none whatsoever. And they are quite happy to sit in this place and let this remain in place when there is still no idea of the impact it is going to have.
It is about time that we stood up in this place for our farmers and our farming communities and that, as I said earlier, they get the respect they deserve. They should get the respect they deserve through support for the amendment that will get rid of this tax break on the carbon sink forests, because it is simply not right. If we want to ensure that we have the ability to feed this nation into the future then we need to ensure that we support amendments like the one we are putting forward.
I do not think people really think about the potential for our ability to feed ourselves to decrease or disappear. It sounds like something that it is not real. Let me tell you that this issue of food security is going to be one of the most significant this nation will face over the coming decades. We need to do everything we can to support our regions’ ability to be sustainable and viable in the future, not rip it apart and take it away.
This is a vitally important piece of legislation. We have been very consistent, and we will continue to be consistent, in our view on this. As I said, we are not going to stand up and do this again every time a tax bill comes through, but it is very important that particularly the people of regional Australia know that we will stand firm, whether on this issue or on the issue of going back to some kind of single-desk arrangement for orderly marketing for wheat. We will absolutely stand behind our farmers and our regional communities in what they need to have to have a sustainable future. We will not back away from this. When we get to the Committee of the Whole stage, this will go forward, and I implore senators on both sides of this chamber to give this the consideration it deserves. This amendment needs to succeed. There should not, by any stretch of the imagination, be a tax break available for carbon sink forests. It is simply wrong and it goes right to the heart of the viability of our regional communities.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-09-10,"—This managed investment scheme issue is absolutely basic to the National Party. It is fundamental to the National Party. It is a question of life and death to the National Party. I will offer to take anyone on a tour of places where these managed investment schemes have eroded the viability of the sugarcane growers, the dairy farmers and the banana growers. We should have learnt our lesson. We developed an MIS and we thought it would help build industries. Everyone let it go through, but we saw what it did. We saw how it was impacting on rural Australia. I had the experience the other day of going to Tully. A big banana grower and sugar grower said that a block of land became available next door to him and he thought he would test the market. He was quite a wealthy man. The MIS tried to buy the block of land and it became a bidding war. He just got blown out of the market. He was a genuine farmer, farming sugar and bananas, and he could not compete. This is happening right across rural Australia.
It is bad enough with an MIS, where you give a tax break, if you actually include land in that tax break. I do not know if it is included, but Senator Joyce, who is an accountant, says it is, and Senator Milne has an opinion from a barrister who says land is included in the tax break. We will never know, I presume, until someone takes it to the High Court and has it tested. But if it is included, goodness help Australian farmers as there will not be any farming land left.
Australia is a huge empty land, and we do have lots of land. But we do not have lots of good land. In fact, we only farm about 20 million hectares. That is our total farming land. This measure has the potential for taking 20 million hectares out. Where are we going to farm? And where are we going to put the trees? We are told we will put them in land that is not highly productive. You put the trees where the trees grow fattest, and where they grow fattest is on productive land where it rains. Trees grow where it rains and they absorb more carbon. If you want to go and put trees out in the Simpson Desert I do not think we would have any objections to that. But putting them on prime agricultural land is just wrong. One of the other things that would happen—if people would ever care to go out—is that once you put those trees down next to a productive farm it becomes a haven for pigs, and—

Opposition senator—Feral goats.
—I have never seen feral goats, but I believe that could be the case where you come from, Senator. Certainly where I come from you would then have to set up traps and have shooters go in to shoot them out. The pigs and feral goats go through the fences and destroy crops, and put mud in the rivers and the creeks. All those things do happen.
Today, the Greens and the Nationals find themselves in alignment. It is slightly different though, as I think the Greens are actually concerned about monoculture taking over the land, and it is a legitimate argument. Where the National Party is coming from is a bit different but we end up at the same place. We are concerned about very scarce good farming land in Australia being taken over. We have seen this happen in MISs. I was very disappointed the other day when the Senate brought down a report virtually giving the MISs a bit of a free kick, or a tick. Now we are just going to make it worse—100 times worse.
I cannot support something that will see people marooned, as in Tully. I talked to a guy the other day who had been a fourth-generation unionist. He was a fitter and turner in Tully and he was a fourth-generation mill worker. He appeared in the Australian. He said, ‘There will not be a fifth-generation worker in the Tully mill, as much as I would like to see my children being involved in the tools and work on the mill. I don’t think there will be one.’ He is not only a mill worker and a fitter and turner, but also a union rep in the factory who is saying that this is wrong. I suppose it is another indication of the Labor Party not being particularly worried about the blue-collar worker. But these people are worried about their jobs. As has been said before, we actually export about 60 per cent of our primary product and that feeds the world. The world is becoming more populated, and there is less and less land to feed the people. Why, in the name of goodness, are we going to do this? This is stupidity at its highest level and it should be opposed. We opposed it last time. In fact, it is only the second time we have crossed the floor on this, and we do not enjoy doing that as we understand the problem it causes.
We, the National Party, have to run up our banner and fly our colours. We have to say to the people in rural Australia: ‘We are not going to let this happen to you. If our vote means anything, it will not happen to you.’ We can only cast our vote; we do not expect to win. But at least it says to the people: ‘If you back us and give us your vote, we will back you in return.’ That is what we are doing today. I saw this coming when the bill was first introduced, and I think someone said at the time that this was an MIS on steroids—and it is. Senator Milne is right, we do not need this and, in fact, we should oppose it. We will be opposing this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-09-10,"—I would like to add a few words to those of my colleagues, Senator Joyce, Senator Nash and Senator Boswell. I said on 15 September last year in my maiden speech to this parliament, ‘Do not ever take the supply of food for granted,’ and I meant it.
I just want to relate a brief story. I live in Inverell in northern New South Wales and our parish priest is Father Joe Adriano. I got to know Father Joe in 1995 when he first came to Australia from the Philippines. We were fishing in the creek on my property one night and he said to me: ‘John, you’re so lucky here in Australia. You walk into your supermarkets and all the shelves are full. You walk around to the butchers’ section and there are all sorts of lamb, steak and pork.’ Of course, I was pig farming at the time. He was simply amazed at the stocks of food that we had in our supermarkets in Australia. He said that back in the Philippines the shelves are mostly empty. That is why I say, ‘Don’t take our supply of food for granted.’ We are lucky. The nation was built by our farmers and now we have policies that do their utmost to destroy our farming sector.
Life is about fairness, and when you have a situation where a large company with a pocketful of money can go in and buy up agricultural land, inflate the prices and prevent the traditional farmer from buying the land, that is wrong. As Senator Boswell just pointed out, when farmers want to expand their acreage, perhaps because their son has just left school and wants to go onto the land to keep the generations going, they get done over in a bidding war. That is wrong. Inflating the price of land is keeping the genuine farmers from producing food for feeding not only Australian but the rest of the world as well, because we are a major food supplier for many areas of the world. The laws as they stand are simply wrong and that is why we are going to support the amendments put forward by Senator Joyce and Senator Milne.
The upfront tax deductions of planting down good agricultural land with trees are simply wrong in every way. We cannot eat trees, we cannot eat bark and it is simply wrong for the future. My fear arises when I hear statistics and forecasts that in the next 30 to 40 years the world is going to have to double its food production to meet the demand for human consumption. How are we going to do that when our nation is being planted down with trees? It is ridiculous. That is why a commonsense attitude should be brought to this whole debate.
The Nationals have stood by their argument all the way through this debate. We are not going to continue this debate for years to come, day in, day out.. Senator Joyce has made that quite clear. We stand by what we believe in and we stand by our regional communities. We do not want to see this huge tax incentive for these turbocharged managed investment schemes, known as carbon sinks, to continue when the genuine farmers are squeezed out. The genuine people who actually feed our nation, who put the food on our table every day, are the people we need to support and who we will continue to support. That is why we find ourselves in this position in this upcoming vote.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-09-10,"—I seek leave to table a correction to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 4) Bill 2009.
Leave granted.
—In summing up this second reading debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 4) Bill 2009 I thank the members who contributed. It would probably benefit people who have been listening to this debate and those in the gallery, who might be wondering what this piece of legislation is all about, if I revisit for a minute and explain that the debate that we have heard from the National Party senators today goes to an amendment that is being proposed to this large piece of legislation.
Schedule 1 of this bill lifts the expenditure cap for access to the existing research and development tax offsets from $1 million to $2 million with effect from 1 July 2009. This measure provides a further boost to small pre-profit companies in research-intensive industries ahead of the introduction of the new R&D tax incentive in 2010-11. It also mitigates the incentive for firms to keep their R&D spending below the current expenditure cap.
Schedule 2 of this bill honours the government’s 2008 budget commitment to improve the integrity of prescribed private funds and to provide the trustees of such funds with greater certainty as to their philanthropic obligations. The government has recently consulted on draft guidelines, which will be shortly made into a legislative instrument. Following a thorough public consultation process, this schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and A New Taxation System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 to improve the integrity of prescribed private funds.
Schedule 3 of the bill amends the income tax law to provide relief from capital gains tax to members and insured entities of friendly societies that have either a life insurance business, a public health insurance or both and the society demutualises to a for-profit entity. Depending on how the friendly society chooses to demutualise, these entities do not easily fit within existing demutualisation regimes. These amendments will provide a broadly equivalent capital gains tax outcome for members and insured entities of these friendly societies relative to what members and policyholders of a stand-alone life insurance or private health insurer would receive if the insurer demutualised.
Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that losses transferred to the head company of a consolidated group or a multiple entry consolidated group by a joining entity that is insolvent at the time of joining are not wasted. The head company will be able to apply the transferred losses in one of three ways. The loss can be applied to reduce a net forgiven amount under the commercial debt forgiveness rules. Alternatively, they can be applied to reduce a capital allowance that is adjusted under the limited recourse debt rules or to reduce a capital gain that arises when the joining entity subsequently leaves the group. As the amendments have been official to taxpayers, they apply from 1 July 2002—that is, from the commencement of the consolidation regime.
Finally, this bill includes minor amendments to the tax laws. The amendments ensure that the laws operate as intended by correcting some technical or drafting defects, removing anomalies and addressing unintended outcomes. The minor amendments are part of the government’s commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax law. Minor amendment packages now include addressing minor legislative issues raised by the public through the recently introduced tax issues entry scheme, or TIES for short. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-09-10,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister’s answer. I note that he does not include in that the fact that the government has reduced this year’s Customs budget by $58.1 million. He does not include abolishing detention debt. He does not include removing the 45-day rule for onshore protection visa applicants.
—The question, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.
—I am coming to the question, Mr President. Nor does he include providing 24 new portable accommodation units to the refugee processing outpost, in order to house the extra people that people-smugglers are bringing in, at a cost of $1.5 million to the Australian taxpayer.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-09-10,"—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister tell the Senate when the Rudd government will reverse its program of softening border protection that gives people-smugglers the green light and return to the previous strong policies which saw no unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 under the Howard government?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice,16,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-10,"—I thank the senator for the question. The Rudd Labor government remains absolutely committed to strong border security measures. That is why in the 2009 budget an additional $654 million was dedicated to a whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling as part of the Rudd government’s $1.3 billion strategy to strengthen national security and border protection. We have established a dedicated Border Protection Committee of Cabinet to drive the whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling and to ensure that the government’s efforts are fully coordinated and resourced at levels which enable us to quickly respond to the factors that contribute to regular people movement. We have also created a single point of accountability for matters relating to the prevention of maritime people-smuggling within the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. They will create a more effective capability to task and analyse intelligence, coordinate surveillance and on-water response and also engage internationally with source and transit countries to comprehensively address and deter people-smuggling throughout the operating pipeline from source countries to our shores.
The challenge is real and the challenge remains. As I have said previously, we have had boat arrivals in more than 20 of the last 30 years. This is an ongoing problem for Australia, as it is an ongoing problem for the world. Reports indicate that the number of people around the world seeking protection or seeking to move is increasing all the time. We see the international engagement and the regional engagement commenced under the previous government as a vital component of a successful policy to combat people-smuggling, but it is an ongoing challenge and we remain committed to trying to end people-smuggling.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice,16,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-10,"—I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for what I think was a question. It actually sounded a bit more like a combination of the shadow minister’s press releases, which are incredibly confusing. When you bring them all together they are a complete mess. What we have done is try to implement a policy that is absolutely committed to strong border security and that enhances our border control and border patrolling. Also, we make no apology for the fact that we have introduced legislation measures to ensure a more humane treatment of refugees who have arrived in this country. We made that very clear. A number of the coalition’s own backbenchers have seen fit to support that. I think the Australian community has moved on to understanding that you can have strong border security and humane treatment of those found to be under your protection. I suggest that the Liberal Party, rather than calling for an inquiry, actually work at trying to find a policy that perhaps takes account of modern circumstances. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-10,"—The senator seeks to repeat the catchcry of ‘soft on boarder security’, but that is all the Liberal Party have got. There is no policy and half the time they do not oppose the measures that we recommend. I remind those opposite that under the Howard government 5,516 unauthorised arrivals arrived in 2001; 2,900 in 2000; and 3,700 in 1999. Were you soft on boarder security then? No. What you were dealing with was the challenge of a surge that occurred at that time, just as earlier governments such as the Fraser government had to deal with the surge of Chinese arrivals in its period. These things occur as a result of people who have been forced out of their home countries seeking asylum. What we have seen over the years is that these figures go up and down as people seek to find safety. I am afraid that will continue— (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-10,"—I thank Senator Hurely for the question. Today’s labour force figures show that employment fell by 27,100 people in August. The unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 per cent, supported though by a fall in the participation rate. The participation rate is still at a high level but it did fall. Everyone is concerned by job losses, which is why the government has acted decisively to stimulate the economy and to support jobs. Today’s figures demonstrate that the government stimulus and combined efforts of employers and employees has helped cushion the impact of the global recession on job losses. The effectiveness of the government’s stimulus in supporting jobs and effort by businesses may mean that unemployment peaks somewhat lower than we originally forecast in the budget. If that is the case, I am sure all senators would welcome it. Unfortunately, though, the unemployment rate will continue to rise as the effects of the global recession continue to wash through our economy.
Even though the Australian economy is looking much stronger than the rest of the world, we need to remember that it will take time for the full effects of the global recession to be felt. We do know that without the stimulus unemployment would be much higher. We know that the government’s action and the combined efforts of employers and employees have helped cushion the impact of the global recession on jobs. Treasury have estimated that without the government stimulus the unemployment rate would peak 1½ per cent higher, or up to 210,000 more Australians who would be out of work by June 2010. The stimulus is supporting jobs now; it will support jobs in coming months. While unemployment in other advanced economies is forecast to reach double figures, our stimulus package will ensure that we should not reach those sorts of levels of unemployment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-10,"—Australia’s unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent does remain lower than any of the major advanced economies except Japan. In the US, the unemployment rate has reached 9.7 per cent, its highest in 26 years. In the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate is now at 7.8 per cent. In Canada, the unemployment rate is 8.7 per cent. And in the Euro area, unemployment has reached 9.5 per cent. Since September 2008, employment in Australia has fallen by just 0.3 per cent. This compares to much higher falls in the US, Canada and the UK. These figures demonstrate that the government’s approach is working to assist in retaining jobs, helping Australians stay in work. Without that action, unemployment would be much higher today. Compared with the rest of the world we are doing well but we are in a very difficult circumstance. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-10,"—Australia has coped with the global financial storm because of this government’s assertive and timely policy stimulus. That stimulus plus the combined efforts of employers and employees have helped to lessen the impact of the global recession on jobs. It is our government’s policy actions that continue to be critical factors in supporting the economy—the initial fiscal stimulus to households and businesses combined with a longer term effect from the infrastructure programs. This government knows that we will face a big jobs challenge ahead. The unemployment rate will continue to rise as the effects of the global recession impact our economy. We have already seen unemployment rise by 200,000 people in Australia.

This laboratory based research is funded both through the CSIRO and external bodies such as the NIH grants.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-09-10,"—Senator Back, in the last three days you have asked me the same question about the process of Biosecurity CRC funding. The CRC applied for refunding for the 11th round. It was one of the 10 out of 24 that did not make it through to the second stage of applications. It was rejected after careful assessment of the application by an independent CRC review committee. The independent reviewers were not convinced that the CRC would achieve the proposed outcomes necessary to address biosecurity threats such as the Hendra or the H1N1 viruses.
The Biosecurity CRC was advised on 28 April that it would not be progressing to stage 2. In May I announced the CRC program would move from biennial to annual rounds. This meant that the Biosecurity CRC and other CRCs that did not go on to stage 2 of the process would not have to wait two years to reapply. In fact, I opened a new selection around on 26 May, with applications closing on 14 August. I amended the guidelines to allow the CRC committee to provide feedback to the CRCs that made it to interview before the 11th round was completed. The CRC committee chair provided written advice back to the CRC on 26 June this year and expanded verbally on that feedback on 6 July. The committee’s feedback to the CRC noted that while that included many key players it did not include some logical end users such as AQIS and Customs.

It chose not to do so. I can only conclude that members of the Biosecurity CRC decided that they would not be able to put together a strong enough application.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. Sessional orders require the minister to be directly relevant to the question. The question was: can the minister advise the Senate which agency will continue to do the field research? No longer talking about the Biosecurity CRC being closed down, it was: which agency will undertake it? That is the question, and that is what he needs to directly answer.

I think the government have been upfront about the reasons why we terminated the contract with Choice. The government’s concern was that the website would not be able to provide timely, reliable prices for local stores all around Australia and that consumers who relied on the website might feel misled if the information was not accurate. The proposal was that the prices of at least 5,000 items be provided on a weekly basis. Since there are well over 4,000 supermarkets in Australia, that could involve more than 20 million prices being checked and provided each week. This was complicated by the fact that supermarkets change their prices, especially of fresh food, daily or even more then once a day. The government could not see that it was possible to generate and supply such an enormous amount of pricing information accurately and reliably. The government was concerned that consumers would rely on the website prices and accordingly make decisions on where to shop, and feel misled if the prices were not accurate. The room for error was large on what would have been a government funded website.
The government is working on policy measures to introduce more competition into the grocery retailing industry. It is also working on a range of policy measures to reduce barriers to entry into grocery retailing. These measures include the ACCC working with major supermarkets on removing provisions from shopping centre leases that restrict the entry of rivals and an examination of state and territory zoning laws, designed to enable more competitors to enter the market. Of course, we have already relaxed the foreign investment guidelines, with overseas retailers like Aldi and Costco taking advantage of that relaxation. In addition, we have introduced unit pricing to better enable consumers to make meaningful price comparisons. All of these measures, as the senator would understand, are designed to promote competition and choice for the benefit of consumers.

So they knew very well that this question was happening today. This is not a question without notice, as it were; they have had notice.

But here we are more than 2½ months after the questions were asked and we still have no answers. It is not that hard. The questions were requests to table the contracts and consultancies relating to the establishment of, and the mismanagement and wasteful spending on, the GROCERYchoice website.
Interestingly, the government have been forced under the ‘Murray motion’ in the Senate to reveal the $5 million contract that the ACCC had with the Bailey Group to monitor grocery prices across this country, as well as a supplementary consultancy contract. They were forced to reveal that. We want all this information, and currently the government are obfuscating. They are blocking the release of this information for no good reason.
The answer provided by the Leader of the Government in the Senate this afternoon is entirely inadequate. It is entirely unsatisfactory. He says the answers will be provided ‘as soon as possible’.

Senator Mason asked questions on Building the Education Revolution. We have also seen issues with respect to Indigenous housing.
This particular issue, the government’s management of the removal of the 40 per cent rebate for AQIS export certification charges, has quite a sorry history. The government commissioned and accepted the recommendations of the Beale report, but they have not resourced it properly. They were prepared just to remove the 40 per cent rebate without any process. They were happy to say, ‘Righto, we’ll rip this $43 million out of industry.’ Once the objections started to be raised, the minister had to take action to put in place a process to try and mitigate the problems. The unfortunate part of it is that he has not actually gone about his job properly. He has not listened to the industry. He has created a number of industry consultative groups that are bound by confidentiality agreements, so they cannot really talk to their industry sectors. Then, when it came to the time for the fees to be exposed, people found out what the impact was going to be.
The government keep trotting out the line that industry supports this. But when you look at the submissions to the inquiry, there are nine that support it—one of those being the government’s own submission. Four of those, including the government’s own submission, express strong support. Five of those nine express qualified support. But there are 19 submissions to the inquiry that oppose it and 12 of them strongly oppose it.
—Including Austrade.
—Including Austrade. That submission has been officially withdrawn by Austrade today. We understand that process and we have seen that happen in the last 24 hours. This demonstrates the complete mishandling of the whole process by the minister. If industry want to know who to blame if these fees and charges are brought out, they ought to be knocking on the door of Minister Burke. He is the one to blame for his completely incompetent handling of this process. He has been a weak minister. He has not stood up for his portfolio. The department has been completely and utterly gutted. Industry understand that.
—What a stretch. That is even below you.
—Senator Sterle and some of my colleagues on the other side will probably get up and talk about those that support this, but they will not talk about companies like the Mildura Fruit Company, who have pulled out of export markets to China, South Korea and Thailand because of the increase in AQIS fees. They have stopped exporting. They have pulled out because it is not economical to do it anymore.
The Australian Meat Industry Council have said what the opposition have said all along, ‘Put the reforms in place first. Show us the savings and then come to us with the revised fees and charges.’ That is what the opposition have said all along and that is what the Australian Meat Industry Council say in their submission. They bear $32 million of the $40-odd million cost. They bear most of the cost. They have been saying all along, ‘Put the reforms in place first and then come and talk to us.’ The Australian Ostrich Association tell us that any increase in cost is likely to shut down the industry. What we are getting here is a competition between the big guys and the little guys. The government is happy to go with the big blokes. That is fine, but who on the government side is standing up for the little blokes? Not many that I can see, and certainly not the minister.
The performance, the complete shambles, over the last 24 hours over the Austrade submission demonstrates that the government have absolutely no control. One hand does not know what the other one is doing. There are submissions going through ministerial offices without them even knowing that they are going through. The one thing that we ask, the one thing that the committee have asked today, is that the officers who prepared the submission be allowed to give their evidence tonight. They have been working with industry. That is why they have said what they have said. We know there are some who support this, but we know that there are a lot who do not. That is why we are asking the questions we are asking.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Quarantine</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,25,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2009-09-10,"—If we are going to take note of answers today, particularly answers given by my colleague Senator Kim Carr, let us have a discussion about the Building the Education Revolution program and let us get some facts on the table. One of the reasons this was instigated was that after 11 long years of the Howard government schools in this country had been neglected. Infrastructure was never seriously addressed under the previous government. In fact, education itself had plummeted to receiving the lowest contribution of GDP for many years, as the OECD continually reported and highlighted. I ask my colleagues opposite whether they can tell me how many schools we have in this country, including Catholic, independent Christian schools and government schools. How many schools do we have in this country? There is a deafening silence. They want to stand up and criticise, but they have no idea of the magnitude of this project and they have no alternative policies.
We are talking about 9½ thousand schools that will actually benefit from this education revolution, a revolution that was needed because of the abject neglect of the previous federal government. In those schools we have 24,000 projects happening around this country, from remote Indigenous schools to major high schools in capital cities to little primary schools in regional centres—primary schools, secondary schools and rural and remote schools. In fact, 9½ thousand schools around this country are benefiting from the Building the Education Revolution program, covering 24,000 projects.
We knew from the start that this was a massive undertaking. It was part of stimulating the economy through the global financial crisis, making sure that at the end of the day we were protecting jobs. If we had not instigated this project, there would have been an extra 210,000 Australians out of work. This was about not only building up the infrastructure in schools around this country—a neglected part of education under the Howard government—but also stimulating the building industry. It was about Australians having a reason to stay in work through the global financial crisis and a reason to keep collecting their fortnightly pay packet to ensure that the building industry that had gone through a massive slump was stimulated, and 210,000 Australians continue to maintain their jobs.
All you hear from the other side is criticism of the small number of projects that have encountered some problems. As Minister Gillard said this morning when she was interviewed on ABC radio, we anticipated that there would be problems. We have set up a website so that people can contact the federal government about problems. Remember that these schools are negotiating these projects with state and territory authorities. Federal government does not deliver services; it provides money to the state and territory government authorities who roll this out. School by school, projects were identified and these were negotiated with state or territory government authorities. We anticipated that projects at 9½ thousand schools would not be rolled out perfectly, and if you thought that was going to happen then you are in a fool’s paradise.
—You weren’t wrong there.
—How many complaints have we had or how many problems have we had? We have had 49 problems, Senator Mason, out of 24,000 projects at 9½ thousand schools. I would have thought that that was a pretty good example of how this government works cooperatively with state and territory governments, even your mates in WA, to ensure that what we are doing is not only stimulating the economy but also putting back into schools and building in schools the capacity to deliver future education in a modern and stimulating learning environment. That is what this government is about. This government is about ensuring that the schools in this country move into the next century with classrooms that are not falling down around their ears, with sporting facilities that can be used, with science laboratories that can be used and with libraries that are productive, inviting and encourage learning, investigation and research by students in this country.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-09-10,"—Given the scale of the government's maladministration, I might have to confine myself to the shambles of the implementation of the Building the Education Revolution program. Sir, you would think that if a government was to spend, let us say, $16 billion people would be happy, wouldn’t you? What has in fact happened? All the stakeholders—the students, their teachers, even the education union, the P&Cs—are saying this money has not been well spent. There has been a chorus throughout the country that this has been a very, very poor spend. Why? Let me tell you why: because, as Abbotsford Primary School illustrates so well, there is no flexibility. What is happening is that state governments are telling schools what they need to have. It is the old Labor Party story: ‘We will tell you what you want. If you don’t want it you can’t have it.’
—Command model.
—Yes, command model—this whiff of Stalinism. The fact is that it is not flexible, has not been flexible and has not been working. What is worse is that it is costing far, far more than it should. Under the tender processes that the Commonwealth government is supposed to be oversighting prices have gone up. The taxpayer is not getting a good deal out of this, and that is an enormous problem. They say prices have gone up 50 per cent in the last 12 months on the same projects. This is a very, very poor spend. And there has been bullying by state governments. The money is being used to fulfil state government responsibilities and state government obligations. Incidentally, most of the money, the vast majority, that Senator Crossin spoke about is being spent on state government responsibilities. Infrastructure for schools is a state government responsibility, but they have not been performing, so the Commonwealth government picks up the tab. So much of the money is being used for state government priorities.
It is a bad spend for another couple of reasons. We do not even know how many jobs are going to be created, because the tenderers were not asked the question about how many jobs were going to be created, although I suppose with Abbotsford Primary School at least we know the government was going to knock down a four-classroom building and replace it with a new one. It is like digging a hole and knowing you are going to fill it up again, like something out of the Great Depression.
It has been an appalling spend, and we do not even know how many jobs have been created, and neither does the government. But even worse—and my friend Senator Back just reminded me about this—with a $16 billion spend, we are not even certain whether educational outcomes will increase, because that was never part of the project. We are not certain with $16 billion worth of expenditure that any student’s HSC score or TE score will rise even one point. We do not know that, and the question was never asked. It is a hell of a lot money—a one-off in the Commonwealth’s history—to give to an education system for no certain educational outcome. It is an enormous amount of money. Perhaps the only exception is my home state of Queensland and Evesham State School, where the lucky student—the single student at the school—has been given $250,000 towards whatever school she decides to go to. I understand that half of the principals in central-west Queensland are trying to find this poor young lady, because wherever she goes, they get the money. I am told they are offering her iPods and Sony PlayStations and that she will not have to do homework for a year as long as she goes to their school—that is because of the $250,000.
This is not a joke, but it just shows us that this whole project is quickly developing into a farce. Last week, poor old Ms Gillard—she has had a pretty bad fortnight—described the fact that this project has been underfunded by $1.7 billion as a mere bump in the road, a mere bagatelle. If you are spending $350 billion, does $1.7 billion more matter? Perhaps it does not. It is the sort of loose change that you find in your lounge suite under the cushions, isn’t it? Who cares about $1.7 billion anymore? It means nothing. Even when it comes to the government’s own advertising of their horrible failures on this project, when they finally put up the billboards in the schoolyards—do you know what, Mr Deputy President?—we will discover that those very billboards that are advertising the government’s failures are illegal.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2009-09-10,"—I would like to take offence at Senator Colbeck’s contribution today. I have worked closely with Senator Colbeck on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee and I find him to be one of the better performers on that side of the chamber when talking about agriculture. But Senator Colbeck’s blatant attack on Minister Burke today during his motion to take note of answers was nothing short of disgraceful. On that, Senator Colbeck mentioned how AMIC was one of the representative bodies that have had $43 million ‘ripped out’—that was the wording he used—of the industry, and he quoted AMIC, the Australian Meat Industry Council. To clear the air, I have in front of me the Australian Meat Industry Council’s press release of 17 June 2009. The heading is: ‘AMIC endorses government reform package’. This is their press release. It does not sound like they have had the guts ripped out of them—to use Senator Colbeck’s terminology. In fact, I expect that sort of terminology from the Uncle Festers of the Queensland Liberal Senate team, such as Senator Macdonald, but certainly not from Senator Colbeck.
—Order! Senator Sterle, be careful when you are referring to another senator.
—I thought I was being nice, actually. AMIC’s press release states:
The Australian Meat Industry Council has announced today its agreement to the terms and conditions for a return to full cost recovery for AQIS export certification charges based upon a commitment by the federal government to implement—ready?—a groundbreaking suite of reforms to the meat inspection system in Australia.
It goes on to state:
In addition to the new AQIS reform agenda, a range of technology improvements, IT upgrades and a new plant performance rating tool and new market access consultation arrangements between government and industry will be implemented.
Further:
Minister Burke has committed over $289 million—
this is to AMIC—
to the various elements of the reform package, the implementation of which will begin immediately. Gary Berridge, Chairman of AMIC’s Australian Processing Council said today.
Mr Berridge went on to say:
We commend Minister Burke for his foresight and willingness to listen to industry in establishing a new framework for exports certification in Australia that will elevate its standing as a leader in this field internationally and provide a platform for Australia’s global competitiveness for the next 10 to 15 years.
It does not sound like they have had the guts ripped out of them—to use Senator Colbeck’s terminology; it sounds like a resounding endorsement of the minister’s hard work. And, not only that, the minister is seeking—lo and behold, this might come as a bit of shock to those opposite—the views of the industry.
The press release goes on to say:
The outcomes achieved today are the result of input by a broad cross-section of industry and government on both sides of the House, and I thank them for all their considered input and guidance in achieving this momentous outcome.
That is Gary Berridge from AMIC. There are also words of encouragement from the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, Horticulture Australia and the like, but I will not go on because of the time limit.
The line of questioning today from the opposition was that, for some reason, there was something sinister going on within Austrade. There has been a lot of commentary on that today. Quite simply, for the record—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—and take your fingers out of your ears, Senator Cormann, and have a good listen to this: Austrade’s submission to the Senate inquiry was not cleared through the office nor was it cleared through Austrade’s executive. The letter will be on the website for you, Senator Cormann. You can look for yourself. I know that might involve a bit of hard work.
—Order! Address the chair, Senator Sterle.
—And I will. Mr President, I know that it might be a bit hard for Senator Cormann and others opposite to do a little bit of work and to actually do a bit of reading before they shoot their gob off to the media. The submission did not reflect the views of this government, nor did it reflect the views of Austrade. The Austrade executive recognised that a serious mistake had been made and acted appropriately to correct the public record. A wide range of industry representatives have endorsed, as I have said before, and supported the government’s position: the Australian Dairy Industry Council, ABB, GrainCorp, Horticulture Australia and the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, to mention a few.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2009-09-10,"—I rise to support the motion to take note of answers from Senator Carr moved by Senator Colbeck. It is terribly distressing because this is the third day on which I have questioned Senator Carr on these matters and he continues to state points which are incorrect. One of the points I have made is the fact that the fieldwork associated with the Hendra virus research in Queensland is partially funded by the Australian biosecurity CRC, undertaken by the Queensland DPI. The minister continues to refute that view and I cannot understand why he does. It is clear, it is the fact: it is not work undertaken by the CSIRO. The minister has said that for whatever reason this particular CRC did not renew its application when it was refused earlier this year. I would have thought that, acting responsibly, the minister may himself have queried why such an important CRC did not reapply, particularly after we had the outbreak of the swine flu pandemic—it is transferred between humans and animals—and of course the fresh outbreak of Hendra. Why then he did not call the parties together to find out why that CRC had not reapplied? I did, and there was a considerable level of distress when that particular CRC learnt that their application had not been peer reviewed, that it had been the basis of a study and a recommendation by the review committee—no members of which had any expertise, as I said yesterday in this place, in areas such as infectious disease, biosecurity, quarantine, animal disease or the like.
Surely the minister must have had some alarm bells ringing. So incorrect was the advice of that committee to the minister that they said to him that the Quarantine and Inspection Service was not part of that bid. I would have thought that the minister would have had the opportunity in the last 24 hours to avail himself of the fact that AQIS is merely a service of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which was a main participant in the bid. That committee advised the minister again that the Customs service was not part of the bid. Of course it was not part of the bid or the CRC because the Customs service does not do research.
Why is it so critically important that this CRC continues? There are three reasons. Let me come back to the agreement of Senator Sterle and Senator O’Brien yesterday, who visited the facility with me in Geelong. We all agree that it is world’s best practice, but it is a laboratory based service. The strength of this CRC has been the fact that it combines members who do the fieldwork—in the case of the Hendra virus, the Queensland DPI; but state organisations around Australia—and feed that material into the CSIRO at the Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, which does phenomenally good work. Let me make the third point, which will be lost when this CRC is terminated—and this is where it is so unique: we have been able to take the quality of the work done by the Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, with the brilliance and speed of the testing, and, through the excellence of the CRC, transfer that out to laboratories around Australia. That is not a feature of other organisations around the world; it is a role of the CRC and is not something undertaken by the CSIRO. It does not have that role. I urge the minister to reconsider and to invite an independent assessment to see whether or not this CRC should continue.
I made the point today about the West Nile virus, a viral disease which has killed hundreds of people in the USA and in the north of America in the last couple of years and which affects animals. The two vectors are mosquitos of a type we have in Australia and birds, including crows, which we have in Australia. It is a shame Senator Crossin is not here, because the Northern Territory is one of the areas at risk. I asked the minister: who will do this work, which has been ongoing at the CRC, when the CRC is finished? I draw the attention of the Senate to the comment by the minister, when in opposition, about the dairy CRC and the weeds CRC. He pointed out that he asked the government of the day why they were being wound up when their research was beginning to bear fruit. I asked the minister today: why is this CRC being wound up when it is so good?

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CIVIL AVIATION SAFETY AUTHORITY (CASA) AND RELATED MATTERS


Recommendation 1

“The Committee recommends that the Australian Government strengthens CASA’s governance framework and administrative capability by:
introducing a small board of up to five members to provide enhanced oversight and strategic direction for CASA; and
undertaking a review of CASA’s funding arrangements to ensure CASA is equipped to deal with new regulatory challenges.”

Response to Recommendation 1

A CASA Board has been established.  The Board of five members has been appointed by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and comprises a Chair, Deputy Chair, the Director of Aviation Safety as an ex officio member, and two other members.  Board members are appointed for terms of up to three years.  The Board’s primary purpose includes deciding on the objectives, strategies and policies to be followed by CASA, ensuring that CASA performs its functions effectively and efficiently and complies with the reporting and other requirements of the Commonwealth Authorities Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) and the Civil Aviation Act 1988.  Legislative amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to give effect to the governance changes were passed by Parliament in March 2009, with the new arrangements in place from 1 July 2009.  Future funding arrangements for CASA will be addressed in the National Aviation Policy Statement later in 2009.

Recommendation 2

“The Committee recommends in accordance with the findings of the Hawke Taskforce, that CASA’s regulatory Reform Program be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible to provide certainty to industry and to ensure CASA and industry are ready to address future safety challenges.”
Response to Recommendation 2
In the National Aviation Policy Green Paper, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to have the regulatory reform program completed by 2010-2011.

Recommendation 3

“The Committee recommends that the Australian National Audit Office audit CASA’s implementation and administration of its Safety Management Systems approach.”

Response to Recommendation 3

This is a matter for the Auditor General.

 


REPORT BY THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION:


Temporary visas -
 
 Permanent benefits: Ensuring the effectiveness, fairness and integrity of the temporary business visa program


THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT

Preamble
The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration’s inquiry into temporary business visas titled Temporary visas … permanent benefits: Ensuring the effectiveness, fairness and integrity of the temporary business visa program. The report was tabled in Parliament on 12 September 2007.
The Australian Government agrees with the Committee that temporary skilled migrants are essential to meet current and future skills shortages in Australia and make a significant contribution to the Australian community. The Subclass 457 visa is the main temporary visa for skilled temporary workers. Many people on this visa apply for permanent residence through the employer sponsored migration visas. The employer sponsored visas, both temporary and permanent, provide a targeted response to skills shortages. These migration programs complement the government initiatives to increase the skills levels of Australians.
The Government also agrees that it is important to restore public confidence and support for the Subclass 457 visa program. While most sponsors comply with the requirements for the Subclass 457 visa there is a small group that seeks to exploit or abuse the program. The Government introduced to the Parliament, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008 that strengthens the capacity to monitor sponsors, share information with other regulators and to take strong action against those who abuse the program, including pecuniary and other administrative sanctions. The Bill was enacted on 18 December 2008 and is to commence by mid September 2009.
Training Australians and not just relying on the temporary employees from overseas is an important part of the Subclass 457 visa requirements, as discussed in the report. The training standards have not been clear in the past. The training requirement and ways in which it can be met and measured were considered in the reviews that the Government has instituted since taking office, especially the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel comprising representatives from state governments, unions and industry. The reviews also considered other key aspects of the Subclass 457 visa including adequate remuneration and regulations to prevent exploitation and undercut Australian working conditions.
The reviews of the Subclass 457 visa program that the Government commissioned are:
the business-led External Reference Group (ERG) established by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in February 2008 to examine ways to make the program operate as effectively as possible. The ERG presented its report in April 2008. Fourteen of the sixteen recommendations have been agreed to and are being implemented;
the Subclass 457 Integrity Review led by industrial relations expert, Ms Barbara Deegan, which examined ways to improve the integrity of the program. Ms Deegan presented her final report in October 2008;
the Subclass 457 Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) comprising representatives from Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR), the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. The IDC was created to consider the reform package for the Subclass 457 visa program and to bring together the outcomes of the other reviews; and
the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel comprising representatives from industry, unions and State Governments to consider issues and policy proposals for the skilled migration program and to provide advice to the IDC on the reform package.
The reports from the IDC and the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel brought together the issues raised in the reviews undertaken, including the findings and recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, for Government consideration of the long term reform of the 457 visa. The aim of the reform is to increase the effectiveness of the program, restore the integrity of the program and public confidence, ensure that it meets the skill needs to contribute to the Australian community, and, using a risk based approach, provide fast processing for genuine sponsors and strong actions against those who may attempt to exploit or abuse the program. The report was presented to Ministers on 19 December 2008.
The Government is grateful for the work the Committee has taken in respect to this important subject and for all those who contributed with their submissions and evidence to the Committee.
The Government’s response to the recommendations made by the Committee follows. A number of the recommendations have already been implemented. Others will be announced following the Government consideration of the reviews and consultations. The delay in responding to the Committee’s report has been due, in part, to the number of changes to the Subclass 457 visa program that were being considered and implemented in 2008.

Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, together with the Australian Federal Police and other relevant agencies, review the character requirements of the 457 visa program to ensure the integrity of security and police checks, particularly with reference to any variations in these procedures for overseas trained doctors entering under the Medical Practitioner visa (subclass 422) and the 457 visa.

The Government notes this recommendation.

The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is the competent authority which conducts national security assessments on visa applicants. ASIO assess visa applicants referred by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) as per the requirements of Public Interest Criteria 4002 (PIC 4002) under the Migration Regulations 1994. At the completion of a security assessment, ASIO provides advice to DIAC as to whether the applicant is assessed as a direct or indirect risk to security.
The character requirement of the 457 visa program is detailed in Public Interest Criterion 4001 (PIC 4001) of the Migration Regulations. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is not a direct stakeholder in these requirements. Under current processing arrangements, Subclass 457 visa applicants are not required to provide police clearances except in situations where they have declared a previous criminal history in their application.
All overseas trained doctors have their medical qualifications verified through the International Credentials Service of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates of the United States (ECFMG). State and Territory Medical Boards also have a legislative responsibility to ensure that they only register people of good character.
Subclass 422 (Medical Practitioner) visa applicants are required to provide police clearances for any country in which they have lived for more than 12 months in the last 10 years.
The Australian Government continues to monitor the security and police clearance requirements against risk assessments.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship commission research into sectoral usage of the 457 visa program, commencing with the meat processing sector, with a view to further refining temporary skilled migration policy and the 457 visa program with reference to specific industry sector needs.

The Government supports this recommendation.

The specific needs of some industries warrant the development of Labour Agreements. Labour Agreements allow the Australian Government to stipulate certain requirements relating to the recruitment of overseas workers, which may not be applicable under the standard Subclass 457 visa program.
In 2006-07, the Commonwealth and the Australian Meat Industry Council negotiated a Meat Industry Labour Agreement that enables meat processing companies to regularise the status of existing overseas meatworkers on Subclass 457 visas where they can demonstrate the skills are not readily available in Australia.
Changes to the Migration Regulations introduced on 10 September 2007 have made the Labour Agreement the only pathway available to access overseas meat workers under the Subclass 457 visa program. These changes have received some criticism from the industry.
This approach was extended to the on-hire industry. On 1 October 2007, access to the standard Subclass 457 visa program was removed for on-hire employers that seek to place overseas workers with other unrelated businesses. A Labour Agreement is now the compulsory pathway for access to overseas workers for the on-hire industry. The agreement provides checks and balances to assist in managing prevalent practices such as ‘benching’ (not paying salary between contracts) and the underpayment of workers.
Further analysis of sectorial usage of the Subclass 457 visa program, and the suitability of certain industries to access a Labour Agreement, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship:
clarify the purpose of the Business (Short Stay) visa (subclass 456) in terms of whether it permits employment options—that is, valid entry for short-term specialists to meet the urgent needs of business;
work with stakeholders to ensure an effective, streamlined migration option to meet the short-term temporary employment needs of business; and
rename the long-stay and short-stay business visas and the business visitor visas to more accurately reflect their employment or business visit purposes, with consideration to be given to renaming the Temporary Business (Long Stay) visa as the Temporary Skilled Employment (Long Stay) visa.

The Government supports point one and two of this recommendation.

DIAC is currently developing policy options that aim to:
clarify the distinction between the Subclass 456 Business (Short Stay) and 457; and
ensure visa options are available that balance the need to be responsive to the short-term demands of the labour market with the need to protect Australian workers and their conditions.
Under current policy, short term employment, generally no more than four weeks, for Subclass 456 Business (Short Stay) visa holders may be possible where it is:
highly specialised in nature and not ongoing; or
an emergency or urgent situation and not ongoing; or
in Australia’s interest.
In 2008, an investigation by the Workplace Ombudsman found that workers on a vessel laying a gas pipeline touching the seabed were considered to be within the Australian Migration Zone. These workers had originally been granted Subclass 456 visas. Following the Workplace Ombudsman’s findings, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship directed that where people are employed on vessels carrying out similar work, they will be required to apply for a Subclass 457 visa. This will ensure that overseas workers employed within the Australian Migration Zone are properly paid and Australian wages and conditions are not undermined. Changes are being made to the Subclass 457 visa enabling sponsorship for periods of less than three months.

The Government notes point three of this recommendation.

The Government has conducted a comprehensive review of the Subclass 457 visa program. This has included external consultation with stakeholders on changes to improve and streamline the visa.
Consideration may be given to the names of the visas after the Government has considered the reforms of the Subclass 457 visa program.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that, in light of the serious concerns raised during the inquiry about skills assessment processes for overseas trained doctors (OTDs), the Department of Health and Ageing, together with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, work to ensure initiatives announced by the Council of Australian Governments to establish a national process for the skills assessment of OTDs are implemented as a matter of urgency.

The Government supports this recommendation.

At its 14 July 2006 meeting, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a nationally consistent assessment process for the assessment of overseas trained doctors. Details of the new assessment model have been agreed and the new assessment pathways were phased in across States and Territories. The new assessment model will ensure all overseas trained doctors undergo adequate assessment, supervision and orientation. This will ensure that only appropriately qualified doctors are registered. The new assessment model has been fully implemented from 1 July 2008.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship investigate alleged misuse of the Occupational Trainee visa (subclass 442) and take action to address any problems identified with the program.

The Government supports this recommendation.

A national assessment model for overseas trained doctors has been introduced. The Department of Health and Ageing has also worked with DIAC to develop processes that will minimise misuse of the Occupational Trainee visa. The new measures have been implemented by all specialist colleges and medical registration boards.
DIAC also monitors the use of Subclass 442 visas in other occupational groups to ensure the integrity of the visa program is maintained. The Workers Protection Act 2008 will apply to sponsors in the Subclass 442 visa program.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, together with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, investigate and report to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on the adequacy of the salary system under the 457 visa program, underpinned by the minimum salary level, to identify if viable alternatives exist for calculating salary levels.

The Government supports this recommendation.

The Minimum Salary Level (MSL) for Subclass 457 visa holders was increased on 1 August 2008 when a new legislative instrument came into effect. The MSL increased by 3.8 per cent and applies to new sponsored worker visa applicants and to all existing visa holders. The revised formula applies to all sponsored workers who are paid in accordance with a MSL.
The Subclass 457 Integrity Review conducted by industrial relations expert Ms Barbara Deegan investigated the MSL as part of the broader package of reforms for the Subclass 457 visa program. This issue was considered in the Subclass 457 Integrity Review’s first discussion paper titled ‘Minimum Salary Level and Labour Agreements’ published in July 2008. The Subclass 457 Integrity Review has reported to the Minister and includes further consideration of the MSL under the Subclass 457 visa program. The Government has announced market rates of salary will be introduced as an alternative to the current MSL arrangement from mid September 2009.
In the interim, the MSL will be increased for all new and existing 457 visa holders by 4.1 per cent on 1 July 2009, in line with all employees total earnings as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government proceed with its proposal to index the salaries of 457 visa holders in line with increases to the minimum salary level or, alternatively, the award conditions under which the visa was granted.

The Government supports this recommendation.

On 23 May 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced a 3.8 per cent increase to Minimum Salary Levels (MSLs), which took effect from 1 August 2008. This increase was based on the increase in total employment earnings in the period from November 2006 to November 2007.
The MSL will be increased for all new and existing Subclass 457 visa holders by 4.1 per cent on 1 July 2009, in line with increase of all employees total earnings to November 2008 as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
In addition to the MSL, there is a requirement that Subclass 457 visa holders be engaged in accordance with Australian work standards including industrial instruments (where they refer to a higher salary than prescribed by the MSL Legislative Instrument), superannuation, occupational health and safety, workers compensation, workplace relations and taxation legislative requirements.
The Government has decided to replace the current MSL arrangement with a system of market rates of salary, whereby Subclass 457 visa holders would be paid the market rate for their specific occupation, thereby ensuring parity with Australian workers.

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations:
work with stakeholders to review the impact on the 457 visa program of the transition from the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO);
regularly review the list of approved occupations gazetted under the Migration Regulations 1994 that meet the minimum skill level for the 457 visa as defined under the new ANZSCO to ensure that this list maintains the integrity of the 457 visa program in listing only ‘skilled’ occupations; and
communicate to stakeholders and the Australian public what impact the adoption of the ANZSCO system will have on the definition of a ‘skilled’ occupation under the 457 visa program in terms of ensuring a continued benefit to Australia.

The Government supports this recommendation.

DIAC will make the necessary changes to its visa processing computer systems in 2009. These changes will affect the processing of Subclass 457 visas, but also include changes affecting skilled migration, students and a broad range of other departmental business, such as reporting.
Significant work is required in a number of DIAC’s computer systems as well as the new Generic Visa Portal being developed under the DIAC’s Systems for People Project. An implementation date for the systems changes required is yet to be finalised. The aim is to have the necessary work completed in 2009 to coincide with the ABS and DEEWR moving to ANZSCO as the single reference for analysing and recommending changes to the list of skilled occupations for the Subclass 457 visa program.
DIAC has, as part of the transition planning, consulted with stakeholders. Assessing authorities had the opportunity to comment on a draft of the new Skilled Occupations List (SOL) for permanent migration and to affirm which occupations they are able to assess under ANZSCO.
DIAC, ABS and DEEWR officers meet regularly to develop the strategy to shift from ASCO to ANZSCO. The new arrangements will be outlined on DIAC’s website. DIAC’s network of Regional Outreach and Industry Outreach Officers are supporting the change strategy and providing advice on the changes. DIAC will also engage the Migration Agent Industry, which plays a significant role in preparing sponsorship documentation for Subclass 457 visa processing.
The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship last changed the Legislative Instrument that includes occupations and minimum salary levels for the Subclass 457 visa in August 2008. This change was part of a program to reform the Subclass 457 visa program. Whilst this list still used ASCO numerical codes and occupation titles, the changes followed consultation by DEEWR and DIAC with stakeholders.
DIAC invited community comment on the reform of the Subclass 457 visa program through the Subclass 457 Integrity Review led by industrial relations expert, Ms Barbara Deegan. This review also included references to skill levels. The report is being considered by Government.

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations work with stakeholders to improve the flexibility of the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations and the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations in defining new/emerging occupations and specialisations.

The Government supports this recommendation.

Occupations eligible for various visas are based on the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) and, in the future will be based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO). This provides structure and consistency to eligibility criteria. There is flexibility to add new and emerging occupations and specialisations or to exclude specific occupations from the lists, including the Subclass 457 list of acceptable occupations. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship can amend by legislative instrument, the list of eligible occupations in response to changing demands and when new occupations are to be included in the program due to a skills shortage or when existing occupations are to be excluded due to an oversupply in the labour market.
On 1 July 2008, for example, the Minister amended the legislative instrument to exclude ‘Heavy Truck Driver’ as an eligible occupation in the regional Subclass 457 visa program, following a recommendation from the Trucking Industry Working Group. At the same time, the Minister added ‘Mining or Construction Site Heavy Truck Driver’ as an eligible occupation, to take into account the specific labour requirements of the mining and construction industries in regional areas.
The Subclass 457 Integrity Review conducted by Ms Barbara Deegan recommended that new skills lists be developed by DEEWR in consultation with DIAC and industry parties to ensure that only occupations requiring genuine skill are included. This option is being considered as part of the ongoing review of the Subclass 457 visa program.
On 1 April 2009, the Government announced that all occupations in ASCO Major Groups 5‑7 (applicable to regional Australia) would be removed from the approved lists and be required to use Labour Agreements.
The current Subclass 457 visa program has the flexibility to include and exclude specific occupations and specialisations as required, based on consultations between DIAC, DEEWR and relevant stakeholders. There is also the option to request a labour agreement for occupations not on the list of occupations for this visa.

Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that the existing 457 visa subclass be maintained in its current form and not be divided into two visa subclasses for higher and lower (regional) Australian Standard Classification of Occupations classifications. However, the Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations further investigate this area, with a view to enhancing monitoring and reporting, and improving arrangements for regional areas of Australia.

The Government supports this recommendation.

Regional arrangements for the Subclass 457 visa subclass were addressed as part of the review of the Subclass 457 visa program. The Government has decided that the special need for lower skilled occupations in ASCO 5-7 will not have regional concession and will be considered under labour agreement. This provides enhanced reporting arrangements.
The Government has also announced that the MSL and regional MSL concessions will be replaced by market salary rates. This effectively excludes the need for special regional arrangements.
The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008 has been passed by Parliament and will come into force in September 2009 to better define employers’ obligations and employees’ rights. The obligations will be incorporated in the Migration Regulations, allowing greater flexibility where required for changing circumstances. The Act and associated Regulations will strengthen the monitoring and enforcement regime.
Any further changes to the current form of the Subclass 457 visa program will be informed by the findings and recommendations from the review of the program, including the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel (comprising representatives from State Governments, industry and unions); the Subclass 457 Integrity Review conducted by industrial relations expert Ms Barbara Deegan; and the Subclass 457 Inter-Departmental Committee.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship commission an independent review of the structure and roles of Regional Certifying Bodies (RCBs), with particular regard to:
the capacity of RCBs to fulfil their specified functions;
the differing organisational structures of RCBs; and
the adequacy of the ‘regional’ 457 visa and associated concessions.
In addition to reporting on the issues outlined above, this review should aim to:
produce clear operational guidelines for RCBs; and
identify mechanisms for the communication of relevant procedural, legislative and statistical information to RCBs.

The Government supports this recommendation.

In the current Subclass 457 visa program review, the structure and roles of Regional Certifying Bodies (RCBs) were considered by an Inter‑Departmental Committee including DIAC, DEEWR, DFAT, the Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. The review has been submitted to Government for consideration.

Recommendation 12

The Committee recommends that, to ensure the 457 visa program is limited to skilled occupations where there are demonstrated skills shortages and there is no negative impact on Australian jobs, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations:
regularly review the gazetted list of approved occupations and give consideration to ensuring that it lists only skilled migration occupations in demand—for example, through the possible implementation of a Temporary Migration Occupations in Demand List; and
work with industry and other stakeholders to trial a limited labour market testing process to agreed standards for a narrow range of identified occupations.

The Government notes this recommendation.

The eligible occupations for the Subclass 457 visa are based on the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations and are listed in a Legislative Instrument, which can be changed quickly. New and emerging occupations and specialisations can be added to the approved list of occupations and occupations of concern can be removed from the list with a change to the Legislative Instrument. This ensures that the program can respond quickly to changes in the labour market. The list is monitored to ensure that it reflects skill needs.
There is no proposal to introduce a temporary Migration Occupations in Demand List (MODL). The list of approved occupations for the Subclass 457 visa program enables close monitoring of occupations accepted under the program.
However, any changes to the gazetted list of approved occupations or consideration to introduce labour market testing (LMT) procedures must be consistent with Australia’s international trade commitments. Under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Australia has made certain commitments to allow the entry and temporary stay of executives and senior managers, independent executives and service sellers and to allow the entry and temporary stay of specialists (persons with trade technical and professional skills) subject to individual compliance with labour market testing.
Our commitments largely relate to Australian classifications of ASCO 1-4 occupations.
Australia’s free trade agreements also commit Australia on the temporary entry of executives, managers and specialists as intra corporate transferees, independent executives, and contractual service suppliers without limits and without labour market testing. Australia has also made sectoral commitments which relate to certain specific professions, specifically Thai chefs in the Thailand Australia Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA).
It is important to avoid reforms that could be inconsistent with Australia’s commitments under World Trade Organization/General Agreement on Trade in Services (WTO/GATS) and free trade agreements.
As part of the current Australian Mode 4 offer for the Doha round of negotiations Australia has offered additional concessions regarding the entry and temporary stay of skilled persons, including the removal of labour market testing for specialists.
Some Free Trade Agreements have specific occupational concessions beyond WTO GATS commitments, which must be complied with. Australia should also be cautious about measures that could limit our capacities in future negotiations.
The Government has decided to include a sponsorship criterion that employers demonstrate a record of employing local labour and non-discriminatory employment practices.

Recommendation 13

The Committee recommends that, in referring specific cases for formal English language testing with a focus on occupations with a high occupational health and safety (OH&S) risk or history of sponsor non-compliance, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship also take into account that the need for 457 workers to have a higher level of English language proficiency for OH&S and broader communication reasons remains relevant, regardless of the sector or region in which they work.

The Government supports this recommendation.

An English language requirement for Subclass 457 visa applicants was introduced in July 2007. All primary Subclass 457 visa applicants must meet the English language requirement unless they fall within certain exempted categories. This measure was specifically introduced to address occupational health and safety concerns in the workplace and better equip Subclass 457 visa holders to bring any issues or concerns to appropriate attention. English language skills also assist in the settlement of Subclass 457 visa holders into their local community.
The Subclass 457 Integrity Review conducted by Ms Barbara Deegan recommended that the current English language requirement be retained with some minor changes to exemptions.
The Government has agreed to increase the English language requirement for ASCO 4-7 occupations and chefs to IELTS level 5 from 14 April 2009.

Recommendation 14


The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship:

work with stakeholders to develop best practice benchmarks for training requirements to be met by sponsoring employers—this should ensure effective training objectives under the 457 visa program that uphold the commitment to training Australians;
implement mechanisms to ensure improved communication of training requirements under the program and training outcomes; and
ensure that appropriate resources are committed to monitoring compliance with training requirements under the program.

The Government supports this recommendation.

Training benchmarks were considered as part of the current review of the Subclass 457 visa program by the Inter-Departmental Committee comprising DIAC, DEEWR, DFAT, the Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance and Deregulation.
The Government has agreed that DEEWR develop training benchmarks for all sponsorship applications.

Recommendation 15

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations work with stakeholders to improve:
the process of negotiating Labour Agreements;
the consistency of such agreements with aspects of the overall 457 visa program; and
the operation and transparency of such agreements.
The Government supports this recommendation.
The Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations are working towards a more streamlined process for Labour Agreement negotiations. A process for consulting with industry stakeholders on individual Labour Agreement proposals was introduced in early 2008. This process supports other consultative arrangements under Labour Agreements. The views of industrial stakeholders are integral to Labour Agreement but do not constitute a veto. Requests to access Labour Agreements remain commercial-in-confidence during the negotiation process although a company may choose to make certain information available to industrial stakeholders on a commercial-in-confidence basis.
The terms and conditions included in Labour Agreements generally mirror those in the existing Subclass 457 visa program. All Labour Agreement visa processing has been co-located with standard Subclass 457 visa processing. This will also increase the consistency and integrity of decision making.
Labour Agreements will be subject to provisions of the Worker Protection Act 2008 which is to be implemented in September 2009. This will ensure greater monitoring and enforcement powers with respect to Labour Agreements.

Recommendation 16

The Committee recommends that, given the number of significant changes made to the 457 visa program in 2007 and past concerns about the program, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship commission an independent review of the program in 2008-09 to assess the impact of these changes on the program’s effectiveness, fairness and integrity.

The Government supports this recommendation.

In February 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship appointed a business-led External Reference Group (ERG) to consider the Subclass 457 visa. The final report reinforced the existence of skill shortages and labour market pressures and the important role of the skilled migration program. The Government accepted 14 of the 16 recommendations and a number of immediate measures have been initiated including:
arrangements to eliminate the back-log of Subclass 457 applications;
establishing three dedicated Subclass 457 processing centres in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth from 1 July 2008; and
a comprehensive and targeted information strategy to reduce the potential for exploitation by promoting awareness of rights of visa holders and obligations of employer sponsors.
On 14 April 2008, the Australian Government appointed industrial relations expert Ms Barbara Deegan to examine the integrity of the Subclass 457 visa arrangements. The terms of reference for the Subclass 457 Integrity Review included examining:
Measures to strengthen the integrity of the temporary skilled migration (Subclass 457 visa) program;
The employment conditions that apply to workers employed under the temporary skilled migration program;
The adequacy of measures to protect 457 visa holders from exploitation;
The health and safety protections and training requirements that apply in relation to temporary skilled workers;
The English language requirements for the granting of temporary skilled migration workers’ visas; and
The opportunities for Labour Agreements to contribute to the integrity of the temporary skilled migration program.
The Integrity Review has reported to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Deputy Prime Minister. The Integrity Review will complement the recommendations of the External Reference Group (ERG).
The final reports from Ms Deegan and the ERG will inform the Australian Government’s medium and longer term strategy to improve the transparency, accountability and integrity of the temporary skilled migration program.
On 8 July 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced the establishment of a Skilled Migration Consultative Panel including representatives from State Governments, unions and industry. The Panel:
considered and provided advice to Government through an Inter-Departmental Committee on matters referred to it regarding temporary skilled migration policy changes;
considered and provided advice on issues referred by the 457 Integrity Review, consulting with their members and constituents when appropriate; and
provided informed feedback on reform proposals based on a sound appreciation of the issues and the impacts these issues have on business, the Australian workforce and the broader community.
The Panel provided advice through the latter half of 2008 to assist the Government in its development of a package of longer term measures.
The reforms will complement broader labour market policies, including the development of a new fair and flexible workplace relations system.

Recommendation 17

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship ensure that adequate resources are allocated to the compliance regime under the 457 visa program and, in particular, to the implementation and enforcement of the new arrangements.

The Government supports this recommendation.

Significant additional resources have been allocated to the compliance regime under the Subclass 457 visa program. A comprehensive monitoring officer training program has been developed to prepare monitoring officers for their roles as inspectors after the implementation of the Worker Protection Act 2008.
The training content was adapted to focus on the new policies and procedures introduced on 15 October 2007. This shifted the monitoring environment to a targeted risk-based approach to monitoring.
On successful completion of the training course, monitoring officers are awarded the national qualification of Certificate IV in Government (Statutory Compliance). The course was developed to ensure that monitoring is conducted in accordance with the strategic themes of DIAC, and focuses on record keeping, site visits, handling cases in line with national standards and conducting thorough audits. The program runs for 23 days and is divided into four blocks focusing throughout on:
Standardised record keeping procedures;
Consistent and transparent decision making; and
Relevant legislation and policy.
The Government will provide $19.6 million over four years to strengthen the integrity of temporary working visa arrangements, including the 457 visa program, by clarifying the obligations and rights of employers and workers, further protecting workers from exploitation. As part of the Government’s broad reforms, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship introduced a Bill to amend the Migration Act (1958) to better define employers’ obligations and employees’ rights. It was enacted on 18 December 2008 and is to commence by mid September 2009. It will strengthen the monitoring and enforcement regime. The Act:
better defines the obligations of sponsors in regulations;
enhances the capacity of the Department to investigate non-compliance;
expands the range of sanctions that may be imposed in respect of non-compliance by allowing a court to impose civil penalties; and
facilitates information sharing across government and with the community at large to further support a monitoring regime.

Recommendation 18

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship regularly report on its website details of monitoring and enforcement activities—for example, on the number of employer sponsors monitored, site visits conducted, sponsor approvals cancelled, sponsors banned and sponsors fined.

 
The Government supports this recommendation.

DIAC provides detailed statistics on the Subclass 457 visa program on a monthly basis. DIAC is planning to expand this reporting to include more general monitoring and enforcement activities. Information on statistics can be found on the DIAC website at: www.immi.gov.au/media/statistics/statistical-info/temp-entrants/subclass-457.htm.

Recommendation 19

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship introduce a more comprehensive, confidential complaints mechanism so that 457 visa holders are able to report potential breaches of visa requirements without provoking retaliatory action. This mechanism should also be widely promoted to 457 visa holders.

The Government supports this recommendation.

DIAC has in place a compliments and complaints policy which ensures all complaints are dealt with in a confidential manner. Feedback received by DIAC is handled in accordance with the Information Privacy Principles (IPP) of the Privacy Act 1988. In particular:
Information is only collected insofar as is necessary and lawful (IPP1);
Information is only stored for as long as necessary and with appropriate security to prevent unauthorised access (IPP4); and
Information is only disclosed to the person the information is about, not to any other person or organisation (IPP11).
In addition, the immigration ‘dob-in’ line which is used by members of the public to report a person working or living illegally in Australia is being enhanced to include reporting sponsors who are breaching their obligations to overseas workers. To raise awareness of and encourage use of the facility, details will be included in information material provided to Subclass 457 visa holders.
There are also alternative complaints mechanisms which can be used by Subclass 457 visa holders, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Workplace Ombudsman.
The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship introduced a Bill to amend the Migration Act (1958) to better define employers’ obligations and employees’ rights. It was enacted on 18 December 2008 and is to commence by mid September 2009. The Act will strengthen the monitoring and enforcement regime and will:
better define the obligations of sponsors;
enhance the capacity of the Department to investigate non-compliance;
expand the range of sanctions that may be imposed in respect of non-compliance by allowing a court to impose civil penalties; and
facilitate information sharing across government and with the community at large to further support a monitoring regime.
In the 2008-09 budget, the Australian Government announced funding for a comprehensive and targeted information strategy to reduce the potential for exploitation by promoting awareness of rights and obligations of visa holders and awareness of obligations amongst employer sponsors. For visa holders, this measure includes a comprehensive information pack that will be translated into community languages. For sponsors, this measure includes requiring employers themselves to declare that they understand their obligations under the program prior to accessing the scheme.

Recommendation 20

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) develop and distribute promotional material for 457 sponsors and visa holders that clearly sets out the rights of visa holders and the process that follows employment cessation. This information should:
clearly state that DIAC has the power to allow 457 visa holders to stay beyond a 28-day period following the cessation of employment;
be distributed to all new 457 visa holders and sent to the known postal addresses of 457 visa holders currently in Australia; and
be provided in both English and the first language of the visa holder.

The Government supports this recommendation.

A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) flyer for visa holders, providing information on the Subclass 457 visa program and contact details for further assistance, was sent to all active sponsoring employers within Australia in September 2007. The information package also included advice about the strengthening of employer obligations. The FAQ sheet states that a visa holder has 28 days to find a new sponsor and apply for a new Subclass 457 visa if their employment with their original sponsor is terminated. It also states that the visa holder has the option of applying for another visa subclass. If the visa holder does not apply for another visa, they have to leave Australia before the end of the 28 days, unless they have received approval from DIAC for an extension.
In recognition that many visa holders change their Australian addresses on a regular basis, the information was not sent directly to Subclass 457 visa holders, but to all Subclass 457 visa sponsors, with a requirement that they provide all sponsored workers with a copy of the flyer within five working days of receipt of the letter or of their commencement in the sponsor’s employment.
The material was provided in English. This initial version of the Frequently Asked Questions has since been updated and will be translated into the most widely used language groups of Subclass 457 visa holders.
Information on the Department’s website is available in seven community languages.

Recommendation 21

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship develop a communications strategy to ensure that stakeholders, including sponsors and visa holders, and the broader Australian population are adequately informed of the proposed changes to the 457 visa program. This should provide clarity on sponsors’ legal obligations, including the payment of travel costs, medical expenses, recruitment and migration fees, and the necessity of adequate record keeping.
and

Recommendation 22

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) provide clear guidelines for 457 sponsors and visa holders on their rights and obligations. At the time of granting a visa DIAC should provide:
sponsors with a checklist outlining their obligations; and
visa holders with a list of their rights and their sponsor’s obligations in both English and their first language.
In addition, this information should be provided to existing sponsors and visa holders in Australia.

The Government supports these recommendations.

DIAC has developed a comprehensive information strategy to improve transparency in and understanding of the Subclass 457 visa program, and to ensure that stakeholders, including sponsors, visa holders and the broader Australian population, are adequately informed of changes to the Subclass 457 visa program. This will provide clarity on visa holders’ rights and sponsors’ obligations. A range of information products has already been developed for both sponsors and visa holders.
Approximately 20,000 employer sponsorship requirements brochures, outlining employer undertakings under the Subclass 457 program, with an accompanying letter from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, were mailed to Subclass 457 sponsors in July 2008.
An information sheet on Minimum Salary Level (MSL) requirements and advising of the increase of the MSL on 1 August 2008 was developed and was included in the Employer Responsibilities Kit distributed in August 2008. The kit included the MSL information sheet, the employer sponsorship requirements brochure, a Work entitlement checklist, the Quick reference guide to checking work entitlements and a document titled “Do your employees have a valid visa to work in Australia?”.
The previous FAQ for visa holders has been redeveloped into three separate documents. These cover “Pay, tax and superannuation, recovering earnings”, “Accommodation, family and health care” and “Sponsors, contracts, unions and workplace conditions”. These have been translated into some of the languages of the nationalities most frequently using the Subclass 457 visa program.
In order to raise awareness about visa requirements and to encourage decision-ready applications, a comprehensive set of checklists for the sponsorship, nomination and visa application stages of the visa process have also been developed.
All of the above information is available on the DIAC website.
Pilot information sessions to inform visa holders of their rights and obligations and focus groups to investigate the different ways visa holders find out information about their rights in Australia, are also being developed.

Recommendation 23

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship collect and publish, as appropriate under privacy laws, more detailed statistics on the 457 visa program—for example, on the occupations and actual base salaries of 457 workers—to enhance transparency and reinforce public confidence in the operation of the program.

The Government supports this recommendation.

Following an announcement by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, a report containing statistics on the Subclass 457 visa program has been published on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s website. The report is located at www.immi.gov.au/media/statistics/statistical-info/temp-entrants/subclass-457.htm and contains the following information:
Number of visa grants by location of the nominated position and applicant type;
Top 15 citizenship countries for visa grants by applicant type;

Top 5 subclasses for persons granted a permanent visa who last held a subclass 457 visa.
The report for the 2007-08 Financial Year to 30 June 2008 was made available on the Department’s website on 22 July 2008 and includes total program numbers as well as statistics for each State and Territory. Updated reports are published on a monthly basis.

Recommendation 24

The Committee recommends that, to ensure fast-tracked service standards for processing times are met, the Australian National Audit Office undertake a performance audit of the administration of the 457 visa program next financial year. This audit should examine processing efficiency—that is, the extent to which the fast-track processing initiative leads to faster processing times compared to the rest of the caseload.

 
The Government supports this recommendation.

DIAC notes the Committee’s recommendation and would welcome an ANAO audit, should the Auditor-General decide that it is an audit priority. In addition, the Department is undertaking a related audit of the Effectiveness of Controls over the Regional Certification of Concessional 457 Visas and Monitoring of 457 Visas as part of the Financial Year 2008‑09 Internal Audit Program.
A number of measures were also introduced in July 2008 to improve processing times for Subclass 457 visas in response to the External Reference Group report. These measures included reducing the backlog of Subclass 457 applications; establishing three dedicated Subclass 457 processing centres in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth; and introducing a comprehensive and targeted information strategy to reduce the potential for exploitation by promoting awareness of rights of visa holders and obligations of employer sponsors. The processing times for Subclass 457 visas have been significantly reduced as a result of these measures.

Recommendation 25

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship improve its visa electronic lodgement procedures to ensure the effectiveness of the 457 visa program.

The Government supports this recommendation.

Since July 2007, there have been three computer system releases containing improvements to increase the effectiveness of Subclass 457 processing. These include textual enhancements to the electronic lodgement forms, an increase to the size limit of allowable attachments, enhancements to the document checklist list within departmental systems, enhancements to the storage of authorised recipient contact details, and the automated storage of application attachments into the Department’s record keeping system. In addition, hardware within the electronic business environment has been upgraded, which is expected to improve the availability and capacity of all electronic business applications including electronic visa applications.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-09-10,"—by leave—I wish to respond to a statement tabled today by Senator Wong on behalf of the Special Minister of State, Senator Ludwig. I make this statement on behalf of the coalition, and in particular the shadow special minister of state, Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson. The coalition will closely watch the deliberations and recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the machinery of referendums. In particular, the coalition will want to see spending neutrality for public education, or other programs, to ensure equal weight is given to potential ‘yes’ and ‘no’ cases. The coalition is also concerned that the Special Minister of State’s statement in the Senate today could be interpreted as a reflection on the community’s ability to understand the issues involved in previous referendums. The coalition believes that any statement by the government to the effect that only eight referendum proposals have been successful is the result of a defect in the machinery of referendums—as opposed to a clearly expressed community view of proposed constitutional changes—should be subject to rigorous scrutiny. Sensible proposals arising from this inquiry will be supported by the coalition, but we reserve our right and our position until the outcome of the inquiry.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Framework for Referenda in Australia</title>,Ministerial Statements,32,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2009-09-10,"—In taking note of this report, I note that the government were forced to table this report as a result of a motion by Senator Cormann and me. They took too long. Yes, it has now been tabled, but the government response is inadequate. In terms of the government’s response to that report, let us just make it clear there are no action items. It is another review; it is another report with no action for and on behalf of this government. We are waiting. This government made obesity a national health priority. Prior to it being elected, they announced that that promise would be abided by and then they did it, but nothing has happened in terms of action. That is what we are concerned about. This report has a lot of very interesting recommendations in it. Now that it is out there and it has been made available to us, we will certainly consider it carefully. Of course the government have had it since 30 June, and their response is effectively a nil response to date. We will consider that and review it in due course.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ryan) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>National Preventative Health Taskforce</title>,Documents,33,1,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2009-09-10,"—Communications campaigns are an important part of the interaction between government and citizens. Maybe if our government and this Commonwealth were not quite as large and intrusive, this would not be quite as important, but that is a much larger subject that I do not plan to address this evening.
When used appropriately, such campaigns serve an important purpose: they communicate rights, opportunities and obligations to all Australians. Under the previous, coalition government, Mr Rudd and the Labor Party continually made opportunistic attacks on government information campaigns, but for the first time the Australian National Audit Office has examined what Labor have done and their behaviour. They have found that Labor have come up wanting, which is no surprise to many of us who are familiar with their behaviour at the state level. Let’s put aside for the moment the grave concerns that the Auditor-General expressed early last year about having to be involved in the approval process of advertising campaigns. Let’s also put aside the fact that such involvement could severely compromise the independence of the Audit Office.
According to the latest Audit Office report, the Rudd Labor government’s new advertising regime contains a number of serious faults. Again—no surprise to all of us—Labor is failing to live up to its pre-election promises and commitments. Despite spending $87 million on a media buy in 2008, the ANAO points out that there are still government agencies whose processes are not meeting the requirements of the advertising guidelines. Moreover, the ANAO considers that Labor’s guidelines themselves need an overhaul. There are a number of serious deficiencies that require correction.
The Audit Office says that the Rudd Labor government must make greater use of research to inform the communication of strategy. Put simply, firstly, the Rudd Labor government is launching advertising campaigns that have no clear rationale and, by implication, are political feel-good campaigns. Secondly, the Audit Office says that the Rudd Labor government must provide greater clarity on the requirements of the cost-benefit analysis used in these advertising campaigns. In other words, Labor is spending too much money on the wrong sorts of campaigns and advertising.
The Audit Office says that the Rudd Labor government must also provide greater clarity around the boundary between business-as-usual communication activities and those activities which are subject to the guidelines. It says that the government must also provide greater clarity on which advertising activities fall within the campaign advertising definition. Taken together, these recommendations clearly relate to the rort that was exposed when my colleague Senator Ronaldson questioned the ANAO about Labor’s stimulus package website. As the Senate will recall, the website cost millions but was never cleared by the ANAO because it was outside these guidelines. Eventually, officials in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet temporarily closed down the website when it was pointed out that it contained party-political material. We have again seen this week the Rudd government’s signs in schools scandal. This is another example of slipping political advertising through a loophole.
Finally, the ANAO also recommended that agencies present campaign documentation on their own websites. This final failing is worthy of greater comments, because it goes to the lengths to which the Rudd Labor government has divorced itself from the principles it announced before the last election. At Senate estimates, officials were asked about which firms were winning advertising tenders. Previously, all such information had been available through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Labor, however, refused to answer this question, stating that the process had now been devolved to individual agencies. In response, my colleague Senator Ronaldson put a question on notice to each individual agency.
Bizarrely, and this shows just how arrogant the Rudd Labor government has become, the Special Minister for State wrote back purporting to answer on a whole-of-government basis, outlining that the information was available in their annual advertising report. But this is simply not true. The Rudd Labor government’s new advertising report is a waster of paper, delivering less real information about government advertising than was disclosed under the previous government. The report, in its 32 pages, has just one page of useful information: the cost of the overall media buy. The rest of the report is filler that is available on relevant departmental websites.
What is much more important is what is missing from this report. Who were the applicant agencies? Who were the successful agencies? How much were they paid? What amount was spent respectively on advertising, research and public relations? Which campaigns had to be changed during their development because they were outside the advertising guidelines? None of this is in the report. Yet all of this information was available under the previous government and was brought to the public’s attention three or four times every year during the Senate estimates process. Now that Labor has abolished the central agency for government advertising, this vital information has been hidden in the bureaucracies of individual departments. But this is again no surprise. Using the veil of independence and transparency of an outside agency, this report does not conceal what truly lies beneath: more complexity and less information about government advertising programs.
Overall, the ANAO report is a damning indictment of how the Rudd Labor government has been abusing the system over the past year and since it took office. Even the ANAO now admits that the Rudd Labor government has put spin over substance in its advertising campaigns and it is time for the Rudd government to act to fix these problems and fix them now.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Audit Report No. 2 of 2009-01</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,35,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-09-10,"—Tonight I rise to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of the Cancer Council and to discuss my involvement as part of the Queensland Senators Team in the Cancer Council’s Brisbane Relay for Life. Every year the Cancer Council puts on the Brisbane Relay for Life, one of the many held around Australia, to raise money for cancer research, provide support for those with cancer and educate the community about prevention. But the Relay for Life is not just a fundraiser for the Cancer Council. It enables people from all walks of life to come together for 18 hours for one common cause: to celebrate cancer survivors, remember loved ones who we have lost and to fight back against the disease which has affected each and every one of us in some way.
According to the Cancer Council an estimated 111,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in 2009; one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 85; cancer is a leading cause of death in Australia, with more than 42,000 expected to die from cancer in 2009; almost 12,000 more people die each year from cancer than 30 years ago; more than 60 percent of cancer patients will survive more than five years after being diagnosed; the survival rates for many common cancer have increased by more than 30 percent in the past two decades; the most common cancers in Australia, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, are prostate, bowel, breast, melanoma and lung cancers; each year 434,000 people are treated for non-melanoma skin cancer, which is the most common but least life threatening; cancer costs $3.8 billion in direct health system costs; and $378 million was spent on cancer research in 2000-01, 22 per cent of all health research expenditure in Australia.
These numbers are alarming, which is why I decided to embark on this journey with the Cancer Council by participating in the Relay for Life, and have done so over several years now. I have participated in the Pine Rivers Relay for Life three times before as co-captain and in two years won the award for highest fundraiser, raising over $30,000. I have also taken part in the Redcliffe Relay for Life and will be joining the member for Petrie, Yvette D’Ath’s, Petrie Possums on 19 September, along with a team in the Pine Rivers 2009 relay on 31 October.
Participating in these events is important to me. It is not only for a good cause but a chance as a community to provide support and aid to those who need it most. I am sure everyone has been touched by cancer in some way, whether it was your mum, your dad, your brother, your sister or even your child. Cancer does not discriminate, which is why it is important that we support events like Relay for Life to raise much-needed funds for non-government organisations like the Cancer Council to find a cure for a disease which can affect anyone at any age.
Together with fellow Queensland Senator Claire Moore, Abdul Salam Obeid, Wendy Cooke, Russell Vieritz, Christine Stubbs, David Doolan, Abdul Kadir Obeid, Stacey Furner, John Hamze, Annalese Vieritz, Carol Cooke, and John, Carol’s partner, we formed the Queensland Senators Team and participate in the Brisbane Relay for Life held at Mount Gravatt showgrounds from 3.00 pm on Saturday 22 August to 9.00 am on Sunday 23 August. The idea of the event is to have at least one carrying around the team baton for the entire 18 hours. Each team member took turns with a half hour shift, and I thank those who did the graveyard shifts in the early hours of the morning. The event kicked off at 3.00 pm on the Saturday with an opening ceremony and a chance for survivors and carers, wearing sashes, to do a walk of solidarity in the fight against this disease which affects so many Australians. At 6.00 pm there was a candlelight ceremony, where every team member was given a paper bag to decorate. Some people put the names of loved ones who they had lost to cancer on them. After a moving ceremony, a candle was put inside each bag and lit and all the lights at the showground were turned off so all you could see were soft lights coming from within the bags.
The following morning was the closing ceremony, where the story of a young woman of just 22 suffering from cancer was played to the crowd. The young lady was diagnosed with bowel cancer and had undergone chemotherapy only to find that it had spread to more parts of her body. But she has not given up and remains optimistic that she will pull through this disease, which has affected her so young. It is stories like this that make you realise that no one is exempt from cancer. As well as the ceremonies, the Cancer Council provided entertainment to get the 500-plus participants going throughout the night, including two movie screenings from midnight for the kids.
This year’s Relay for Life also had a different spin from previous years. Aside from raising money leading up to the event, each of the 50 or so participating teams had to organise a fundraising activity at their tent site. There were cake stalls, shoulder rubs, face painting, raffles, chance games and Smurf muffins to name just a few. Additionally, the Queensland Senators Team had a game called ‘Put money where your mouth is’, where participants got to throw coins through a hole cut out of the mouth of one of my corflutes. The game was a success, with many eager passers-by having a go throwing a coin at me.
The event was an overall success and I would like to thank all my fellow team members for all the hard work they put in by raising funds and helping to set up on Saturday afternoon and pack up on Sunday morning. I would also like to say a big thankyou to all our sponsors and those who made a contribution either online or by post to the Queensland Senators Team, including Colgate Palmolive; Kerry Ingredients; Campbells Cash and Carry; ITW Proline; Berri; Bidvest; Metcash—IGA Distribution; Pizza Hut, Holland Park; McDonalds, Carina Heights; Mansfield State High School; the Australian Services Union; Christine Flage; the member for Deakin, Mike Symon; Senator Farrell; Senator Sterle; Senator Bilyk; Senator Hurley; the member for Lindsay, David Bradbury; the member for Blair, Shayne Neumann; and Queensland state member for Murrumba, Dean Wells.
In total the Queensland Senators Team raised $4,764.70 to contribute to the Brisbane Relay for Life 2009 event, which continues to climb and is now over $92,000. I would like to give a big thankyou to those who donated to my team members.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-09-10,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
All agencies subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 are required to report procurement contracts awarded where the contract value is $10,000 or more on AusTender, the government’s tender and procurement reporting system. From 3 September 2007 departments and agencies have been required to include on AusTender details of those contracts which are consultancies and the reason for the consultancy. The information sought by the honourable member in relation to DBCDE consultancies valued at $10,000 or more is available on the AusTender website (www.tenders.gov.au). Please note that departments have six weeks to report procurement contracts on AusTender.
Further details will be available in the Department’s annual report, which is due to be published in October 2009.
While AusTender and the Annual Report contain details of contracts valued at $10,000 or more, it is considered to be an unreasonable diversion of resources for the Department to provide details of consultancies valued at less than $10,000.
Details of consultancies over the value of $10,000 can be obtained from the AusTender website.
The Department has prepared its Annual Procurement Plan. This plan identifies 31 expected contract opportunities for the next 12 months. This plan was developed on the best information available at the time and is subject to change. The Annual Procurement Plan has been published on AusTender.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy: Consultants</title>",Answers to Questions on Notice,38,1,answer
