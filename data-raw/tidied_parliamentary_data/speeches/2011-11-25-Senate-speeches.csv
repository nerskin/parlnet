Question agreed to. 

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,3,2,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-11-25,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (11:25):  I rise today with some relief to speak upon the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. Let me say upfront that the coalition does not oppose this package of legislative changes. Indeed, it is the role of the law to facilitate domestic market conditions that are good for business and the community, and competition policy plays a critical part in that role.


The amendments in this bill attempt to strengthen the competition policy regime, which in turn should facilitate a more conducive economic and business environment. That said, the coalition believes that this is an extremely modest bill with modest aims. While we see no damage being caused by this bill, we also see no great cause for celebration. The govern­ment's language of accomplishment and achievement does not suit this bill. It is misleading and overstates the impact these changes will make. Yet again we have the Labor Party seeking to create the illusion of reform. Desperate to claim some sort of policy success that assists businesses, and particularly smaller businesses, it makes claims where there are none and overstates the impact of minor changes.


Essentially, this bill has two aims. The first is to clarify the operation of existing provisions—and, I stress, not to create new ones—relating to mergers and acquisitions by addressing a potential uncertainty or ambiguity that may arise in defining what a market is for the purposes of section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. It does this by broadening the language of 'market' so that all markets can be included and so that creeping acquisitions can also be scrutinised. This will ensure that a court or the ACCC can examine mergers in a greater number of markets.


The second aim of the bill is to insert interpretive principles into the unconscion­able conduct provisions to assist the courts in applying the law as well as to assist broader community and stakeholder understanding. What the bill does not achieve is that which was described in the government's speeches in the second reading debate, when it claimed great accomplishments for small business and groundbreaking shifts in competition and consumer law in Australia. It does not do anything of that sort. It is what it is, and we support it for the aims I have just outlined. It is a modest gain to clarify contested and often misunderstood aspects of competition law.


I first want to address the bill's provisions in relation to its amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 with respect to section 50, which is the key provision relating to mergers and acquisitions. It provides the ACCC with the legislative framework to analyse, consider and address potential competition policy concerns posed by mergers and acquisitions in Australia. Most of us agree that mergers and acquisitions are important for the efficient functioning of the Australian economy. They allow firms to achieve efficiency such as economies of scale and the diversification of risk across a range of activities. Absent some genuine and real concern for the greater community, there is no role for the state or the law in restricting these.


However, the current law does contain a weakness, and this bill addresses the issue of 'creeping acquisitions'. Creeping acquisitions are a series of small-scale acquisitions that individually may not substantially lessen competition in a market but collectively have the potential to do so over time. Each of these small acquisitions may not be in breach of section 50, and therefore the series of acquisitions are permissible by law. However, over a long period of time such transactions may have the cumulative effect of substantially lessening competition in a market. There are currently no provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act to prevent or limit creeping acquisitions.


Over the past decade or so there have been concerns raised about market concentration in a number of key sectors. We have seen it recently in banking, groceries, fuel and a few other areas. As a result, issues have arisen as to how section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act is applied to these markets, particularly those affected by creeping acquisitions. One just has to look at the supermarket sector to see my point. Just over two decades ago, when Professor Hilmer was doing his work looking at our competition and consumer framework and recommending the reforms which earned a wide degree of support and which have been of significant and undoubted benefit to Australia and Australians, the two major supermarket chains had less than half of the total grocery market. Today, those same two chains have more than two-thirds—approaching three-quarters—of the market. Nothing enormous or transformational happened overnight. Indeed that change in market share may partly simply reflect changing consumer preferences. But we also know that, through a series of acquisitions, new presences and purchases of new properties, the supermarket majors have greatly enhanced their positions. It is only fair to concede that the degree of increase in market share of these two major chains has caused a level of concern in some areas of our community—amongst consumers, producers and businesses alike.


To start with, these changes to the act remove the word 'substantial' in relation to the ACCC's analysis of mergers and acquisitions, so now even those mergers not considered substantial can be scrutinised by the ACCC. The hope is that this will remove the risk that a court might adopt the view that an acquisition in a geographically confined market is not substantial and therefore does not fall within the scope of section 50.


The bill also amends section 50 to replace references to 'a market' with references to 'any market'. Together, these changes clarify the ability of the ACCC or a court to consider multiple markets when assessing mergers, including smaller mergers which over time may amount to potentially damag­ing creeping acquisitions. It is important to note, however, that the amendments to section 50 do not oblige the ACCC to examine the competitive impact of an acquisition in a small market. It is simply a clarification that it indeed may do so and that it is a relevant factor where a merger is being considered for other reasons.


So what do we have here? In short and put simply, this is a clarification of the law to reduce an ambiguity that might become a legal basis to challenge the work of the ACCC. On that basis, the coalition supports the bill. But I say again: we do not support the government's claim that this bill is somehow a profound strengthening of the Competition and Consumer Act.


The other aspect of this bill relates to the concept of unconscionable conduct. As with the amendments to section 50, these provisions also reflect work undertaken by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The Competition and Consumer Act does not currently include a statutory definition of 'unconscionable conduct'.  Let us be very clear: this bill makes no changes to those provisions. Rather, what this bill seeks to do is implement guiding interpretive principles so that there is better understanding of 'unconscionable conduct'. The coalition supports this initiative.


What we really need and what will contribute to the further development of healthy competition policy is a better under­standing of the concept of unconscionable behaviour and what it means for businesses—in particular, small, medium-sized and family businesses. While we understand that many people and many small businesses may at times have a negative experience, particularly when dealing with a larger business, and can come to the conclusion that what they have experienced is unconscionable conduct, this is a complex area of law and we need to assist people to understand this area of law in more detail. This bill does make it a little bit clearer and the way it brings clarity is through establishing these interpretive principles.


It was the recommendation of the Senate Economics Committee that interpretive principles were needed rather than specific examples. This is an important distinction. Examples, it was thought, may create a false sense of expectation. It was also believed that examples may not remain relevant or current as community expectations change—such changes might change the meaning and understanding of 'unconscionable conduct'. Interpretive principles will assist the courts in interpreting the provisions, help stakeholders in understanding them and guide regulators in enforcing them.


But, again, let us be clear about the impact of these interpretive principles. They do not in any way, shape or form offer the agencies new powers in addressing unconscionable conduct. There are no new protections announced for small business and it would be misleading for anyone to imply in the commentary on this bill that these changes represent substantial new protections for small business. These interpretive principles should give clarity to the court about what was intended by parliament, but they should not be oversold.


These amendments insert new guidelines to assist people, to assist businesses, to assist the regulators and to assist the courts. But by no means are these principles any sort of new measure that will give the greater protection that some have called for. Again, the government has attempted to oversell its limited efforts in order to create the illusion of activity and the illusion of substantial policy reform. Sadly, the constant over­selling of its efforts reduces its fatally damaged credibility even further, particularly when dealing with small business.


The government claims that this bill before the Senate today implements a Labor election commitment to introduce a law in relation to creeping acquisitions—they claimed the then regulatory response did not adequately address the problem. They claim great reform. But that is little more than misplaced grandeur. In reality, what we have here is the government applying a dictionary and a thesaurus to the original bill—expanding some definitions and giving us some interpretive guidelines to better understand the sometimes complex language of competition law. That is an important objective. These are all good and necessary changes that the coalition supports. However, they must be understood and explained for what they are—this is a start and a step in the right direction, but many more steps are needed. That is why the coalition has called for a root and branch review of the competition and consumer law. Two decades on, such a review is only appropriate, but for some reason this government seems to think that a few tweaks and a few changes here and there will create the illusion that it is really listening when it is not.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (11:35):  In summing up and closing the second reading contributions on the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, I firstly thank Senator Ryan. I will make some remarks in response to a couple of the points Senator Ryan made, but in thanking him I do acknowledge that he did stick substantially to the issue before the chair, unlike some of his colleagues. He made a useful contribution to the considera­tion of this legislation.


This bill will strengthen and clarify Australia's competition and consumer laws, which are designed to improve the welfare of Australians. The bill makes two important changes. The first general point I would make in response to one of Senator Ryan's arguments is that we do not overstate the consequences of this legislation. The changes are important, but we certainly do not overclaim what the impact of these two changes will be. 


Firstly, the bill will enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions by amending the mergers and acquisitions provisions in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The bill will remove the requirement that a market in which the competition effects of a merger or acquisition are assessed must be a substantial market. The amendments will also ensure that the courts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, can consider the competitive effects of a merger or acquisition in any market.


Secondly, the bill improves and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The bill will assist consumers, busin­esses, regulators and the courts through inserting interpretive principles which will clarify the meaning of unconscionable conduct. The bill will also unify the business and consumer related provisions. These amendments clarify the parliament's intention as to how the unconscionable conduct law should apply. They will help the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to take more effective enforcement and compliance action. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to correct a small number of drafting errors which arose in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010.


I will make a couple of concluding remarks. Firstly, I do not agree with the level of Senator Ryan's critique. I think it is important to point out that, not just in the context of this legislation, this government over the past four years has taken effective steps in a range of consumer law activity. Not the least of these, of course, is the important legislation known as the Australian Consumer Law. I do not intend to go into that in detail, given the limited time today, but I would point out that this govern­ment, for which I have some responsibilities in my deregulatory ministerial capacity, has taken a number of significant steps in moving towards a seamless national economy and in protecting consumers. That is well illustrated by the Australian Consumer Law and by the transfer, with the agreement of the states, of responsibilities in the last significant remaining areas of financial services regulation and supervision. So I would argue that this government has taken a number of effective initiatives with respect to competition and consumer laws in this country, of which this piece of legislation represents a part.


Senator Ryan stated a number of concerns. One in particular was the presence in our marketplace of what are known as the 'big two' retailers and their growth in market share over a long period of time. I note that he expressed some concerns about the trend and also referred to the need to do more with respect to this issue. Senator Ryan, I look forward to a policy contribution from the opposition in this regard. I look forward to any policy announcement from those opposite. I think it should be pointed out, as Senator Ryan's National Party colleagues have pointed out, that over many years, including the almost 12 years they were in government, this trend was rapidly accentuated under the previous Liberal-National Party government. Despite the stated concerns of some in the opposition, particularly those in the National Party, they did nothing about it. So we do look forward to the development of effective policy from the Liberal-National Party in this regard and in other areas of competition. Perhaps in the spirit of Christmas goodwill, as we are approaching that time of the year, the Liberal-National Party will give some consideration to actually coming up with a policy or two over the break, rather than continuing their very negative constant attack and critique and basically saying no to anything the government does.


The final contribution I want to make in this debate is to thank the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It has done some good work under successive chairs.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  A fine job.




Senator SHERRY:
  Mr Acting Deputy President and colleague, you are Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and I want to acknowledge and thank you and the members of the committee for your good work. I also want to acknowledge the important work that my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Bradbury, has done on this measure and others. This is an important reform. We do not overstate its impact but it is an important reform and should be seen in the context of the total reforms that this government has made to improve competition—effective competition; it is important to add that descriptor—in this area. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:44):  I have a couple of comments to make on the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I did not have an opportunity to speak to it during the second reading debate, not through any lack of trying on the part of the minister, who graciously tried to see where I was—I was in another meeting. I will make a couple of short contributions that will lead into the amendments that I will be moving shortly.


I do not oppose this bill, but I believe that it could be improved. That is why I will be moving amendments to omit the word 'substantially' and substitute the word 'materially' when it comes to mergers. It is my view that the ACCC does not have the legislative firepower that it needs to deal with the issue of mergers. Having the word 'materially' rather than 'substantially' with regard to lessening competition would make a very real difference to the highly concentrated markets we have here in Australia. We have a situation where Woolworths and Coles control some 80 per cent of the dry grocery market. We have had too many mergers that have been approved by the ACCC under the current legislation. We have seen the difficulties in the grocery sector with petrol and we have a looming problem with the liquor market, and the word 'substantially' does not do the job that it should—it is too high a test. That is why I am grateful for the work that Associate Professor Frank Zumbo, from the University of New South Wales, has done in relation to this and other competition issues.


I have some questions for the government. I am aware of the time constraints and I will be short and succinct. I am concerned about the amendments to the definition of unconscionable conduct in this regard. My question is as follows: the government is going to include a number of paragraphs in the legislation that set out examples of unconscionable conduct. It is quite proscrip­tive, but I ask the minister whether what is proposed in the bill is essentially repeating what the courts have said in previous cases? Do these amendments expand the scope of the unconscionable conduct provisions in the legislation? I will start off with that, and I had two or three more questions after that.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:47):  If I may assist the minister, the legitimate concerns I have about these amendments are about whether they will actually make a difference if what the bill is proposing to do is simply to restate the position of the courts in existing cases. What difference will it make? That is essentially my question, and I have some follow-up questions depending on the minister's answer. I think it is quite material to how effective these changes will be, and what the government believes these changes will mean to the definition of unconscionable conduct and the practical application of the law.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (11:48):  I am conscious of the time, so I will try to deal with your concerns, Senator Xenophon, though I am not necessarily sure I will satisfy them.


Effectively, clarifying the issues you raised, the expert panel that explicitly considered the issue of unconscionable conduct has raised a number of concerns about potential use of examples in the ACL. For example, listing a particular scenario as amounting to unconscionable conduct might be misleading when a court might decide that a scenario with slightly different facts does not involve unconscionable conduct. Examples might be treated as rebuttable presumptions either formally by the courts or in the development of business practices. Examples are unlikely to remain current as business practices and technologies evolve.


The Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which I referred to in my second reading speech, considered whether the definition of 'unconscionable conduct' should be inserted in the act in its December 2008 report, The need, scope and content of a definition of unconscionable conduct for the purposes of part IVA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The committee noted two significant reservations about defining unconscionable conduct in the act. Firstly, terms used in a definition would need to be carefully considered for their judicial meaning, and it would need to be clear to stakeholders how the courts' interpretation of these terms might encroach on current business practices and how a definition would affect larger businesses' respon­sibilities under other statutes. Secondly, agreeing on a suitable definition would be a prolonged and difficult process, and definitions proposed, such as that put forward by Professor Zumbo, to whom Senator Xenophon has referred, were considered too complex and uncertain. Accordingly, the Senate committee consid­ered that a definition of unconscionable conduct should not be adopted, and recom­mended an alternative process whereby an expert panel should consider whether examples should be inserted in the act. This is the path the government took. The expert panel explicitly considered whether examples would improve the functioning of the law in this area, and instead recommended that principles be inserted in the act.


My only other comment is that it is correct that the principles that are inserted are obviously based on case law.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:51):  I am grateful to the minister for those answers. I want to go further. I refer my friends in the coalition to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics report, The need, scope and content of a definition of unconscionable conduct for the purposes of part IVA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It is a December 2008 report—it is amazing to think that three years have passed so quickly. There are additional comments made by both the coalition and myself about the need for a statutory definition of unconscionable conduct. I am pleased that the coalition took that view at that time and I hope it is still their view.


Notwithstanding that, I want to get to the nub of the issues of the specific amendments proposed by the government. Does the government expect that there will be more cases brought to court as a result of these amendments to the definition of unconscionable conduct?

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (11:52):  Frankly, it is very difficult to give you an answer to that and to predict the level of disputes, cases et cetera. One of the factors would be the decision of the regulator—the ACCC. I understand why you are interested in an answer but, having taken advice, it is not possible for me to give an answer on that matter. It is a somewhat hypothetical matter of conjecture.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (11:53):  Given Senator Xenophon invited me to make some comments, I thought I should briefly restate our position on this. Senator Xenophon, you and I have spent some quality hours in the Senate Economics References Committee together, particularly on supermarket issues. I was not a member of the committee that reported that. I would state, though, that our commitment to the root-and-branch review of the act encompasses the issue you raise. We do not necessarily have a position on it. We think that, two decades on, it is time to look at it. The events that are necessary to trigger an offence are something we are keen to look at. However, my personal view on the question about whether something should result in a greater number of court cases is that a good act does not necessarily lead to a higher number of court cases because it has an educative function that means that behaviour changes, which does not necessarily lead to a higher number of court cases.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-11-25,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:54):  I am grateful for Senator Ryan's contribution. I indicate to him that I think that is a fair point. Just because you do not have more court cases does not mean that the legislation is not more effective or broader. But the coalition did state three years ago that there is a need for a statutory definition of unconscionable conduct and that the current law was not adequate. It then set out in the additional comments that there is a need for a statutory list of examples that constitute unconscionable conduct—which is consistent with this bill, I believe—that there is a need for a prohibition against bullying, intimidation, physical force, coercion and undue harassment and that there is a need for a statutory definition of the statutory duty of good faith as well as a legislative framework to deal with unfair contract terms in business relationships involving small businesses. That is something that the coalition signed up to three years ago. Senator Eggleston, Senator Bushby, Senator Joyce and I signed up for that.


Another way to put the question to Senator Sherry is this: will these amend­ments in terms of unconscionable conduct broaden the operation of the section?

You did indicate that you were asking the question in another way—

  It's a different question.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:56):  I appreciate the minister's frankness. If the government is unable to say whether this will broaden the operation of the section, you need to query what the benefit of these amendments will be. If it is simply restating the position of the case law then it is the status quo. It is just a bit of window dressing for the current operation of laws relating to unconscionable conduct. I think the government has set out why it does not accept the need for a statutory definition of unconscionable conduct but, if it cannot say that it will broaden the operation of the section, to what extent does it consider that there may be a gap in the law in the absence of a statutory definition? Isn't it better to have a statutory definition as to what the government is intending to do? I accept that the intentions of the government with respect to this legislation are good ones, but I worry that effectively the status quo will remain as is.

You have a conceptual approach that I think is best summed up as about the nature of 'broaden'. I have indicated that these amendments will strengthen and clarify. I understand your perspective. I do not necessarily agree with it, but I do understand it. You are seeking far-reaching broadening, if I can add to your descriptor. These changes are meant to strengthen and clarify. I do not think I can add any more to my earlier remarks.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:59):  by leave—I move the amendments on sheet 7136:


(1)   Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 3), before item 1, insert:


1AA  Subsection 50(1)


   Omit ""substantially"", substitute ""materially"".


(2)   Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 5), after item 1, insert:


1A  Subsection 50(2)


   Omit ""substantially"", substitute ""materially"".


(3)   Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 17), after item 3, insert:


3A  Subsection 50(1) of Schedule 1


   Omit ""substantially"", substitute ""materially"".


These amendments are intended to lower the threshold by which mergers are considered by the ACCC. Under the current threshold a merger is only prohibited if it 'substantially' lessens competition. The use of the word 'substantially' makes the threshold a very high one requiring the merged entity to exercise market power after the merger. Proving the existence of market power requires proof of an ability to raise prices without losing business. Very few businesses would have market power under the definition as it is effectively only a monopolist that would have the power to raise prices without losing business.


Under the existing threshold relatively few mergers or acquisitions are stopped by the ACCC. Mergers and acquisitions reduce competition in the market and lead to higher levels of market concentration. A reduction in competition is detrimental to competition and consumers as it may lead to higher prices and reduced product choices. We need a stricter threshold for assessing mergers. Within this context the concept of materiality is adopted, as that is a commonly understood concept used in the accounting and business world to assess the impact of particular conduct or an event. In this context a merger will substantially lessen competition if it has or would have a noticeably adverse impact on competition by reducing in a material way the number of efficient independent competitors and the range of product choices available to consumers.


That is at the heart of this. We need to do a lot better. In recent years too many mergers have been approved by the ACCC. The ACCC does not have the legislative firepower to deal with these issues adequately. The threshold is simply too high under 'substantially'; 'materially' would remedy that.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (12:01):  I acknowledge and appreciate the concern of Senator Xenophon and the attention he has paid to this issue—as has Senator Ryan. I recall a significant number of discussions about this at Senate estimates. We are dealing with substituting the word 'substantially' with 'materially'. The detailed and principled approach that Senator Xenophon is proposing reflects what is known as his trade practices Richmond amendment bill. I do note we are developing a trend to name amendments in this area after geographic locations based on where proposals are drafted or communicated. But that is by the by. I am not sure which Richmond this is—I know a number of Richmonds.




Senator Xenophon:
  I can clarify that right now.




Senator SHERRY:
  Thank you. As I have said, the proposal is to change the test to 'material' lessening of the competition, as reflected in Senator Xenophon's earlier bill. That bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry. The majority report—both government and opposition—recommended against the passage of the bill with this approach contained in it. The concept of substantially lessening competition has been part of section 50 since 1993. It is well established and understood by the courts, the ACCC, business and consumers.


The concept of 'substantially' is interpreted by the courts to mean 'that the effect of the acquisition be 'meaningful or relevant' to the competitive process'. Australia's SLC test for mergers is consistent with merger laws in many other OECD countries, including the US, Canada, the UK and New Zealand. What is proposed—effectively the Richmond amendment—could have the effect of moving Australia out of line with international practice. It would make significant changes to Australia's merger law that are likely to have substantial and unintended consequences.


Consistent with our previous position, as enunciated in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and the response to considering what is known as the Richmond bill, the government is unable to support the amendments that Senator Xenophon has presented.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-25,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:04):  In the interests of time I did not choose to make a second reading contribution so I will quickly sum up where we are coming from with this legislation and Senator Xenophon's amendments. I note that the concluding comments of the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest say:


Given the history of reviews and the Rudd Government’s commitment to implement a ‘creeping acquisitions’ law ‘as a matter of urgency’, it might seem that the amendments to the merger provisions proposed by the Bill are an anti-climax. Descriptions of the amendments as ‘window dressing’ or ‘pragmatic’ would also appear to be apt. These minor amendments largely reflect the ACCC’s current interpretation of the existing law and are unlikely to have any substantial effect on merger analysis in the future.


Similarly with the unconscionable conduct provisions. The Federal Government has been under pressure for some time to strengthen these prohibitions and the Bill purports to finally address these calls. The changes are, in fact, relatively minor. Their real effect seems likely to be minimal and they are not expected to have a substantial impact in practice. However there are other reforms happening at this time including the amendments to the Franchising Code of Conduct ...


It goes on to say that they might have a collective impact. I think the reality is, as Senator Sherry has just outlined, that the word 'substantially' is understood in case law on this legislation. It is true that it is consistent with legislation in the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand and it has been part of case history and case law in Australia since 1993. There is a concern that if the word were changed to 'materially' the gov­ernment would be arguing that 'substantially' and 'materially' mean the same, because this is to be seen as only a clarification, not a change. So the government would argue that 'substantially' and 'materially' are the same. However, if 'substantially' were changed in the legislation, people would come back, in relation to all those cases since 1993, saying, 'Where does that leave us?' The difference between 'substantially' and 'materially' would need to be tested in the courts. We could end up with a bit of a process in the courts, in the making of that determination. Although Senator Xenophon says that 'materially' is understood to be a lesser threshold than 'substantially', there would be a legal argument as to whether that was the case and, if it was the case, at what point would 'materially' kick in as opposed to the stronger definition that is 'substantially'. It is for that reason that the Greens will not support Senator Xenophon's amendments: they lead to that unresolved question of the difference between 'materially' and 'substantially'. I do not want to bring into play at this time that which has already been dealt with. I also want the legislation to stay consistent with international law and with other countries' laws and experience.


The other comment I will make, quickly, is that the ACCC is under different leadership. It is quite clear from that new leadership that the ACCC intends to take a more assertive position in relation to mergers and so on, and that it wants to become a little more proactive. I am concerned that making this change now might in some way complicate the opportunity that exists for a more aggressive and assertive role for the ACCC in this space. I support the ACCC's new leadership's stated position of taking a more assertive position in this area. I do not want to complicate those matters. That is why the Greens will not be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments.


However, I say to the government that, while it is says this clarifies things, the Parliamentary Library's assessment suggests it is extremely minor and does not really make any substantial change. The Greens agree with Senator Xenophon that we need substantial change. If the ACCC's attempts to use the law as it currently stands in a more assertive and proactive way fail, because the law turns out to restrict the ACCC's ability to do so, I will be very happy to be back here supporting a much more substantial intervention. At this stage we support the minor amendment that the government is proposing but will not support Senator Xenophon's amendment. I will say that this is a space that we are all going to be watching with a very interested eye so as to see how the ACCC proceeds in the next 12 months.

She makes two very reasonable points. In noting that, I have been present on one occasion when the new head of the ACCC, Mr Sims—this was in the context of franchising law, on which there has been some recent improvement in dispute resolution and a range of other changes—indicated the ACCC's renewed interest in applying the upgraded franchising area of the legislation and devoting more attention to that. I will not go to other issues of franchising reform, but I do note that. I think it is an important consideration. I accept Senator Milne's caveat that, in supporting these amendments today, the Greens will be keeping a close eye on developments as they emerge from the focus of the ACCC.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:13):  I am grateful for the comments made by my colleagues. In relation to those of Senator Milne: it is fair enough for her to say, by referring to the Bills Digest—the objective analysis of legislation, if you like, that we receive here—that it is about clarification and could be seen to be window dressing. I am disappointed that the Australian Greens cannot support the amendment at this time, but at least they are keeping the door open. I do acknowledge that there has been a change of guard at the ACCC, and that Mr Rod Sims, the new chairman, has taken a different approach. The statements he has made to date have been encouraging. The way in which he has approached evidence at Senate estimates hearings is refreshing. I welcome that, but I still think we are not giving the ACCC the powers it needs to deal with this adequately.


When it comes to issues of mergers and acquisitions, let us put this in perspective. Senator John Williams is in the chamber. I thought his contribution and a question he put to Mr Sims during a Senate estimates hearing not so long ago were telling. Senator Williams basically asked—I am sure he will correct me if I misquote him—how is it that in the last 30 years, the last generation, we have had a situation where Coles and Woolworths have gone from a 40 per cent market share between the two of them to something like an 80 per cent market share? That is an exponential increase. How is that good for competition? How is that good for suppliers down the supply chain? How is that good for wholesalers? How is it good for consumers that they have so little choice in this country? And how is it good that we have two big gorillas in the room when it comes to our grocery sector? You even have multinationals, such as Heinz, saying: 'This is killing us in terms of food processing. This is actually squeezing us out of the marketplace because of the conduct of those two.' 


Our current laws are not good enough and that is why we need a change from 'substantially' to 'materially'. I am grateful to the Minister for Small Business for mentioning the Richmond amendment because I was going to get to it. The Richmond amendment is named after the location of the United service station at 128 Marion Road Richmond West in South Australia—a service station run for many years by William and Samira Fares. This is a small family business—a business where they put in hard work, do great mechanical work and serve petrol, and they are salt of the earth people. They have worked their guts out to build up that business, and what happens? Woolworths decides to set up an outlet right next door to them—blocking the view of oncoming traffic to their service station—to compete with them in a way that is not fair; to compete with them with their huge buying power in a way that cannot allow a level playing field.


It is an issue that I raised directly with Michael Luscombe, the former CEO of Woolworths, and he was good enough to meet with me in Sydney last year about this. I put to him—I do not think he would mind me saying this—'If you say that they can compete then why don't you let the Fares, in their United service station at 128 Marron Road Richmond West in South Australia, access petrol at the same price you can access petrol?' There are days when the wholesale price that William and Samira Fares pay for their petrol is higher than the price that Woolworths is retailing it for. How can that be fair? We need to remedy that. We need to give small businesses in this country are fighting chance.


I have small businesses—I am not going to do anything to identify them—come to my office, and they are even reluctant to be seen to walking into my office. They tell me, 'If we make a complaint to the ACCC about what Woolworths and Coles are doing to us, about the conditions they sometimes put on us, such as they suddenly want ten tonnes of a particular vegetable at a certain price'—which is below the cost of production for these businesses—'and we do not do it, then that will be the end of their relationship with us.' You also have small businesses setting up a business model that is based on having Coles and Woolworths as their main buyer, and they say, 'There's no point going to the ACCC because if we make a complaint we're finished.' If these things are happening then we need to do something about mergers in this country, we need to do something about increasing competition, and we need to do something about small businesses having a fighting chance.


That is why I have moved this amendment. I am grateful to the Greens for a least keeping the door open. Senator Madigan has told me privately, and he may want to make a contribution on behalf of the DLP, that he will be supporting this amendment. So we will be dividing on this amendment. I would urge Senator Williams, if he is able, to at least keep the door open to this and to at least consider supporting this.


We need to do something better. We need to have a situation where the laws of this nation work for the small business sector and, in turn, for consumers. As for the references that have been made to other countries not going to 'materially', in the United States—I am grateful for the work that Senator Williams has done on this—they have got the Robinson-Patman Act where you cannot have anyone having more than 20 per cent of the market. You do not have a situation there where two supermarket chains control 80 per cent of the dry grocery market as in this country. They have got legislative safeguards. They may not have the word 'materially' in some of those jurisdictions, but they have got other pieces of legislation that gives a semblance of protection to small business. That is what the key to this is. 


I note that Senator Ryan, on behalf of the coalition, says that he is not supporting this. Senator Ryan and I have disagreements about the marketplace, but I have a genuinely good work relationship with Senator Ryan. I do respect that he has got some intellectual firepower. I do not agree with his position on the $1 milk and the like. I say that genuinely; at least we can have a discussion about it. My plea to Senator Ryan, to the coalition, to the Greens and to the government is: something has gone seriously wrong in this country when it comes to allowing the level of market concentration in so many industries. Associate Professor Frank Zumbo has assisted me with drafting the Richard amendment. He met the Fares; he spoke to them and he spoke to the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Tom Koutsantonis, their local member. One good thing that has come out of the meeting that we had at Richmond West a year and a half ago is that there is now a Small Business Commissioner of South Australia, which Associate Professor Zumbo had a key role in creating.


There are some small changes to franchising law—I know that Senator Sherry is not ecstatic about that—where small business, under a Labor government, I might add, will have a fighting chance. It is disappointing that the Liberal Party in South Australia oppose that. Let us do this right. Let us revisit this. I welcome Senator Milne's comments. I would urge my colleagues to think carefully about this amendment. There will be a division on it based on Senator Madigan's gracious support for this amendment. There is something seriously wrong in this country in the way that we have dealt with the big end of town and small businesses.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (11:25):  I rise today with some relief to speak upon the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. Let me say upfront that the coalition does not oppose this package of legislative changes. Indeed, it is the role of the law to facilitate domestic market conditions that are good for business and the community, and competition policy plays a critical part in that role.


The amendments in this bill attempt to strengthen the competition policy regime, which in turn should facilitate a more conducive economic and business environment. That said, the coalition believes that this is an extremely modest bill with modest aims. While we see no damage being caused by this bill, we also see no great cause for celebration. The govern­ment's language of accomplishment and achievement does not suit this bill. It is misleading and overstates the impact these changes will make. Yet again we have the Labor Party seeking to create the illusion of reform. Desperate to claim some sort of policy success that assists businesses, and particularly smaller businesses, it makes claims where there are none and overstates the impact of minor changes.


Essentially, this bill has two aims. The first is to clarify the operation of existing provisions—and, I stress, not to create new ones—relating to mergers and acquisitions by addressing a potential uncertainty or ambiguity that may arise in defining what a market is for the purposes of section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. It does this by broadening the language of 'market' so that all markets can be included and so that creeping acquisitions can also be scrutinised. This will ensure that a court or the ACCC can examine mergers in a greater number of markets.


The second aim of the bill is to insert interpretive principles into the unconscion­able conduct provisions to assist the courts in applying the law as well as to assist broader community and stakeholder understanding. What the bill does not achieve is that which was described in the government's speeches in the second reading debate, when it claimed great accomplishments for small business and groundbreaking shifts in competition and consumer law in Australia. It does not do anything of that sort. It is what it is, and we support it for the aims I have just outlined. It is a modest gain to clarify contested and often misunderstood aspects of competition law.


I first want to address the bill's provisions in relation to its amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 with respect to section 50, which is the key provision relating to mergers and acquisitions. It provides the ACCC with the legislative framework to analyse, consider and address potential competition policy concerns posed by mergers and acquisitions in Australia. Most of us agree that mergers and acquisitions are important for the efficient functioning of the Australian economy. They allow firms to achieve efficiency such as economies of scale and the diversification of risk across a range of activities. Absent some genuine and real concern for the greater community, there is no role for the state or the law in restricting these.


However, the current law does contain a weakness, and this bill addresses the issue of 'creeping acquisitions'. Creeping acquisitions are a series of small-scale acquisitions that individually may not substantially lessen competition in a market but collectively have the potential to do so over time. Each of these small acquisitions may not be in breach of section 50, and therefore the series of acquisitions are permissible by law. However, over a long period of time such transactions may have the cumulative effect of substantially lessening competition in a market. There are currently no provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act to prevent or limit creeping acquisitions.


Over the past decade or so there have been concerns raised about market concentration in a number of key sectors. We have seen it recently in banking, groceries, fuel and a few other areas. As a result, issues have arisen as to how section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act is applied to these markets, particularly those affected by creeping acquisitions. One just has to look at the supermarket sector to see my point. Just over two decades ago, when Professor Hilmer was doing his work looking at our competition and consumer framework and recommending the reforms which earned a wide degree of support and which have been of significant and undoubted benefit to Australia and Australians, the two major supermarket chains had less than half of the total grocery market. Today, those same two chains have more than two-thirds—approaching three-quarters—of the market. Nothing enormous or transformational happened overnight. Indeed that change in market share may partly simply reflect changing consumer preferences. But we also know that, through a series of acquisitions, new presences and purchases of new properties, the supermarket majors have greatly enhanced their positions. It is only fair to concede that the degree of increase in market share of these two major chains has caused a level of concern in some areas of our community—amongst consumers, producers and businesses alike.


To start with, these changes to the act remove the word 'substantial' in relation to the ACCC's analysis of mergers and acquisitions, so now even those mergers not considered substantial can be scrutinised by the ACCC. The hope is that this will remove the risk that a court might adopt the view that an acquisition in a geographically confined market is not substantial and therefore does not fall within the scope of section 50.


The bill also amends section 50 to replace references to 'a market' with references to 'any market'. Together, these changes clarify the ability of the ACCC or a court to consider multiple markets when assessing mergers, including smaller mergers which over time may amount to potentially damag­ing creeping acquisitions. It is important to note, however, that the amendments to section 50 do not oblige the ACCC to examine the competitive impact of an acquisition in a small market. It is simply a clarification that it indeed may do so and that it is a relevant factor where a merger is being considered for other reasons.


So what do we have here? In short and put simply, this is a clarification of the law to reduce an ambiguity that might become a legal basis to challenge the work of the ACCC. On that basis, the coalition supports the bill. But I say again: we do not support the government's claim that this bill is somehow a profound strengthening of the Competition and Consumer Act.


The other aspect of this bill relates to the concept of unconscionable conduct. As with the amendments to section 50, these provisions also reflect work undertaken by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The Competition and Consumer Act does not currently include a statutory definition of 'unconscionable conduct'.  Let us be very clear: this bill makes no changes to those provisions. Rather, what this bill seeks to do is implement guiding interpretive principles so that there is better understanding of 'unconscionable conduct'. The coalition supports this initiative.


What we really need and what will contribute to the further development of healthy competition policy is a better under­standing of the concept of unconscionable behaviour and what it means for businesses—in particular, small, medium-sized and family businesses. While we understand that many people and many small businesses may at times have a negative experience, particularly when dealing with a larger business, and can come to the conclusion that what they have experienced is unconscionable conduct, this is a complex area of law and we need to assist people to understand this area of law in more detail. This bill does make it a little bit clearer and the way it brings clarity is through establishing these interpretive principles.


It was the recommendation of the Senate Economics Committee that interpretive principles were needed rather than specific examples. This is an important distinction. Examples, it was thought, may create a false sense of expectation. It was also believed that examples may not remain relevant or current as community expectations change—such changes might change the meaning and understanding of 'unconscionable conduct'. Interpretive principles will assist the courts in interpreting the provisions, help stakeholders in understanding them and guide regulators in enforcing them.


But, again, let us be clear about the impact of these interpretive principles. They do not in any way, shape or form offer the agencies new powers in addressing unconscionable conduct. There are no new protections announced for small business and it would be misleading for anyone to imply in the commentary on this bill that these changes represent substantial new protections for small business. These interpretive principles should give clarity to the court about what was intended by parliament, but they should not be oversold.


These amendments insert new guidelines to assist people, to assist businesses, to assist the regulators and to assist the courts. But by no means are these principles any sort of new measure that will give the greater protection that some have called for. Again, the government has attempted to oversell its limited efforts in order to create the illusion of activity and the illusion of substantial policy reform. Sadly, the constant over­selling of its efforts reduces its fatally damaged credibility even further, particularly when dealing with small business.


The government claims that this bill before the Senate today implements a Labor election commitment to introduce a law in relation to creeping acquisitions—they claimed the then regulatory response did not adequately address the problem. They claim great reform. But that is little more than misplaced grandeur. In reality, what we have here is the government applying a dictionary and a thesaurus to the original bill—expanding some definitions and giving us some interpretive guidelines to better understand the sometimes complex language of competition law. That is an important objective. These are all good and necessary changes that the coalition supports. However, they must be understood and explained for what they are—this is a start and a step in the right direction, but many more steps are needed. That is why the coalition has called for a root and branch review of the competition and consumer law. Two decades on, such a review is only appropriate, but for some reason this government seems to think that a few tweaks and a few changes here and there will create the illusion that it is really listening when it is not.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-11-25,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (11:35):  In summing up and closing the second reading contributions on the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, I firstly thank Senator Ryan. I will make some remarks in response to a couple of the points Senator Ryan made, but in thanking him I do acknowledge that he did stick substantially to the issue before the chair, unlike some of his colleagues. He made a useful contribution to the considera­tion of this legislation.


This bill will strengthen and clarify Australia's competition and consumer laws, which are designed to improve the welfare of Australians. The bill makes two important changes. The first general point I would make in response to one of Senator Ryan's arguments is that we do not overstate the consequences of this legislation. The changes are important, but we certainly do not overclaim what the impact of these two changes will be. 


Firstly, the bill will enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions by amending the mergers and acquisitions provisions in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The bill will remove the requirement that a market in which the competition effects of a merger or acquisition are assessed must be a substantial market. The amendments will also ensure that the courts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, can consider the competitive effects of a merger or acquisition in any market.


Secondly, the bill improves and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The bill will assist consumers, busin­esses, regulators and the courts through inserting interpretive principles which will clarify the meaning of unconscionable conduct. The bill will also unify the business and consumer related provisions. These amendments clarify the parliament's intention as to how the unconscionable conduct law should apply. They will help the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to take more effective enforcement and compliance action. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to correct a small number of drafting errors which arose in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010.


I will make a couple of concluding remarks. Firstly, I do not agree with the level of Senator Ryan's critique. I think it is important to point out that, not just in the context of this legislation, this government over the past four years has taken effective steps in a range of consumer law activity. Not the least of these, of course, is the important legislation known as the Australian Consumer Law. I do not intend to go into that in detail, given the limited time today, but I would point out that this govern­ment, for which I have some responsibilities in my deregulatory ministerial capacity, has taken a number of significant steps in moving towards a seamless national economy and in protecting consumers. That is well illustrated by the Australian Consumer Law and by the transfer, with the agreement of the states, of responsibilities in the last significant remaining areas of financial services regulation and supervision. So I would argue that this government has taken a number of effective initiatives with respect to competition and consumer laws in this country, of which this piece of legislation represents a part.


Senator Ryan stated a number of concerns. One in particular was the presence in our marketplace of what are known as the 'big two' retailers and their growth in market share over a long period of time. I note that he expressed some concerns about the trend and also referred to the need to do more with respect to this issue. Senator Ryan, I look forward to a policy contribution from the opposition in this regard. I look forward to any policy announcement from those opposite. I think it should be pointed out, as Senator Ryan's National Party colleagues have pointed out, that over many years, including the almost 12 years they were in government, this trend was rapidly accentuated under the previous Liberal-National Party government. Despite the stated concerns of some in the opposition, particularly those in the National Party, they did nothing about it. So we do look forward to the development of effective policy from the Liberal-National Party in this regard and in other areas of competition. Perhaps in the spirit of Christmas goodwill, as we are approaching that time of the year, the Liberal-National Party will give some consideration to actually coming up with a policy or two over the break, rather than continuing their very negative constant attack and critique and basically saying no to anything the government does.


The final contribution I want to make in this debate is to thank the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It has done some good work under successive chairs.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop

Senator SHERRY:
  Mr Acting Deputy President and colleague, you are Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and I want to acknowledge and thank you and the members of the committee for your good work. I also want to acknowledge the important work that my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Bradbury, has done on this measure and others. This is an important reform. We do not overstate its impact but it is an important reform and should be seen in the context of the total reforms that this government has made to improve competition—effective competition; it is important to add that descriptor—in this area. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

Having regard to Senator Boswell's acceptance of a $30 000 donation from Metcash, and other such donations in previous years and his subsequent request, on 23 November 2010, for a parliamentary inquiry into the Australian Com­petition and Consumer Commission's decision to block the expansion of Metcash:

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:08):  I move:


That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me making a statement.


Mr President, I do that because what we have now before the Senate is a request, which you have granted, from Senator Abetz via Senator Kroger—which of course mentions Senator Milne on the way—to have me referred to the Committee of Privileges regarding a donation which came to the Australian Greens, and which I have stated on the public record was in no way an influence on me or a donation to me as a person. And then consequent to that were matters raised regarding the Triabunna woodchip mill sale five months ago.


The President has ruled that the donation is a matter which should be examined by the Committee of Privileges and that a matter having been raised five months ago makes it a further matter that should be examined by the Committee of Privileges. However, in the case of Senator Boswell, a donation directly to him, on the record, which was 12 months ago, does not receive the same ruling from the President. Here we have a President who is making contradictory rulings when it comes to a National Party senator as against a Greens senator. What we have in the President's ruling—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on the basis of that being a reflection on a decision of the President.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I do not think there is a point of order, Senator Macdonald. Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. What we have is a double standard coming from the chair— 



Opposition senators interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order on my left!




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The members opposite do not like that, but the reality is—and let me make this very clear—that we now have a ruling from the chair, directed at me, regarding a donation and a consequent referral to matters in the Senate, which does not apply, according to the President, to Senator Boswell or to a series of other senators who have gained monetary advan­tage or sought donations and then, in this Senate, prosecuted a case which was in favour, potentially or directly or indirectly, of the donors. So what we have is the Committee of Privileges, which has a time-honoured non-political role in protecting privilege in this place, being politicised by these contrary decisions from the chair.




Senator Birmingham:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on two grounds: firstly, on the ground of reflection on the chair; and, secondly, on the ground of direct relevance. Senator Brown moved a motion of dissent from the chair, which is to be debated on the next day of sitting. The content of Senator Brown's contribution at present, though, is all about his dissent from the chair and nothing about the motion that he sought to make a short statement on and certainly nothing about the suspension of standing orders.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Birmingham, there is no point of order. As in the past, these debates have ranged fairly wide and that has been accepted practice. Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  You are absolutely right, Mr Deputy President. What we have here is a situation in which there is a difference in ruling in very similar cases—and it must go challenged. Otherwise, every senator, including those who have shares—for example, in coalmining corporations—and who have a direct pecuniary benefit flowing from those shares ought not have spoken on the mining tax legislation before this Senate in the last week or ought not have spoken on the matter of the carbon so-called 'tax'—the carbon trading scheme legislation—in recent weeks. The chair has to be very clear about this, because the chair has blocked my application for Senator Boswell's case to be looked at by the Committee of Privileges while fostering Senator Kroger's application to have—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Brown, you are going very close to reflecting upon the President.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, but I am not.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I am just warning you, Senator Brown.





Senator BOB BROWN:
  Mr Deputy President, I simply must put this case before the Senate. Let me be clear about the second matter, which was when Senator Kroger put the reference for me to the committee to the chair, she was informed an hour and a half before that statement was made by the President. Members of the Press Gallery from the Murdoch press were in the gallery then, but we were not told about it. I ask you: is it not a matter of privilege that senators should be left in the situation where the President does not inform them that they are victims of a proposal to go to the privileges committee but the press gets to know about it? That cannot be allowed to stand. That is an infringement of the rights of members of this Senate to be able to freely know that they are not going to be ambushed by the actions, or by the failure to act, of the chair. This is a serious matter; it should go to— (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Christopher",ALP,2011-11-25,"



Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (16:14):  Mr Deputy President, I indicate on behalf of the government that we will not be supporting the motion for the suspension of standing orders. The President made his ruling regarding the precedence of the matter that Senator Bob Brown referred to him regarding Senator Boswell. He refused it precedence, which is a decision that is his alone to make. It is also perfectly appropriate for Senator Brown to disagree with that ruling and to give notice of his disagreement, which he has done—and that will come before the chamber on the next day sitting, as is the normal process. So the proper processes are being followed. The Senate will get a chance to consider Senator Brown's motion on the next day of sitting, and senators will be able to make a judgment as to those matters and whether or not they support his attempt to have that matter referred to the Privileges Committee.


The government support that proper process without expressing any view on the matters contained in the submission from Senator Brown to the President. I have not read it. We make no commentary on that. The President has exercised his duties and we support the President in following the proper process. I will say, though, that I absolutely reject the suggestion that the President has acted somehow in a partisan way. The President is meticulous about following proper process and trying to give fair treatment to all senators. I do not for one minute accept that his motives or his actions in this matter have been anything other than seeking the advice of the clerks and following the proper process, and I am absolutely confident that that is the case. I think the President and his deputy, Senator Parry, always do their best to reflect the best practices of the Senate and treat all senators equally and make fair and appropriate rulings. So I reject the suggestions in Senator Brown's contribution that call into question the President's motives in this matter. The President has taken advice and made his ruling. Senator Brown disagrees with that, which is his right. The Senate will get to consider that on the next day of sitting. That is the way it should be.


The government will therefore oppose the suspension of standing orders. But I reiterate that we do not accept in any way the criticisms made of the President and I think he has acted perfectly appropriately on this occasion. The merits of the case Senator Brown puts will be considered by the Senate at the appropriate time.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-11-25,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:17):  We are witnessing another display of pecksniffian petulance from Senator Bob Brown. If he had not voted to cancel parlia­ment on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, he would have been able to debate this motion come Monday. But of course he is hoist with his own petard by the fact that he now has to wait until next year.


This wilful and tawdry attempt to defame Senator Boswell is one of the most shameful attempts I have witnessed in my 17 years in this place. Senator Boswell would have to be one of the most honourable and decent senators in this place, and the President himself outlined the huge number of steps that Senator Boswell took. A well-known champion of small business, Senator Boswell seeks to look after them to the very best of his ability and, might I add, he is pretty effective at doing it. Because he is such a decent and honest man, he disclosed exactly what had occurred, that Metcash was supportive of the National Party et cetera. Might I add, he did not handle the money, unlike another senator. But here we have a classic example of somebody wanting to remove a speck of a donation from somebody else's eye when they have a boulder of $1.6 million in donations in their own eye. That is what Senator Bob Brown cannot overcome. The President made a clear and strong ruling against Senator Brown in relation to his donation that he personally sought to negotiate and obtain, and Senator Brown's attempt to get the same ruling applied to Senator Boswell's situation—which was clearly an immature tit-for-tat effort—failed. It fell flat, and now we have this display of petulance.


Let me just make another point. Senator Bob Brown talks about double standards. Well, try this on for size: he moved his notice of motion about the Privileges Committee and said the committee was in danger of politicisation by slap-wrist style references such as Senator Kroger's. Well, guess what? He is out there in the media saying, 'I voted for the reference to the Privileges Committee. We have nothing to hide. It'll be thrown out.' That is out of one side of his mouth. Then, out of the other side of his mouth, he says the whole committee of privileges system is endangered by these types of efforts! Then why did you vote for it? Why did you vote for it? You cannot have it both ways. But that is Senator Brown's political epitaph: he always wants it both ways. He wants a $30,000 donation to be treated as something outrageous, yet he has a $1.6 million donation that he himself has not been able to fully explain. He has asked questions about this matter in the parliament, on behalf of somebody who has given him money, without disclosing that prior to asking those questions. They are the matters that the Privileges Committee, in due course, will need to look at.


This matter in relation to Senator Boswell dates back some 12 months. So why raise it today? Because it is an immature little tit-for-tat tactic against the coalition for having put together a substantial case against Senator Bob Brown which the President found himself having to rule in favour of to give it precedence. So Senator Brown rushes to his office, digs into the archives, rushes out a motion and the President rules against him. What does he do? He wants to move dissent. Then when that doesn't work he wants to move another motion. I simply say, in the spirit of Christmas, Senator Brown, that this place is not about you; it is about serving the people of Australia and I suggest you get on with it. We as a coalition will be opposing the suspension.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-25,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:22):  I rise this afternoon to support the motion that standing orders be suspended so that the motion may be dealt with now. The reason for that is we need to take a very serious look at what is going on here. There has been a very clear attempt by Senator Abetz through this process to effectively put in place a SLAPP writ, which will stand over the next few months unanswered so that Senator Abetz can do as he did this morning: get on ABC radio in Tasmania and put this out as far and wide as he can. As for a notion about the spirit of Christmas, this has been a carefully planned SLAPP suit, effectively, from Senator Abetz on the last day of sitting. This matter of the sale of the woodchip mill is five months old. Why is it that it has taken Senator Abetz this long to spend so much time getting everything that is already on the public record? He has no case to answer.


The interesting difference is that had the President asked for any kind of explanation he would have discovered that Senator Brown, on the public record—which was not presented by Senator Kroger in her dossier—made a very clear explanation as to the donation that was made to the Australian Greens, whereas for the matter in relation to Senator Boswell the explanation did not come until after the whole thing was made public, and that is when the response came in here. But that is beside the point that I want to make here.


In relation to procedural fairness, I heard what Senator Evans had to say, but the fact of the matter is Senator Kroger was informed 1½ hours before the President made his statement that he intended to do so. A journalist was notified by somebody, and maybe Senator Kroger would like to explain how that occurred if the President did not allow that to come specifically into the gallery for that particular notice. What is more, having informed Senator Kroger this would occur, neither Senator Brown nor myself were informed by the President that he intended to make a statement in which we would be named.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  This is the problem with the conservatives. They cannot stand to listen to someone without interjecting. I am just trying to make the point—




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: it looked as though Senator Di Natale was trying to film the chamber on his BlackBerry. 



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator Fifield:
  Maybe he wasn't, but that is certainly how it appeared.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Fifield, thank you for that notation but Senator Di Natale has assured us he has not been taking photographs, and senators know that it is not appropriate.




Senator MILNE:
  The Senate really needs to think about the fact that we have a Senate chamber of which we should all be proud. It is a real privilege to serve the Australian community in our capacity as senators. However, what we have witnessed in the last few weeks is a level of personal abuse, nastiness and hatred that I have not witnessed in all the years that I have been in the Senate. I have never known the level of personal vitriol that has come across this chamber. There have been many occasions when senators could have, from the other side of the chamber, responded but have chosen not to and have risen above it. 


What we have ended up with at the end of the year is a SLAPP suit from Senator Abetz, delivered by Senator Kroger, designed for a political outcome. It is unjust and is, in a serious way, compromising the whole process of privilege. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said a little while ago, 'The Privileges Committee is an incredibly serious thing,' and all we have had since then is an attempt by several senators—ranging from Senator Bernardi to Senator Macdonald to Senator Abetz—to get up in all of their speeches and use this opportunity to maintain a public case. It is wrong and unjust. (Time expired)

The incorporated speech read as follows—



On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I am happy to present [speak on] the committee's report entitled Inquiry into integrity testing.


Since July this year, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity has been conducting an inquiry to consider the possible introduction of a law enforcement integrity testing framework at the Commonwealth level. In that context the inquiry addressed issues including types of integrity testing, its effectiveness both in corruption investigations and as a deterrent, the question of requisite safeguards, the nature of any such legislation, and of course the likely role of Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) under such a framework.


Integrity testing is a term that is used to describe a range of activities that are designed to assess compliance with the governing integrity requirements of an office or agency. In essence, integrity testing involves putting an individual in a simulated situation where corrupt behaviour can occur, and then observing the individual's behaviour. Such a test can be arranged on a targeted basis—as a result of specific intelligence about an individual or group—or on a random basis in order to provide a general deterrent.


A simple example of such a test, in the context of police integrity, might involve the leaving of valuable items at a crime scene in order to watch that the correct procedures for dealing with such property are followed.


Integrity testing of police officers already occurs in a number of jurisdictions, including New York City, Hong Kong, London, and in most Australian states, although not currently at the Commonwealth level. Experience from those places has shown integrity testing to be a very effective tool. The introduction of integrity testing would complement Australia's existing integrity arrangements and would assist the government in its fight against serious and organised crime.


In the final report, which it is my pleasure to present, the committee has recommended that a targeted integrity testing program initially apply to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies within ACLEI's jurisdiction. ACLEI was established in December 2006 to provide anti-corruption oversight of law enforcement at the Commonwealth level and currently oversees the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.


In making its recommendations, the committee does not allege the existence of widespread or serious corruption in Australian law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies take their governance and accountability requirements very seriously. However, the potential for corruption suggests the need for effective measures to combat corruption, and integrity testing is a useful tool to incorporate into the range of integrity measures that already exist. What's more, integrity testing is in keeping with the basic principle that corruption is best fought through prevention and vigilance. As the committee heard from witnesses to the inquiry, integrity testing can speed up investigations and enhance the ability of agencies to mitigate corruption risks.


The committee gave some consideration to the dangers represented by entrapment and induce­ment within a poorly structured integrity testing program. It was determined that entrapment and inducement are in effect the same kind of shortcoming, and that the key test for avoiding inducement in integrity testing is to ensure there is clear and straightforward opportunity for any person who is the subject of a test to pass or fail the test. Of equal importance is the need to ensure that law enforcement officers or staff are not placed in situations that would not be expected to occur as part of their ordinary duties.


The committee acknowledges that integrity testing may use significant law enforcement powers in some circumstances; which is why the committee has recommended appropriate legislation be put in place, with safeguards including:


the requirement for the Integrity Commissioner to be notified;


the discretion for the Integrity Commissioner to be involved or take control of integrity tests; and


oversight by Commonwealth Ombudsman and reporting to the Parliament.


The committee wishes to express its appreciation to all parties who contributed to the conduct of this inquiry, whether by making a written submission, by attending a public hearing or, as in many cases, by making both written and oral submissions.



I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:05):  I pay tribute to Bronwen Meredith, a human rights activist who passed away on 19 November. Born in Hobart in 1919 and raised in a Quaker family, Bronwen Meredith learnt the values of tolerance, peace and justice from an early age. Educated at the Friends' School, she ran a Junior League of Nations as a student, with talks and discussions about the role of the League of Nations in peace making and social justice issues. In 1938, she attended the Philip Smith Teachers College to train as a teacher and also studied for her Bachelor of Arts at the University of Tasmania.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:
  Just wait a minute, Senator Singh. Senators in the chamber, Senator Singh is talking about a very serious matter. I believe she is entitled to be heard in silence regardless of the issue, but it is a sensitive issue.




Senator SINGH:
  She married her husband, Richard, in 1945 and together they became interested in prison reform, actively working to oppose the death penalty of a young man. In 1956, Bronwen and her husband moved to Papua New Guinea, where they both taught at a mission school. They took their five children, Heather, Stephen, Richard, Timothy and Jillian. They returned to Hobart in 1961, where Bronwen did a library course and worked at New Town High School for 10 years.


I first met Bronwen at a meeting in Hobart of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, of which I am a member. Bronwen joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in Tasmania in 1963. One of the first campaigns she became involved with in WILPF was opposing French nuclear testing in the Pacific and then, during the Vietnam War, she and her husband assisted young men facing the draft. She became the first Secretary of WILPF in 1970 and was also involved in conducting a branch of Amnesty International at that time. In 1967, Bronwen attended an international Quaker conference in North Carolina and spent six weeks at a Quaker office in New York. While there she summarised the attitude to the Vietnam War of members of the United Nations organisa­tion, as expressed by the General Assembly. This summary was printed and presented to the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. In 1973, concern for Indigenous people moved Bronwen and her husband to join the Commonwealth service in the Northern Territory. They taught in government schools in Darwin and Katherine for seven years.


Bronwen and her husband moved to England in 1981, where she became active in both Amnesty International and the UK branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1986, Bronwen became the National Secretary of WILPF and was President of the Religious Society of Friends in Australia for four years. She joined me in speaking out against the war in Iraq in Hobart on the International Day of Action in 2003, and was regarded as an active and valued member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. I know she will be greatly missed and my thoughts are with her family.


Monday marked the beginning of Asbestos Awareness Week. Australia carries the burden of one of the highest rates of asbestos related disease in the world, with nearly 10,000 recorded cases of mesothelioma since records began in the 1980s. Although the dangers of asbestos have been known for years, the long period between exposure and the onset of symptoms means that the diagnosis of asbestos related disease is expected to increase until at least the year 2018. While the dangers have been known for many years, we will continue to pay the price of exposure all those years ago for some time to come. Sadly, a very real concern now is that this will continue well into the future as we face a third wave of asbestos related disease as people unwittingly expose themselves to asbestos through DIY home renovations and the like.


I was pleased that, as part of Asbestos Awareness Week, both the ABC's 7:30 and Channel 10's The Project featured stories this week on asbestos and the very real risks associated with its exposure. Both these programs tackled the issue of DIY home renovation and the dangers associated with the unsafe removal and disposal of asbestos.


I was particularly saddened to hear the story of the Sager family, who lost their 25-year-old son, Adam, to mesothelioma. His parents, Julie and Don, told of Adam being exposed while they were renovating their family home in the 1980s. Adam would play in the dust that they did not know was dangerous at the time and that they never could have imagined would result in his devastating death.


Sadly, I fear we are at risk of hearing many more stories such as Adam's in the decades to come. I spoke in this place just last sitting about the obligation DIY renovation TV programs have to the Australian public and that they must highlight the dangers of asbestos during the broadcast of these shows. Education is vital, and we must make people who are renovating aware that if their home is more than 30 years old the chances are it will contain asbestos. We must educate people that asbestos can and will kill them, and that due care must be taken.


Given this week is Asbestos Awareness Week, I congratulate all those who are out there doing everything they can to raise awareness of this deadly carcinogen. There are many important groups, researchers, medical professionals, removalists and advocates, all working hard to educate the Australian public and support those living with asbestos related diseases, and seeking to effect change in places such as this. Their work is vital and it is very much appreciated. I also thank them very much for joining me this Tuesday, here in Parliament House, for the launch of the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease by me and my co-chair Russell Broadbent, with guest speaker Matt Peacock, a journalist who has been reporting on asbestos and its effects for the last 30 years.


I also learnt this week that the Cancer Council in Victoria will this week launch an easy-to-read information booklet about mesothelioma, and I have no doubt that it will be appreciated by the many people who may be diagnosed in the years to come.


The Gillard Labor government is also working to ensure people are not needlessly exposed to asbestos. In October last year the Asbestos Management Review was established and it will provide recommen­dations to government on the development of a national plan to improve asbestos aware­ness and management. I pass on my thanks to all of those people involved in this area and encourage them to continue their work and their fight to raise awareness and support those with asbestos related disease.


Finally, I was recently fortunate to visit Goodwood Primary School in the electorate of Denison. The school was established in 1955 and currently has around 95 students. What I learnt about Goodwood Primary School during my visit is that 85 of those students have iPads, which are distributed across all of the grades. I hope that soon schools in other parts of Tasmania will also have access to iPads.


These iPads were purchased using the federal government's National Partnership Low SES Plan funding. Goodwood Primary School is the only primary school in Tasmania that has this educational tool—the iPad—available to all its students, and it was just wonderful to see these young students using their iPads in an educational way to make movies, to take photos and to write notes. They used them in a wide range of ways and for a wide range of purposes. We live in a very much technologically focused time, and the advantage these children will have over those who do not have access to such recent technology will no doubt brighten their future.


Not only are the students benefiting but the participation of parents in the school has also increased from five per cent to 25 per cent, and the school believes the sole reason is the introduction of the iPads. Students and their parents are rightly proud that their school is the first and only primary school in Tasmania to have instigated this program. I congratulate Goodwood Primary School on its efforts to equip their students with a bright future and to engage with the parents of their school. I hope to see more Tasmanian schools consider introducing iPads to their classrooms as an educational tool. Finally, I would also just like to wish you, Mr President, the Deputy President, senators, the Clerk and Deputy Clerk, officers and all the Senate staff here a restful Christmas break and a happy new year. Thank you for welcoming me into my beginning term here in the Senate.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-11-25,"



Senator Ludlam

asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 June 2011:


With reference to the proposed changes to the way the Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS) will conduct the homelessness count in the 2011 Census:


(1) Why did the ABS undertake a methodological review of Counting the


Homeless 2006.


(2) How did the ABS consult with the sector before announcing these changes.


(3) What kind of resourcing has been devoted to the homelessness count over the past two census in 2001 and 2006, and does this differ from the resources for the 2011 Census.


(4) Are the proposed changes due to a budget cut or any kind of resourcing issue.


(5) Why was there such a long delay in releasing the discussion paper the ABS promised would be released in December 2009 but was only released in March 2011 about the proposed changes to the methodology.


(6) Why does the ABS still believe the Chamberlain and McKenzie methodology, used for the 2001 and 2006 census, led to an over estimation of homelessness figures, even though this view was and continues to be strongly refuted by homelessness services, peak bodies and homelessness researchers.


(7) What is the ABS response to our understanding that peak bodies, researchers and service providers still maintain in fact the homeless are being undercounted.


(8) Can the ABS confirm it will be doing all the analysis itself using its new methodology and that this will not include:


   (a) Chamberlain and McKenzie's analysis of people staying in supported accommodation data;


   (b) extensive field work usually carried out by Chamberlain and McKenzie; and


   (c) an analysis of the Secondary School Student Survey.


(9) Will the ABS form their homelessness estimate predominately on raw census data.



(10) How does this overcome the problem that homelessness is 'hidden' and therefore difficult to measure without expert analysis, a sound background in research and an understanding of the complexity of homelessness.




Consultation with sector



(11) In regard to the forum that took place on 24 May 2011 with the ABS and key homelessness stakeholders:


   (a) did the ABS call this forum;


   (b) apart from this forum, how has the ABS tried to engage with the sector since announcing these dramatic changes;


   (c) how many submissions did the ABS receive on its discussion paper and how were they incorporated; and


   (d) will the ABS be establishing a sector reference group.


(12) Does the ABS appreciate that up until now Australia has been in the fortunate and unique position(compared to other countries around the world) of having a consensus on homelessness figures.


(13) Will the ABS guarantee that it works to a consensus on publishing revised figures and introducing a new methodology.




New assumptions reflected in the methodology



(14) Can the Minister confirm some of the more controversial assumptions in the discussion paper including:


   (a) all people over 55 years old living in caravan parks will be classed as 'grey nomads' and will not be counted as homeless;


(b) people living in attractive holiday destinations cannot be classed as homeless;


   (c) there are only 1 253 people experiencing primary homelessness in the Northern Territory, but this is based on the assumption that 1 million square miles of territory can be covered in one night; and


   (d) people staying in improvised dwellings should not be considered homeless if they have an income from employment or are landowners.




Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and homelessness



(15) Given that the revised count of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were homeless and staying with friends and relatives across Australia on census night has been revised to 872(discussion paper, p. 73) which is significantly down from the figure of 5 438 in recently released Australian Institute of Health and Welfare(AIHW) figures of Indigenous people currently experiencing secondary homelessness, how can the significantly revised down figures be reconciled.


(16) How was the AIHW consulted regarding the proposed changes to the methodology.


(17) How will the new ABS methodology incorporate overcrowding experienced in Indigenous households.


(18) What strategies are being considered or employed to improve the accuracy of counting Indigenous people in the census.


(19) Given that the census in the territories is only conducted over one night, yet the Northern Territory spans more than 1 000 000 square km and has the highest number of remote communities in Australia and it is stated that between 2001 and 2006 the number of rough sleepers is said to have declined by 26 per cent—yet no additional services or accommodation were provided in this time and it is unlikely that this number found accommodation; it is therefore likely that significant numbers of undercounting of homeless people occurred in the last census, and will occur again, therefore:


   (a) what measures will the ABS have in place to prevent undercounting of homeless people in the Northern Territory in the 2011 and subsequent census; and


   (b) has the ABS considered extending the census period to more than one day; if not, will it.




School students, young people and homelessness



In regard to the number of young people experiencing homelessness in 2006 which has been revised by the ABS from approximately 21 000 down to 5 000 nationally:


(20) Given that 35 per cent of Supported Accommodation Assistance Program(SAAP) funding is currently allocated to services providing responses to young people, how will a significant drop for the 2011 figures impact on funding for youth services in the future.


(21) Is the ABS aware that in the north and west Melbourne metropolitan regions alone, current demand data shows that there are 861 young person headed households awaiting assistance.


(22) Does the ABS have confidence in the accuracy of the new figure.


(23) What is the estimated margin of error and how was it calculated.


(24) Given that a strong concern with the revised methodology is the proposal to only gather data from six schools, over 1 day, on youth homelessness, compared with thousands previously:


   (a) what was the rationale for this; and 


   (b) how will the ABS work with the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs(FaHCSIA) regarding any changes to the scope or process for collecting data on youth homelessness through schools.


(25) Can the ABS confirm why the National Census of Homeless School Students is not going ahead.


(26) Does FaHCSIA sit on the Steering Group for the ABS review.


(27) Has the ABS been provided with any advice in making the case that the National Census on Homeless School Students is not required.




Secondary homelessness



(28) In regard to the significant revision down by 58 per cent(or 27 277 people) from the secondary homelessness figures in the 2006 census, can an outline and account be provided for all of the assumptions underlying the removal of these 27 277 people in the secondary homelessness category.




Undercounting of specific and marginalised groups



(29) For each of the following groups, can the ABS provide an explanation on how it intends to better include them and count them more accurately in the next census:


   (a) women escaping domestic violence who seek assistance from a homelessness service but are turned away and either sleep in a car in a concealed location or are accommodated by a friend or relative for the night;


   (b) Indigenous people in overcrowded households;


   (c) rough sleepers in the 'long grass' in the Kimberley and Pilbara in Western Australia and Darwin-Daly district in the Northern Territory;


   (d) families in private motels paid for by temporary state housing vouchers; and


   (e) single people staying with friends in public housing not named on the lease(due to rules prohibiting sub-letting they often will not identify as residing with the tenant even if this is the case).




New ABS concept of 
'
rooflessness
'
 rather than homelessness



(30) Does the discussion paper suggest that the ABS is moving towards a view of homelessness that focuses on a person's 'rooflessness', that is, homelessness defined only as rough sleeping or primary homelessness.


(31) How is this definition helpful to the current conceptualization of homelessness, particularly in terms of devising responses to prevent and intervene early before primary('roofless') and chronic homelessness occurs.

The ABS has advised that some of the improvements applied for the 2011 Census and planned for future Censuses will address, at least in part, the 'hidden' homelessness when Indigenous people have a usual residence reported for them. The ABS will seek advice, through its new Homelessness Statistics Reference Group, on approaches for addressing the 'hidden' nature of homelessness, and will use its planned focus group work to provide new insights on measurement.


(11) (a) The ABS has advised that it wrote, in advance of the publication of the ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006, to offer an ABS funded workshop for Homelessness Australia members after they had had a chance to review the Discussion Paper. This Homelessness Australia workshop was in addition to the discussion forums planned, advertised and held in each capital city. Homelessness Australia accepted the offer and the meeting occurred on 24 May 2011.


(11) (b) The Discussion Paper announced public discussion forums in each capital city and sought submissions. Additional forums were held, on request, with stakeholders across Australia,. The ABS has also answered questions received during forums, or in writing or over the telephone.


(11) (c) Please refer to the ABS' Position Paper on the Review of the Counting the Homeless methodology. This paper responds to submissions made and feedback received during the ABS' consultation with the sector regarding the review.


(11) (d) The ABS has advised that it has convened a Homelessness Statistics Reference Group with invitees from the sector, from academia, and from government.


(12) The ABS is an independent statutory authority and has released its Discussion Paper and Position Paper  outlining the ABS' assessment of the Counting the Homeless methodology.


(13) The ABS has advised that it is continuing to consult with stakeholders, including through the new Homelessness Statistics Reference Group, to inform its view of whether, and if so how, official estimates of the prevalence of homelessness can be made.


(14) (a) The ABS has advised that the statement in the question is not an assumption made in the ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006.


(14) (b) The ABS has advised that the statement in the question is not an assumption made in the ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006.


(14) (c) The ABS has advised that the statement in the question is not an assumption made in the ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006.


(14) (d) The ABS has advised that the statement in the question is not an assumption made in the ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006. 


(15) The ABS has advised the following: 


The number of 5,438 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the question is quoted from Table 1.3 in a May 2011 publication issued by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare(AIHW) titled Housing and Homeless Services, Access for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People(Cat. No. HOU 237). The data are reported from the Counting the Homeless 2006 state and territory reports and do not represent just Indigenous people who were homeless and staying with friends and relatives across Australia. The 5,438 number from Counting the Homeless 2006 represents homeless Indigenous people staying with friends and relatives(872 in the reviewed ABS estimates) and people staying in SAAP on Census night(2,692 in the reviewed ABS estimates). The 1,874 people difference between the Counting the Homeless 2006 and the reviewed ABS total estimates derives mainly from the Counting the Homeless 2006 use of a SAAP support period estimate, rather than the estimate of the number of people accommodated on Census night.


(16) The ABS has advised that the AIHW was a member of the Steering Committee for the methodological review and participated in all three review workshops.


(17) The ABS has advised that this issue has not been addressed in any former estimates of homelessness and will be the subject of ongoing research by the ABS, including through focus group work following the Census, and in the design and development of culturally appropriate homelessness modules in the ABS's national surveys of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


(18) The ABS has advised that, in consultation with a range of organisations and government departments at all levels, it implemented a range of changes to its Indigenous Enumeration Strategy(IES) for the 2011 Census. The IES drew on the extensive evaluation undertaken of the 2006 Census data and field processes. It incorporated improvements to the enumeration procedures for Indigenous people living in urban areas, as well as remote communities.


The ABS has advised that, at a broad level, the range of improvements in the 2011 IES have provided for:


more detailed planning of the enumeration process; 


earlier, more detailed and ongoing engagement; 


integration of the strategy more fully into the mainstream operation so that coverage can be ensured; 


reorganisation and increased flexibility of the field operation to ensure that for each area the appropriate enumeration methodology is used and documented, including targeted responses in areas where there are significant issues impacting enumeration; 


increases in the number of field staff positions; 


systems and procedures to enhance the collection of management information and to allow for closer management of the field operation and the tracking of progress; 


a greater level of support to Indigenous people who need assistance in completing their form particularly in urban areas; and, 


a reduction in the overall timing of remote Indigenous enumeration, to counter the effects of a longer enumeration period.


(19) (a) The ABS developed an overall national strategy and implemented detailed operational plans at regional levels. These regional plans were developed after close consultation and ongoing engagement with stakeholders and service providers within those regions.


The ABS has advised that these plans included working closely with service and accommodation providers to identify locations of people experiencing homelessness and employing staff from these organisations to assist with the homeless count. The ABS will also employed people who have been homeless to assist with the homeless count. Homeless Enumeration Coordinators were also employed in urban areas such as in Darwin, Katherine and Alice Springs. 


(19) (b) The ABS has advised that, if possible, the enumeration period for the rough sleeper count in the Northern Territory should be conducted on the one day. A count on the one day provides for a snapshot at a particular point of time and minimises the risks of both under and over counting. However, where circumstances preclude this, the period can be extended to ensure maximum possible coverage.


(20) The Census is not the only data relied on by Governments to ascertain the extent of homelessness or indeed the demand for homelessness services. The Government has committed to strong targets to reduce homelessness across Australia and our record has been to increase funding for services by more than 55 per cent over four years. 


It should also be noted that states and territories are responsible for the allocation of supported accommodation funding that is provided by the Commonwealth.


(21) The ABS has advised that it has received a submission in response to the ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006, which states that ""…there are 861 young person headed households in crisis and awaiting assistance.""  


In regard to the revised estimate for the number of people aged 12 to 24 experiencing homelessness on census night which decreased from 32 444 to 13 316(discussion paper, p. 73):


(22) Please refer to the ABS' Position Paper on the Review of the Counting the Homeless methodology.


(23) Please refer to the ABS Position Paper on the Review of the Counting the Homeless methodology. This paper responds to submissions made and feedback received during the ABS' consultation with the sector regarding the review.


(24) (a) Please refer to the ABS' Position Paper on the Review of the Counting the Homeless methodology.


(24) (b) The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs(FaHCSIA) is on the steering committee for the methodological review and they will also be on the Homelessness Statistics Reference Group.


In regard to the decision not to use the National Census of Homeless School Students, which in 2006 identified approximately 7 000 young people who were homeless but still at school:


(25) The ABS has advised that it has not had any role in the funding, design, development or conduct of the NCHSS.


(26) Yes.


(27) The ABS is conducting a national survey of secondary school students and it has not received advice that a count is not required.


(28) Please refer to the Position Paper on the Review of the Counting the Homeless methodology.


(29) (a) The ABS has advised that, as well as targeted enumeration of those sleeping rough, such as inner city areas of capital cities and other identified major urban centres, all Census field staff are tasked with identifying rough sleepers in their workloads so that they can be included in the Census.


(29) (b) The ABS has advised that extensive engagement was undertaken with community groups, Non-Government Organisations(NGOs), service providers and Indigenous communities to raise awareness of the Census and the importance of an accurate count.


(29) (c) The ABS has advised that these areas were identified early in fieldwork planning, and local plans were developed to ensure that the rough sleepers in the 'long grass' were counted.


(29) (d) The ABS has advised that these individuals and families were asked, like other residents of private motels, to participate in the census.


(29) (e) The ABS has advised that the Census communications campaign included tailored messages encouraging people who may be staying with friends, but who have no usual address, to report ""none"" in the usual address question on the Census form.


(30) The ABS advises that this is incorrect. The published ABS Discussion Paper, Methodological Review of Counting the Homeless, 2006, provides details for the various categories of homelessness.
