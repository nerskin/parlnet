Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (12:12):  Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. The opposition will be asking that you put the question separately on the procedural element of this motion, 'that these bills may proceed without formalities', and I wish to speak to that procedural motion.


We have a particular issue here before the chamber about the whole consideration of the important elements of the carbon bills. We all know that there is major interest in this process. We read in the media every day that this is going to be the most important element that comes—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator MOORE:
  We read in the media about the interest that has been placed on this process. We have now heard that there is going to be a meeting of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee this afternoon to consider the process. We all know that, in the last sitting of this chamber, there was a motion passed by this Senate that there would be a consideration of this package of bills through the environment committee. There was a process put in place that there would be a report provided to this place on 14 July to allow there to be consideration of these issues. That process has not occurred.


We are here today, on the first sitting day of a new Senate, and we have a whole range of people in this place who have not had the opportunity to have any consideration of this legislation. The process that this Senate put in place was that there would be a committee process where we would have the opportunity to consider the range of issues that have occurred over the last period of months. We are not only looking at issues that were previously discussed in this place. The situation internationally and also nationally has changed considerably around the whole issue of this legislation about carbon pricing and the process that we are going to put in place to look at this significant range of legislation. That process has not occurred. There has not been the opportunity for people to put forward their views. There has not been the opportunity for people to listen to the range of views that we know are held, that continue to be held and that continue to be examined.


It is so important that we start together in this place with appropriate consideration of the legislation that is before us. We talk nobly about what should happen in this place. We heard this morning about the independence of the Senate and how important it is for every single senator to understand fully, to question and to be involved in the votes that they will take on legislation before the chamber. I do not believe, the opposition does not believe and many people in the community do not believe that that is allowed by the current process of bringing forward this package of legislation today, without a recommendation from the committee that was charged by the Senate to consider it, without an opportunity for people to have current evidence before them, although I know the government will say that there has been considerable process around these carbon bills. 


It is important that there is considerable effort put into looking at this legislation that we have. It is not simple. It is complex. There are a range of issues here that we all need to understand and consider before we vote. There needs to be the opportunity in this place to have the process. We do not think it is appropriate, in the first matter of core business before us, to say: 'We'll bring the whole carbon tax legislation before this place, we will expect that that process will take place and we will go straight into the full debate without having the evidence from the committee that we set up.'


We consider that this is an important element of the operations of the Senate. We believe it is important for all of us to have the time and the opportunity to hear from not just each other across the august chamber of the Senate. It is not just a debate for us in this place. The important thing is that when we come here we come here we come with the information, concerns and support or otherwise of the people in the wider community who care deeply about this issue. Only this morning, outside this parliament, we had the opportunity to meet with a whole group of young people who have a passionate concern about the future of our environment and the future of carbon pricing in Australia. I believe that every senator in this place was provided with an invitation to go and meet with these young people about this legislation. We had that opportunity to go down there this morning. Some of us took it, and what we heard from the people there was that that it was our decision but their future. 


We need to ensure that those voices are heard in this place, through the whole range of the committee process. That has not been completed. We have not had that process concluded. And yet we are here being asked to accept a blanket proposition from the government which says that the bills have to come through straightaway. I do not believe that has given us the chance to have the debate we need to have, not just here but outside. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Do you believe in democracy? There has been an election.




Senator MOORE:
  I think that to do duty to our job as senators, to do duty to our process, we need to ensure that we have further opportunity to consider what has been said by the community. Other people will have more comments, but I do not believe, as a member of this Senate, that the process that we have taken to date has given due consideration to the role of the Senate. The Senate committee process, which is the background to what we do, has not been allowed to function fully. There was no attempt to talk to community members. I think it is important that we understand that what we are being asked to do is actually shortcutting the process. What we have been asked to do by the government today is to cut through, to shortcut the process, to ensure that the debate does not reflect the wider information that we must have before we come to this place. It is not a worthy process to rush this through in this way. It is not a worthy process to dismiss the concerns of people in the community who want to hear this debate fully. It does not fulfil those same promises that we heard earlier today about ensuring that this place actually does listen and care and that when we come into this place we do not just bring our own personal opinions; we bring consideration of committee process and recommendations that we have come to expect.




Senator Heffernan:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr President. My point of order is: I take exception to being told I am not—



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator Heffernan:
  I did not see anyone over there at the 'Bin the budget' rally yesterday, at which I spoke, which concerns—



The PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point. That is not a point of order. 




Senator MOORE:
  In terms of the process that Senator Heffernan has just outlined, indeed the role of all the senators is to ensure that they do listen to the community. However, the process yesterday was not about the bills that are in front of us. The community meeting that we went to this morning was. The whole process of that community meeting of young people from across the country was specifically on the bills that the government now wants us to rush in to debate straightaway. 


I have heard the comments from across the way that we have had an election. Indeed we have. We are all aware of that election. But, just because we have had an election, the role of this place does not stop. If you think back to the discussions we had less than an hour ago, when we were swearing in the new Senate, it was said that we were going to ensure that the Senate would be a place where there would be independent, full debate. That is our job. What the government wants us to do now, as the first element of the business for the new Senate—and many senators have not have the opportunity to be in debates about this before—is to rush through a debate on bills for which we have not had the most up-to-date committee recommendations. 


Getting committee recommendations should be the way we work. I think that would be evident to all of us. Those of us who have been lucky enough to be here for a while should have seen it in practice. The new senators would have heard about the way the Senate operates, which ensures that there is the opportunity for people to have information. We have a committee structure, in which committees are tasked to go out with legislation and seek the opinions of the people in the community on that legislation. The committee's job is to consider that evidence, have it all recorded and then come back into this place with recommendations.


We all know that, in legislation processes, many of us use the committee reports as the basis for what we are going to say. We look at what has gone on, we look at the submissions that have been received and we look at the concerns. We most particularly do not rely on things that have happened exclusively in the past. When the government brought forward these bills to the last Senate, we recommended that, before they be considered, they would go through the committee process. The committee process crossed over the conclusion of the last Senate and the beginning of this Senate. We now are faced with looking at legislation to be debated in this place. We had a Senate committee process in place which was considering this legislation—the standard process. The standard process is that the committee has the opportunity to present its report and then, on the basis of that report, we then flow into the debate in this place.


That is not an unusual situation. The way that that operates is clearly identified in the standing orders. So it is particularly important that, when we move into this first debate, we have the authority of the standing practice of the Senate behind us so that we move forward with confidence. That can only enhance the debate; it does not delay the debate. We have no intention of delaying the debate. I remember many times in this place when senators on the other side were making passionate declarations about how important it was for us to have the committee process in place. We heard that. We were reminded of our job, our responsibility to ensure that Senate practices were put in place. I but ask the same thing: if we are going to have legislation brought into the chamber, it is our job to expect that we have all the information available to the senators, that the committee process be fully concluded and that we would have the opportunity to give due consideration to those processes. It is not an unusual request; it is certainly not a groundbreaking request. It is simply asking that the process of the Senate run as we expect it to, the process of the Senate run as it should do and, in fact, the process of the Senate run as it does best—providing information for senators to consider what is important in the legislation, providing opportunities for the senators to ask questions about the legislation and providing opportunities for the senators to respond to their responsibilities as senators in this chamber.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:25):  Let us just be very clear about one issue here. What this government is seeking to do is to have the carbon tax repealed. That was the bipartisan position of Prime Minister Gillard and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, at the 2010 election. We were promised there would be no carbon tax in 2010. Then, in 2013, Prime Minister Rudd and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, were once again on a unity ticket—and I have exhibit A here: a Labor Party brochure authorised by George Wright, in which he tells us, 'Kevin Rudd and Labor have removed the carbon tax.'


So why on earth is my good friend Senator Moore—recently resworn as a representative of the people of Queensland,  having been elected on the policy of removing the carbon tax, and her colleagues before her having been elected on a policy of never having a carbon tax—now standing here seeking to frustrate the will of the Australian people? I do not think anyone could argue with the proposition that the carbon tax was one of the key issues at the last election.


The reason the Australian people wanted to see the back end of the carbon tax was that they knew it was impacting on their cost of living—$550 for the average household in Australia each and every year. And, courtesy of the Greens-Labor majority that used to preside in this place, the carbon tax ratcheted up yet again on 1 July to increase that impost on Australian families even further. And, if the cost-of-living impost is not bad enough, we know it destroys jobs. The carbon tax is a blot on the economic landscape of our nation. It attacks the cost of living of families and it is destroying jobs as we speak.


We all know the example of Fuji chemicals, which wanted to set up in Australia with $1 billion worth of infrastructure capital investment and 150 jobs, as an ongoing concern and replacing imports. They decided to set up in China instead, simply because of the carbon tax. Do you know what they will do in China? They will emit more greenhouse gases in their production than they did in a pre-carbon tax environment in Australia. And that is where you see the absolutely perverse environmental outcome of the carbon tax. Not only does it destroy Australia's economy and the cost of living; it actually ensures that clean production companies in Australia have to move offshore to countries where they do not have as strong an environmental regime as we do in Australia.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! On my left.




Senator ABETZ:
  This is the classic lose-lose scenario that was inflicted upon the Australian people by the Australian Greens and the Labor Party in that marriage that they undertook with Senator Bob Brown and Prime Minister Gillard.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator ABETZ:
  I do not know what the Labor Party interjections are about. I refer to this brochure again: 'Kevin Rudd and Labor remove the carbon tax.' If we were to believe the very policy on which Senator Moore got herself re-elected to this place—that is, the carbon tax had been removed—sorry; what are these bills doing here? The carbon tax, we are agreed, still has to be removed. It is still on the legislative books, is it not?


We, as an opposition, said to the Australian people: 'If you elect us on 7 September, we will have as the very first item of business in the new parliament the repeal of the carbon tax.' And we lived up to that promise. Prime Minister Abbott introduced the repeal of the carbon tax as the very first item of business in the new parliament. So it should be no surprise to those opposite that we, as the very first item of business in this new Senate, would seek to ensure the repeal of the carbon tax.


 I say to those opposite: you had your fun last month. Yes, the dead hand of the old Senate reached out and attempted to control that which will happen in the new Senate. And that is why the motions were moved to seek to delay the will of the Australian people.


I have been asked: is this a measure that is frustrating the government? More importantly, this measure, or the motion moved by those opposite last month, was frustrating the Australian people. It is frustrating the Australian economy. It is frustrating the world's environment to boot. So in every possible respect—




Senator Cameron:
  What did you say?




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Cameron says, 'What did you say?' Can I ask you, Senator Cameron: what did you say when you sought re-election? 




Senator Cameron:
  I said I supported a price on carbon.




Senator ABETZ:
  You said that the carbon tax was being removed, on Labor Party funded brochures. Your own union may well have funded this brochure.


The fact that we are seeking to put this up as the first item should be of surprise to nobody. We said we would do so if we were elected. The Labor-Greens Senate majority frustrated us in that endeavour. We now have a new Senate, more reflective of the will of the Australian people generally on 7 September, taking into account the quirks of Western Australia. We have a situation where we as a government want to introduce this legislation as a matter of absolute urgency to get this blot off our economic landscape. People are quite rightly concerned about their cost of living. Today the Senate has the opportunity— 




Senator Cameron:
  People are concerned about the planet as well.




Senator ABETZ:
  So why did you campaign to abolish the carbon tax, not only in 2010 but in 2013 as well?


As I have already pointed out to Senator Cameron—he who will interject but never listen—the carbon tax applying in Australia is in fact perverse in relation to the world's environment. Europe discovered that themselves when they closed down their relatively clean aluminium smelters only to see them pop up again in Africa and elsewhere where the environmental regimes were not half as good as they were in their pre-existing foundries and smelters in Europe. As a result, the world's environment was worse off. The same is happening in relation to Australia. With great respect to Senator Moore, it is not as though this is a debate that has fallen out of the sky just today; I think it has been around very strongly for a number of years. In fact, so strong was the sentiment in the Australian community that Labor promised no carbon tax in 2010. They promised that absolutely. 


Then, when they realised the vehemence with which the Australian people despised the carbon tax—because it was impacting on the cost of living; it was destroying their jobs and having a perverse outcome on the environment—the Labor Party rushed around at the 2013 election to say, 'No, nothing to see here. We've already removed the carbon tax.' We know that the carbon tax has not been removed. Just as the Australian people were misled before the 2010 election—that there would be no carbon tax—so they were misled by the Australian Labor Party in 2013 with the assertion that the carbon tax had already been removed. 


The simple fact that we have to introduce this swathe of bills, some nine of them, indicates that the carbon tax regrettably is still alive and well. And, each day that this carbon tax continues, it will continue to have an impost on the cost of living for every single Australian, and it will continue to destroy jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector—




Senator Cameron:
  Don't you talk about manufacturing. What did you do to Ford? What did you do to GM?




Senator ABETZ:
  especially in the manufacturing sector, Senator Cameron, which you know. It continues to have a perverse outcome on the environment. We as a government are determined to—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cameron. 





Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Cameron is always willing to interject, never willing to listen. That is his wont. The new senators will soon learn that that is his style, and a very ugly style it is, if I might say. 




Senator Cameron:
  I don't listen to rubbish.




Senator ABETZ:
  We as a government will seek to prosecute those issues on which we were elected and in particular this impost on the economy which we believe was brought to us as a result of that marriage between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens, something about which former Senator Mark Bishop had words to say, quite rightly. He is no longer with us, regrettably, but I am sure he is ably replaced by Senator Bullock, and I wish him well. 


I conclude my remarks by saying that we as a government are anxious to remove this impost for the Australian people; noting that, in its removal, we will be delivering on the promises made by Ms Gillard and Mr Abbott, in 2010, and by Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott in 2013.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:36):  I was not going to speak in this debate, and I think—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Don't worry, I will be speaking on the suspension of standing orders and the upending of the Senate rules which no doubt you will do next. 


I thank Senator Milne for allowing me to speak first. I will not be too long. There are a number of things in that stream of hyperbole which I think require a response from the Labor Party. Firstly, Senator Abetz says, 'People are concerned about the cost of living; this carbon price is a dreadful thing for cost of living'. What about the GP tax—that promise that you broke? You did not tell people that you would be introducing a $7 GP tax. As I recall, it was, 'No cuts to health; no cuts to education.' People care about the cost of living. What about the tax on pharmaceuticals, the increased co-payment, making it more expensive for people to get medication? Do you reckon that has an impact on people's cost of living? What about fuel excise? This is one for Senator Williams. What about the increase to fuel tax? That is also not something that was discussed before the election. Some might describe it as a carbon tax on steroids. What about the cuts to pensions? They might be something about cost of living—the cuts to pensions that the Prime Minister so arrogantly pretends do not exist. The thing about this government is that not only—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He said, 'No cuts.' You tell that to Australia's pensioners. You are going to reduce the amount by which their pension increases from what it is now into the future. You tell them, 'Actually, love, that's not a cut. I'm going to take money back to the government, which is how I get a saving in my budget, but I'm not even going to do you the respect of acknowledging that it is a cut to your pension.'


Finally, there is the deregulation of university fees, making it harder for disadvantaged Australians and kids from working-class families to go to university. When Senator Abetz comes in here and cries about the cost of living, I hope everybody in this chamber and everybody who might consider this debate will think about the cost-of-living measures, the cost-of-living imposts, the increases to the cost of living of Australians, particularly middle- and low-income Australians, that the government are seeking to impose with their budget. Worst of all, they told lies before the election about whether they would do that.


There was a lot of talk about mandate in the contribution from Senator Abetz. Where is the mandate for the GP tax? Where is the mandate for the increases to the fuel excise? Where is the mandate for increases to the pharmaceuticals co-payment? Where is the mandate for cuts to the pension? Where is the mandate for putting university education out of the reach of so many Australians? If you want to talk about mandates, Senator Abetz, maybe the government should come in here and talk to Australians about why they lied to the Australian people and told them there would be no change to pensions, no cuts to health and no cuts to education.


Senator Abetz also talks about the manufacturing industry. A government whose Treasurer stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and goaded Holden to leave wants to talk to us about manufacturing jobs? The government, who ripped assistance away from the car industry and ensured that we have an end to the auto manufacturing industry here in Australia, want to come to this chamber and tell us that we have to get rid of the carbon price because that is better for manufacturing jobs, after demonstrating that they have no concern for manufacturing workers and their families. I think Senator Abetz said in his speech—and the Hansard will correct me if I am wrong—that the carbon tax had destroyed the Australian economy. If that is the case, what has this government done in terms of ripping away manufacturing jobs? What has this government done in terms of the hit on low- and middle-income earners, the hit on families, the hit on vulnerable Australians and the hit on elderly Australians? Let's get a bit of reality into this debate.


The Labor Party has made very clear: we support an emissions trading scheme. That is our position, and that is a floating price. With all of the word games and props that Senator Abetz uses, he glosses over that fact. We support an emissions trading scheme, which is what we went to the election with in 2007—a mandate which those opposite deny. We support an emissions trading scheme, like John Howard used to in 2007, like John Hewson does and like all sensible economists do, because it is the cheapest way for our economy to respond to climate change. It is the cheapest way for us to address this issue. Unlike those opposite, we do not believe it is a reasonable position, an ethical position, to say to Australians, 'It's all too hard. We don't want to do anything about climate change.' That is what this government wants. That is the position of this government. It is not the position of the Labor Party.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-07,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:42):  I rise to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the new Senate, sworn in a matter of a few hours ago, is being asked, if the government has its way on this, to deal with a complex set of bills which go to the heart of addressing global warming and bringing down greenhouse gas emissions. Having listened to Senator Abetz, it makes it even more important that we do not deal with these in the rush that the government wants. This is a matter where, in 50 years time, people are going to look back on what this Senate did and say, 'How is it possible that, given what they knew at the time with regard to climate science, given that they knew at the time that we were reaching tipping points beyond which there is no return, given they knew at the time that ocean acidification is simplifying marine ecosystems, given that they knew that the West Antarctic ice sheet was collapsing, given that they knew glaciers were retreating, and given that they knew that extreme weather events were killing people all around the world and here in Australia, they swore in people in the Senate and within hours wanted to bring on a complex set of legislation and vote down the only effective policy that this parliament has had to bring down emissions?' Every minute that we stand here under the current legislation, greenhouse gas emissions are coming down. That is the fact of the matter. Look at the electricity sector; look at the sectors that are covered.




Senator Williams:
  Shut down manufacturing.




Senator MILNE:
  As for shutting down manufacturing, as Senator Williams talks about, let me tell you: hollowing out the manufacturing sector is the legacy of the Howard and Costello years. Hollowing out the manufacturing sector and undermining investment in further education are the legacies of those years. In 2006, there was the opportunity at the height of the boom to actually invest in education and in transitioning the economy. And what did they do? They gave it out in tax cuts, left, right and centre—manna from heaven. Remember the debate? Rivers of gold; manna from heaven—they gave it out in tax cuts to people, instead of investing in public transport, in education and in the kind of infrastructure that the future demanded.


But now we are in a situation where Senator Abetz tells Australians that there is a carbon tax. There is not. We have legislation in this parliament which is an emissions trading scheme. That is what is the law in Australia as I stand here and speak. It is operating as a fixed price for three years and then transitioning to flexible pricing as of 1 July next year. So it is a lie to say to the Australian people that we do not have an emissions trading scheme. We do. The architecture is passed. Everything is in place. The Climate Change Authority was set up to recommend to the parliament the level that we should set for ambition, and, when that recommendation was made, the parliament was supposed to put that into the legislation to enable flexible pricing. The linking with the European Union has already been done. The expectation is that we will be at flexible pricing, linked to the European Union, next year. We could actually go to it now if we chose to do so. But the fact of the matter is: we already have an emissions trading scheme.


As to this notion that it is a blot on jobs: well, contrary to what Senator Abetz says, in the news today we hear that Californian company SolarReserve's CEO, Kevin Smith, has said that it will not be investing in Australia because of the wind-back of climate framework policy. Around Australia today, we have a huge rollout of renewable energy and jobs because people can see that this is where the innovation is, this is where rural development is, this is where rural jobs are, around Australia. Communities are embracing renewable energy, putting solar panels on their roofs and doing what they can with energy efficiency.


It may come as a shock to the coalition to learn it, but most people are actually anxious about the future because of global warming. If you had picked up the paper over the weekend you would have seen that Kiribati, a country in the Pacific, has just bought land in Fiji so that it can transfer its entire population. What does that say to this parliament? These are our Pacific island neighbours who are already impacted on by sea level rise and by saltwater incursion. They have young people sitting there in their country knowing that it is rapidly reaching a point where they can no longer live in that country. As to Tuvalu, as early as 2006, on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, up got their leader and said to the global community: 'Who will take my people?' Is Australia going to start recognising that we are driving environmental refugees around the world because of extreme weather events, because of sea level rise, because of storm surge and because of saltwater incursion? These are the issues that we should be talking about, particularly here in this Senate.


There is a need for everybody in the Senate—and, I would say, especially the new senators—to understand the architecture of the legislation and how it works. Did the new senators, for example, know that there has been a schedule added to one of the bills—schedule 5 added to the main bill—which removes the funding substantially from ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency? This parliament set up the Australian Renewable Energy Agency so that there would be a continuum between early-stage research and pilot-stage rollout of projects through to commercialisation under the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They were a package. And the idea was that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation profits would flow back into the Renewable Energy Agency and fund early-stage research. So it became a circular thing, where the community was not having to pay for the early-stage research—in fact the rollout and profit from those projects was.


Does anyone here actually understand that, by repealing these bills, the government has chosen to forgo $18 billion in revenue over the forward estimates? The Prime Minister is saying to the people of Australia that he will not take it out of the pockets of the big polluters; he will in fact take it out of the pockets of the community in co-payments for going to the doctor; he will take it out of the pockets of the community and pensioners; he will take it out of the pockets of the community when it comes to health and education. Whilst people have talked about the co-payments, not a lot has yet been said about the millions being taken out of health and education to the states.


Speaking of the states, how many people here realise that Tasmania has had a major windfall gain because of our emissions trading scheme? Hydro Tasmania has made substantial amounts of money—$70 million is going into the Hydro because of carbon pricing, and that goes into the state budget by way of a dividend paid into the state budget. Stopping that means that Tasmania—which is already under the pump economically, which people realise—will have fewer nurses, police and teachers.




Senator Bushby:
  Where does that money come from?




Senator MILNE:
  It is coming out of the pockets of big polluters; that is where the money is coming from. That is my point. It is coming out of the pockets of big polluters because the big polluters are being asked to internalise the real cost of their pollution, and that is why we are saying: why should the community have to pay with their lives?


Why should the community have to pay for the extreme weather events? Who pays for the massive destruction of infrastructure? Who paid for the aftermath of the Queensland floods? I will tell you: the community did, through their taxes. Billions went in that so-called one-off flood repair levy. But we said at the time that a permanent fund should be set up and the big polluters should pay into that permanent fund, because every year Australians have to pay for extreme fires, for floods and for drought relief, and that is going to go on and on. We are going to see more extreme weather events, and the community is going to pay with lives and with infrastructure, and they are already paying. If you look at the so-called savings that you are supposedly going to be making, and then you take from that the cost of cleaning up after these extreme weather events, and ask people: 'How much are your insurance premiums these days if you live in an area vulnerable to flooding, to storm surge or to fire?' you will find that, if you live in Roma, the savings that you supposedly are going to make from the repeal of a carbon price are nothing compared with the fact that you cannot even afford insurance anymore because of your vulnerability to flooding. That is the reality around Australia, and that is why I think we need to stand here and go through these bills and have people actually understand the connections between all of the elements of these pieces of legislation. The future depends upon it.


We went out and spoke with some young people this morning, and I can tell you that they are representative of young people right around the country. They get the climate science. They know the world is changing. They also know that it is their future, that they and their children are going to inherit an earth that has been seriously depleted by species extinction, for a start, and extreme weather events. They know they are going to inherit a world with more conflict. The Pentagon has already acknowledged that global warming is going to be a major driver of conflict and is now part of military planning in the United States. That is why we are saying: do not rush this. Australia is not a dictatorship; it is a democracy, and the Senate is a house of review. We should be reviewing this legislation and pointing out the lies that have been told about carbon pricing. It has always been a lie to say that we have a carbon tax in Australia. We have an emissions trading scheme that is legislated; it is in place now and it is linked to the European Union. And we should be keeping that carbon price.



Senator Lambie interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  I am pleased that Senator Lambie has raised the issue of pensioners. Part of the design of carbon pricing was that people on low incomes and pensions were overcompensated for the flow-on cost of carbon pricing. We structured the compensation to overcompensate people on low incomes. What is more, we did something that was innovative, and that was raise the tax-free threshold. The tax-free threshold in Australia used to be $6,000. We have raised the tax-free threshold to $18,000 and it will go to $19,400. That means people around Australia on low incomes benefit hugely. Everybody, and particularly those on low incomes—part-time workers, students and the like—benefits from the fact that they have now got a higher tax-free threshold. That was part of the design.


It is important that we have a full and informed debate on how the package worked. Why did we need $10 billion going into renewable energy, which the Greens negotiated? It was because the carbon price was not going to drive the transformation to 100 per cent renewables as quickly as possible. That is why we added the Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the architecture to support a transition to a low-carbon economy. The Climate Change Authority was an important part of the architecture. It was based on what they do in the UK, where they recognised that they needed an expert body to recommend to the parliament the level of ambition that would be required to meet their obligations as part of a global community trying to constrain global warming to less than two degrees.


The Greens will stand here and argue absolutely for the retention of our emissions trading scheme and the retention of action on global warming. Frankly, it is a global disgrace that we are behaving as an isolationist, inward-looking, selfish country in the global community. Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, is calling a global summit asking countries to put a higher level of ambition on the table and acknowledging the disaster that is climate change. And this weekend we had scientists reporting that we are very close to having a massive burst of methane going into the atmosphere because of the thawing in the Arctic. That will set us back a very long time in terms of urgency and what needs to be done.


By keeping the scheme we have got, we have a trajectory which we can increase and we will be able to do it in a way that does not have massive dislocation in the economy. But the longer you leave action on global warming, the longer you do not do what is necessary, by the time you get around to doing it the trajectory will be so steep that the dislocation will be huge. We have already seen the risk associated with investment in what will be stranded assets. I have absolutely no doubt that the coal ports up and down the Queensland coast and the coalmines currently being proposed in the Galilee and Bowen basins are going to end up as stranded assets because the world is going to have to move and very fast.


It beggars belief that the Parliament of Australia, a nation which prides itself on its global responsibility, would abuse the processes of the parliament and race in here on the first day of a new Senate and try and drive through legislation that will impact on every person who comes after us. This seems to be part of a game the coalition wants to play. The Prime Minister ran around Australia saying Whyalla would be wiped off the map, and Barnaby Joyce said a roast dinner would cost $100 and the like. All of it was untrue—unsubstantiated nonsense has been out there. That is why we need to make a considered and thoughtful judgement. It really will be a situation where, in 50 years time, people will look back at who was in here now and ask themselves: 'Why did those people vote the way that they did in full knowledge? Were they so selfish that they didn't care about future generations? Were they so ignorant that they didn't read the science and understand what it meant? Or were they just involved in playing cheap political games?' People in here have to recognise that on this package of bills, on this issue, they will be judged. We will all be judged for the positions that we take.


Former Prime Minister Rudd decided in 2010 to abandon what he then called 'the greatest moral challenge of all time'. And it is. It is an intergenerational equity issue and it is a justice issue. He was right. In abandoning that in 2010, he turned the 2010 election into a climate election. I can tell you, Mr President, the 2016 federal election will be a climate election in Australia. That is because the rest of the world is not going to tolerate what Australia is doing. We will see not only the Chinese but also the British and the Americans entering into all kinds of bilaterals, which will give them enormous economic advantage, recognising that the main source of growth at the moment is innovation in the clean energy economy. Australia will be left behind as a rust-bucket economy because we are looking back to an old, resource based dirty past as the rest of the world is investing its best brains in a clever, innovative and educated future. That is why this choice today is about the past versus the future and that is why the Greens are firmly placed here on the side of the future. 


We accept the Climate Change Authority's recommendation that we need a 40 to 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The community is rapidly coming to understand the costs of not acting on climate change. The cost of acting is far less and people are now seeing that this is an equity issue. Why should $18 billion be kept in the hands of the polluters and taken out of the pockets of the community? That is what people are asking and that is the question that has to be answered. But it is because of the fact that so many lies have been told, because there is an attempt to abuse the processes of this parliament, that we are saying here that we will absolutely not support these bills being taken together. We ask that the questions of proceeding without formality and the bills being taken together be put as separate questions.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-07-07,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:01):  To me this is an issue about process. I can indicate that I did not support the carbon tax because the former government had a reverse mandate not to introduce it. When Malcolm Turnbull was opposition leader, we jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to come up with an alternative emissions trading scheme and I think it stood the test of time in terms of the predictions made about the revenue recycling, the waste inherent in what the previous government had put up.


But the issue here is: do we deal with these bills this week or do we deal with them next week? That is what the issue is. Do we deal with them in a rush this week, or do we wait for a committee process to determine the nuances and the intricacies of these bills, particularly given the new schedule that Senator Milne referred to? I think it would be a prudent thing to do to ensure that we deal with them next week. There is no question that we need to have these bills dealt with in this sitting fortnight, but the immediate question is whether we deal with them this week or next week. Having them dealt with separately, I think, would be preferable from a procedural point of view.


In terms of abuse of process, I must say—and I think Senator Madigan has been consistent on this as well—I have been in this chamber when the ALP and the Greens voted for the guillotine where we rammed a whole range of bills through with little or no debate. That was absolutely and fundamentally wrong. It is very important that we on the crossbench try and ensure that that does not happen again. I was not party to it and I do not want to be party to it.


If my colleagues on the crossbench decide to have these bills dealt with this week, my plea to you is: at the very least, please let's make sure there is sufficient debate in the committee stage, because I have been in this place when they rammed through legislation and there was no committee stage or it was truncated. You do not get to ask those key questions in the committee stage about the intricacies of the bills, about how they work. That is very important. So, if we are going to deal with them this week, then let's sit as many hours as we need to so that no senator, no party, no individual is deprived of the right to ask key questions about these bills, because they have wide implications.


Let's look at the broader picture. It is this: both major parties have a bipartisan commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by a fairly modest five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. How do you best achieve it? That is one of the questions here. I believe that direct action, a second-best option, with modification, might work.


I agree with Senator Wong that the best, most effective and efficient way of dealing with climate change, of reducing greenhouse gases, is by having an efficient emissions trading scheme. I would like to quote from an opinion piece published last week in the New York Times by Henry Paulson. Henry Paulson was the Secretary of the Treasury from July 2006 to January 2009 in the United States for George W Bush. We are not talking about a left-winger. We are talking about a deeply conservative man whose position was this:


The solution can be a fundamentally conservative one that will empower the marketplace to find the most efficient response.


He goes on about the risks of not having an effective response. He says:


When I worry about risks, I worry about the biggest ones, particularly those that are difficult to predict—the ones I call small but deep holes. While odds are you will avoid them, if you do fall in one, it’s a long way down and nearly impossible to claw your way out.


That is the sort of thing we need to be careful of. When you hear an arch-conservative saying we need to have an efficient market response to climate change, that is something that we need to look at very, very closely. Mr Paulson went on to say:


The nature of a crisis is its unpredictability. And as we all witnessed during the financial crisis, a chain reaction of cascading failures ensued from one intertwined part of the system to the next. It’s easy to see a single part in motion. It’s not so easy to calculate the resulting domino effect. That sort of contagion nearly took down the global financial system.


We need to have a sensible and a considered approach.


Can I also say this about the debate in relation to the carbon tax. Whilst I did not support it, let's put this in perspective. Two-thirds of the reason why power prices have gone up in this country is because of network charges. Successive governments at a state and federal level have been asleep at the wheel with respect to our National Electricity Market and the power of the Australian Energy Regulator. The regulator does not have enough powers to tackle the cost-gouging that we consumers are facing when it comes to electricity prices in this country. We have had a narrow debate—that the increased prices are all about the carbon tax. Of course the carbon tax is a key factor, but two-thirds of the power prices are due to a whole range of other factors, including where network charges have been gold plated and where consumers and businesses have been taken for mugs. We need a commitment from the government. That is why the Palmer United Party, Senator Muir, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day can play a key role to ensure that the government pushes a reform agenda to make sure the regulator has the power to hold big power companies to account for the price gouging which has been occurring for so long.


For our manufacturing industries, power prices are a real and significant factor, but for the government to rip $400 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme is a much bigger factor for manufacturing in this country, and that is on top of the $500 million taken out of promises made by the former shadow minister, Ms Mirabella.


The Australian government, for reasons I cannot fathom, has decided to send a contract for the building of two Navy supply ships worth up to $1.5 billion to South Korea and/or Spain. It will not even allow Australian companies to tender. How is that good for our manufacturing industries? We are not even allowed to have a fighting chance, to tender for those jobs. We need those jobs more than ever, with the demise of Holden, Ford and Toyota removing original automotive manufacturing from this country. We need those jobs and that is why this government must be held to account. So I will not be lectured by this government on manufacturing jobs when it is not even allowing Australian industry to tender for a $1.5 billion contract. There is something that we need to do as well. It is not that simple; it is nuanced.


So if eventually there will be a suspension of standing orders, which I understand the government is proposing to move, and we deal with these bills this week—that is not my preferred course, but if we do—I urge my crossbench colleagues: for goodness sakes, do not do what the ALP and the Greens did in the previous parliament when they rushed things through and gagged debate. We need to have a decent debate on this. That is what this parliament is about. We have a job here to hold the executive arm of government to account. We owe that to the people of Australia.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-07-07,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:09):  This is a matter which brought me to politics in the first place, so I am very pleased to speak on these bills today. As much as Senator Abetz would like us to believe that the Australian government has a mandate to bash these bills through without comment, I would remind him that the Australian people have seen fit to hang the numbers in this chamber; that we have the largest ever assembly of crossbenchers, people who have not yet had time to read the bills, let alone critique them and come to an informed view, which is why we engage in committee processes in the first place; and that although Mr Abbott does control the numbers in the House of Representatives—which is why we have seen debate there approach the proportions of a sham—the Senate works very differently and thank goodness it does. We have the most diverse upper house probably in the history of the Federation and, given the importance of the bills we are dealing with, the very least we could do is pay the committee the respect it deserves and give it the time to produce and table its report. 


I will be very clear: this is one bill on which I have made up my mind. The most important issue facing this parliament today and facing other parliaments and assemblies around the world is what kind of policy we bring into the age of climate change. We have committed ourselves already to dangerous climate change and to dangerous degrees of global warming. The question now is whether we plunge on and commit ourselves and our children to catastrophic climate change, where societies' ability to adapt to what is coming down the line will be overwhelmed. 


We have also heard Senator Abetz and others on the government benches adopting this very thin veneer of pretending to care about climate change, but the cat was let out of the bag by the fact that they are still happy and content to adopt a five per cent target, which is so brazenly at odds with what the scientific community has been telling us for decades. It should be treated as no more than a sham. That is why the government's direct action policy should be seen for what it is: a policy designed by people who could not care less whether or not it works because, through some strange artefact, the government appears to have decided that what the weather is doing at the moment is some kind of socialist conspiracy.


How utterly bizarre! How could otherwise intelligent, reasonable legislators, educated people, somehow bring themselves to believe that NASA, CSIRO, the Hadley Centre and the Bureau of Meteorology have got it wrong and Lord Monckton somehow got it right? I should not address him as a lord. The House of Lords have asked that he not be addressed as a lord, so I will not. They believe that somehow people like Andrew Bolt have got it right and that the global science community have somehow become engaged and enmeshed in a socialist conspiracy? What are you people huffing in your party room, if that is where you have got to? 


These acts should stand. The government would rip $18 billion out of the economy—out of direct transfers to vulnerable Australians, out of energy efficiency throughout the business community and out of changes to the tax scales to protect people who can least afford increases in electricity prices. Bear in mind that the overall impact, more or less, is as Treasury predicted: equal to about a third of the cost impact of the GST when it was introduced. Those who were unable to pay for that were compensated—indeed, as Senator Milne reminds us, were overcompensated.


Even more importantly, the carbon tax would transfer some of that money from dirty industry to the clean energy industries of the future. The package was not perfect but it is a lot better than what this current government proposes to do, which is simply to throw a wrecking ball through it. You will be throwing a wrecking ball through Australian industry. While those on the other side of the chamber bemoan the demise of manufacturing in this country, they are setting out to systematically sabotage the clean energy sector, which has extraordinary manufacturing potential for Australia, particularly for my state of WA, which has been dubbed 'the Saudi Arabia of sunlight'. All this shows that the government simply cannot be taken seriously.


This is policy designed by people who have managed to persuade themselves that the most serious public policy issue facing this country in the 21st century simply does not exist. How nice that must be for you, to wake up in the morning simply believing that it is not there, it is just not true and it is just not happening. You wake up, you tighten that blindfold around your eyes and you come into parliament to try to persuade the rest of the country that, simply because you have deluded yourselves into believing this is not real, we should believe it and go that way as well. It is real and it is, indeed, an uncomfortable and an inconvenient truth. But it is the truth. You cannot argue with the weather; you cannot debate the composition of the atmosphere.


You bring forward these repeal bills. However, the Australian Greens are of the view that they should be debated and that the committee should be allowed to report. We are strongly of the view that the new crossbenchers and the other senators on the back bench of the Labor and Liberal-National parties should be given the opportunity, given the gravity of these measures, to read the bills and to analyse exactly what it is that you are proposing to do, to form a considered view and then, I would hope, to consign these repeal bills to the dustbin of history. As Senator Milne mentioned previously, people will be looking back at these debates. They will be asking how on earth Australia became the first and only industrialised country in the world to roll back a functional carbon price instrument.


I am a little tired of being accused of being a socialist for being one of the ones promoting a flexible pricing instrument to deal with this public policy question. That is straight out of the Karl Marx playbook—that you would have a market instrument to sort out the most efficient and most rapid way of restructuring electricity markets around the country, driving industry and householders towards more efficient consumption of energy, thereby lowering electricity bills and eventually eliminating them when the renewable energy infrastructure is completely in place. You have somehow established in your own minds that a floating market instrument as one component of public policy for dealing with this issue is somehow a socialist initiative. How utterly bizarre. You have completely taken leave of reality.


That is not the only thing: the Australian Greens believe that one of the most important components of the clean energy package, which the coalition also proposes to wreck, is the construction of and investment in the next generation of renewable energy power stations, such as solar thermal plants. Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Wright were buoyed over recent days with the announcement that Alinta, themselves a very substantial fossil player, are now undertaking a feasibility study into converting a section of South Australia's power grid into a dedicated solar thermal plant. That fires the starting gun for me. I think we are going to beat you, Senator Wright. I think the goldfields in WA will be the first to get one of those built. We look forward to the competition.



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Waters might like to step up for the western part of Queensland. Our continent is drenched in sunlight and this is the fuel for the power stations of the future. You can try to roll it back all you like and maybe you—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—will be successful today, Senator Abetz. Maybe you will succeed through these procedural shenanigans to have these bills brought on and rammed through. But I do not think you are aware of just how rapidly the electricity sector is changing. What has been posed as this so-called death spiral of the black-power generators in the network business, at least on the east coast of Australia, is in fact the sign of an industry being born, an industry that we desperately need to perform and outperform expectations, as it has been doing.


You can sit there and study your repeal bills. You can craft your speeches about toxic taxes and rehearse the same tired talking points that got you through last September because people genuinely believed your campaign of fearmongering—that Whyalla would be wiped off the map, that people would be priced out of their homes and that electricity bills would go through the roof. None of it happened. That is why it did not work when it came to the Western Australian by-election. The talking points no longer worked. The stale lines that you were rolling out meant that the combined vote of the coalition collapsed by another five per cent. It was not a glitch, not the kind of bump that always happens in by-elections. It was the continuation of a long-term decline in the Liberal Party vote. It was 50 per cent of the Western Australian vote a decade ago. Now it is 34. And we knocked another five per cent off you while you were out there flailing your arms about, talking about the toxic carbon tax. The Greens recorded their strongest ever vote in Western Australia in the Senate.


The reason it is not working anymore is that the fear campaign was exposed as hollow. Whyalla is still chugging along pretty nicely. Alinta is now proposing solar thermal in South Australia. The off-grid miners are first in the queue in Western Australia to eliminate their diesel fuel bills and their gas bills by building solar plants at their mining operations. The politics have changed, the policy has changed and the air is warming around us.


All I can do is urge the crossbenchers to join with the Greens in opposing this motion, in taking time and giving these bills due consideration because, in my view, there will not be a more important set of bills that we deal with, certainly not in this term of parliament. We cannot be the first country in the world to roll back a functional carbon price that is actually changing the structure of electricity markets, at least on the east coast. It is driving down emissions in the electricity sector and we are finally seeing that economic tipping point of the next generation of renewable energy technology and the increasing economic advantages of eliminating your fuel bills—coal, gas and oil. The penny is finally dropping that that revolution is here.


If you think you can hold that back with these votes today, you are mistaken. Maybe you will manage to cost us five years, as Australian industry slips further backwards down the curve, outcompeted by the United States, the Chinese and the Middle East—they also have a fair amount of sunlight there. Is that really what you are after? You will not be able to say that you were not warned. You went into this with your eyes open. I look forward to committing to the vote: proper, due consideration of these bills rather than this reckless, headlong rush that you are engaged in on behalf of your donors in the coal, oil and gas industries.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (12:12):  Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. The opposition will be asking that you put the question separately on the procedural element of this motion, 'that these bills may proceed without formalities', and I wish to speak to that procedural motion.


We have a particular issue here before the chamber about the whole consideration of the important elements of the carbon bills. We all know that there is major interest in this process. We read in the media every day that this is going to be the most important element that comes—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator MOORE:
  We read in the media about the interest that has been placed on this process. We have now heard that there is going to be a meeting of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee this afternoon to consider the process. We all know that, in the last sitting of this chamber, there was a motion passed by this Senate that there would be a consideration of this package of bills through the environment committee. There was a process put in place that there would be a report provided to this place on 14 July to allow there to be consideration of these issues. That process has not occurred.


We are here today, on the first sitting day of a new Senate, and we have a whole range of people in this place who have not had the opportunity to have any consideration of this legislation. The process that this Senate put in place was that there would be a committee process where we would have the opportunity to consider the range of issues that have occurred over the last period of months. We are not only looking at issues that were previously discussed in this place. The situation internationally and also nationally has changed considerably around the whole issue of this legislation about carbon pricing and the process that we are going to put in place to look at this significant range of legislation. That process has not occurred. There has not been the opportunity for people to put forward their views. There has not been the opportunity for people to listen to the range of views that we know are held, that continue to be held and that continue to be examined.


It is so important that we start together in this place with appropriate consideration of the legislation that is before us. We talk nobly about what should happen in this place. We heard this morning about the independence of the Senate and how important it is for every single senator to understand fully, to question and to be involved in the votes that they will take on legislation before the chamber. I do not believe, the opposition does not believe and many people in the community do not believe that that is allowed by the current process of bringing forward this package of legislation today, without a recommendation from the committee that was charged by the Senate to consider it, without an opportunity for people to have current evidence before them, although I know the government will say that there has been considerable process around these carbon bills. 


It is important that there is considerable effort put into looking at this legislation that we have. It is not simple. It is complex. There are a range of issues here that we all need to understand and consider before we vote. There needs to be the opportunity in this place to have the process. We do not think it is appropriate, in the first matter of core business before us, to say: 'We'll bring the whole carbon tax legislation before this place, we will expect that that process will take place and we will go straight into the full debate without having the evidence from the committee that we set up.'


We consider that this is an important element of the operations of the Senate. We believe it is important for all of us to have the time and the opportunity to hear from not just each other across the august chamber of the Senate. It is not just a debate for us in this place. The important thing is that when we come here we come here we come with the information, concerns and support or otherwise of the people in the wider community who care deeply about this issue. Only this morning, outside this parliament, we had the opportunity to meet with a whole group of young people who have a passionate concern about the future of our environment and the future of carbon pricing in Australia. I believe that every senator in this place was provided with an invitation to go and meet with these young people about this legislation. We had that opportunity to go down there this morning. Some of us took it, and what we heard from the people there was that that it was our decision but their future. 


We need to ensure that those voices are heard in this place, through the whole range of the committee process. That has not been completed. We have not had that process concluded. And yet we are here being asked to accept a blanket proposition from the government which says that the bills have to come through straightaway. I do not believe that has given us the chance to have the debate we need to have, not just here but outside. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Do you believe in democracy? There has been an election.




Senator MOORE:
  I think that to do duty to our job as senators, to do duty to our process, we need to ensure that we have further opportunity to consider what has been said by the community. Other people will have more comments, but I do not believe, as a member of this Senate, that the process that we have taken to date has given due consideration to the role of the Senate. The Senate committee process, which is the background to what we do, has not been allowed to function fully. There was no attempt to talk to community members. I think it is important that we understand that what we are being asked to do is actually shortcutting the process. What we have been asked to do by the government today is to cut through, to shortcut the process, to ensure that the debate does not reflect the wider information that we must have before we come to this place. It is not a worthy process to rush this through in this way. It is not a worthy process to dismiss the concerns of people in the community who want to hear this debate fully. It does not fulfil those same promises that we heard earlier today about ensuring that this place actually does listen and care and that when we come into this place we do not just bring our own personal opinions; we bring consideration of committee process and recommendations that we have come to expect.




Senator Heffernan:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr President. My point of order is: I take exception to being told I am not—



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, Senator Heffernan.




Senator Heffernan:
  I did not see anyone over there at the 'Bin the budget' rally yesterday, at which I spoke, which concerns—



The PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point. That is not a point of order. 




Senator MOORE:
  In terms of the process that Senator Heffernan has just outlined, indeed the role of all the senators is to ensure that they do listen to the community. However, the process yesterday was not about the bills that are in front of us. The community meeting that we went to this morning was. The whole process of that community meeting of young people from across the country was specifically on the bills that the government now wants us to rush in to debate straightaway. 


I have heard the comments from across the way that we have had an election. Indeed we have. We are all aware of that election. But, just because we have had an election, the role of this place does not stop. If you think back to the discussions we had less than an hour ago, when we were swearing in the new Senate, it was said that we were going to ensure that the Senate would be a place where there would be independent, full debate. That is our job. What the government wants us to do now, as the first element of the business for the new Senate—and many senators have not have the opportunity to be in debates about this before—is to rush through a debate on bills for which we have not had the most up-to-date committee recommendations. 


Getting committee recommendations should be the way we work. I think that would be evident to all of us. Those of us who have been lucky enough to be here for a while should have seen it in practice. The new senators would have heard about the way the Senate operates, which ensures that there is the opportunity for people to have information. We have a committee structure, in which committees are tasked to go out with legislation and seek the opinions of the people in the community on that legislation. The committee's job is to consider that evidence, have it all recorded and then come back into this place with recommendations.


We all know that, in legislation processes, many of us use the committee reports as the basis for what we are going to say. We look at what has gone on, we look at the submissions that have been received and we look at the concerns. We most particularly do not rely on things that have happened exclusively in the past. When the government brought forward these bills to the last Senate, we recommended that, before they be considered, they would go through the committee process. The committee process crossed over the conclusion of the last Senate and the beginning of this Senate. We now are faced with looking at legislation to be debated in this place. We had a Senate committee process in place which was considering this legislation—the standard process. The standard process is that the committee has the opportunity to present its report and then, on the basis of that report, we then flow into the debate in this place.


That is not an unusual situation. The way that that operates is clearly identified in the standing orders. So it is particularly important that, when we move into this first debate, we have the authority of the standing practice of the Senate behind us so that we move forward with confidence. That can only enhance the debate; it does not delay the debate. We have no intention of delaying the debate. I remember many times in this place when senators on the other side were making passionate declarations about how important it was for us to have the committee process in place. We heard that. We were reminded of our job, our responsibility to ensure that Senate practices were put in place. I but ask the same thing: if we are going to have legislation brought into the chamber, it is our job to expect that we have all the information available to the senators, that the committee process be fully concluded and that we would have the opportunity to give due consideration to those processes. It is not an unusual request; it is certainly not a groundbreaking request. It is simply asking that the process of the Senate run as we expect it to, the process of the Senate run as it should do and, in fact, the process of the Senate run as it does best—providing information for senators to consider what is important in the legislation, providing opportunities for the senators to ask questions about the legislation and providing opportunities for the senators to respond to their responsibilities as senators in this chamber.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:25):  Let us just be very clear about one issue here. What this government is seeking to do is to have the carbon tax repealed. That was the bipartisan position of Prime Minister Gillard and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, at the 2010 election. We were promised there would be no carbon tax in 2010. Then, in 2013, Prime Minister Rudd and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, were once again on a unity ticket—and I have exhibit A here: a Labor Party brochure authorised by George Wright, in which he tells us, 'Kevin Rudd and Labor have removed the carbon tax.'


So why on earth is my good friend Senator Moore—recently resworn as a representative of the people of Queensland,  having been elected on the policy of removing the carbon tax, and her colleagues before her having been elected on a policy of never having a carbon tax—now standing here seeking to frustrate the will of the Australian people? I do not think anyone could argue with the proposition that the carbon tax was one of the key issues at the last election.


The reason the Australian people wanted to see the back end of the carbon tax was that they knew it was impacting on their cost of living—$550 for the average household in Australia each and every year. And, courtesy of the Greens-Labor majority that used to preside in this place, the carbon tax ratcheted up yet again on 1 July to increase that impost on Australian families even further. And, if the cost-of-living impost is not bad enough, we know it destroys jobs. The carbon tax is a blot on the economic landscape of our nation. It attacks the cost of living of families and it is destroying jobs as we speak.


We all know the example of Fuji chemicals, which wanted to set up in Australia with $1 billion worth of infrastructure capital investment and 150 jobs, as an ongoing concern and replacing imports. They decided to set up in China instead, simply because of the carbon tax. Do you know what they will do in China? They will emit more greenhouse gases in their production than they did in a pre-carbon tax environment in Australia. And that is where you see the absolutely perverse environmental outcome of the carbon tax. Not only does it destroy Australia's economy and the cost of living; it actually ensures that clean production companies in Australia have to move offshore to countries where they do not have as strong an environmental regime as we do in Australia.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! On my left.




Senator ABETZ:
  This is the classic lose-lose scenario that was inflicted upon the Australian people by the Australian Greens and the Labor Party in that marriage that they undertook with Senator Bob Brown and Prime Minister Gillard.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator ABETZ:
  I do not know what the Labor Party interjections are about. I refer to this brochure again: 'Kevin Rudd and Labor remove the carbon tax.' If we were to believe the very policy on which Senator Moore got herself re-elected to this place—that is, the carbon tax had been removed—sorry; what are these bills doing here? The carbon tax, we are agreed, still has to be removed. It is still on the legislative books, is it not?


We, as an opposition, said to the Australian people: 'If you elect us on 7 September, we will have as the very first item of business in the new parliament the repeal of the carbon tax.' And we lived up to that promise. Prime Minister Abbott introduced the repeal of the carbon tax as the very first item of business in the new parliament. So it should be no surprise to those opposite that we, as the very first item of business in this new Senate, would seek to ensure the repeal of the carbon tax.


 I say to those opposite: you had your fun last month. Yes, the dead hand of the old Senate reached out and attempted to control that which will happen in the new Senate. And that is why the motions were moved to seek to delay the will of the Australian people.


I have been asked: is this a measure that is frustrating the government? More importantly, this measure, or the motion moved by those opposite last month, was frustrating the Australian people. It is frustrating the Australian economy. It is frustrating the world's environment to boot. So in every possible respect—




Senator Cameron:
  What did you say?




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Cameron says, 'What did you say?' Can I ask you, Senator Cameron: what did you say when you sought re-election? 




Senator Cameron:
  I said I supported a price on carbon.




Senator ABETZ:
  You said that the carbon tax was being removed, on Labor Party funded brochures. Your own union may well have funded this brochure.


The fact that we are seeking to put this up as the first item should be of surprise to nobody. We said we would do so if we were elected. The Labor-Greens Senate majority frustrated us in that endeavour. We now have a new Senate, more reflective of the will of the Australian people generally on 7 September, taking into account the quirks of Western Australia. We have a situation where we as a government want to introduce this legislation as a matter of absolute urgency to get this blot off our economic landscape. People are quite rightly concerned about their cost of living. Today the Senate has the opportunity— 




Senator Cameron:
  People are concerned about the planet as well.




Senator ABETZ:
  So why did you campaign to abolish the carbon tax, not only in 2010 but in 2013 as well?


As I have already pointed out to Senator Cameron—he who will interject but never listen—the carbon tax applying in Australia is in fact perverse in relation to the world's environment. Europe discovered that themselves when they closed down their relatively clean aluminium smelters only to see them pop up again in Africa and elsewhere where the environmental regimes were not half as good as they were in their pre-existing foundries and smelters in Europe. As a result, the world's environment was worse off. The same is happening in relation to Australia. With great respect to Senator Moore, it is not as though this is a debate that has fallen out of the sky just today; I think it has been around very strongly for a number of years. In fact, so strong was the sentiment in the Australian community that Labor promised no carbon tax in 2010. They promised that absolutely. 


Then, when they realised the vehemence with which the Australian people despised the carbon tax—because it was impacting on the cost of living; it was destroying their jobs and having a perverse outcome on the environment—the Labor Party rushed around at the 2013 election to say, 'No, nothing to see here. We've already removed the carbon tax.' We know that the carbon tax has not been removed. Just as the Australian people were misled before the 2010 election—that there would be no carbon tax—so they were misled by the Australian Labor Party in 2013 with the assertion that the carbon tax had already been removed. 


The simple fact that we have to introduce this swathe of bills, some nine of them, indicates that the carbon tax regrettably is still alive and well. And, each day that this carbon tax continues, it will continue to have an impost on the cost of living for every single Australian, and it will continue to destroy jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector—




Senator Cameron:
  Don't you talk about manufacturing. What did you do to Ford? What did you do to GM?




Senator ABETZ:
  especially in the manufacturing sector, Senator Cameron, which you know. It continues to have a perverse outcome on the environment. We as a government are determined to—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cameron. 





Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Cameron is always willing to interject, never willing to listen. That is his wont. The new senators will soon learn that that is his style, and a very ugly style it is, if I might say. 




Senator Cameron:
  I don't listen to rubbish.




Senator ABETZ:
  We as a government will seek to prosecute those issues on which we were elected and in particular this impost on the economy which we believe was brought to us as a result of that marriage between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens, something about which former Senator Mark Bishop had words to say, quite rightly. He is no longer with us, regrettably, but I am sure he is ably replaced by Senator Bullock, and I wish him well. 


I conclude my remarks by saying that we as a government are anxious to remove this impost for the Australian people; noting that, in its removal, we will be delivering on the promises made by Ms Gillard and Mr Abbott, in 2010, and by Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott in 2013.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:36):  I was not going to speak in this debate, and I think—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Don't worry, I will be speaking on the suspension of standing orders and the upending of the Senate rules which no doubt you will do next. 


I thank Senator Milne for allowing me to speak first. I will not be too long. There are a number of things in that stream of hyperbole which I think require a response from the Labor Party. Firstly, Senator Abetz says, 'People are concerned about the cost of living; this carbon price is a dreadful thing for cost of living'. What about the GP tax—that promise that you broke? You did not tell people that you would be introducing a $7 GP tax. As I recall, it was, 'No cuts to health; no cuts to education.' People care about the cost of living. What about the tax on pharmaceuticals, the increased co-payment, making it more expensive for people to get medication? Do you reckon that has an impact on people's cost of living? What about fuel excise? This is one for Senator Williams. What about the increase to fuel tax? That is also not something that was discussed before the election. Some might describe it as a carbon tax on steroids. What about the cuts to pensions? They might be something about cost of living—the cuts to pensions that the Prime Minister so arrogantly pretends do not exist. The thing about this government is that not only—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He said, 'No cuts.' You tell that to Australia's pensioners. You are going to reduce the amount by which their pension increases from what it is now into the future. You tell them, 'Actually, love, that's not a cut. I'm going to take money back to the government, which is how I get a saving in my budget, but I'm not even going to do you the respect of acknowledging that it is a cut to your pension.'


Finally, there is the deregulation of university fees, making it harder for disadvantaged Australians and kids from working-class families to go to university. When Senator Abetz comes in here and cries about the cost of living, I hope everybody in this chamber and everybody who might consider this debate will think about the cost-of-living measures, the cost-of-living imposts, the increases to the cost of living of Australians, particularly middle- and low-income Australians, that the government are seeking to impose with their budget. Worst of all, they told lies before the election about whether they would do that.


There was a lot of talk about mandate in the contribution from Senator Abetz. Where is the mandate for the GP tax? Where is the mandate for the increases to the fuel excise? Where is the mandate for increases to the pharmaceuticals co-payment? Where is the mandate for cuts to the pension? Where is the mandate for putting university education out of the reach of so many Australians? If you want to talk about mandates, Senator Abetz, maybe the government should come in here and talk to Australians about why they lied to the Australian people and told them there would be no change to pensions, no cuts to health and no cuts to education.


Senator Abetz also talks about the manufacturing industry. A government whose Treasurer stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and goaded Holden to leave wants to talk to us about manufacturing jobs? The government, who ripped assistance away from the car industry and ensured that we have an end to the auto manufacturing industry here in Australia, want to come to this chamber and tell us that we have to get rid of the carbon price because that is better for manufacturing jobs, after demonstrating that they have no concern for manufacturing workers and their families. I think Senator Abetz said in his speech—and the Hansard will correct me if I am wrong—that the carbon tax had destroyed the Australian economy. If that is the case, what has this government done in terms of ripping away manufacturing jobs? What has this government done in terms of the hit on low- and middle-income earners, the hit on families, the hit on vulnerable Australians and the hit on elderly Australians? Let's get a bit of reality into this debate.


The Labor Party has made very clear: we support an emissions trading scheme. That is our position, and that is a floating price. With all of the word games and props that Senator Abetz uses, he glosses over that fact. We support an emissions trading scheme, which is what we went to the election with in 2007—a mandate which those opposite deny. We support an emissions trading scheme, like John Howard used to in 2007, like John Hewson does and like all sensible economists do, because it is the cheapest way for our economy to respond to climate change. It is the cheapest way for us to address this issue. Unlike those opposite, we do not believe it is a reasonable position, an ethical position, to say to Australians, 'It's all too hard. We don't want to do anything about climate change.' That is what this government wants. That is the position of this government. It is not the position of the Labor Party.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-07,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:42):  I rise to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the new Senate, sworn in a matter of a few hours ago, is being asked, if the government has its way on this, to deal with a complex set of bills which go to the heart of addressing global warming and bringing down greenhouse gas emissions. Having listened to Senator Abetz, it makes it even more important that we do not deal with these in the rush that the government wants. This is a matter where, in 50 years time, people are going to look back on what this Senate did and say, 'How is it possible that, given what they knew at the time with regard to climate science, given that they knew at the time that we were reaching tipping points beyond which there is no return, given they knew at the time that ocean acidification is simplifying marine ecosystems, given that they knew that the West Antarctic ice sheet was collapsing, given that they knew glaciers were retreating, and given that they knew that extreme weather events were killing people all around the world and here in Australia, they swore in people in the Senate and within hours wanted to bring on a complex set of legislation and vote down the only effective policy that this parliament has had to bring down emissions?' Every minute that we stand here under the current legislation, greenhouse gas emissions are coming down. That is the fact of the matter. Look at the electricity sector; look at the sectors that are covered.




Senator Williams:
  Shut down manufacturing.




Senator MILNE:
  As for shutting down manufacturing, as Senator Williams talks about, let me tell you: hollowing out the manufacturing sector is the legacy of the Howard and Costello years. Hollowing out the manufacturing sector and undermining investment in further education are the legacies of those years. In 2006, there was the opportunity at the height of the boom to actually invest in education and in transitioning the economy. And what did they do? They gave it out in tax cuts, left, right and centre—manna from heaven. Remember the debate? Rivers of gold; manna from heaven—they gave it out in tax cuts to people, instead of investing in public transport, in education and in the kind of infrastructure that the future demanded.


But now we are in a situation where Senator Abetz tells Australians that there is a carbon tax. There is not. We have legislation in this parliament which is an emissions trading scheme. That is what is the law in Australia as I stand here and speak. It is operating as a fixed price for three years and then transitioning to flexible pricing as of 1 July next year. So it is a lie to say to the Australian people that we do not have an emissions trading scheme. We do. The architecture is passed. Everything is in place. The Climate Change Authority was set up to recommend to the parliament the level that we should set for ambition, and, when that recommendation was made, the parliament was supposed to put that into the legislation to enable flexible pricing. The linking with the European Union has already been done. The expectation is that we will be at flexible pricing, linked to the European Union, next year. We could actually go to it now if we chose to do so. But the fact of the matter is: we already have an emissions trading scheme.


As to this notion that it is a blot on jobs: well, contrary to what Senator Abetz says, in the news today we hear that Californian company SolarReserve's CEO, Kevin Smith, has said that it will not be investing in Australia because of the wind-back of climate framework policy. Around Australia today, we have a huge rollout of renewable energy and jobs because people can see that this is where the innovation is, this is where rural development is, this is where rural jobs are, around Australia. Communities are embracing renewable energy, putting solar panels on their roofs and doing what they can with energy efficiency.


It may come as a shock to the coalition to learn it, but most people are actually anxious about the future because of global warming. If you had picked up the paper over the weekend you would have seen that Kiribati, a country in the Pacific, has just bought land in Fiji so that it can transfer its entire population. What does that say to this parliament? These are our Pacific island neighbours who are already impacted on by sea level rise and by saltwater incursion. They have young people sitting there in their country knowing that it is rapidly reaching a point where they can no longer live in that country. As to Tuvalu, as early as 2006, on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, up got their leader and said to the global community: 'Who will take my people?' Is Australia going to start recognising that we are driving environmental refugees around the world because of extreme weather events, because of sea level rise, because of storm surge and because of saltwater incursion? These are the issues that we should be talking about, particularly here in this Senate.


There is a need for everybody in the Senate—and, I would say, especially the new senators—to understand the architecture of the legislation and how it works. Did the new senators, for example, know that there has been a schedule added to one of the bills—schedule 5 added to the main bill—which removes the funding substantially from ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency? This parliament set up the Australian Renewable Energy Agency so that there would be a continuum between early-stage research and pilot-stage rollout of projects through to commercialisation under the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They were a package. And the idea was that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation profits would flow back into the Renewable Energy Agency and fund early-stage research. So it became a circular thing, where the community was not having to pay for the early-stage research—in fact the rollout and profit from those projects was.


Does anyone here actually understand that, by repealing these bills, the government has chosen to forgo $18 billion in revenue over the forward estimates? The Prime Minister is saying to the people of Australia that he will not take it out of the pockets of the big polluters; he will in fact take it out of the pockets of the community in co-payments for going to the doctor; he will take it out of the pockets of the community and pensioners; he will take it out of the pockets of the community when it comes to health and education. Whilst people have talked about the co-payments, not a lot has yet been said about the millions being taken out of health and education to the states.


Speaking of the states, how many people here realise that Tasmania has had a major windfall gain because of our emissions trading scheme? Hydro Tasmania has made substantial amounts of money—$70 million is going into the Hydro because of carbon pricing, and that goes into the state budget by way of a dividend paid into the state budget. Stopping that means that Tasmania—which is already under the pump economically, which people realise—will have fewer nurses, police and teachers.




Senator Bushby:
  Where does that money come from?




Senator MILNE:
  It is coming out of the pockets of big polluters; that is where the money is coming from. That is my point. It is coming out of the pockets of big polluters because the big polluters are being asked to internalise the real cost of their pollution, and that is why we are saying: why should the community have to pay with their lives?


Why should the community have to pay for the extreme weather events? Who pays for the massive destruction of infrastructure? Who paid for the aftermath of the Queensland floods? I will tell you: the community did, through their taxes. Billions went in that so-called one-off flood repair levy. But we said at the time that a permanent fund should be set up and the big polluters should pay into that permanent fund, because every year Australians have to pay for extreme fires, for floods and for drought relief, and that is going to go on and on. We are going to see more extreme weather events, and the community is going to pay with lives and with infrastructure, and they are already paying. If you look at the so-called savings that you are supposedly going to be making, and then you take from that the cost of cleaning up after these extreme weather events, and ask people: 'How much are your insurance premiums these days if you live in an area vulnerable to flooding, to storm surge or to fire?' you will find that, if you live in Roma, the savings that you supposedly are going to make from the repeal of a carbon price are nothing compared with the fact that you cannot even afford insurance anymore because of your vulnerability to flooding. That is the reality around Australia, and that is why I think we need to stand here and go through these bills and have people actually understand the connections between all of the elements of these pieces of legislation. The future depends upon it.


We went out and spoke with some young people this morning, and I can tell you that they are representative of young people right around the country. They get the climate science. They know the world is changing. They also know that it is their future, that they and their children are going to inherit an earth that has been seriously depleted by species extinction, for a start, and extreme weather events. They know they are going to inherit a world with more conflict. The Pentagon has already acknowledged that global warming is going to be a major driver of conflict and is now part of military planning in the United States. That is why we are saying: do not rush this. Australia is not a dictatorship; it is a democracy, and the Senate is a house of review. We should be reviewing this legislation and pointing out the lies that have been told about carbon pricing. It has always been a lie to say that we have a carbon tax in Australia. We have an emissions trading scheme that is legislated; it is in place now and it is linked to the European Union. And we should be keeping that carbon price.



Senator Lambie interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  I am pleased that Senator Lambie has raised the issue of pensioners. Part of the design of carbon pricing was that people on low incomes and pensions were overcompensated for the flow-on cost of carbon pricing. We structured the compensation to overcompensate people on low incomes. What is more, we did something that was innovative, and that was raise the tax-free threshold. The tax-free threshold in Australia used to be $6,000. We have raised the tax-free threshold to $18,000 and it will go to $19,400. That means people around Australia on low incomes benefit hugely. Everybody, and particularly those on low incomes—part-time workers, students and the like—benefits from the fact that they have now got a higher tax-free threshold. That was part of the design.


It is important that we have a full and informed debate on how the package worked. Why did we need $10 billion going into renewable energy, which the Greens negotiated? It was because the carbon price was not going to drive the transformation to 100 per cent renewables as quickly as possible. That is why we added the Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the architecture to support a transition to a low-carbon economy. The Climate Change Authority was an important part of the architecture. It was based on what they do in the UK, where they recognised that they needed an expert body to recommend to the parliament the level of ambition that would be required to meet their obligations as part of a global community trying to constrain global warming to less than two degrees.


The Greens will stand here and argue absolutely for the retention of our emissions trading scheme and the retention of action on global warming. Frankly, it is a global disgrace that we are behaving as an isolationist, inward-looking, selfish country in the global community. Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, is calling a global summit asking countries to put a higher level of ambition on the table and acknowledging the disaster that is climate change. And this weekend we had scientists reporting that we are very close to having a massive burst of methane going into the atmosphere because of the thawing in the Arctic. That will set us back a very long time in terms of urgency and what needs to be done.


By keeping the scheme we have got, we have a trajectory which we can increase and we will be able to do it in a way that does not have massive dislocation in the economy. But the longer you leave action on global warming, the longer you do not do what is necessary, by the time you get around to doing it the trajectory will be so steep that the dislocation will be huge. We have already seen the risk associated with investment in what will be stranded assets. I have absolutely no doubt that the coal ports up and down the Queensland coast and the coalmines currently being proposed in the Galilee and Bowen basins are going to end up as stranded assets because the world is going to have to move and very fast.


It beggars belief that the Parliament of Australia, a nation which prides itself on its global responsibility, would abuse the processes of the parliament and race in here on the first day of a new Senate and try and drive through legislation that will impact on every person who comes after us. This seems to be part of a game the coalition wants to play. The Prime Minister ran around Australia saying Whyalla would be wiped off the map, and Barnaby Joyce said a roast dinner would cost $100 and the like. All of it was untrue—unsubstantiated nonsense has been out there. That is why we need to make a considered and thoughtful judgement. It really will be a situation where, in 50 years time, people will look back at who was in here now and ask themselves: 'Why did those people vote the way that they did in full knowledge? Were they so selfish that they didn't care about future generations? Were they so ignorant that they didn't read the science and understand what it meant? Or were they just involved in playing cheap political games?' People in here have to recognise that on this package of bills, on this issue, they will be judged. We will all be judged for the positions that we take.


Former Prime Minister Rudd decided in 2010 to abandon what he then called 'the greatest moral challenge of all time'. And it is. It is an intergenerational equity issue and it is a justice issue. He was right. In abandoning that in 2010, he turned the 2010 election into a climate election. I can tell you, Mr President, the 2016 federal election will be a climate election in Australia. That is because the rest of the world is not going to tolerate what Australia is doing. We will see not only the Chinese but also the British and the Americans entering into all kinds of bilaterals, which will give them enormous economic advantage, recognising that the main source of growth at the moment is innovation in the clean energy economy. Australia will be left behind as a rust-bucket economy because we are looking back to an old, resource based dirty past as the rest of the world is investing its best brains in a clever, innovative and educated future. That is why this choice today is about the past versus the future and that is why the Greens are firmly placed here on the side of the future. 


We accept the Climate Change Authority's recommendation that we need a 40 to 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The community is rapidly coming to understand the costs of not acting on climate change. The cost of acting is far less and people are now seeing that this is an equity issue. Why should $18 billion be kept in the hands of the polluters and taken out of the pockets of the community? That is what people are asking and that is the question that has to be answered. But it is because of the fact that so many lies have been told, because there is an attempt to abuse the processes of this parliament, that we are saying here that we will absolutely not support these bills being taken together. We ask that the questions of proceeding without formality and the bills being taken together be put as separate questions.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-07-07,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:01):  To me this is an issue about process. I can indicate that I did not support the carbon tax because the former government had a reverse mandate not to introduce it. When Malcolm Turnbull was opposition leader, we jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to come up with an alternative emissions trading scheme and I think it stood the test of time in terms of the predictions made about the revenue recycling, the waste inherent in what the previous government had put up.


But the issue here is: do we deal with these bills this week or do we deal with them next week? That is what the issue is. Do we deal with them in a rush this week, or do we wait for a committee process to determine the nuances and the intricacies of these bills, particularly given the new schedule that Senator Milne referred to? I think it would be a prudent thing to do to ensure that we deal with them next week. There is no question that we need to have these bills dealt with in this sitting fortnight, but the immediate question is whether we deal with them this week or next week. Having them dealt with separately, I think, would be preferable from a procedural point of view.


In terms of abuse of process, I must say—and I think Senator Madigan has been consistent on this as well—I have been in this chamber when the ALP and the Greens voted for the guillotine where we rammed a whole range of bills through with little or no debate. That was absolutely and fundamentally wrong. It is very important that we on the crossbench try and ensure that that does not happen again. I was not party to it and I do not want to be party to it.


If my colleagues on the crossbench decide to have these bills dealt with this week, my plea to you is: at the very least, please let's make sure there is sufficient debate in the committee stage, because I have been in this place when they rammed through legislation and there was no committee stage or it was truncated. You do not get to ask those key questions in the committee stage about the intricacies of the bills, about how they work. That is very important. So, if we are going to deal with them this week, then let's sit as many hours as we need to so that no senator, no party, no individual is deprived of the right to ask key questions about these bills, because they have wide implications.


Let's look at the broader picture. It is this: both major parties have a bipartisan commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by a fairly modest five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. How do you best achieve it? That is one of the questions here. I believe that direct action, a second-best option, with modification, might work.


I agree with Senator Wong that the best, most effective and efficient way of dealing with climate change, of reducing greenhouse gases, is by having an efficient emissions trading scheme. I would like to quote from an opinion piece published last week in the New York Times by Henry Paulson. Henry Paulson was the Secretary of the Treasury from July 2006 to January 2009 in the United States for George W Bush. We are not talking about a left-winger. We are talking about a deeply conservative man whose position was this:


The solution can be a fundamentally conservative one that will empower the marketplace to find the most efficient response.


He goes on about the risks of not having an effective response. He says:


When I worry about risks, I worry about the biggest ones, particularly those that are difficult to predict—the ones I call small but deep holes. While odds are you will avoid them, if you do fall in one, it’s a long way down and nearly impossible to claw your way out.


That is the sort of thing we need to be careful of. When you hear an arch-conservative saying we need to have an efficient market response to climate change, that is something that we need to look at very, very closely. Mr Paulson went on to say:


The nature of a crisis is its unpredictability. And as we all witnessed during the financial crisis, a chain reaction of cascading failures ensued from one intertwined part of the system to the next. It’s easy to see a single part in motion. It’s not so easy to calculate the resulting domino effect. That sort of contagion nearly took down the global financial system.


We need to have a sensible and a considered approach.


Can I also say this about the debate in relation to the carbon tax. Whilst I did not support it, let's put this in perspective. Two-thirds of the reason why power prices have gone up in this country is because of network charges. Successive governments at a state and federal level have been asleep at the wheel with respect to our National Electricity Market and the power of the Australian Energy Regulator. The regulator does not have enough powers to tackle the cost-gouging that we consumers are facing when it comes to electricity prices in this country. We have had a narrow debate—that the increased prices are all about the carbon tax. Of course the carbon tax is a key factor, but two-thirds of the power prices are due to a whole range of other factors, including where network charges have been gold plated and where consumers and businesses have been taken for mugs. We need a commitment from the government. That is why the Palmer United Party, Senator Muir, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day can play a key role to ensure that the government pushes a reform agenda to make sure the regulator has the power to hold big power companies to account for the price gouging which has been occurring for so long.


For our manufacturing industries, power prices are a real and significant factor, but for the government to rip $400 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme is a much bigger factor for manufacturing in this country, and that is on top of the $500 million taken out of promises made by the former shadow minister, Ms Mirabella.


The Australian government, for reasons I cannot fathom, has decided to send a contract for the building of two Navy supply ships worth up to $1.5 billion to South Korea and/or Spain. It will not even allow Australian companies to tender. How is that good for our manufacturing industries? We are not even allowed to have a fighting chance, to tender for those jobs. We need those jobs more than ever, with the demise of Holden, Ford and Toyota removing original automotive manufacturing from this country. We need those jobs and that is why this government must be held to account. So I will not be lectured by this government on manufacturing jobs when it is not even allowing Australian industry to tender for a $1.5 billion contract. There is something that we need to do as well. It is not that simple; it is nuanced.


So if eventually there will be a suspension of standing orders, which I understand the government is proposing to move, and we deal with these bills this week—that is not my preferred course, but if we do—I urge my crossbench colleagues: for goodness sakes, do not do what the ALP and the Greens did in the previous parliament when they rushed things through and gagged debate. We need to have a decent debate on this. That is what this parliament is about. We have a job here to hold the executive arm of government to account. We owe that to the people of Australia.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,BILLS,7,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-07-07,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:09):  This is a matter which brought me to politics in the first place, so I am very pleased to speak on these bills today. As much as Senator Abetz would like us to believe that the Australian government has a mandate to bash these bills through without comment, I would remind him that the Australian people have seen fit to hang the numbers in this chamber; that we have the largest ever assembly of crossbenchers, people who have not yet had time to read the bills, let alone critique them and come to an informed view, which is why we engage in committee processes in the first place; and that although Mr Abbott does control the numbers in the House of Representatives—which is why we have seen debate there approach the proportions of a sham—the Senate works very differently and thank goodness it does. We have the most diverse upper house probably in the history of the Federation and, given the importance of the bills we are dealing with, the very least we could do is pay the committee the respect it deserves and give it the time to produce and table its report. 


I will be very clear: this is one bill on which I have made up my mind. The most important issue facing this parliament today and facing other parliaments and assemblies around the world is what kind of policy we bring into the age of climate change. We have committed ourselves already to dangerous climate change and to dangerous degrees of global warming. The question now is whether we plunge on and commit ourselves and our children to catastrophic climate change, where societies' ability to adapt to what is coming down the line will be overwhelmed. 


We have also heard Senator Abetz and others on the government benches adopting this very thin veneer of pretending to care about climate change, but the cat was let out of the bag by the fact that they are still happy and content to adopt a five per cent target, which is so brazenly at odds with what the scientific community has been telling us for decades. It should be treated as no more than a sham. That is why the government's direct action policy should be seen for what it is: a policy designed by people who could not care less whether or not it works because, through some strange artefact, the government appears to have decided that what the weather is doing at the moment is some kind of socialist conspiracy.


How utterly bizarre! How could otherwise intelligent, reasonable legislators, educated people, somehow bring themselves to believe that NASA, CSIRO, the Hadley Centre and the Bureau of Meteorology have got it wrong and Lord Monckton somehow got it right? I should not address him as a lord. The House of Lords have asked that he not be addressed as a lord, so I will not. They believe that somehow people like Andrew Bolt have got it right and that the global science community have somehow become engaged and enmeshed in a socialist conspiracy? What are you people huffing in your party room, if that is where you have got to? 


These acts should stand. The government would rip $18 billion out of the economy—out of direct transfers to vulnerable Australians, out of energy efficiency throughout the business community and out of changes to the tax scales to protect people who can least afford increases in electricity prices. Bear in mind that the overall impact, more or less, is as Treasury predicted: equal to about a third of the cost impact of the GST when it was introduced. Those who were unable to pay for that were compensated—indeed, as Senator Milne reminds us, were overcompensated.


Even more importantly, the carbon tax would transfer some of that money from dirty industry to the clean energy industries of the future. The package was not perfect but it is a lot better than what this current government proposes to do, which is simply to throw a wrecking ball through it. You will be throwing a wrecking ball through Australian industry. While those on the other side of the chamber bemoan the demise of manufacturing in this country, they are setting out to systematically sabotage the clean energy sector, which has extraordinary manufacturing potential for Australia, particularly for my state of WA, which has been dubbed 'the Saudi Arabia of sunlight'. All this shows that the government simply cannot be taken seriously.


This is policy designed by people who have managed to persuade themselves that the most serious public policy issue facing this country in the 21st century simply does not exist. How nice that must be for you, to wake up in the morning simply believing that it is not there, it is just not true and it is just not happening. You wake up, you tighten that blindfold around your eyes and you come into parliament to try to persuade the rest of the country that, simply because you have deluded yourselves into believing this is not real, we should believe it and go that way as well. It is real and it is, indeed, an uncomfortable and an inconvenient truth. But it is the truth. You cannot argue with the weather; you cannot debate the composition of the atmosphere.


You bring forward these repeal bills. However, the Australian Greens are of the view that they should be debated and that the committee should be allowed to report. We are strongly of the view that the new crossbenchers and the other senators on the back bench of the Labor and Liberal-National parties should be given the opportunity, given the gravity of these measures, to read the bills and to analyse exactly what it is that you are proposing to do, to form a considered view and then, I would hope, to consign these repeal bills to the dustbin of history. As Senator Milne mentioned previously, people will be looking back at these debates. They will be asking how on earth Australia became the first and only industrialised country in the world to roll back a functional carbon price instrument.


I am a little tired of being accused of being a socialist for being one of the ones promoting a flexible pricing instrument to deal with this public policy question. That is straight out of the Karl Marx playbook—that you would have a market instrument to sort out the most efficient and most rapid way of restructuring electricity markets around the country, driving industry and householders towards more efficient consumption of energy, thereby lowering electricity bills and eventually eliminating them when the renewable energy infrastructure is completely in place. You have somehow established in your own minds that a floating market instrument as one component of public policy for dealing with this issue is somehow a socialist initiative. How utterly bizarre. You have completely taken leave of reality.


That is not the only thing: the Australian Greens believe that one of the most important components of the clean energy package, which the coalition also proposes to wreck, is the construction of and investment in the next generation of renewable energy power stations, such as solar thermal plants. Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Wright were buoyed over recent days with the announcement that Alinta, themselves a very substantial fossil player, are now undertaking a feasibility study into converting a section of South Australia's power grid into a dedicated solar thermal plant. That fires the starting gun for me. I think we are going to beat you, Senator Wright. I think the goldfields in WA will be the first to get one of those built. We look forward to the competition.



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Waters might like to step up for the western part of Queensland. Our continent is drenched in sunlight and this is the fuel for the power stations of the future. You can try to roll it back all you like and maybe you—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—will be successful today, Senator Abetz. Maybe you will succeed through these procedural shenanigans to have these bills brought on and rammed through. But I do not think you are aware of just how rapidly the electricity sector is changing. What has been posed as this so-called death spiral of the black-power generators in the network business, at least on the east coast of Australia, is in fact the sign of an industry being born, an industry that we desperately need to perform and outperform expectations, as it has been doing.


You can sit there and study your repeal bills. You can craft your speeches about toxic taxes and rehearse the same tired talking points that got you through last September because people genuinely believed your campaign of fearmongering—that Whyalla would be wiped off the map, that people would be priced out of their homes and that electricity bills would go through the roof. None of it happened. That is why it did not work when it came to the Western Australian by-election. The talking points no longer worked. The stale lines that you were rolling out meant that the combined vote of the coalition collapsed by another five per cent. It was not a glitch, not the kind of bump that always happens in by-elections. It was the continuation of a long-term decline in the Liberal Party vote. It was 50 per cent of the Western Australian vote a decade ago. Now it is 34. And we knocked another five per cent off you while you were out there flailing your arms about, talking about the toxic carbon tax. The Greens recorded their strongest ever vote in Western Australia in the Senate.


The reason it is not working anymore is that the fear campaign was exposed as hollow. Whyalla is still chugging along pretty nicely. Alinta is now proposing solar thermal in South Australia. The off-grid miners are first in the queue in Western Australia to eliminate their diesel fuel bills and their gas bills by building solar plants at their mining operations. The politics have changed, the policy has changed and the air is warming around us.


All I can do is urge the crossbenchers to join with the Greens in opposing this motion, in taking time and giving these bills due consideration because, in my view, there will not be a more important set of bills that we deal with, certainly not in this term of parliament. We cannot be the first country in the world to roll back a functional carbon price that is actually changing the structure of electricity markets, at least on the east coast. It is driving down emissions in the electricity sector and we are finally seeing that economic tipping point of the next generation of renewable energy technology and the increasing economic advantages of eliminating your fuel bills—coal, gas and oil. The penny is finally dropping that that revolution is here.


If you think you can hold that back with these votes today, you are mistaken. Maybe you will manage to cost us five years, as Australian industry slips further backwards down the curve, outcompeted by the United States, the Chinese and the Middle East—they also have a fair amount of sunlight there. Is that really what you are after? You will not be able to say that you were not warned. You went into this with your eyes open. I look forward to committing to the vote: proper, due consideration of these bills rather than this reckless, headlong rush that you are engaged in on behalf of your donors in the coal, oil and gas industries.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (14:01):  I am aware of the Sydney university research. I am also very well aware that the previous Labor government left us a budget mess, which we are addressing. There have been a range of views expressed relating to the budget since that time. But what is very important for the Senate to note is the very fact that we are having to take tough decisions is because of the previous government's economic mismanagement and the budget mess that they left us. We had an MBS 10 years ago that was costing this nation $8 billion. It is now costing around $19 billion and is projected to cost around $34 billion over the next decade. This government has had to make some tough decisions. There has been a range of commentary about that.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order, which is particularly on direct relevance. The minister has been asked specifically about whether she thinks that the figures quoted in the question are correct. It is not whether she is aware of the University of Sydney process. It is about the specific figures about the cost of two parents and two children and the impact of the GP tax. I would ask you to draw the attention of the minister to the question.



The PRESIDENT:  The minister has got nearly a minute left answer the question. The minister is being relevant.




Senator NASH:
  I indicated that I am aware of the view. I am aware of a range of views when it comes to the budget measures that this government has put in place. For over 50 years, successive governments have recognised the need for a co-payment when it comes to the PBS. We have had something like an 80 per cent blow-out over the last decade in the PBS. The question relates the PBS. The reason we have made—




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I again rise on a point of order on direct relevance. The question is specifically about the figures in the question and about whether they are correct. That is the question.



The PRESIDENT:  The question was broader than just the indication of figures. Senator Nash is being relevant.




Senator NASH:
  As I was indicating to the chamber, over successive governments for nearly 50 years there has been an acknowledgement that there needed to be a co-payment when it comes to the PBS, to ensure that it is sustainable. This government will ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. The budget is going to relate to ensuring that happens.

Senator Wong:
  Mr President, on a point of order: the fact that the word 'aware' is in part of a question does not mean that the minister can simply say, 'I am aware of everything,' and then not answer the question. The question is very specifically about a study which shows that the government's GP tax deters the vulnerable from seeking medical care. That is the question that the minister should respond to and that is the question that the minister should be directly relevant to.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. The minister has only been going for 12 seconds in this answer.




Senator NASH:
  I would say that, as with most studies relating to these things, this needs to be taken in context. This government has said that the requirement for a modest contribution when it comes to a co-pay is a necessity to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. Unlike those opposite with a history of waste and mismanagement, which has led to the fact that we have a tough budget, we—

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (14:06):  Isn't it interesting that the shadow Assistant Treasurer actually supports a co-pay? Let me just share this with the chamber:


But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical. 


That is from your shadow Assistant Treasurer.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order again going to relevance. We only have a minute for this particular answer. It is halfway through. We have not got close to the question, which is about the impact on the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. The minister has gone nowhere near it.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Senator Nash is being generally relevant to the portfolio and the question. Senator Nash, you have the call.




Senator NASH:
  The best way those opposite could assist the elderly and indeed all people across Australia is to support this government getting rid of the carbon tax, which is putting such a huge impost on people.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.


I recognise that Senator Cormann is here in his representing capacity; nonetheless, notice was provided to the minister's office and in fact notice was provided to the Senate on 5 May—quite some time ago.




Senator Bushby:
  Mr Deputy President, I believe there is a requirement that notice be given in order to take note.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No, there is no requirement.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President—there is no requirement but, as a courtesy, we do notify ministers that we are going to do this. The fact is, formal notice was submitted on 5 May this year. Questions on notice are meant to be returned within 30 days, and clearly that has not occurred in this instance.


I will go into a little detail about why this question was put on notice in the first place and why it has now become urgent that some answers be provided. The question related to the degree to which state governments and the federal government in particular subsidise the destruction of native forests in the south-west of Western Australia. This is something that has occurred across the eastern states—in eucalypt forests in Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria—and very clearly in Western Australia as well. Not only are we flattening precious ecosystems but taxpayers are funding it. In Western Australia, vast amounts of timber are woodchipped and sent offshore to be pulped, to be brought back into Western Australia as paper and other pulp products. In this instance, the timber is sawlogs—I will go into a little bit of detail about them in a moment—from Western Australian forests, principally karri and jarrah, and a large amount of that timber is being used as sleepers. So we are interested to know the degree to which the federal government is providing financial assistance to Western Australia for 'resleepering' of railway lines in WA since 2009, because it appears that potentially a very large fraction of that sawn timber winds up in publicly-subsidised hardwood timber sleepers for Western Australian railway lines. It is particularly ironic that I have to be raising this issue today, given the closure of the Tier 3 grain rail lines in Western Australia.


It appears that WA has already exported more than 85,000 tonnes of karri as woodchips this year. This is extraordinary natural heritage being thrown into chip-mills and exported as a low-value woodchip cargo. Earlier this year, I visited the Challar Forest in the South West, 50 or 60 kilometres south of Manjimup. I met with campaigners down there who had spent months doing what they could to protect those forest ecosystems. I was winched up a 40-metre karri tree, which they estimated was somewhere between 300 and 400 years old, to sit for a brief period of time with one of the campaigners who had spent the morning there. Western Australian citizens should not have to put themselves in the way of logging equipment and earthmoving equipment in order to protect these priceless ecosystems—but thank goodness they are! They gave me a very brief tour of the extraordinary devastation that had been inflicted already in the coops around the Challar Forest that they were seeking to protect: areas that had been scrub-rolled, which means that the underbrush and the understorey had been smashed into the ground, in preparation for fallers to come in and remove the largest trees.


The fact is—as a result of the Gallop government, with the strong support of the Greens and the community, ending large-scale clear-felling in native forests in Western Australia after 2001—that that so-called clear-felling no longer occurs. But I can tell you that the destruction and the waste that is still occurring in Australia's native forests is absolutely unbelievable. The idea that you would take a 600-year-old karri tree, a tree three times the age of the city of Perth, and feed it into a chip-mill because it had a small amount of rot in the heartwood is utterly obscene. The fact that we are still conducting this carnage in our native forests is completely indefensible. The idea that we would be publicly subsidising that destruction is abhorrent to the majority of Western Australians. The question that I put to the Assistant Treasurer, or to the minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, as the portfolio was later transferred—that is, question No. 621, was simply: to what degree are we actually subsidising this carnage in our native forests?


On jarrah, we know that the state government sells a couple of hundred thousand tonnes a year, and that just 17 per cent of that is sawn timber—that is, something that you can hold in your hand—and the rest of it is fed into a chipper. Last year, 370,000 tonnes of jarrah logs were sold—which is a reasonably typical year—from Western Australian forests. Of that, only 17 per cent was sawn timber and the rest was charcoal, firewood or waste at the mills. Of that 17 per cent, a significant proportion was railway sleepers; we do not know the exact number. That was the purpose of putting that question to the minister. We know in relation to railway sleepers going interstate and overseas that the state government spent around $1 million buying them from major mills—at the same time as they are closing down or scaling back the Tier 3 grain railway lines. So the demand is falling, even as the state government is throwing more money at 'sleepering'. We want to know how many; where they are going; in what volumes; who the customers are; and exactly how much Western Australian and Australian taxpayers are paying to subsidise that process. Obviously, the reason that it is being subsidised is that the business case is dead. It simply does not stack up as a commercial proposition. We also understand that a lot of pole logs are being exported to China and to other countries, with significant volumes going into sea containers and then on into mills. The jobs and employment argument is absolute nonsense, but I will speak more on that in a moment.


On karri, the majestic tall timber of the South West main belt, only a tiny proportion—12 per cent—ends up as sawn timber, while 85 to 90 per cent of these extraordinary trees are put into chip-mills and exported. It goes through the Diamond Mill in Manjimup and is exported from the port of Bunbury, mostly to Japan for paper products. This year, we believe around 85,000 tonnes has been exported. Some of the karri stays in WA—but again, the purpose of putting these questions in the chamber is that the exact quantities are completely unknown to the public—who are paying for this destruction. We also know that logging is moving much closer to Margaret River, and that there is a very strong sentiment from local people there that they want their forests saved—that their forests are vastly more valuable standing than flattened, as we are seeing around Challar Forest. One of the reasons for this—not that it tends to show up in annual reports, nor does it show up in any state or federal government balance sheet—is the extraordinary range of threatened species that are at risk from the destruction that we are perpetrating in our precious eucalypt forests in WA. Three species of black cockatoos, the woylies, the numbats—all these forest-dependent species are threatened with extinction, the more logging continues to wipe out their habitat. What is the federal government doing to protect these ecosystems? Well, it is proposing to hand back the powers on national environmental law—powers that have been accruing to the Commonwealth over a period of 20 or 30 years—back to the very same state governments which are financing the destruction of these ecosystems and which are, in fact, the proponents of logging down there.


These are the reasons that I was proud to visit the South West earlier this year to launch the Green's Future Forests initiative, which is about getting out of native forest logging once and for all and about transitioning properly—forever—into the plantation estate. Our South West forests are simply to precious to lose. I want to acknowledge and pay my respects to those campaigners and their families who, in some instances, have put their lives on hold for years to protect these ecosystems. It is completely insane that we have environment ministers at state and federal levels who stand back while these ecosystems are being mowed down before our eyes, and that it is up to the community to step up. Thank goodness for people like Mikey and Jess Beckerling, who showed me around the blockade camp at Challar that day and then messaged us only a few weeks later—within days, from recollection, of the by-election in WA—that in fact the fallers had moved away, that the wet season had come, and that it would not be possible to flatten Challar Forest; that we had at least won a reprieve until the forest dries out again later this year. I hope with all my heart that, at that point, the fallers do not move back in again and flatten that precious ecosystem, but if it appears that that is on the cards I will be travelling back down to the South West to lend my support to those members of the Western Australian community who have stepped up where the governments have so dramatically failed to do so.


The initiative that we launched that day—Future Forests for the South West; similar to initiatives that we had announced for the tall forests of the east coast and Tasmania—quite simply says, 'This has to stop.' These towns are running out of forests to chop down. If we want to put a sustainable basis under towns like Manjimup and other timber towns or former timber towns of the South-West, we need to look very carefully at reinvesting in the plantation estate and transitioning out of native forests once and for all. I think one of the promising uses of the plantation estate down there, if we can get proper environmental protection for the South-West forests, will be housing. The idea that you could plug a housing affordability crisis into a manufacturing crisis and a skills crisis in Australia—as well as the climate change crisis and the decline of native forest logging in Western Australia—is the kind of closed-loop thinking that I think we need to progress. 


One of the planks of this platform—if you will pardon the pun—was the comprehensive plantation and farm forestry plan to support a vibrant new timber industry that would support the establishment of a second pine sawmill to improve the utilisation of the softwood resource. One of the most interesting things that is being done, and that I believe should be done—not just with the Western Australian plantation estate but across the country—is new jobs in sustainable forestry for building homes. 


Australia has one of the least affordable housing markets in the Western world. So right now in Western Australia, on a given night, there are nearly 10,000 people experiencing homelessness, and one-quarter of those are under 18 years old. There are 45,800 people on a social housing waiting list, and the overall supply gap of affordable homes in WA is at least 50,000 affordable rental homes. The Greens National Housing Roadmap that we launched last year provides an ambitious plan to fund 214,000 new homes across the country within a decade. In WA that would translate to 21,500 new homes, including, most immediately, providing a roof over the head of those sleeping rough, those people who are homeless in WA; 1,500 new affordable rentals created from currently empty space, through our Convert to Rent program; 12,000 new social housing dwellings; and 7,000 new affordable rentals. What does this have to do with the issues that I am raising around the destruction of irreplaceable forest ecosystems in the South-West? 


We believe there is an enormous potential in a home-grown, WA made, fast-build, sustainable prefab housing industry using the plantation estate. We need a major commitment to an ambitious building program. Where should that come from? The potential of the fast-build prefab housing industry is massive. Should we be bringing these kits in in flat packs from China or should we be constructing this material at home in WA? Modern prefab homes look like conventionally built homes, they are cheaper, they are faster to build, they are far more energy and water efficient and have vastly less building waste. Why would that material not be made out of sustainably grown timber from the South-West of Western Australia? 


In suburban Perth, a one-bedroom house can be delivered in just 14 weeks from the time of order of delivery to the time it is placed on site. It effectively uses a lot of the skills—the design, engineering and manufacturing skills—of people who are falling out of the auto industry, which is in crisis on the east coast. We do not have a car industry in Western Australia. There are similar skills. There is a production line. The kits go in at one end and houses come out the other, and then they are simply assembled on site in a matter of hours or days. It is not simply detached housing. In Richmond, in Melbourne, for example, there is an eight-storey apartment block that was assembled in 11 days. That is the kind of manufacturing innovation that we believe Australia needs, and it should be coming from the sustainable plantation estate in forests like those of the South-West. This is the kind of creative thinking that the Australian Greens are bringing to the debate, not just about housing affordability but also about protection of native forests. We can have the jobs, we can protect irreplaceable native forest ecosystems and we can make vastly better use of the plantation estate. We cannot do that without intelligible information such as that that we have requested from the minister's office and that they have so spectacularly failed to provide to the Senate today. 


I look forward to the next time Senator Cormann comes in here and hopefully provides us with a bit of information about the degree to which taxpayers are subsidising the destruction of native forest ecosystems. When the time comes and the door opens for alternative employment, alternative manufacturing and alternative skills development based on the plantation estate, the Greens are here with some creative ideas of our own.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:19):  Mr Deputy President Marshall, congratulations on your appointment.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  If any of the new senators or anyone who might be listening to this debate needed any evidence of the hypocrisy of the Greens political party, they have just heard it. Senator Ludlam gave a magnificent speech this morning about how he was offering himself for the position as the President of the Senate because he did not want the crossbenchers to be ignored. Why was that? Because it was a government senator who was being nominated for the President of the Senate. But, when it came to your position, Mr Deputy President—the deputy's job—did the Greens have the same high-sounding principles about giving the Senate the opportunity of voting for a crossbench senator? No, of course Senator Ludlam did not. Why? Because there is no difference between the Greens political party and the Australian Labor Party. Why the Palmer United Party have been put between the ALP and that section of the ALP called the Greens, I will never know, but, if the new President is listening, he should do something about it so that all of the Labor Party can actually sit together. 


I am still waiting for answers to questions of the previous government that were never answered, and I know that the Greens had questions of the previous government that were never answered either. But did they ever embark upon this stunt of spending 15 minutes, when we were on broadcast, when there were a couple of people in the gallery? Did they ever bother about it then? No, because it was the Labor Party, it was their other faction, that was refusing to answer. 



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Ludlam is right. Yes, I think I can count two times in the last six years where they did move such a motion. This is just typical of the Greens political party. If you happened to be listening to Senator Ludlam, you would think, 'Horrors! Native timber in Australia is just about to disappear'. Most of what Senator Ludlam just spoke about is incorrect. For a start, it was Richard Court's Liberal government—much to my disgust—which shut down a lot of sustainable logging in karri and jarrah forests in Western Australia. I was well familiar with the statistics on the logging industry and the forests in Western Australia back earlier in this century. I am not quite so up to date with the statistics at the moment but I can guarantee you—because I have seen the Greens here for a long period—that most of what Senator Ludlam has spoken about in relation to Australia's native forests would be incorrect. 


Australia has an enviable record of sustainable management of our native forests. We have built up that reputation over many years, but the Greens have determined to shut down in this country anything which is productive. That takes jobs away from the workers that I thought the Labor Party were concerned about. I remember a time when—and I pay credit to the CFMEU; wash my mouth out!—the forestry section of the CFMEU had the courage to stand up to the Greens and to the Labor Party to save logging jobs in Tasmania. They knew, as we all knew, that logging in Tasmania was sustainable. 


We have just had the farce of the United Nations group suggesting that some of the forests in Tasmania which have been logged for centuries are now so pristine that they have to be protected. Senator Colbeck, photographically as well as verbally, made the case on why some forests in Tasmania should be delisted. I see Senator McLucas mouthing something here. She well knows the forests on the Atherton Tableland. I can still remember Senator Richardson going up to Ravenshoe and saying, 'These are the pristine forests which have to be saved.' The locals told him, 'Minister, these forests have been logged for 100 years and you are saying they are pristine!' In his book Whatever it takes, former Senator Richardson gave the truth to that campaign, writing that it was all about whatever it took to get the Greens second preferences in the elections in 1990.


I challenge senators to go through most of the facts Senator Ludlam has just related. They would see that, as with most things with the Greens political party, it will be a fabrication, an exaggeration, and this misleading of the Australian public must be brought to account. I was involved in the committee on Northern Australia. The other day we had the Wilderness Society following the Greens political senators around the North, giving them information about various things. Not once did they mention the oil leaking into the Great Barrier Reef. You would think the Greens would have 10 motions before the Senate about oil from ships leaking into the Great Barrier Reef. Did we hear a squeak from the Greens about that? No. And why not? Because the oil leaked from the boat Bob Brown was on doing some sort of campaigning. When Bob Brown's boat leaks oil into the Barrier Reef, it is not something the Greens are too interested in, but when anyone else does it you will have the Greens there in spades.


We were in Weipa the other day, and Senator Waters, to her credit, was asking questions of Rio. She said, 'But you've got all these new boats going through the Barrier Reef and we are campaigning to stop them.' It took about 15 minutes of patient explaining by the Rio executive that there were absolutely no additional boats going through the Barrier Reef, that there were a few extra boats taking bauxite from Weipa but they were going straight to China. I almost felt sorry for Senator Waters, but at least she now has the truth of the matter. This is a motion to taken note of—




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to draw Senator Macdonald's attention to the question before the chair, which has very little to do with any of the stuff he has been going on about. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Ludlam. I will say that the question before the chair is to take note of minister's response. In your contribution you also ranged rather broadly on that subject. It is a debate about that now, and I think Senator Macdonald, for the whole, is responding to some of the matters you raised, but I ask him to keep the question in mind.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. As Senator Ludlam interrupted me, I was about to refer to the fact that this is a motion to take note of the failure to answer a question, notice of which was said to be given to the minister but about which the minister—and he is checking—is unaware. Again, that I have seen as a Greens tactic in the past. It may be that they did give notice this time, but this happens often. It even happened under the former government, I might add, on the one or two occasions when this matter was raised. 


I have finished my conclusion. I do not wish to take the time of the Senate on these matters. I want to take at least five minutes less than Senator Ludlam. I point out that this becomes such a great issue for Senator Ludlam and the Greens now because the coalition is in government, but it is an issue which the Greens never seemed to worry about when, week after week, Labor ministers would take questions on notice in this chamber and never answer them. I think the hypocrisy of the Greens is there for everyone to see.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (15:29):  Congratulations, Deputy President Marshall, on your election to that position. I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to copayments for medical services and to the regulation of financial services.


You would have noticed that Labor senators have been asking Senator Nash questions over many weeks about the impact of the GP tax, the $7 co-payment, and what that means for those using the health system in our country. We will continue to do so because it is important that people understand what this will mean for health consumers in our country. We will also continue to do so because we do not get an explanation or an understanding from either the minister or the government of what this measure will in fact mean. We saw the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, say that the $7 co-payment is just a bit more than the cost of a cup of coffee, a couple of beers. That is not what we are hearing from the health community and health consumers and, again, today we see coverage of the University of Sydney's detailed analysis of what this $7 tax on a GP visit, this $7 tax on diagnostic imaging and this $7 tax on pathology will mean. What will that mean? 


That is why I, again, asked a question today: what does it mean for a woman who finds a lump in her breast? She has to go to the doctor. There will be a GP tax on that visit. She will probably need to go to the doctor twice. She will need an ultrasound and a mammogram. She will need to have an ultrasound biopsy, various blood samples and various pathology. It is ascertained that the cost for just finding out what the lump might be is in the vicinity of $90. But, if she then finds out that this is a positive test, there are a range of costs that that woman will have to cover in order to be treated for breast cancer. Minister Nash did not answer those questions. She provided a couple of answers.


First of all, she said that the GP can make the choice. The GP can decide whether or not to pass on those costs. At the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry last Thursday, we asked various witnesses about the likelihood of GPs making decisions not to pass on those costs. I do not recall anyone saying, 'That'll be fine; the GP practice will just cover those costs.' It will mean that, for every item 23 on the MBS, a 20-minute consultation, the doctor would not only receive $5 less but also lose their bulk-billing incentive. The bulk-billing incentive is paid at the rate of $6 for a regular bulk-billed event in a metropolitan area and it is $9 or $10 in rural areas—there was different evidence on this last Thursday. The doctor will not absorb those costs for a 15- or 20-minute consultation. The doctors have said to us very clearly, 'We can't afford to.' So the bulk-billing incentive that is currently in place to encourage people to bulk-bill will now be paid if the doctor does not bulk-bill. The incentive is now applied if the doctor does not bulk-bill the patient. That is, they get the bulk-billing incentive if they actually require the patient to pay the $7 co-payment.


Senator Nash also said that the reason we have to do this is that the health system is unsustainable and that we cannot keep the health system going with the costs it has at the moment. First of all, the AMA, which is fairly well respected in this place, says, 'Frankly, the health system is absolutely sustainable.' Associate Professor Brian Owler, the President of the AMA, has said very clearly that the cost to the health system as a ratio to GDP has not gone up in any way that should be viewed as alarming. It is about the same as it has been over the years. But let us peel back Senator Nash's claim that we have to make the system sustainable.


Any saving as a result of the application of the GP tax does not go back to the health budget. It will not go back into support health service delivery in this country. It is being creamed off and put into the Future Fund that, one day, may or may not do some medical research. So it is not as though the money is going back into better services, more doctors, more nurses; it is being pulled away.


But the more concerning thing is that people might go to the doctors less. That is my real fear: that people will attend the doctor less because they have not got money in their pocket. (Time expired)

It is good to see a Victorian in the chair after the earlier comments about Tasmanians, even though we are of different persuasions.


What we have seen today and what Senator McLucas referred to in a series of questions is a contrived and confected scare campaign by an opposition that is desperate to find a cause. As Senator Abetz outlined in an answer to a different question, the Labor Party have misled the Australian people by telling them they terminated the carbon tax, by putting out brochures saying that they removed the carbon tax. They do not want to talk about that. They do everything they can to prevent those matters being brought to a vote in the Senate. They do everything they can to prevent the government implementing its agenda, so they try this confected campaign and this confected outrage about changes to Medicare that were announced in the budget.


What is the truth about Australia's health budget? Ten years ago, we spent $8 billion on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. MBS payments cost about $8 billion. Today they are $19 billion and, in a decade, they will be $34 billion. We all know that, as we get better with medical science and, as over the last 10, 20 and 30 years there have been medical treatments for conditions that were not available, our PBS and our medical system costs more because we are treating conditions we previously could not. But we also know that when something in terms of its spending increases by more than the government revenue base or by more than the annual inflation rate, as health spending has done year on year for as long as I have been in this place and indeed much longer under the previous coalition government, it requires each and every year billions of dollars to be reallocated from one government area to another. Because, if spending on health is growing faster than the government revenue base, you need to reduce spending elsewhere in order to maintain that rate of growth or restrain that rate of growth. Or you do what Labor did, which is simply borrow the money.


Growth in health spending per se is not a problem. For the same reason that the Hawke government introduced a co-payment for pharmaceutical benefits for those who had previously had free and unlimited prescriptions, introducing a small contribution from patients to access a service will actually make the health system more sustainable over time. From the confected outrage of those opposite, you would think we were introducing an American-style system where there were serious barriers to access. We have all had the tragedy of cancer in our families, but there are treatments for that that were not available a decade ago, let alone two or three decades ago. Asking people to make a small contribution to access public subsidies in the order of thousands of dollars that can extend and improve the quality of life is not unreasonable. It is done with safety nets. 


I do not understand why it is with this most intimate of things, our own health, this thing that is most important to all of us—and I do believe those opposite share that view, although I do not share their confected outrage at these changes—we should say that we should never ask someone to make a contribution to their own health care. Why is it that when we talk about people going to see a doctor—for example, to access treatment, as in the example earlier of breast cancer—there is moral outrage at a payment to access certain treatments, but when you access pharmaceuticals like Herceptin, if you access life-saving medical treatments, it is okay to ask the patient to make a small payment? Somehow there is moral outrage at a payment for another purpose that will actually treat the same condition. 


The Labor Party are in a desperate search for a campaign. All this government are doing is making the system sustainable in the long term. All this government are doing is saying that we think it is reasonable that people make a small, modest contribution to their own health care—after all, like all Australians, we agree it is so important to all of us.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:39):  Deputy President Marshall, congratulations on your elevation. I rise to take note of the responses of the Assistant Minister for Health to questions asked without notice today. I can inform the Senate, particularly the Assistant Minister for Health, that her response today was once again completely uninformative. The responses we received were once again a repetition of tired and worn-out lines from a minister who seeks to hide from the scrutiny to which this government does not want to be exposed. The assistant minister seems to believe that, if she keeps repeating the same lines over and over, those lines, by the very uttering of them, will somehow protect her from the avalanche of outrage crashing down on this government. But the people of Australia are awake to this government. They have, in the nine months since Mr Abbott assumed the prime ministership, been exposed to the reality of the web of lies that those opposite repeated ad nauseam before the election. Any currency those lines ever had in that election has completely evaporated. Remember, Deputy President, the new Prime Minister Tony Abbott, only 24 hours before the last federal election, on 6 September 2013, said there would be 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS'.


What we heard in the assistant minister's response was weasel words certainly, but weasel words that reveal a determination to push forward with a budget of broken promises to tax the sick. Why are we being subjected to these weasel words? It is because more experts are coming out against this government's policies, and weasel words are all the government have left to sell. They have nothing substantive to say, as each one of their key platforms is quickly being eroded by expert opinion and public sentiment. They keep on the offensive about the former Labor government, but they fail to realise the pain that they are set to cause everyday Australians. The questions addressed to the Assistant Minister for Health today were on that very topic—the pain they are causing, figuratively and literally in this instance.


What we are already seeing and being told by our local doctors all across this country, and indeed by the AMA, is that people are refusing to seek the medical attention that they may need. The fear of being unable to pay this GP tax has Australians running away from their doctors and doctors worried about their patients. Researchers from the University of Sydney are the most recent experts to come out against this tax. They have answered all the questions that the minister continues to refuse to answer. What do we know now? We know that the average patient with type 2 diabetes will be $121.49 worse off each year with this new tax. Patients with worse cases can expect to fork out an additional $150 per year. We can see these examples in other demographics too. 


Some conservative estimates of what average Australian families will have to face include the following. A young family with two parents and two children under 16 years of age will pay $184 more per year on average for care and medications. Today, the minister refused to even acknowledge that fact, simply saying, 'I'm aware there are a range of opinions.' Being aware of a range of opinions does not absolve her of the responsibility for the policies that she wants to implement that are designed to hurt the sickest in our community. Self-funded retirees aged 65-plus years with no Commonwealth concession card will pay an additional $244 per year because of what this government wants to implement. An older couple with concession cards will pay an additional $199 per year on average. The minister might call this a modest contribution, but to the people of New South Wales and in the region where I live that is no modest contribution, and it is a disincentive to seek health care. 


This is not just a single hit on the sick but a sick tax, literally taxing the sickest people in our community every time they need to seek medical care, every time they have a blood test, every time they need some pathology test, every time they need an X-ray or every time they need any other form of diagnostic imaging. Breast cancer fears will be put aside by mothers trying to look after their kids and putting their needs first and the costs of their families ahead of their own care. The chronically ill must be feeling even worse now than they might expect from their illness, as they are subject to the punishments of this bruising and cruel government, punishing them for being sick, punishing them for having an illnesses, punishing them every time they seek health care or diagnosis, punishing them for acquiring a chronic disease or for failing to be born or remain healthy enough and perfect enough to avoid the need to go to the doctor. This is a sick government. It is a sick tax that they are proposing and Labor will be fighting it all the way, to preserve access to Medicare. That is part of the fabric of this country.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:44):  The fundamental question when we debate the GP co-payment, as we are this afternoon, is whether we want Medicare to be sustainable. Fundamentally, the contribution from those opposite, the modern Labor Party, is that they do not want Medicare to be sustainable. All of those who have looked at this in detail over the years, on both sides of politics, and taken the view that we need to make Medicare sustainable have come to the same conclusion. Bob Hawke wanted to make Medicare sustainable, Dr Andrew Leigh wanted to make Medicare sustainable and the coalition government wants to make Medicare sustainable. 


We have heard from Senator Ryan and others about the massive blow-out in costs from 2004 to 2014 and the projected blow-out in costs in another decade from $8 billion to $19 billion to $34 billion. When Andrew Leigh made his comments we were spending around $8 billion. In 2003, he said:


As health researchers have shown, cost-less medical care means that people go to the doctor even when they don't need to, driving up the cost for all of us.


That was Dr Andrew Leigh's position when we were spending less than $8 billion. Dr Leigh had a prescription, and it was the right one. We wouldn't often say that about Dr Leigh, but on this he was correct. He was correct when he came to that conclusion, as was Bob Hawke. So, well before it was blowing out, Bob Hawke and his government identified that they needed to make Medicare sustainable. 


The modern Labor Party are now arguing that in fact Bob Hawke did not support Medicare and they are not prepared to accept that he was trying to save Medicare. He was trying to improve Medicare. He was trying to ensure that the position that Andrew Leigh put—that all of us end up paying more and it becomes unsustainable—was the correct one. 


Well before we saw these kinds of costs, Bob Hawke said: 'It is quite clear, and I understand there is a very significant blow-out with regard to the Medicare situation in terms of servicing. What needs to be done of course is to ensure that both on the supply side and the demand side that there be some restraint imposed because you can't have a situation, Ray, where you are just going have outlays growing as in the rate that they were.' That was true then and it is truer now. What we have seen since then is massive blow-outs in cost—massive blow-outs when Dr Andrew Leigh said it in 2003 and came up with his prescription; and massive blow-outs since then: $8 billion in 2004, $19 billion now and $34 billion projected in 10 years time.


We hear those opposite, Labor senators, claiming that they support Medicare. That position is not sustainable if you do not have a way to make it financially sustainable. If you do not accept people being asked to make a small contribution to their own health care, with safeguards in place for the most vulnerable to a maximum of $70 per year, then you need an alternative prescription. 


As Senator Ryan so eloquently put it, when these costs grow well above inflation and government revenue, then the money has to come from elsewhere, and you cannot just keep borrowing it. Eventually you will have to pay it back. So those of us who believe not in a sustainable budget for its own sake but in a budget that can deliver a sustainable Medicare system, a sustainable NDIS, a sustainable pension system and fund the infrastructure of the 21st century need to come up with ideas of how to fund these things and make them sustainable, and that is what the coalition has done. 


Bob Hawke knew it to be true but eventually got rolled by his own party. Andrew Leigh knows it to be true but he has now had to pretend that he has had a lobotomy since coming into parliament and he no longer believes what he knew to be true just a few years ago. The position put by the Labor Party has no substance. It needs to be rejected. That is why things like a co-payment are important. (Time expired)

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:51):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann during question time today—and what a day it has been! With apologies to President Obama, today we have seen the government in the Senate acting with the audacity of hope. Over the past few hours we have witnessed the government's audacity in trying to ram through the repeal of the carbon tax legislation without debate. During question time, we finally got to hear the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann—the still acting Assistant Treasurer—admit that the government has audaciously introduced changes to Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms to remove basic consumer protections, in the dead of the night, at the eleventh hour, in an audacious attempt to subvert the parliamentary process and avoid the scrutiny of the Senate. There has been an attempt to ram through changes making it easier for the likes of Storm, Trio, Timbercorp, Great Southern and—as we heard again just 10 days ago—the Commonwealth Bank's shonky financial planning arm to rip off ordinary Australians. The government has the audacity to hope that they are going to get away with it. On 30 June, hours before their own 1 July deadline, they promised the big banks, AMP and a handful of dodgy financial planners that give the good financial planners a bad name, that they would keep their promise to them. While they were prepared to break promises to working Australians—promises about the ABC, promises about Medicare and promises about SBS—they insisted that they needed to keep a promise to the big banks and to a handful of dodgy financial planners and audaciously introduced these changes by regulation, without the confidence or the guts to bring proper legislation into this place.


In today's Financial Review,Phil Coorey asked Mr Clive Palmer, the member for Fairfax, what he thought about Mr Cormann's audacious act. For the benefit of those opposite, I will quote the response the member for Fairfax gave Mr Coorey. The member for Fairfax said:


They can stick it up their arse—and you can quote me on that.


How can you have advisers not acting in people's best interests?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Simply quoting unparliamentary language does not make it parliamentary, and I would ask you to withdraw. I would also ask you to be mindful of the standing orders.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I withdraw. I was of the opinion that I was quoting a member of the other place. But I could not agree more with the sentiment that was expressed earlier today by Mr Palmer, the member for Fairfax. I think he captured the sentiments of people who had been fleeced, who had been mugged and who had been ripped off before the FoFA changes were introduced.


Senator Cormann's audacious act in the dead of night will take Australia back to the bad old days. He has removed the best interests duty by removing the list of the steps a planner must take to legally meet the best interests duty. He has introduced new exemptions allowing for conflicted remuneration—allowing payment of conflicted remuneration and commissions for advice on complex products. These exemptions will see a return to the sales culture—and those across the chamber know it. These exemptions will see the return of conflicted remuneration, allowing payment of unlimited incentives and bonuses based on sales and revenue targets and removing any requirement to disclose these incentives.


Senator Cormann's reforms will allow commissions on execution services, extend grandfathering provisions so that these commissions can be traded, extend the already broad exemption for basic banking products so that it applies to all staff and remove the opt-in requirement, bringing back trailing fees. We will not allow Senator Cormann's audacity to roll back basic protections for Australian consumers, and nor should this Senate.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:30):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and congratulations on your appointment today. I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The actions of the Minister for Employment in making the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines Repeal Instrument 2014 which repeal the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines 2012 and slash the wages of cleaners covered by Commonwealth contracts.




Senator LINES:
  I rise to speak about the plight of cleaners and the actual impact on cleaners of the guidelines that Senator Abetz refuses to take responsibility for in this place. In question time today Senator Abetz tried to put the responsibility for cutting cleaners wages by $5 an hour onto the Fair Work Commission. But the truth is Senator Abetz himself has cut the wages of cleaners. There is no way of getting around that; it is not Fair Work, it is not anyone else—it is Senator Abetz who has made the decision to cut the wages of cleaners, and he has done that very early on as the Minister for Employment. In fact, really, he is the 'minister for unemployment' for cutting the wages of cleaners in such a harsh and cruel way.


Senator Abetz has made this decision, saying it is something about red tape. There is no red tape involved in cutting cleaners' wages by $5 an hour. Clearly the minister does not understand what was put in place by Labor. The minister said on the Insiders that he wants a level playing field. That is exactly what Labor put in place—a level playing field. Labor said, if you are a contractor—and in this case a contractor cleaning company bidding for Commonwealth work—then there is a rate of pay that needs to be paid, there are a set of conditions that need to be adhered to, and there is a work rate which has been thoroughly investigated and set. What that did was ensure that cleaners, who might work in the same building for 30 years but have five or six different employers, did not go from contract to contract facing this uncertainty. What was happening before Labor put in place the level playing field was that, at contract change, cleaners did not know even if they had a job. So every time a contract changed—every couple of years—cleaners faced the prospect of having no employment and of finding themselves on the scrap heap of unemployment. Labor fixed that through the guidelines.


The second thing Labor did was take their wages out of competition, because one of the other things that contractors used to be able to compete around was whether they paid the award for cleaners, which is around $18 an hour, or whether there was an enterprise agreement in place. Labor said, 'No, if we are going to have an even playing field, then cleaners deserve to have the same hourly rate—not to have their wages go up or down or indeed be out of work every time somebody else, not the cleaners but a government bureaucrat, makes a decision to change a contract.'


Labor also put in place a fair work rate because, when cleaners were kept on by the contractor, they would be told suddenly that their cleaning area had doubled. Obviously that is not fair. Labor amended all of that and put into place a set of guidelines that said, 'If you are contracting for government work in government buildings there is a certain standard.' Minister Abetz has come along and just slashed that. There is no red tape about this. This is ideological hatred of workers in this country. He demonstrates it day after day in this chamber. Standing here today in response to questions put to him on behalf of Labor, asking him why he did that, he tried to shift the blame to the Fair Work Commission.


The Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn is so concerned about this that yesterday he raised this in the media. In fact, he has called cleaners 'the new battlers'. Senator Abetz rubbished him as well and said that he did not know the full story. Well, the test is coming, Senator Abetz, because on 1 October the Garrison Support contract will change. Those cleaners currently have their rate of pay, their right to continue to work, their conditions of employment and their workload set by Labor under Labor's standards under those guidelines. Those guidelines were slashed and burned by Senator Abetz a couple of weeks ago. So Senator Abetz said to those 50-odd cleaners at Garrison Support: 'I don't care about you. I'm going to hide behind the Fair Work Commission and red tape and I'm going to slash your pay.' That is the detail underpinning that quick signature that Senator Abetz sneakily put on a piece of paper a couple of weeks ago. He has absolutely directly—no-one else is responsible for this but Senator Abetz—threatened the ongoing employment of those cleaners at Garrison Support.


So that is their first issue. Do they have a job on 2 October? If they have a job, will they have lost more than $100 a week in pay? The new contractor coming in under Senator Abetz's new guideline can just take their current pay and drop them back to the award, no questions asked—'If you want the job, this is the rate you sign for.' We have all been there before in the old Work Choices days. Senator Abetz has threatened their employment. If they are given a job, they could be asked to sign at the lower rate. In addition to that, they could have their hours cut, their conditions cut or their workload increased. For those cleaners at Garrison Support what the minister has done has absolutely guaranteed they have no certainty about the future.


And good on the Archbishop for Canberra and Goulburn for speaking out, because it is not okay to take $170-odd away from cleaners who work full time. They have bills to pay. They have families to feed. All of those 50-odd cleaners at Garrison Support are facing that real threat on 2 October.


The other person I would like to talk about is Chris Wagland, a long-term cleaner in government contracts. She has worked in a Defence building for about 30 years. She lost her job previously under John Howard and his harsh Work Choices laws. Chris, despite fronting up to work every day in the Commonwealth building and doing a great job raising a family with boys in high school and so on, refused to sign an Australian workplace agreement and—guess what—was sacked. Chris is back there now; but, again, once her contract comes up, she is facing uncertainty. Will she lose her job? Will her hourly rate be cut? What will happen to her workload? In the 30 years that Chris Wagland has worked at that Defence contract building she has had five or six different employers. It is the same building, same cleaning and same staff she probably interacts with every day of the week, and yet on five occasions her job has been threatened, her livelihood has been threatened and she has also been sacked.


So Chris was one of the cleaners who was very excited when Labor signed these Fair Work principles, and what she is now seeing is same old, same old under this Abbott government. This is a Prime Minister who also on Fairfax radio promised no worker would be worse off under the government led by Mr Tony Abbott. Guess what? Here we have 50 low-paid cleaners—and, when you walk into a government building, they will be the lowest paid people there. Two weeks ago Senator Abetz sneakily—he did not tell anyone or signal he was going to do it—cut their rate of pay. There is no getting around this. There is no trying to blame Fair Work. The blame for this rests fairly and squarely with Senator Abetz. Those 50 cleaners at Garrison Support on 2 October will not know whether they have a job, what their hours of work will be, what their rate of pay will be or what their work rate will be, and that responsibility rests fairly and squarely with the 'minister for unemployment'. That is what he is really doing. Responsibility for their welfare and their future rests with Senator Abetz.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (16:41):  I start by disabusing those listening: no-one has had a pay cut. This is a dishonest campaign being run by the ALP.




Senator Wong:
  It's a future pay cut, so that makes it all okay! Tell the truth for a change, Connie.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  True to form, Senator Lines, Senator Wong and all of you across there never let the facts get in the way of a false and misleading scare campaign that the ALP is running in this instance. So let me tell the Senate and remind those opposite of the facts.


These are the facts. As part of repeal day the coalition government revoked the Fair Work principles and the associated Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines with effect from 1 July 2014—




Senator Lines:
  And cut cleaners' pay. That's what you did.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Lines, if instead of trouting on you just sat there and listened, you might learn something.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order! Senator Fierravanti-Wells, direct your comments through the chair, please.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Every day, we are working to implement our economic action plan. That Australia is open for business is a key part of that economic action strategy. We are determined on this matter, and that is why we are cutting the regulatory burden. It is why on the first red tape repeal day we scrapped 10,500 unnecessary regulations and laws, saving $700 million a year. It is why we have taken the action we have in revoking the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines.


The former government created the Fair Work principles for cleaning service providers, which make them subject to additional workplace relations rules that are outside the mainstream workplace relations and procurement framework. These were created as a concession to United Voice—your former union, Senator Lines. United Voice, of course, is a trade union and an amalgam of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union. While the principles were initially brought in by an earlier minister, Bill Shorten as workplace relations minister signed off on updated principles and guidelines in 2012. These ad hoc arrangements created by Labor create confusing and cumbersome red tape for suppliers. There is no reason to create different rules for businesses that want to supply the government. Workplace relations laws, the modern award system and the Fair Work Ombudsman—the government regulator—already provide strong safeguards. There is no reason to have different rules just because a cleaner is working in a certain type of government office in a specific location. As I have said, workplace relations laws, the modern award system and the Fair Work Ombudsman already provide strong safeguards for all cleaners, no matter where they work.


These guidelines were not about pay. They were about a leg-up to the union. We know this, because the guidelines were all about giving the unions access to the cleaning-room floors. The guidelines required employees to be provided with information by union officials about joining a union, contained a requirement that union delegates attend all staff inductions, and scheduled employee meetings with union officials.


The Cleaning Services Guidelines only applied to cleaners in some government buildings in some parts of capital cities. There is no immediate pay cut. Existing employment contracts continue to apply. Suppliers to government will continue to be required to certify that they comply with all the laws and policies of the Commonwealth, including the Fair Work Act. The guidelines do not impact on all the industry, as has been suggested.


As Senator Abetz has highlighted, there is unfairness in the current system, which was put in place by the former Labor government. How is it fair that cleaners who clean the Comcare building in Canberra are to be paid more than cleaners who clean the Comcare offices anywhere else in Australia? I understand that it does not stop there. In my own state of New South Wales, cleaners of Commonwealth offices in Penrith are paid a different rate than the cleaners in Parramatta. This is not fair and it is not reasonable. Nobody in the Labor Party can explain why the same class of worker is treated differently. This government has said quite clearly that there should be a level playing field.


Let me give another example. The guidelines create benefits for one subset of cleaners—those who happen to work in a building where the government is the contractor, in certain parts of capital cities—Chatswood, but not Campbelltown; Parramatta, but not Penrith. How is this fair? How is this equitable? Cleaners currently working in government offices will not be subject to a pay cut, and claims to the contrary are wrong. The terms and conditions of current employment contracts continue to apply by law until those contracts expire or are renegotiated, whether those contracts are enterprise agreements or other contracts for above-award rates of pay. Beyond that time, employers and employees have the flexibility to negotiate above-award pay rates in the future, should they so wish.


The present guidelines create inequitable benefits and obligations. A cleaner in the same building and in the same location, but occupied by the private sector, would have different rates and conditions. The general provisions of the fair work principles, which, for example, require a declaration of compliance with the Fair Work Act 2009 add no value. Government procurement policies and processes already require decision makers to ensure tenderers comply with the laws and policies of the Commonwealth.


The Fair Work Ombudsman is the correct regulator to ensure all workers receive their correct legal entitlements. The Fair Work Ombudsman will further increase its education and compliance activity in relation to the cleaning services. The guidelines did not impact on all of the cleaning services industry, as may have been suggested. The guidelines created benefits for one subset of cleaners: those who happened to work in a building where the government is the contractor, in certain parts of capital cities. There were only ever around 25 cleaning contracts that were subject to the guidelines, representing a tiny proportion of the total industry and a very small proportion of total government cleaning contracts.


Prior to the introduction of the guidelines there were at least 65 contracts with government agencies that included the higher rates of pay and other conditions. Agencies continue to have that flexibility, and to consider a range of quality as well as price factors when awarding tenders. That is as it should be. We want to give business a leg-up, have less red tape in the way of doing business, and less intrusion into how they operate businesses. In that way we help business help Australia to build a strong and prosperous economy, to create more jobs and more growth for the betterment of all Australians—all Australians, not just the favoured few protected by the unions, like United Voice, that enjoyed the patronage of the previous government.


I reiterate that this is a dishonest campaign that is being run by the Labor Party. The facts should prevail, and not the scare campaign.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:49):  Dishonesty is clearly in the eye of the beholder, it seems to me. It is hard to know who the Abbott government holds in more contempt—this parliament or the cleaners who clean it. No doubt the true answer is that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Senator Eric Abetz, hold them in equal contempt. How the Prime Minister and Senator Abetz have treated cleaners and the Senate has been widely described as shoddy, secretive, dishonest, sneaky, low and underhanded. In fact, it seems to me these descriptions perfectly apply to what we are seeing of the Abbott government as a whole when it comes to the budget and to the information available about asylum seekers. Now it is increasingly evident that this is how they are treating the Australian public and how they have treated the Senate in relation to this cleaning issue.




First the Prime Minister promised not to cut the pay of cleaners. Then, breaking his word, he and Senator Abetz sneaked through these changes, buried in the 9,500 regulations to go under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's so-called 'red tape repeal day', on Wednesday. Buried in more than 50,000 pages of regulations and acts of parliament to be scrapped was the revelation that from 1 July the government would abolish the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines for cleaners employed on government contracts.




In the last sitting period the Senate rightly voted to protect the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines, which ensure fair pay and working conditions for cleaners working in Commonwealth buildings. However, in another low point for this government, Senator Abetz secretly moved to abolish the guidelines and rip away more than 20 per cent of the cleaners' wages by reducing their minimum wage from $22.02 per hour to $17.49 per hour, which can amount to $172 per week.



This appears to be a deliberate attempt by Senator Abetz to subvert the parliamentary process. While the parliament was debating this matter, the government was secretly subverting it. Secrecy and subversion is becoming a hallmark of this government, and so is rank dishonesty. The Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, told parliament on 16 June:


I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that no cleaner's pay is reduced.


But, as he and Senator Abetz know full well, that is not the case. These cleaners, some of the country's lowest paid workers, could lose almost a quarter of their weekly wages under these changes quietly introduced by the Abbott government. Thousands of workers will be hit by the changes, which will strip between $172 and $225 a week from the pockets of full-time contract cleaners who clean government buildings.


The guidelines are a form of collective bargaining that lift the wages of workers working for businesses that win government cleaning contracts by between $4.53 and $5.93 an hour above the minimum wage—and the minimum wage is very minimum. This brings their weekly wage from $664 to $836 for a 38-hour week for level-1 workers and from $724 to $950 a week for level-3 workers. These are not princely sums of money—with the wages we earn in this place we are very aware of that—and there can be no rationale for reducing them further. The Greens believe in fair work, we believe in a fair country and we believe in looking after those people who are on low incomes. Unlike this government, we do not believe in taking from the 'have-nots' and giving to the 'haves'. 


The Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines were established to ensure that the cleaners of government buildings are protected and receive fair pay and working conditions. This was because of the woeful and well-documented history of underpayment, exploitation and unsafe work practices in the cleaning industry. A 2010 Fair Work Ombudsman's audit of cleaning contractors found that 40 per cent of audited businesses did not comply with workplace laws and it recovered almost $500,000 for 934 underpaid workers. But, with those changes being scrapped, cleaners working on government jobs could again be reduced to being paid at the lowly award rate, thus reducing their already low pay of $836 for a 38-hour week to $664. Well, now, what do you know? Senator Abetz is dialling back the clock to reintroduce these conditions for some of the lowest paid people in Australia. In his perverse universe it is those who are already better off who are entitled to extra benefits, tax breaks and advantages, not those who are some of the lowest paid in the country. 


All this is at a time when income and wealth inequality is growing globally and in Australia. The ABS statistics for 2011-12 reveal that the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australian households had a net worth that was 68 times as high as that of the least wealthy 20 per cent, yet we have a government that is intent on reducing those low-paid workers' wages even more.


The Prime Minister knows very well that the removal of the guidelines from 1 July this year will leave cleaners vulnerable to pay cuts when current cleaning contracts expire and government agencies go out to tender. So, in reality, the Prime Minister and Senator Abetz know very well that, despite the Prime Minister's assurance, the government will run open tenders for future cleaning service contracts, with absolutely no specification for above-award wages. It says a lot about the Abbott government that it is moving to cut the already low pay of the very cleaners who are cleaning the offices of the Prime Minister and Senator Abetz. We in this place know the work the cleaners do. We know they are the people we greet as we come in to work at the break of day. We know the value they provide in keeping our offices clean. This is yet another broken promise to add to the Prime Minister's growing list of untruths. The Prime Minister has deceived cleaners and he has deceived the public yet again.


The Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines prescribed minimum hourly base rates of pay. They prevented Australian government agencies from accepting any new tender for cleaning services unless the tenderer agreed to comply with the guidelines, including paying employees no less than the prescribed above-award wage rates. The Greens believe that the removal of the guidelines will encourage future tenderers to bid at only the award rate in order to secure the cleaning contract. This means a return to what always happens to exposed and low-paid workers: cheap is good. It will mean those on the lowest salaries will be exploited.


It is typical of the Abbott government—which only thinks in terms of, 'Is this good for the one per cent?—that, in trying to justify his sneaky repealing of this regulation, he reportedly said that it was costing suppliers $5 million a year. That additional cost put food on the table for some of the lowest paid people in the country. Senator Abetz calls that red tape. The cleaners and their families know that this helps them to make ends meet and makes the difference between living above the poverty line or falling below it. Just like the rest of the Abbott budget, these impending wage cuts will make life harder for the 'have-nots', while the Abbott government are helping make life much easier and better for the 'haves', their one per cent barrackers.


The workers at Parliament House now face the likelihood of a pay cut when the contract is up for renewal. I understand that, at a rally of the hard-pressed cleaners outside parliament to protest these cuts, the United Voice union rightly named the Prime Minister as the winner of its 2014 'golden toilet brush award', which recognises 'the individual, company or organisation that has done least in the past year to give cleaners a fair go'. Not a very meritorious award to win, I would have thought. 


The Greens condemn the repealing of the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines 2012. The Greens condemn the way that these guidelines were repealed, which was low, dishonest and undemocratic. And the Greens condemn the Minister for Employment, Senator Eric Abetz, for doing both, because he was responsible for repealing these guidelines and he was responsible for the way they were repealed. The Greens stand with our cleaners and we will fight for fair pay for those on low incomes. Unlike the Abbott government, who look after their mates, the Greens stand for the 99 per cent in Australia.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  I am absolutely appalled that we have to have a debate in this place about the exploitation of cleaners, some of the poorest workers in this country. They are some of the workers that do some of the dirtiest jobs around this place. They are the workers who keep this place looking fantastic for senators and members as they go about their business. They keep the toilets clean for the public, they keep the toilets clean for the senators, they keep the toilets clean for the Prime Minister and even for Minister Abetz, who is about cutting their wages and conditions.


I listened to Senator Fierravanti-Wells when she was giving her lame excuse for why some of the lowest-paid workers in this country should have their wages cut. She did say that at this moment no-one will have their wages cut. But I have been around industrial relations for many years in this country—27 years a full-time union official—and I know a bit of a con job when I hear it. And we had the con job of all con jobs from the coalition when they stood up here and said, 'No-one will lose out of what we are seeking to do. We are simply trying to remove red tape.'


The coalition's red tape is food on the table for cleaners and their families. The coalition's red tape will simply open up those cleaners to exploitation in the future. We know that because this is simply about opening up those cleaners to exploitation in government establishments, where contractors will come in, try to undercut the rates, try to get the job at the lowest possible rate. Cleaners with any decent rates of pay and conditions at the moment, will have, at the next moment, when they sit down to negotiate their agreement, have their bosses say, 'There is no floor under what we can pay you now; there are no conditions in place. We must cut your wages to remain competitive.'


I have seen it before, and the argument from Senator Fierravanti-Wells that this is about opening Australia up for business is code for opening cleaners up to exploitation. Why should workers on $17 an hour be the workers who are attacked in this parliament? We have seen all these unfair budget positions, where pensioners are getting belted up, where students are getting belted up and where schools and education are losing funding. We have seen all of these unfair government positions, but this has to rank as one of the most unfair positions I have ever seen.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells said that this was outside mainstream industrial relations. Well, I have news for Senator Fierravanti-Wells: for a major employer to say that he, she or that organisation wants a decent underpinning of wages and conditions for contractors who bring workers onto their site is nothing new—absolutely nothing new! There are many workers in weak bargaining positions and there are many workers who do not have the muscle, or the skill or the ability to get a decent rate of pay and conditions. But why should the cleaners in government establishments be amongst the lowest-paid workers in the country when most other workers in here are amongst the highest paid? Why should we create more differentiation between the high-paid people like me and the lowest-paid people, who come in here and clean up after we make the mess? Why should that happen? I just think it is absolutely outrageous—absolutely outrageous! And to run the argument that you cannot do this because it is really a front for the union to sign workers up is probably the worst argument you could put forward.


These are the workers who need union organisation; these are the workers who need support. These are the workers who need to act collectively because they are the workers with the least industrial muscle. It is okay for us, arriving in the big, white Comcar every day, getting chauffeur-driven up here. We get out of the Comcar, we waltz in, we do whatever we like in the office and it is clean the next day. It is cleaned up the next day, and who does that? It is the cleaners. And this government wants them to do that on 17 bucks an hour. I do not think that is fair and I do not think that is reasonable. Senator Fierravanti-Wells, again, used that baseline proposition that the coalition are using for everything, that we have to be economically responsible. Well, sure, you have to be economically responsible but not at the expense of the poorest, most exposed and weakest workers in the country—the cleaners in government establishments.


The government is entitled to put a floor under those payments. The government is entitled to say that cleaners need to be treated with some respect and that cleaners do an important job. If you simply leave it to the market and you let contractors bid against each other as to who can screw their workers to the lowest common denominator, then the wages and conditions of cleaners in government establishments will be amongst the poorest in the country. When you have advisers for the government amongst the highest-paid advisers in the country, when you have frontbenchers and Liberal politicians amongst the highest-paid people in the country and when you have me and Labor people highly paid for the work we do, how can you justify taking away from the lowest-paid workers in the government establishments? There should be a clear and unequivocal position that anyone who works in government is entitled to some respect, some dignity and decent wages and decent conditions, because without decent wages and decent conditions there will be no respect and there will be no dignity.


I challenge any of the coalition members to survive on $17 an hour for two, three or four months—never mind your whole life, like some cleaners have to do!


What is being proposed here is absolutely outrageous and is simply a clear message that Work Choices is on its way back, because that is what this government is about. Many of the same senators who are voting to take away the rights of cleaners are the same senators who voted under John Howard to take away decent rights for workers in this country, to take away their penalty rates, to take away their annual leave loading, to take away all the conditions that they had. The workers were the ones who were left worse off. Those senators do not care about the low pay. 


Government senators only want to look after their mates who are putting money into their election funds, these big, secret funds—the Free Enterprise Foundation and Eight By Five—that are set up by the coalition to finance their election campaigns. The slush funds that the coalition have are funded by some of these cleaning contractors that are going out there and screwing workers to the ground so they can make a profit to put money in the pockets of the coalition for the next election campaign.


This is just unacceptable. It is no wonder the archbishop of Canberra has come out and said that this is unacceptable. It is no wonder these workers' union is saying that this is unacceptable. There is no economic crisis in this country. There were three AAA ratings in this country when the government took office. There is no crisis economically and there is no crisis that would mean that you treat workers like disposable pieces of paper and that you should not give them decent rates of pay, decent rights and some dignity. Twenty-odd bucks an hour is not a lot of money to look after the toilets of the senators across the other side of the chamber.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:09):  Thank you for that instructive effort at class warfare, Senator Cameron. You stand in this place and attack this side of the chamber and the government as if we do not care about low-paid workers. You care more about the spin and the rhetoric, about union memberships and your own slush fund, Senator Cameron, than actually looking at and creating the reform agenda that this nation needs to ensure that our businesses can actually—




Senator Polley:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask that the senator retract those comments defaming the senator on this side. She knows very well what she said. I ask you to ask her to withdraw.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  I was not aware that Senator McKenzie said—




Senator Polley:
  Well, calling, referring—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just a moment, Senator, you have asked me to make a ruling on words that I have not picked up and that you are refusing to repeat. If you care to—




Senator Polley:
  I am quite happy to repeat them. She accused the good senator of having a slush fund. I ask her to withdraw that.




Senator Birmingham:
  On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, the words I heard were the words: 'and your own slush funds, Senator Cameron,' a reference that I took generically to be the Labor Party in general. Indeed, the use of slush funds by unions is being well documented in the media at present—unions that, of course, were run by many of those opposite over the years.




Senator Cameron:
  On the point of order, I am inclined to raise this point of order on exactly the position that Senator Birmingham's has just raised. The issue of slush funds is an issue that the coalition have lost a frontbencher over, in the last period of time.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is no point of order; that is a debating point.




Senator Cameron:
  The issue of slush funds is something that the coalition have—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. That is a debating point. I am inclined to go with the interpretation of Senator Birmingham that there was a generic reference.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you, very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. This government is about ensuring a reform agenda that allows businesses in Canberra and businesses right around our nation, indeed in regional Australia, to be unshackled to increase their productivity. Senator Cameron is quite happy to quote certain economists. I would like to refer the Senate to Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics and Ross Garnaut who both made comments over the weekend about our lack of productivity and how that has the potential to almost halve the growth in our living standards in this nation. So the government is very, very seriously addressing this issue about increasing the productivity of our businesses. The repeal of red tape is a cornerstone of our approach to ensuring that businesses can hire more Australians so that more Australians can get off welfare and into a job and start providing for their families and contributing. It is not an argument about minimum wages; it is about reducing the regulatory burden to Australian businesses.


On our repeal day we did revoke the Fair Work principles and the associated Commonwealth Cleaning Service Guidelines with effect from 1 July 2014. Repeal day was a good day, and I am disappointed that those opposite are not celebrating the fact that we are unshackling businesses in this nation to ensure that they can hire more workers. The best form of welfare is a job, not just for the money it immediately puts into the back pocket of the workers but also for the example it provides for children and the whole family more generally. Repeal day is an important part of the government's deregulation agenda under which we are seeking to cut $1 billion worth of red and green tape each year. We have designated two parliamentary sitting days as repeal days.


Before I go into the benefits of getting rid of red tape to ensure that businesses, including cleaning contractors, can employ more, let us look at the Fair Work principles that were repealed. They were created by the former government to make cleaning service providers subject to additional workplace relations rules that were outside the mainstream workplace relations and procurement framework. They were created, in a sense, as a concession to United Voice. On so many occasions in this chamber in the recent past we have been subjected to the tussle between the Greens and the left wing of the Labor Party for the hearts and minds of United Voice members. 


We remember only too well the other concessions they were given to United Voice, including the $300 million for the Early Years Quality Fund for childcare workers. Who can forget that fabulous arrangement? It was spruiked out there by the then minister as a fund that was going to address the low income and low wages of the child-care workers throughout our nation. But so important were these workers—and the work that they do for families and in educating young people right throughout the nation—to the ALP, that they only set aside enough money for 30 per cent of those lowly paid child-care workers.  Only 30 per cent of them could actually access that fund. 


I notice that those on the other side of the chamber are quite quiet on that front. They are very happy to go out and grab the first day's headlines on the Early Years Quality Fund but not so happy to actually mop up the mess afterwards. Expectations were raised right throughout the sector with parents and, often, with young women, who were sold a pup. They were sold a pup that this fund was actually going to increase their wages. No-one told them that their membership pact with United Voice—their signing-up as part of their wage increase—was a farce. Only 30 per cent of those in long-day-care centres were ever going to be able to access that wage increase. If they want to come in and peddle the stories about broken dreams and promises, I think that those on the opposite side have more than enough game in this area.


It should come as no surprise that the sop to United Voice—I have spoken briefly about that particular slush fund and the ad hoc arrangements—were undone as part of our repeal day measures, which removed the confusing and cumbersome red tape that suppliers of cleaning contracts were subject to. As we know, the Fair Work Ombudsman already provides significant safeguards in the workplace. There is no reason to have different rules just because a cleaner is working in one government office in a specific location. We have a range of mechanisms in place that already provide strong safeguards. It is not fair that different rules should apply for those who are cleaning offices within a government office as opposed to a bank or private enterprise. 


These guidelines were not about pay. As I said earlier, they were about a leg-up for United Voice. The guidelines required that employees be provided with information, by union officials, about joining a union—a free kick, there. The guidelines also had a requirement that union delegates be able to attend all staff inductions—another free kick. And finally, there was the scheduling of employee meetings with union officials. So that is three free kicks to United Voice. I hope it paid off for somebody's pre-selection—that is all I can say.




Senator O'Neill:
  That's so cynical, Senator.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Oh, but so true, Senator O'Neill—so true!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Ignore the interjections.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  I am happy to have that conversation with Senator Lines any time.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKenzie, ignore the interjections and address your comments to the chair.




Senator McKENZIE:
  My apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President. As always, we do not want to let the truth get in the way of a good smear campaign. I think Labor, particularly, has some really great form in this area. They twist the truth. I would like to draw the chamber's attention to another area where the ALP has been out and about—indeed it may even be the same minister as previously, now the shadow minister Kate Ellis. We have seen the ABC's Fact Check on school funding. The smear campaign that the ALP has been conducting about this particular aspect of policy, right throughout the nation, is erroneous. I would like to point Senator O'Neill particularly to check out the ABC Fact Check of Wednesday, 2 July 2014. It is free to a good home. There is some good reading in there. I think she will appreciate being availed of the facts of the smear campaign that the ALP has been conducting on behalf of the AEU over a number of months.


But I have digressed significantly from my outlining of the importance of removing regulatory burden for Australian businesses so they can get on with the business of hiring more Australians and addressing the productivity—the almost bankruptcy—of this country. Why is a deregulation agenda important? It is important because, in the five years from mid-2007, Australia's multifactor productivity declined by nearly three per cent. As I mentioned earlier, Chris Richardson and Ross Garnaut have already made reference to the importance of addressing the productivity issues throughout our economy. 


The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP. We heard so often through the carbon tax debates over the past few years, 'Oh, it is only one per cent', but add all that up and it is people's jobs on the line. To those opposite who deal in vagaries and ideologies, and who do not actually understand the real impact of one per cent on a business's bottom line, it means that it is fewer people that they can employ. At the end of the day, the difference between those on this side of the chamber and those on the other side of the chamber in our views on how best to address the challenges for our nation is that those on this side of the chamber will ensure that we have an economic system that ensures our egalitarian principles—and the principles of equity and fairness that have underpinned this nation for over 100 years—continue, because we will have a sustainable economic position on which to base those policy decisions, unlike the recklessness of those opposite.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:21):  We have just had a senator extolling the virtues of this incredible victory that she is claiming. I want to put on the record the words of James Campbell who, in describing this victory, from the point of view of those in government, said:


The consequences of his victory for the people who clean Commonwealth offices is that from now on instead of having to pay them $22.02 an hour, their bosses will only have to pay them the award of $17.49.


The reality is that it is going to make one awfully big difference to the people that we see cleaning this building. 


I am sure that the people sitting up in the gallery today—if it is their first time to come to the parliament—would understand the symbolic power of this place. There are many people who come here and expect this place to be in great shape. And our cleaners do that. They do an amazing job. In all the places I have worked—including in schools, where the symbolic power of having a clean place for people to work in is important as well—it matters that we have people who do the very important work of cleaning and that we pay them a fair and decent wage. 


We believe that we do important work in this place, and the cleaners who work here are proud to work here. It is my pleasure when arriving at parliament—often early in the morning—to see the cleaners out at the front gallery, the marble hall, cleaning it and preparing it for people to come and visit this great place, our parliament. They deserve a fair wage for the work they do. 


We think we are doing important work in this place, but it may not always be of interest to the media or public. One of the important things being discussed here today relates to 'repeal day'. It was the government's position on repeal day to try to make cutting red tape much more interesting than it really is. They say there are 8,000 unnecessary regulations. This is the work of government. Normal governments get on and do that kind of careful cleaning-up of regulations. We got rid of about 16,000 of them while we were in government, last time, but we did not create a media circus. We did not create a day of stunts. We got on with the important job of repealing things that needed to go. But Tony Abbott's repeal day—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, I would ask you to refer to the Prime Minister by his appropriate title.




Senator O'Neill:
  Sorry, the Prime Minister's repeal day hurt many more people than it helped. We are seeing the consequences of it in this matter of public importance being discussed this afternoon. Included in the 10,000 proposed regulations to be removed by the Liberal government is one in the Australian Jobs Act that requires firms to source local goods and services for major construction projects. Another is in the Therapeutic Goods Act, with the removal of a clause requiring companies to release health warnings about their products. Caught up in this, among many other important pieces of legislation and regulation, was the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines. This is really about a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and those opposite will attack it at every single turn.


These cuts that have been sneakily pushed through mean that Commonwealth cleaners will lose up to $172 per week. One cleaner is on the record as saying that the loss of money will mean that she will not be able to drive to work. So we have this mantra about creating jobs when the government is actually making it impossible for people to get to work, because of the savage cuts coming in through this legislation. It is good that Archbishop Prowse has gone on the record saying that there is a moral dimension here and that a wage is an important part of a job. It is not just having a job, it is being able to live with that job, being able to live on a decent wage. 


The sneaky, disgraceful way in which this regulation has been brought into effect is documented in the paper—the Herald Sun—today. It explains:


But Labor and the Greens were not counting on the Abetz cunning. The Employment Minister accepted the Labor/Greens amendment but before it could come into effect he revoked the regulations. 


This is the type of hidden agenda and sneaky process that we are seeing from this government. It does not want any transparency. It wants to cut cleaners' wages. It wants to hide the fact that it has done it. It wants to hide the fact that it has taken away important legislation and regulation at the cost of ordinary Australians. It is a government that wants to tax people. It is cutting education, it is cutting health and it is cutting wages. The worst days of Work Choices are signalled very clearly by this disgraceful cunning piece of powerful, political play and the people who will pay the cost for it are our good cleaners.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:26):  Here we go again. Another own goal from United Voice. Another exit from the World Cup. Once again they have been exposed for what they are really all about. What has also been exposed is the pandering of the then Labor government to United Voice. There were several other unions, but on this occasion it was United Voice. 


Anybody listening to Senator O'Neill in the last few minutes was invited to think that there has been a reduction in wages. Let me make this clear: cleaners currently working in government offices will not be subject to a pay cut. Claims to the contrary, Senator O'Neill, are wrong. Let me say that to you again: there is no difference in the salaries or wages that these people will enjoy. There is no immediate pay cut. Existing employment contracts will continue to apply. Let me make sure people listening to this exchange, this afternoon, understand this. 


Why do I say it is another own goal for United Voice? I go back to the committee upon which I sat when we looked at the Early Years Quality Fund. This was a time when the then Labor government threw the figure of some $300 million at United Voice to provide some sort of improved wages and conditions—for some people only—in the long-day-care centres. I believe those employed in that sector are entitled to a higher remuneration. But what did we see in the case of United Voice, twisting the arm of the Labor government to spend and waste yet more Australian taxpayers' money? We saw a situation in which $300 million was supplied—but only for a two-year period. 


When I said to the union: 'Should this be successful, who is going to tell this limited number of people who enjoy the increase in wages that it is only for a two-year period?' In their embarrassment they could not and would not answer that question. So we were going to have a scenario in which only those people whose employers had an enterprise bargaining agreement could apply. Remember that most participants in the early-years long-day-care sector were small employers, often families, so they were excluded immediately. We know that only a third of those people were to enjoy any benefit at all, for a limited two-year period.


What has the coalition done in government? It has taken what remains of those Labor funds squandered on United Voice and it has allocated those funds for further training, for everybody in the sector not just for the privileged few who joined up to United Voice. The subject we are discussing today is nothing other than a United Voice membership drive. 


There is no occasion where there will be cuts to wages. There is no occasion where there will be a change in the conditions of employment. But what are we seeing? 


We are seeing the most unusual set of circumstances, promoted by the now Labor opposition, then the government, in which different workers working for the same employer in different cities of Australia will be earning different sums of money. Let me give you a few examples. In the employment portfolio we have examples of confusion in the application of the guidelines. The Department of Employment, and indeed the Fair Work Ombudsman itself, are applying the guidelines in their offices through their cleaning contracts, but they are technically not required to in non-CBD locations. The Fair Work Building and Construction must apply the guidelines in its Melbourne office but not in the Sydney office because in Sydney the building owner provides cleaning services. The last time I looked, I did not think the cost of living in Melbourne was all that much higher than it is in Sydney. Safe Work Australia applies the guidelines only in the Canberra office. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency is located in the CBD, but it does not have to supply these conditions because, again, the structure is serviced by the building owner.


The problem that occurs here is the complete and utter lack of synchrony between workers and members and senators from the Labor side. By that I mean that less than 15 per cent of private sector workers in Australia are members of unions. If the information available to me is correct, more than 90 per cent of federal members and/or senators from the Labor side come from union backgrounds. Less than 15 per cent of workers out there are members of unions and greater than 90 per cent are influencing policy here in this place. That is where the difficulty comes from. It is absolutely and utterly duplicitous for those on the other side to come into this place to talk about pay cuts and the so-called actions of the Minister for Employment. All he has done is apply exactly the same principles that Labor did in government in this particular circumstance. With these inequitable benefits and obligations—circumstances that some cleaners enjoy and others do not—we have a situation where a cleaner in the same building and location, on this occasion is occupied by a private sector company, would receive a different rate of pay and conditions.


Let me remind those listening again that the coalition inherited a $193 billion deficit, racing to that figure again if Labor had continued in government, with $1,000 million a month interest on the debt. That is $100 per working person per month in this country. It is two new primary schools every day. A new primary school every 12 hours is forgone because of the interest we are paying on a debt that Labor created when they had inherited a surplus. You would think that Labor would be embarrassed. You would think that they would never, ever put up such an urgency motion.


Question agreed to.

CLEAN ENERGY LEGISLATION (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]



Today the government reintroduces the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013.


As I said on 12 November 2013, when I introduced this bill for the first time, the Australian people have already voted on this bill.


Now the parliament again gets its chance. The people have spoken.


Now, it's up to this Parliament to show that it's listened.


The Australian people pronounced their judgment against the Carbon Tax: they want it gone and this bill delivers.


It delivers on the Coalition's commitment to the Australian people to scrap this toxic tax.


Madam Speaker, the Budget we delivered recently was tough but visionary. It was about setting the country on a path to long-term structural change.


But, a cornerstone of the Government's plan for a stronger economy built on lower taxes, less regulation and stronger businesses is the repeal of the carbon tax.


The first impact of this bill will be on households whose overall costs will fall around $550 a year on average.


Because of this bill, household electricity bills will be around $200 lower next financial year without the Carbon Tax.


Household gas bills will be around $70 lower next financial year without the Carbon Tax.


Prices for groceries, for household items and for services will also fall because the price of power is embedded in every price in our economy.


This is a bill to reduce the bills of the people of Australia.


When the price of power comes down, Madam Speaker, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be ready to ensure these price reductions are passed on to households and businesses.


But families and pensioners will keep the tax cuts and benefit increases already provided.


The Carbon Tax will go, but the carbon tax compensation will stay so that every Australian should be better off.


Repealing the Carbon Tax will reduce costs for all Australian businesses, every single one of them.


Madam Speaker the previous Government said and argued that only big business paid the Carbon Tax.


That simply wasn't true. Every small business paid the Carbon Tax through higher electricity and gas bills and higher costs for supplies.


As well, Madam Speaker, the Carbon Tax acts as a reverse tariff.


Not only does the Carbon Tax make it more difficult for Australian businesses to compete abroad, it makes it more difficult for domestic businesses to compete at home – because there is no Carbon Tax on imports.


Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax removes over 1,000 pages of primary and subordinate legislation.


Repealing the Carbon Tax cuts the size of the climate change bureaucracy.


So, repealing the Carbon Tax will reduce the cost of living, make jobs more secure and improve the competitive position of our country.


That's what it does: it reduces the cost of living, it makes jobs more secure and improves the competitive position of our country.


Why would anyone be against that, particularly when it's what the Australian people have voted for?


Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax is what the employers and what the jobs providers of our country want now.


The Business Council of Australia ―supports the wind-up of the current carbon pricing mechanism because it places excessive costs on business and households and because (our) carbon charge...is now one of the highest in the world.


The carbon tax has ripped through the economy, hitting schools, hospitals, nursing homes, charities, churches, council swimming pools and community centres.


It has hit each and every group and each and every individual that uses power – and that was always its goal: to make electricity more expensive.


That was the intention of the previous government, to put power prices up because that was their way of reducing carbon emissions.


The intention of the new government is to put power prices down by axing this toxic tax and by using other means to reduce emissions.


By reducing the cost of electricity and gas, we will help to make households better off, workers more secure and our economy stronger.


No one should be in any doubt – the Government is repealing the Carbon Tax in full.


We are doing what we were elected to do.


Others have said they would terminate the Carbon Tax, but they were only renaming it.


Well, Madam Speaker, we are not renaming it. We are abolishing the Carbon Tax in full.


Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax at the end of the financial year provides certainty for business and it simplifies the transition.


It means that this Government will not be proceeding with the previous Government's legislated Carbon Tax increase that would have taken effect from the 1 July.


Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the new Government cannot undo the past, we can only make the future better – and that is what we intend to do.


Madam Speaker, under this Government, the Carbon Tax will not apply from 1 July so there will be no need for further compensation packages.


We will end the merry-go-round of Carbon Tax industry assistance that takes from one pocket and puts less back in the other.


Madam Speaker, we will ensure that the benefits of repealing the Carbon Tax are passed on to consumers.


The ACCC will have further powers to take action against any business that engages in price exploitation in relation to the Carbon Tax repeal.


Penalties of up to $1.1 million for corporations and $220,000 for individuals will apply.


Madam Speaker, it is prudent to do what we reasonably can to reduce carbon emissions.


But we don't believe in ostracising any particular fuel and we don't believe in harming economic growth.


Madam Speaker, climate change is a serious issue and we have strong policies to come into place so that we rest lightly on the planet.


The Government is repealing the Carbon Tax because there is a less complicated and less costly way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—a way that will actually reduce emissions and won't damage the economy.


The Government will scrap the Carbon Tax and then proceed with its Direct Action Plan.


The centrepiece of the Direct Action Plan will be the Emissions Reduction Fund – a market-based mechanism for reducing carbon dioxide emissions; a Fund which provides a powerful and direct additional incentive for businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.


The $2.55 billion Fund will use positive incentives to reduce Australia's emissions and prioritise cost-effective, targeted means to reduce emissions.


It's an incentive-based approach which will support Australian businesses and households to lower their energy costs at the same time as reducing Australia's emissions.


It will see us plant more trees, get more carbon captured in soils, clean up power stations and use smarter technology.


We believe that by the time the 5 per cent reduction kicks in in 2020 we'll have an overall reduction in our emissions of some 22 per cent of 2000 levels off a business as usual model—serious action about a significant problem.


Madam Speaker, the carbon tax is a $9 billion hit on the economy this year alone.


It is a $9 billion hit on jobs, a $9 billion burden on investment and a $9 billion burden on Australia that we just don't need.


This bill gets rid of it.


This bill, Madam Speaker, is the Government's bill to reduce the Australian people's bills and so I commend this bill to the Senate.


TRUE-UP SHORTFALL LEVY (GENERAL) (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


Together, this bill, the True-up Shortfall Levy (Excise) (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013, and the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 ensure that final assistance allocations under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program are accurate so that businesses are not over- or under-allocated assistance in 2013-14. 


This bill imposes a levy which recovers the value of over allocated free carbon units received under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program for the 2013-14 financial year. 


For constitutional reasons, this bill imposes the levy to the extent that it is not a duty of customs or excise.


TRUE-UP SHORTFALL LEVY (EXCISE) (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013[No.2]


Together, this bill, the True-up Shortfall Levy (General) (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013, and the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 will ensure that final assistance allocations under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program are accurate, so that businesses are not over- or under-allocated assistance in 2013-14.


For constitutional reasons, this bill imposes the levy to recover over allocations to the extent that it is a duty of excise.


CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to remove the elements of this act that were legislated by the former government to apply the carbon tax through the fuel tax and excise system.


Importantly, this will reduce the increase in excise-equivalent customs duty on aviation gasoline and aviation jet fuel that represents an equivalent to the carbon tax applied to Australian imports.


Currently, Qantas imposes a carbon price surcharge of between $1.93 and $7.25 per passenger on all domestic flights, depending on the distance travelled. Virgin Australia imposes similar surcharges.


The repeal of the carbon tax will reduce one of the major components of airline costs and enable airlines to pass on a significant saving to travellers.


EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013[No.2]


This bill, which amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921, reduces the increase in excise on aviation gasoline and aviation jet fuel that is applied when an equivalent carbon tax is applied to Australian manufactured fuels.


Around $200 million was raised in 2012-13 by applying the carbon charge to aviation fuel.


This bill will reduce one of the major components of airline costs, which can be passed on to travellers and consumers.


The bill also reduces the act's complexity by removing references and notes associated with the imposition of the carbon tax.


OZONE PROTECTION AND SYNTHETIC GREENHOUSE GAS (IMPORT LEVY) AMENDMENT (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 is one of two bills to repeal the equivalent carbon tax on synthetic greenhouse gases.


These bills are part of the broader legislative package to abolish the carbon tax. This bill amends the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Act 1995 so that importers of synthetic greenhouse gases and products containing those gases will not incur a liability to pay the equivalent carbon tax for synthetic greenhouse gas and equipment imported after 1 July 2014. This will reduce costs for businesses using these gases, including for refrigeration and air conditioning.


OZONE PROTECTION AND SYNTHETIC GREENHOUSE GAS (IMPORT LEVY) (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 provides for an exemption from the equivalent carbon price for the import of bulk synthetic greenhouse gases between 1 April and 30 June 2014 if certain conditions are met.


OZONE PROTECTION AND SYNTHETIC GREENHOUSE GAS (MANUFACTURE LEVY) AMENDMENT(CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 is one of two bills to repeal the equivalent carbon tax on synthetic greenhouse gases. These bills are part of the broader legislative package to abolish the carbon tax.


This bill amends the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Act 1995 so that manufacturers of synthetic greenhouse gases will not incur a liability to pay the equivalent carbon tax for synthetic greenhouse gas manufactured after 1 July 2014. This will reduce costs for businesses using these greenhouse gases, including for refrigeration and air conditioning.


CLEAN ENERGY (INCOME TAX RATES AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates and Other Amendments) Bill 2013 is part of a package of bills to remove the carbon tax.


This bill amends elements of the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011 to repeal the second round of personal income tax cuts due to start on 1 July 2015.


The government understands households will continue to face cost-of-living pressures.


That is why the government is keeping the current carbon tax related personal income tax thresholds and the fortnightly pension and benefit increases. 


In its final budget handed down on 14 May 2013, the former government deferred a second round of personal income tax cuts and booked a $1.5 billion saving over the forward estimates.


But the former government never followed through by legislating this change.


This bill repeals legislated amendments to the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 so that the statutory personal income tax rates and thresholds do not change on 1 July 2015.


This bill also amends the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 to repeal related amendments to the low-income tax offset.


This bill also repeals legislated amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that the related amendments to the low-income tax offset do not take effect on 1 July 2015.


Overall, the repeal of these amendments means that the tax-free threshold will remain at $18,200.


The second personal marginal tax rate will remain at 32.5 per cent. And the maximum value of the low-income tax offset will remain at $445.


This bill legislates the $1.5 billion saving that the former government announced during the 2013-14 budget but never legislated.


A first round of tax cuts to compensate for the introduction of the carbon tax has already been delivered. We will deliver further savings to Australian households of $550 next year with the removal of the carbon tax. In short this is our saving for the Australian people.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (20:52):  I rise to contribute to this debate on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 [No.2] and related bills that are before the Senate. These bills are presented by the government as bills to abolish the carbon tax. However, these bills do much more than terminate the carbon tax. These bills destroy Australia's entire legislative framework for tackling climate change. These bills remove the legislative cap on carbon pollution, an essential principle in ensuring that we meet our 2020 target to reduce Australia's emissions. The bills abolish the entire framework for an emissions trading scheme. It is hard to imagine a more complex national risk management issue than that posed by global warming, yet this government is removing from Australia's climate policy any trace of that world-leading model and replacing it with a token gesture, direct action, a widely criticised, underdeveloped and extremely expensive policy that is doomed to fail. This government cannot or will not deliver the policy solution required for the effective management of climate change. Direct action is a profoundly embarrassing and inadequate alternative to the economic common sense of an emissions trading scheme.


Labor will not support the government's carbon tax repeal bills. Labor's position on these bills is no surprise. It is the position we made clear to the electorate in September and which we have been advocating ever since. That position is to terminate the carbon tax now and move to an emissions trading scheme with a legal cap on carbon pollution, a cap that reduces over time and enables Australia's business community to work out the cheapest, most effective way to operate. At this point I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment along those lines. 


The most effective long-term response to climate change is an emissions trading scheme. It is the model in place or being introduced in Germany, the UK, California, South Africa, China, South Korea. This truth is self-evident and recognised right around the globe, except, it seems, on the Abbott government benches. Labor's amendment to these bills will remove the carbon tax and shift to an emissions trading scheme.


A carbon tax seeks to change behaviour by imposing a price signal that discourages polluters from carbon dioxide pollution without any legal discipline on that behaviour. An emissions trading scheme, however, changes behaviour through the discipline of a legislative cap on pollution. It gives business the ability to trade pollution permits and lets business work out the cheapest way to operate within that national pollution cap. An emissions trading scheme is the cheapest way to achieve this nation's emissions reductions objective because it creates a genuine market. That is why it is so surprising that the Liberal Party does not support a market based mechanism to address carbon pollution.


Labor is committed to putting a cap on pollution via this mechanism of an emissions trading scheme. This emissions trading scheme was what both major parties actually committed to back in 2007 when the Liberals accepted the science of climate change. But if these bills are passed unamended, an emissions trading scheme for Australia will disappear. The Prime Minister will truly get his way in throwing the baby out with the bathwater, with no legislated cap on carbon pollution and no market based mechanism for business to tap into.


The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, issued its latest report—its fifth report—in September last year. In that report the 209 lead authors, supported by more than 600 contributing authors, lifted their level of certainty about the existence of climate change, and its cause by human activity, to 95 per cent. Maurice Newman, the Prime Minister's senior business adviser, tells us in regular opinion pieces in The Australian that the IPCC—those are several hundred leading climate scientists who authored the fifth report—are a fringe group who do not represent the mainstream of scientific opinion. 


This government's suggestion that we should proceed to removing the carbon tax without any substantive policy beyond that is not only irresponsible but dangerous. It is dangerous not only for Australia's economy but also for our international reputation because of the fact that we will not be acting on reducing our carbon pollution.


But let's look at some of the history. The member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, once stated:


The idea that somehow the Liberal Party is opposed to an emissions trading scheme is quite frankly ludicrous.


This highlights how ludicrous some of this debate is right now. The backflips that have occurred in the positions of coalition members are ludicrous. Those opposite have done an about-face for political reasons, but the emissions trading scheme model is still recognised as the cheapest and most effective way to tackle climate change, despite the about-face by government members and senators. The Liberal government is trashing Australia's effort to tackle climate change at exactly the same time as the scientific community is warning that climate change poses a real and serious risk to our precious Australian environment. Labor is committed to putting a cap on pollution through an emissions trading scheme. An emissions trading scheme was what both the major parties committed to, as I mentioned, when the Liberals accepted the science of climate change in 2007.


So, how swiftly things have changed. In July 2009 the now Prime Minister said, 'I am hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science of climate change.' In October 2009 he famously described the science as 'absolute crap'—excuse my language, Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards! And in March 2010 he said:


Now, I don't believe that the science is settled.


In March 2011 he suggested, 'Whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.'


To suggest that climate scientists have not reached a settled view about global warming is simply misleading. The science is settled. It was settled years ago. There is no debate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's most positive assessment of global warming expects the average temperature of the earth to be between 1.1 and 2.9 degrees hotter by the end of this century. A more realistic prediction in line with current levels of consumption is that the weather will be 2.4 to 6.4 degrees hotter, higher than at any time in recorded history.


Even a two-degree climb in average global temperatures could cause crop failures in parts of the world that can least afford to lose their nourishment. The size of deserts will increase, along with the frequency and intensity of wildfires. On average, in the past decade fossil fuel emissions grew at about three times the rate of growth in the 1990s. There is twice as much carbon dioxide trapped in the melting Arctic permafrost as there is already in the earth's atmosphere. It is being released, and its release is speeding up. The melting permafrost is also releasing enormous stores of methane, a greenhouse gas nearly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide.


So we need to listen. We need to listen to these scientists. We need to look at their evidence based findings. We need to listen now not only to the scientists but to the economists who today united in support of a price and a limit on carbon pollution with the release of their open letter. Those economists included Dr Hewson, who said, 'The failure of our generation to act will cost future generations dearly.'


Economist and carbon price pioneer Ross Garnaut has also added his voice to the growing concern of Australia's position on an emissions trading scheme, stating: 


Unless Australia moves from this place, it risks damaging the international effort to reduce the risks of dangerous climate change …


These economists stand in good company with President Obama, who stated that climate change is 'one of the most significant, long-term challenges that the United States and the planet face.' We must understand and then act on this scientific data: the overwhelming global evidence demonstrating that an emissions trading scheme is the cheapest and most effective way of achieving the outcomes we desire for our nation.


So, has Labor's carbon price mechanism been the wrecking ball through the Australian economy that the Prime Minister claimed it would be? Was it the cobra strike at the economy? Did the South Australian town of Whyalla disappear off the map? No, no! The truth is entirely different. The truth of the impact was exactly as Labor predicted. The economy did keep growing. More than 160,000 additional jobs were created in the first 12 months of the carbon price mechanism that, according to the now Prime Minister, was going to have a wrecking-ball impact on the national economy. Also, what Labor's comprehensive policy approach started to do, along with our renewable energy policies, was to drive down carbon pollution, particularly in the electricity market, which is the largest source of carbon pollution in Australia.


We saw a reduction in carbon pollution of around seven per cent in the National Electricity Market in the first 12 months alone. And, as we predicted, there was simply a modest impact on prices. That impact was more than covered through the household assistance package, particularly for low-income and fixed-income households like pensioners and middle-income households. The impact on power prices, again, was exactly as we predicted and, again, was covered by our household assistance package. It also achieved the trebling of Australia's wind capacity and saw solar panels being installed in more than a million households, up from fewer than 7,500 under the Howard years. Employment in the renewable energy industry more than doubled to over 24,000 people and around 150,000 jobs were created. In fact, the economy continues to grow at 2.5 per cent as inflation remains low and pollution in the National Electricity Market is decreasing by seven per cent. Renewable energy technologies are doing well, not only as a new innovative form of industry but also in providing a benefit to the environment, to the community, to our children and to future generations.


I understand that Kirsten Rose, the CEO of the Sustainable Energy Association of Australia, stated, 'We and many of our members believe that an emissions trading scheme—that market mechanism—gives them choices and flexibility in a different way to a direct action plan, which is, effectively, bidding for money to support specific projects.'


The bills also abolish the Climate Change Authority, an independent, strong voice set up to advise the parliament, the government and, perhaps most importantly, the Australian community about the very difficult and highly-contested issues associated with climate change. It is also on the chopping block through this government's approach to climate change. Also on the hit list is ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, an independent agency funded to invest in projects that actually improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia. This continues as an emerging theme of this government: abolishing strong, independent voices and making sure that all advice to the Australian community and to the parliament is filtered, sanitized for political purposes, and fundamentally controlled by the Prime Minister.


As a rich country with a high level of carbon emissions we have a responsibility to reduce our pollution output. Labor has already demonstrated that the balance of sensible, positive actions necessary to reduce carbon pollution, tackle climate change and protect our environmental resources is such an important one. The case that has not been made is one for dismantling many of those measures that we know from the debates in the Senate and other sources have been working well.


This morning I joined my Labor Senate colleagues at the Australian Youth Climate Coalition event outside the front of parliament. There I was reminded about future generations and about the importance of these bills in creating a sustainable future for our young people and for their children to come. Their passion should be echoed right now in this chamber. They want action on climate change. Labor has been and continues to be dedicated to achieving the best possible policy to tackle one of the key challenges of this century. That policy is an emissions trading scheme. By tackling climate change in the most cost-effective way we can support the environment and we can support the renewable industry in Australia; we can see jobs grow; and we can, most importantly, continue to reduce our carbon dioxide pollution and play our part in this global problem that is facing our planet. I move:


   At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate notes:


(a) the scientific and expert consensus regarding climate change;


(b) that, in its first year, the clean energy future package:


      (i) drove a 7 per cent reduction in carbon pollution from electricity generation in the national electricity market;


      (ii) saw renewable energy increase its share of the national electricity market by 25 per cent;


      (iii) delivered the household assistance package to compensate families and individuals for any impact of carbon pricing; and


      (iv) supported continued economic growth, with over 160,000 jobs created in 2012-13 across the economy, including clean energy jobs;


(c) that since the 2013 election Australia's international reputation on climate change action has been damaged by becoming the first nation to move backwards on climate change, while the rest of the world, including China and the US, is moving forward; and


(d) the need for the Government to pass an emissions trading scheme to place a cap on carbon pollution and drive a clean energy future for Australia.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-07,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (21:10):  I rise to oppose the repeal of the clean energy legislation package that is currently the law in Australia. As I stand here I am reminded of TS Eliot's poem The Hollow Men, where he says:


This is the way the world ends


Not with a bang but a whimper.


He was asked some years later whether that was still his view. He said that he would not write that again because he was not sure that it would end in either way. As a result of the H-bomb, he said there were people whose houses were bombed who 'don't remember hearing anything'.


That is where we are in this debate. There is such denial of reality going on in this parliament, but that is not shared outside the parliament. The people actually get it. They know that we are living in a world of accelerating global warming and they know that we have to act on it. There is a level of anxiety in the back of the minds of most people, but the people I particularly want to talk about tonight, and speak on behalf of, are our future generations—of those who are yet to be born. I want to speak on behalf of the voiceless, young people like those that I met outside the parliament today with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, and others—young people around Australia who are marshalling and marching and wanting action on climate change because they know it is about the future. I also want to speak on behalf of the ecosystems of the planet, which do not have a voice in this parliament. All we have heard are superficial and trite three-word slogans about axing the tax and about power prices, but nothing about the real impacts of what we are currently living through.


Many, many years ago I went to the Barrier Reef for the first time. Going back there in recent years, I have seen that it is much deteriorated from what it used to be. That is a result of many things, but global warming is accelerating the degradation of coral reefs around the planet—not only our own Great Barrier Reef but reefs elsewhere in the world.


Some years ago, I campaigned hard for a long time to have the coral reefs of New Caledonia listed as World Heritage areas. It was an eight-year campaign and a huge amount of work went into it. I am very pleased to say that they are now listed as World Heritage areas. But it is a pyrrhic victory, because you cannot protect the coral reefs of the planet—here in Australia, in New Caledonia or anywhere else in the world—unless you act on global warming. Acidification is weakening the structures of the corals. Warming is leading to the bleaching of corals, and cyclones around the world are leading to the destruction of those reefs. We have been seeing the melting around the West Antarctic ice sheet; we have been seeing the melting of the Arctic; and now we are seeing the ongoing release of methane from the permafrost. 


We are seeing extreme weather events around the world. Those extreme weather events are already displacing people and destroying culture. On many of our Pacific Island neighbours' countries, burial grounds are next to the lagoon, next to the sea. Now, with sea-level rise and intensified storms, our neighbours are losing some of the fundamental parts of their culture, and they are being forced to move internally onto higher ground. The nation of Kiribati is buying land in Fiji, where ultimately it will move 100,000 people if it has to. The people of Tuvalu are saying that they are not going anywhere. I hate to think about the fear in the hearts of people in Tuvalu in the storms that come through there, the storm surges and the over wash of those very low-lying islands. Funafuti is already severely adversely impacted, and only a month or so ago in this parliament I had young people here from Kiribati and Tuvalu begging us to respond to the climate crisis because, as they see it, they are going to lose their homes, their country and their culture. 


With extreme weather events around the world, we are going to see a loss of food security. That is why the Greens have campaigned so hard to look after agricultural land and water. We have already seen, with the global food crisis in 2008—which was caused by extreme weather events wiping out crops around the world through fire and drought—an incredible rise in prices for grains. Ultimately, that led to the Arab spring. The first marches in the Arab spring were in Tunisia and were because of the increase in the price of bread. People were marching in the streets with baguettes, protesting about the increase in the price of grain. That is the reality. It is why the Pentagon has recognised global warming as a major security risk. The Pentagon says that future wars are not going to be planetary wars or global wars, they are going to be regional conflicts as a result of the displacement of people.


As I have said many times in this Senate over the years, if we think that the current issues that are driving the displacement of people are as far as it goes, we are wrong. We are going to see millions of people displaced in the coming years because of climate conflict, internal and external to various countries. This is the situation we find ourselves in: a four to six degrees trajectory of global warming and a loss of between a third and a quarter of all species on the planet by 2050. That is heartbreaking when you think about, in particular, alpine species that cannot go any higher—that is it for them. In Tasmania there is a cider gum which is heading for extinction because it is on the central plateau and it cannot go any higher. I mentioned earlier the white lemuroid possum in North Queensland: it cannot go any higher and it is likely to become extinct because of global warming. It is the same around the world. But it is not just global warming on its own; if you put that together with habitat loss and invasive species you will see an accelerated loss. 


Just last week I heard the anguish from scientists who are talking about, for example, the Ebola virus. They are saying that they now have to consider trying experimental drugs et cetera on chimps and apes in zoos around the planet in order to try to save species in the wild. This is whey we are going to hear increasingly asked: what do we do when we have reduced habitats so much that animals are in contact with humans and equally humans are spreading measles and the like into those ape populations in Africa?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Dear me!




Senator MILNE:
  Senator Macdonald can ridicule this, but the reality is that—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I am ridiculing, Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  respiratory illness is being brought to the gorilla populations by humans and not the other way around. We are seeing planetary disaster because of global warming. 


Australia had a framework to deal with this. When I came into the Senate, I came to address global warming. As an environmentalist I have campaigned all my life for the protection of the environment. But I realised that no amount of areas saved can survive global warning. Unless you deal with that, you will ultimately lose everything, from marine ecosystems through to terrestrial ecosystems, and you will also see impacts on people. That is exactly what we are seeing and that is why we developed a clean energy package. 


We worked very hard. It was a condition that the Greens made with former Prime Minister Gillard, before she became Prime Minister, that we would have a legislated carbon price and that it would come into effect by 1 July, 2012. And that is exactly what happened. It was an incredibly well designed package that was recognised by the International Energy Agency as template legislation for developed countries. We should be really proud of that. Australia took a leading role in the development of legislation that other countries could look to, together with complementary measures—things like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. 


It is an emissions trading scheme. The only reason it has a fixed price for three years—and I remind people that former Prime Minister Rudd's scheme also had a fixed price for one year—was that Labor and the Greens could not agree on the level of ambition that was required, and we still do not. The Greens are the only party in this parliament who are prepared to say we have to get to a 40 to 60 per cent reduction by 2030 and zero net carbon by 2050 to give ourselves even a 50 per cent chance of avoiding two degrees. That is the reality of the level of ambition. Five per cent is so far from where it needs to be it is laughable. It was laughable in 2007 and it cannot be taken seriously as a target now, either to address the science or to address the global equity. 


If you are trying to get to a 2015 treaty, it has to have a level of ambition that gives us a chance. That is absolutely the commitment the Greens will be making, from one end of the planet to the other—we are represented in parliaments of 70 countries around the world. We want a global treaty on global warming. As part of it, money needs to go to developing countries that, through no fault of their own, are now suffering the consequences of global warming. That is why we have to do that. It is immoral for Australia to stand up in a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and block finance for developing countries to adapt to global warming.


It is not just the fact that we cannot agree on a level of ambition. The idea of setting up the Climate Change Authority came from the United Kingdom, where they have a high-level scientific panel that advises the British House of Commons on what the level of ambition should be. Climate policy has been depoliticised through that process, and that is as it should be. The Climate Change Authority should make recommendations to the parliament. To its credit, the Climate Change Authority here has made some very important reports and recommendations to the parliament, including the recommendation that we get to the 40 to 60 per cent trajectory of reductions by 2030. That is exactly what we should be doing. If you think about that, you know that we have to get on—now.


The other point I want to make is that the rest of the world is already moving. In many ways, the revolution has been won. Renewable energy around the world is expanding at a fast rate. The greatest level of investment in new electricity generation, around the planet, is in renewables. We are hearing that every progressive economy around the world is investing in education and training and decarbonising their electricity system, because they recognise that that is where the jobs, investment and growth are in this century. This is the century of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  People should be made to listen to this!




Senator MILNE:
  If you do not get on board with it, you will be a left-behind rust bucket. I know that is where Senator Macdonald wants to be. That is where his comfort zone is—as a left-behind rust bucket. But the rest of us would like to see investment in education, innovation and cleverness. 


Today, we heard the government trying to argue that companies had been driven offshore. That is wrong. There are big solar companies not making investments in Australia, because of the uncertainty the Abbott government has created about carbon policy. We are losing mega-investment, because there is no certainty that Australia is on the right track with climate change. If it were, we would be attracting more investment. Trillions of dollars are in the sidelines. The Investor Group on Climate Change has given evidence to that effect. That is why we need to keep our renewable energy target—and keep it at 41 gigawatt hours—but it needs to go beyond 2016. That is why the Greens are committed to 100 per cent renewable energy as quickly as possible and to at least 90 per cent by 2030. 


If you put together 100 per cent renewable energy and a 40 to 60 per cent trajectory, you are putting together a really exciting plan for Australia. You are talking about redesigning our cities, thinking about the way we live—a huge investment in, retrospectively, looking at building renovations, the built environment, the urban environment, changing the way we do agriculture and looking at research and development, to see how we need to change in order to sustain ourselves into the future. 


They are the kinds of exciting things that young people want to be involved in. And they are the one group—the best and brightest—we will drive out of this country, because you want to abandon carbon pricing. They will go overseas, as they did during the Howard years. We lost some of our best and brightest in solar technology at that time, because they realised that there was no hope in Australia. They went overseas. They have come home to Australia and are working in these fields. But they will go again. They want to be part of the future.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  They do not want to be stuck in a rust-bucket economy like Senator Macdonald does. They do not want to be in that place. They want to be where innovation takes place. I feel incredibly disappointed that this Senate appears to want to destroy an emissions trading scheme that is in place right now, and that the Senate wants to abandon carbon pricing and leave us with nothing in terms of a market mechanism that provides the cheapest and most effective abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. 


To give hope to those young people who were outside today, who are no doubt despairing at the thought of this government abandoning carbon pricing and serious efforts on climate change, I say: 'This will galvanise a whole generation. You are not alone.' Around the world people are moving, and they want a 2015 treaty. That means people under the leadership of Present Obama, in the United States, are moving. People are moving in the United Kingdom, Europe and China—everywhere you look around the planet, except for Canada and Australia, which are in the rust-bucket category. They are over there in the umbrella group and they will do everything they can to rip down action on global warming at Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's summit, in Lima, at the end of the year and into next year. 


By imagining you are getting the climate-change issue off the agenda now, you are making it front and centre for the 2016 federal election campaign. Australians will not tolerate that kind of climate denial. That is why I am moving a second reading amendment in this debate. I want to make sure that we recognise the world is on track for four degrees of warming.



We are calling on the government to adopt 40 to 60 per cent below 2000 levels by 2030. I will move a second reading amendment because I want young people, future generations, to know that in this parliament every single one of us knew what was at stake, every single one of us knew we were on track for four to six degrees of warming and every single one of us knew what the consequences were, but only a few of us were prepared to act on it, including the Greens, who took a leadership role at that time and continued to do so. When the votes are taken, future generations will have the names to look back at of the people who sold out Australia—because they are selling us out in a global context. It is the opportunity cost to this nation, not only the physical cost of global warming and not only the trauma of global warming— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (21:31):  The most exciting thing I heard in Senator Milne's speech is the guarantee that the election in 2016 will be on a carbon tax. Nothing has been sweeter music to my ears than to hear that. I hope the Labor Party will again follow their Greens colleagues in making this the issue in the 2016 election. I can assure senators that the Australian people will give it the same result as they gave it in the 2013 election.


I want to start, while Senator Milne is here, by talking about the global warming that we have heard about so often in her speeches and in this parliament from the Greens and the Labor Party over the years. I quote from an article:


The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week.


That was in 2012.


This means that the 'plateau' or 'pause' in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years.


Is this Ian Macdonald saying this or some ratbag scientist that is vilified by the Greens? No, sorry. This is the United Kingdom Met Office. They say:


The new data, compiled from more than 3,000 measuring points on land and sea, was issued quietly on the internet, without any media fanfare, and, until today, it has not been reported.


I suppose Professor Judith Curry, who is the head of the climate science department at America's prestigious Georgia tech university, will be one that the Greens and the Labor Party will say is not a real scientist, but from all research she seems to be a very real scientist to me. She told this newspaper that it was clear:


… computer models used to predict future warming were 'deeply flawed'.


Senator Milne quoted the United Kingdom government. I understand that the new energy minister—or not quite so new now—promised:


The high-flown theories of bourgeois left-wing academics will not override the interests of ordinary people who need fuel for heat, light and transport—energy policies, you might say, for many, not the few.


Of course, that statement by the UK government bought fury from all those fearing reductions in huge subsidies given to wind farms.


I spoke earlier tonight on a related matter before the Senate. I quoted from an article in The Weekend Australian entitled 'Coral comes back from the dead'. It is an interesting article. I recommend that Senator Milne and her colleagues in the Greens have a read of it. I will quote one passage from this article and invite senators to have a look at the rest. The research was done by a Dr Gilmour. The report says:


Gilmour's boss at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, research director Jamie Oliver, concedes there's still no way of knowing whether powerful cyclones have struck before in clusters. 'I think all we can do at this point is say we are seeing a decline in the reef, and we are seeing that cyclones are playing a major role in that decline but we don't know for sure whether it has been as a result of human activities.'


If you listen to the Greens and the Labor Party, Dr Oliver would be pilloried as a climate change sceptic, simply because he says, as I say and as most sensible people say, the science is not settled. I do not know what Senator Milne thinks of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. I think it is a pretty good organisation. It is just one of many organisations, like the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, who say it is not quite as settled as some would have you believe. I said earlier that there is so much research done into trying to justify the Greens and Labor Party's view on climate change and, if you did not have that view—if you happened to be a scientist that had a different view—you would be pilloried. I mentioned many times Professor Bob Carter as being one that the Greens also pillory, but he is as well qualified as others who have a different view. I know, and I do not think I am giving away any confidences by saying, that he knows that he will never, under a Labor government, get any money for any research that is different to what the Labor government wants the results to be.


I mentioned an answer to a question on notice way back in 2009. I will have to get it updated. Over pages and pages it lists hundreds and hundreds of grants—grants of $250,000, $563,000, $255,000. There are pages and pages of them. All the grant money, all the research money, was going to those who would promote the Labor and Greens view on climate change. If you did not have that view, you got no research money. That is the way this whole debate has occurred in Australia.


I want those in the Labor Party to answer this one question: if the carbon tax is such a good thing, why is it that your leader, prior to the 2010 election, promised that there would never be a carbon tax under a government she led?




Senator O'Neill:
  Because an ETS is better, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I see. She promised it would not be there and then she introduced it. Tell me: why did she make that promise and then introduce it? It is a simple question. I am just waiting for the answer. Nobody has ever been able to tell me why, if it is such a good thing, the Labor leader promised not to introduce it. It just shows the hypocrisy, the absolute humbug, of the Labor Party and the Greens political party.


I thought the Labor Party would have learnt their lesson. I cannot talk about other states, but I can talk about Queensland. The Labor Party should have a look at the results of the last election in the seats that used to be traditionally Labor. Capricornia, which is based in Central Queensland and in the Bowen Basin coalfield, is as Labor a seat as you will get. I think we have held it a couple of times in the recorded political history of Australia. Who won it last time? Michelle Landry for the Liberal-National Party. Why? Because she opposed the carbon tax. Why? Because she knew that all of those workers the CFMEU is supposed to be representing understood that they would be losing their jobs. In fact, thousands of people in the Bowen Basin mining industry lost their jobs because of Labor and Green policies. And the Labor Party wonder why they did so poorly in the last election! Australians spoke. Nobody could deny the assertion by Tony Abbott before the last election that the last election would be a referendum on the carbon tax. Everybody knew that. What was the result? I do not need to tell the reduced Labor numbers in the Senate what the result was.


The duplicity and dishonesty of the Labor Party over the carbon tax is symptomatic of their approach to this whole question. The Labor scheme had carbon emissions going up by 2020. Those are their figures, not mine. They were all out there and published by the then department. They showed that Labor's carbon tax would actually increase the emission of carbon. They also showed that the cost of living went up for all Australians. They also showed—and this is beyond doubt—that electricity costs went up and would continue to go up. The only thing that went down was the number of Australian jobs. You have seen a rush of manufacturing jobs from our country to overseas countries. We have all given examples of this before. Just recently the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia was in Weipa—and I am pleased that Senator Waters was there. We heard firsthand how the aluminium industry in Australia is faltering because the bauxite now goes as a raw material straight across to China where they smelt it and make aluminium in far less conducive situations than we do in Australia. There are more carbon emissions when they do it in China than when we do it in Gladstone. This is the Labor Party's view on carbon reduction.


I think we have to keep in mind that Labor's promise with its carbon tax was to reduce Australia's emissions by five per cent. Do I need to remind senators that Australia's emissions of carbon in the world are less than 1.4 per cent? What Labor was going to do with this huge job-destroying carbon tax was reduce Australia's 1.4 per cent of world emissions by five per cent and that was going to save the world. All the biodiversity that Senator Milne talked about, all the forests and all the coral that are disappearing were going to stop if Australia reduced its 1.4 per cent of world carbon emissions by five per cent. How ludicrous! How absolutely ridiculous! How desperately defying logic is the argument of the Greens political party?


I have made my comments about the five per cent, but if that is what is good policy in Australia then I refer to the coalition's policy, which also had a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions but by direct action, things that encouraged people to reduce whatever it was that was causing pollution and particulates. Direct action would work. It is funding things like the wonderful algae project at James Cook University that will help in cleaning emissions from coalmines. They are the sorts of things that the Abbott government's Direct Action Plan would do.


The Labor Party particularly are quoting all of these economists. Have a look at what all the economists in business say about the carbon tax. The Labor Party have got 50 'economists' to sign a bit of paper. What about the thousands of economists in Australia who deal with real life and who demand that the carbon tax go? The Labor Party are quoting President Obama—and I am not quite sure they are quoting him correctly—but I am afraid they did not quote Al Gore, the white knight of the climate change industry. I wonder what the Greens, who used to worship Al Gore, might have thought when Mr Gore turned up with Mr Palmer as he announced he would be voting to remove the carbon tax. I have not heard too much about that at all. I am waiting for someone to give those glowing endorsements of Mr Gore they used to give. To my mind, Mr Gore's actions in relation to the whole climate change debate are circumspect at best, and other people have mentioned that far more relevantly.


They do not talk too much about global warming now because the UK Met Office has said, 'Sorry, it's not warming.' We hear that all of these events are happening more regularly. Remember Cyclone Yasi, up my way? That was the biggest cyclone that ever hit Queensland—since 1917, when there was a bigger one. We do not worry about that. We just think the original Australians must have been responsible for the carbon emissions, when they burnt off large tracts of land before 1917, that caused that much bigger cyclone. But we just forget that; we put it aside; we only talk about Cyclone Yasi. We talk about those huge, destructive, life-taking floods in South-East Queensland a few years ago. They were the biggest floods ever to hit Queensland—that is, the biggest since the early 1950s. We have all of these outrageous claims by those who would have us believe that the science is settled.


I repeat: I am not a scientist. I retain an open mind. I know the climate is changing because, as I mentioned earlier, the world was covered in ice once. It is no longer, so clearly the climate has changed. There used to be a rainforest in the centre of Australia; it is not there anymore. Clearly, the climate has changed. I think every Australian accepts that the climate has changed. But is it man's emissions of carbon that have done that? I do not know. There are respectable scientists who say no, as there are respectable scientists who say yes.


That is why I think Australia has been very foolish in leading the world. Senator Milne would have us believe that China is suddenly going to impose a carbon tax, or that America is going to impose a carbon tax, or that Germany is going to do something serious; but we have all seen the carbon prices and the carbon market, which is fraudulent and subject to manipulation. And this is what the Greens and the Labor Party want us to adopt.


We do have a responsibility to look after our environment. Our Direct Action Plan will help in that regard, and I certainly hope that other parties in the Senate will support it. But we do not need a job-destroying tax to do that. I say that and I know many senators say that, but, more importantly—forget about me and forget about what people will say in this debate about getting rid of the carbon tax—we are a democracy and there could not be a clearer message from the people of Australia to the legislators in this building about what they think of a carbon tax. They want to get rid of it. They understand it destroys jobs. They understand it puts up their cost of living. That is why we must move as quickly as possible to get rid of that soul-destroying tax and all of the paraphernalia that grew up around it, which is the subject of the other bills in the package of bills before the Senate. I certainly urge the Senate to support the bills introduced in this chamber, which reflect the decision made in the lower house to rid Australia of this job-destroying carbon tax.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (20:51):  I move:


That these bills be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



CLEAN ENERGY LEGISLATION (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]



Today the government reintroduces the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013.


As I said on 12 November 2013, when I introduced this bill for the first time, the Australian people have already voted on this bill.


Now the parliament again gets its chance. The people have spoken.


Now, it's up to this Parliament to show that it's listened.


The Australian people pronounced their judgment against the Carbon Tax: they want it gone and this bill delivers.


It delivers on the Coalition's commitment to the Australian people to scrap this toxic tax.


Madam Speaker, the Budget we delivered recently was tough but visionary. It was about setting the country on a path to long-term structural change.


But, a cornerstone of the Government's plan for a stronger economy built on lower taxes, less regulation and stronger businesses is the repeal of the carbon tax.


The first impact of this bill will be on households whose overall costs will fall around $550 a year on average.


Because of this bill, household electricity bills will be around $200 lower next financial year without the Carbon Tax.


Household gas bills will be around $70 lower next financial year without the Carbon Tax.


Prices for groceries, for household items and for services will also fall because the price of power is embedded in every price in our economy.


This is a bill to reduce the bills of the people of Australia.


When the price of power comes down, Madam Speaker, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be ready to ensure these price reductions are passed on to households and businesses.


But families and pensioners will keep the tax cuts and benefit increases already provided.


The Carbon Tax will go, but the carbon tax compensation will stay so that every Australian should be better off.


Repealing the Carbon Tax will reduce costs for all Australian businesses, every single one of them.


Madam Speaker the previous Government said and argued that only big business paid the Carbon Tax.


That simply wasn't true. Every small business paid the Carbon Tax through higher electricity and gas bills and higher costs for supplies.


As well, Madam Speaker, the Carbon Tax acts as a reverse tariff.


Not only does the Carbon Tax make it more difficult for Australian businesses to compete abroad, it makes it more difficult for domestic businesses to compete at home – because there is no Carbon Tax on imports.


Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax removes over 1,000 pages of primary and subordinate legislation.


Repealing the Carbon Tax cuts the size of the climate change bureaucracy.


So, repealing the Carbon Tax will reduce the cost of living, make jobs more secure and improve the competitive position of our country.


That's what it does: it reduces the cost of living, it makes jobs more secure and improves the competitive position of our country.


Why would anyone be against that, particularly when it's what the Australian people have voted for?


Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax is what the employers and what the jobs providers of our country want now.


The Business Council of Australia ―supports the wind-up of the current carbon pricing mechanism because it places excessive costs on business and households and because (our) carbon charge...is now one of the highest in the world.


The carbon tax has ripped through the economy, hitting schools, hospitals, nursing homes, charities, churches, council swimming pools and community centres.


It has hit each and every group and each and every individual that uses power – and that was always its goal: to make electricity more expensive.


That was the intention of the previous government, to put power prices up because that was their way of reducing carbon emissions.


The intention of the new government is to put power prices down by axing this toxic tax and by using other means to reduce emissions.


By reducing the cost of electricity and gas, we will help to make households better off, workers more secure and our economy stronger.


No one should be in any doubt – the Government is repealing the Carbon Tax in full.


We are doing what we were elected to do.


Others have said they would terminate the Carbon Tax, but they were only renaming it.


Well, Madam Speaker, we are not renaming it. We are abolishing the Carbon Tax in full.


Madam Speaker, repealing the Carbon Tax at the end of the financial year provides certainty for business and it simplifies the transition.


It means that this Government will not be proceeding with the previous Government's legislated Carbon Tax increase that would have taken effect from the 1 July.


Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the new Government cannot undo the past, we can only make the future better – and that is what we intend to do.


Madam Speaker, under this Government, the Carbon Tax will not apply from 1 July so there will be no need for further compensation packages.


We will end the merry-go-round of Carbon Tax industry assistance that takes from one pocket and puts less back in the other.


Madam Speaker, we will ensure that the benefits of repealing the Carbon Tax are passed on to consumers.


The ACCC will have further powers to take action against any business that engages in price exploitation in relation to the Carbon Tax repeal.


Penalties of up to $1.1 million for corporations and $220,000 for individuals will apply.


Madam Speaker, it is prudent to do what we reasonably can to reduce carbon emissions.


But we don't believe in ostracising any particular fuel and we don't believe in harming economic growth.


Madam Speaker, climate change is a serious issue and we have strong policies to come into place so that we rest lightly on the planet.


The Government is repealing the Carbon Tax because there is a less complicated and less costly way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—a way that will actually reduce emissions and won't damage the economy.


The Government will scrap the Carbon Tax and then proceed with its Direct Action Plan.


The centrepiece of the Direct Action Plan will be the Emissions Reduction Fund – a market-based mechanism for reducing carbon dioxide emissions; a Fund which provides a powerful and direct additional incentive for businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.


The $2.55 billion Fund will use positive incentives to reduce Australia's emissions and prioritise cost-effective, targeted means to reduce emissions.


It's an incentive-based approach which will support Australian businesses and households to lower their energy costs at the same time as reducing Australia's emissions.


It will see us plant more trees, get more carbon captured in soils, clean up power stations and use smarter technology.


We believe that by the time the 5 per cent reduction kicks in in 2020 we'll have an overall reduction in our emissions of some 22 per cent of 2000 levels off a business as usual model—serious action about a significant problem.


Madam Speaker, the carbon tax is a $9 billion hit on the economy this year alone.


It is a $9 billion hit on jobs, a $9 billion burden on investment and a $9 billion burden on Australia that we just don't need.


This bill gets rid of it.


This bill, Madam Speaker, is the Government's bill to reduce the Australian people's bills and so I commend this bill to the Senate.


TRUE-UP SHORTFALL LEVY (GENERAL) (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


Together, this bill, the True-up Shortfall Levy (Excise) (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013, and the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 ensure that final assistance allocations under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program are accurate so that businesses are not over- or under-allocated assistance in 2013-14. 


This bill imposes a levy which recovers the value of over allocated free carbon units received under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program for the 2013-14 financial year. 


For constitutional reasons, this bill imposes the levy to the extent that it is not a duty of customs or excise.


TRUE-UP SHORTFALL LEVY (EXCISE) (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013[No.2]


Together, this bill, the True-up Shortfall Levy (General) (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013, and the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 will ensure that final assistance allocations under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program are accurate, so that businesses are not over- or under-allocated assistance in 2013-14.


For constitutional reasons, this bill imposes the levy to recover over allocations to the extent that it is a duty of excise.


CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to remove the elements of this act that were legislated by the former government to apply the carbon tax through the fuel tax and excise system.


Importantly, this will reduce the increase in excise-equivalent customs duty on aviation gasoline and aviation jet fuel that represents an equivalent to the carbon tax applied to Australian imports.


Currently, Qantas imposes a carbon price surcharge of between $1.93 and $7.25 per passenger on all domestic flights, depending on the distance travelled. Virgin Australia imposes similar surcharges.


The repeal of the carbon tax will reduce one of the major components of airline costs and enable airlines to pass on a significant saving to travellers.


EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013[No.2]


This bill, which amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921, reduces the increase in excise on aviation gasoline and aviation jet fuel that is applied when an equivalent carbon tax is applied to Australian manufactured fuels.


Around $200 million was raised in 2012-13 by applying the carbon charge to aviation fuel.


This bill will reduce one of the major components of airline costs, which can be passed on to travellers and consumers.


The bill also reduces the act's complexity by removing references and notes associated with the imposition of the carbon tax.


OZONE PROTECTION AND SYNTHETIC GREENHOUSE GAS (IMPORT LEVY) AMENDMENT (CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 is one of two bills to repeal the equivalent carbon tax on synthetic greenhouse gases.


These bills are part of the broader legislative package to abolish the carbon tax. This bill amends the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Act 1995 so that importers of synthetic greenhouse gases and products containing those gases will not incur a liability to pay the equivalent carbon tax for synthetic greenhouse gas and equipment imported after 1 July 2014. This will reduce costs for businesses using these gases, including for refrigeration and air conditioning.


OZONE PROTECTION AND SYNTHETIC GREENHOUSE GAS (IMPORT LEVY) (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 provides for an exemption from the equivalent carbon price for the import of bulk synthetic greenhouse gases between 1 April and 30 June 2014 if certain conditions are met.


OZONE PROTECTION AND SYNTHETIC GREENHOUSE GAS (MANUFACTURE LEVY) AMENDMENT(CARBON TAX REPEAL) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 is one of two bills to repeal the equivalent carbon tax on synthetic greenhouse gases. These bills are part of the broader legislative package to abolish the carbon tax.


This bill amends the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Act 1995 so that manufacturers of synthetic greenhouse gases will not incur a liability to pay the equivalent carbon tax for synthetic greenhouse gas manufactured after 1 July 2014. This will reduce costs for businesses using these greenhouse gases, including for refrigeration and air conditioning.


CLEAN ENERGY (INCOME TAX RATES AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2013 [No.2]


The Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates and Other Amendments) Bill 2013 is part of a package of bills to remove the carbon tax.


This bill amends elements of the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011 to repeal the second round of personal income tax cuts due to start on 1 July 2015.


The government understands households will continue to face cost-of-living pressures.


That is why the government is keeping the current carbon tax related personal income tax thresholds and the fortnightly pension and benefit increases. 


In its final budget handed down on 14 May 2013, the former government deferred a second round of personal income tax cuts and booked a $1.5 billion saving over the forward estimates.


But the former government never followed through by legislating this change.


This bill repeals legislated amendments to the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 so that the statutory personal income tax rates and thresholds do not change on 1 July 2015.


This bill also amends the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 to repeal related amendments to the low-income tax offset.


This bill also repeals legislated amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that the related amendments to the low-income tax offset do not take effect on 1 July 2015.


Overall, the repeal of these amendments means that the tax-free threshold will remain at $18,200.


The second personal marginal tax rate will remain at 32.5 per cent. And the maximum value of the low-income tax offset will remain at $445.


This bill legislates the $1.5 billion saving that the former government announced during the 2013-14 budget but never legislated.


A first round of tax cuts to compensate for the introduction of the carbon tax has already been delivered. We will deliver further savings to Australian households of $550 next year with the removal of the carbon tax. In short this is our saving for the Australian people.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,2,speech
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-07-07,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (20:52):  I rise to contribute to this debate on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 [No.2] and related bills that are before the Senate. These bills are presented by the government as bills to abolish the carbon tax. However, these bills do much more than terminate the carbon tax. These bills destroy Australia's entire legislative framework for tackling climate change. These bills remove the legislative cap on carbon pollution, an essential principle in ensuring that we meet our 2020 target to reduce Australia's emissions. The bills abolish the entire framework for an emissions trading scheme. It is hard to imagine a more complex national risk management issue than that posed by global warming, yet this government is removing from Australia's climate policy any trace of that world-leading model and replacing it with a token gesture, direct action, a widely criticised, underdeveloped and extremely expensive policy that is doomed to fail. This government cannot or will not deliver the policy solution required for the effective management of climate change. Direct action is a profoundly embarrassing and inadequate alternative to the economic common sense of an emissions trading scheme.


Labor will not support the government's carbon tax repeal bills. Labor's position on these bills is no surprise. It is the position we made clear to the electorate in September and which we have been advocating ever since. That position is to terminate the carbon tax now and move to an emissions trading scheme with a legal cap on carbon pollution, a cap that reduces over time and enables Australia's business community to work out the cheapest, most effective way to operate. At this point I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment along those lines. 


The most effective long-term response to climate change is an emissions trading scheme. It is the model in place or being introduced in Germany, the UK, California, South Africa, China, South Korea. This truth is self-evident and recognised right around the globe, except, it seems, on the Abbott government benches. Labor's amendment to these bills will remove the carbon tax and shift to an emissions trading scheme.


A carbon tax seeks to change behaviour by imposing a price signal that discourages polluters from carbon dioxide pollution without any legal discipline on that behaviour. An emissions trading scheme, however, changes behaviour through the discipline of a legislative cap on pollution. It gives business the ability to trade pollution permits and lets business work out the cheapest way to operate within that national pollution cap. An emissions trading scheme is the cheapest way to achieve this nation's emissions reductions objective because it creates a genuine market. That is why it is so surprising that the Liberal Party does not support a market based mechanism to address carbon pollution.


Labor is committed to putting a cap on pollution via this mechanism of an emissions trading scheme. This emissions trading scheme was what both major parties actually committed to back in 2007 when the Liberals accepted the science of climate change. But if these bills are passed unamended, an emissions trading scheme for Australia will disappear. The Prime Minister will truly get his way in throwing the baby out with the bathwater, with no legislated cap on carbon pollution and no market based mechanism for business to tap into.


The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, issued its latest report—its fifth report—in September last year. In that report the 209 lead authors, supported by more than 600 contributing authors, lifted their level of certainty about the existence of climate change, and its cause by human activity, to 95 per cent. Maurice Newman, the Prime Minister's senior business adviser, tells us in regular opinion pieces in The Australian that the IPCC—those are several hundred leading climate scientists who authored the fifth report—are a fringe group who do not represent the mainstream of scientific opinion. 


This government's suggestion that we should proceed to removing the carbon tax without any substantive policy beyond that is not only irresponsible but dangerous. It is dangerous not only for Australia's economy but also for our international reputation because of the fact that we will not be acting on reducing our carbon pollution.


But let's look at some of the history. The member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, once stated:


The idea that somehow the Liberal Party is opposed to an emissions trading scheme is quite frankly ludicrous.


This highlights how ludicrous some of this debate is right now. The backflips that have occurred in the positions of coalition members are ludicrous. Those opposite have done an about-face for political reasons, but the emissions trading scheme model is still recognised as the cheapest and most effective way to tackle climate change, despite the about-face by government members and senators. The Liberal government is trashing Australia's effort to tackle climate change at exactly the same time as the scientific community is warning that climate change poses a real and serious risk to our precious Australian environment. Labor is committed to putting a cap on pollution through an emissions trading scheme. An emissions trading scheme was what both the major parties committed to, as I mentioned, when the Liberals accepted the science of climate change in 2007.


So, how swiftly things have changed. In July 2009 the now Prime Minister said, 'I am hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science of climate change.' In October 2009 he famously described the science as 'absolute crap'—excuse my language, Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards! And in March 2010 he said:


Now, I don't believe that the science is settled.


In March 2011 he suggested, 'Whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.'


To suggest that climate scientists have not reached a settled view about global warming is simply misleading. The science is settled. It was settled years ago. There is no debate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's most positive assessment of global warming expects the average temperature of the earth to be between 1.1 and 2.9 degrees hotter by the end of this century. A more realistic prediction in line with current levels of consumption is that the weather will be 2.4 to 6.4 degrees hotter, higher than at any time in recorded history.


Even a two-degree climb in average global temperatures could cause crop failures in parts of the world that can least afford to lose their nourishment. The size of deserts will increase, along with the frequency and intensity of wildfires. On average, in the past decade fossil fuel emissions grew at about three times the rate of growth in the 1990s. There is twice as much carbon dioxide trapped in the melting Arctic permafrost as there is already in the earth's atmosphere. It is being released, and its release is speeding up. The melting permafrost is also releasing enormous stores of methane, a greenhouse gas nearly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide.


So we need to listen. We need to listen to these scientists. We need to look at their evidence based findings. We need to listen now not only to the scientists but to the economists who today united in support of a price and a limit on carbon pollution with the release of their open letter. Those economists included Dr Hewson, who said, 'The failure of our generation to act will cost future generations dearly.'


Economist and carbon price pioneer Ross Garnaut has also added his voice to the growing concern of Australia's position on an emissions trading scheme, stating: 


Unless Australia moves from this place, it risks damaging the international effort to reduce the risks of dangerous climate change …


These economists stand in good company with President Obama, who stated that climate change is 'one of the most significant, long-term challenges that the United States and the planet face.' We must understand and then act on this scientific data: the overwhelming global evidence demonstrating that an emissions trading scheme is the cheapest and most effective way of achieving the outcomes we desire for our nation.


So, has Labor's carbon price mechanism been the wrecking ball through the Australian economy that the Prime Minister claimed it would be? Was it the cobra strike at the economy? Did the South Australian town of Whyalla disappear off the map? No, no! The truth is entirely different. The truth of the impact was exactly as Labor predicted. The economy did keep growing. More than 160,000 additional jobs were created in the first 12 months of the carbon price mechanism that, according to the now Prime Minister, was going to have a wrecking-ball impact on the national economy. Also, what Labor's comprehensive policy approach started to do, along with our renewable energy policies, was to drive down carbon pollution, particularly in the electricity market, which is the largest source of carbon pollution in Australia.


We saw a reduction in carbon pollution of around seven per cent in the National Electricity Market in the first 12 months alone. And, as we predicted, there was simply a modest impact on prices. That impact was more than covered through the household assistance package, particularly for low-income and fixed-income households like pensioners and middle-income households. The impact on power prices, again, was exactly as we predicted and, again, was covered by our household assistance package. It also achieved the trebling of Australia's wind capacity and saw solar panels being installed in more than a million households, up from fewer than 7,500 under the Howard years. Employment in the renewable energy industry more than doubled to over 24,000 people and around 150,000 jobs were created. In fact, the economy continues to grow at 2.5 per cent as inflation remains low and pollution in the National Electricity Market is decreasing by seven per cent. Renewable energy technologies are doing well, not only as a new innovative form of industry but also in providing a benefit to the environment, to the community, to our children and to future generations.


I understand that Kirsten Rose, the CEO of the Sustainable Energy Association of Australia, stated, 'We and many of our members believe that an emissions trading scheme—that market mechanism—gives them choices and flexibility in a different way to a direct action plan, which is, effectively, bidding for money to support specific projects.'


The bills also abolish the Climate Change Authority, an independent, strong voice set up to advise the parliament, the government and, perhaps most importantly, the Australian community about the very difficult and highly-contested issues associated with climate change. It is also on the chopping block through this government's approach to climate change. Also on the hit list is ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, an independent agency funded to invest in projects that actually improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia. This continues as an emerging theme of this government: abolishing strong, independent voices and making sure that all advice to the Australian community and to the parliament is filtered, sanitized for political purposes, and fundamentally controlled by the Prime Minister.


As a rich country with a high level of carbon emissions we have a responsibility to reduce our pollution output. Labor has already demonstrated that the balance of sensible, positive actions necessary to reduce carbon pollution, tackle climate change and protect our environmental resources is such an important one. The case that has not been made is one for dismantling many of those measures that we know from the debates in the Senate and other sources have been working well.


This morning I joined my Labor Senate colleagues at the Australian Youth Climate Coalition event outside the front of parliament. There I was reminded about future generations and about the importance of these bills in creating a sustainable future for our young people and for their children to come. Their passion should be echoed right now in this chamber. They want action on climate change. Labor has been and continues to be dedicated to achieving the best possible policy to tackle one of the key challenges of this century. That policy is an emissions trading scheme. By tackling climate change in the most cost-effective way we can support the environment and we can support the renewable industry in Australia; we can see jobs grow; and we can, most importantly, continue to reduce our carbon dioxide pollution and play our part in this global problem that is facing our planet. I move:


   At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate notes:


(a) the scientific and expert consensus regarding climate change;


(b) that, in its first year, the clean energy future package:


      (i) drove a 7 per cent reduction in carbon pollution from electricity generation in the national electricity market;


      (ii) saw renewable energy increase its share of the national electricity market by 25 per cent;


      (iii) delivered the household assistance package to compensate families and individuals for any impact of carbon pricing; and


      (iv) supported continued economic growth, with over 160,000 jobs created in 2012-13 across the economy, including clean energy jobs;


(c) that since the 2013 election Australia's international reputation on climate change action has been damaged by becoming the first nation to move backwards on climate change, while the rest of the world, including China and the US, is moving forward; and


(d) the need for the Government to pass an emissions trading scheme to place a cap on carbon pollution and drive a clean energy future for Australia.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-07,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (21:10):  I rise to oppose the repeal of the clean energy legislation package that is currently the law in Australia. As I stand here I am reminded of TS Eliot's poem The Hollow Men, where he says:


This is the way the world ends


Not with a bang but a whimper.


He was asked some years later whether that was still his view. He said that he would not write that again because he was not sure that it would end in either way. As a result of the H-bomb, he said there were people whose houses were bombed who 'don't remember hearing anything'.


That is where we are in this debate. There is such denial of reality going on in this parliament, but that is not shared outside the parliament. The people actually get it. They know that we are living in a world of accelerating global warming and they know that we have to act on it. There is a level of anxiety in the back of the minds of most people, but the people I particularly want to talk about tonight, and speak on behalf of, are our future generations—of those who are yet to be born. I want to speak on behalf of the voiceless, young people like those that I met outside the parliament today with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, and others—young people around Australia who are marshalling and marching and wanting action on climate change because they know it is about the future. I also want to speak on behalf of the ecosystems of the planet, which do not have a voice in this parliament. All we have heard are superficial and trite three-word slogans about axing the tax and about power prices, but nothing about the real impacts of what we are currently living through.


Many, many years ago I went to the Barrier Reef for the first time. Going back there in recent years, I have seen that it is much deteriorated from what it used to be. That is a result of many things, but global warming is accelerating the degradation of coral reefs around the planet—not only our own Great Barrier Reef but reefs elsewhere in the world.


Some years ago, I campaigned hard for a long time to have the coral reefs of New Caledonia listed as World Heritage areas. It was an eight-year campaign and a huge amount of work went into it. I am very pleased to say that they are now listed as World Heritage areas. But it is a pyrrhic victory, because you cannot protect the coral reefs of the planet—here in Australia, in New Caledonia or anywhere else in the world—unless you act on global warming. Acidification is weakening the structures of the corals. Warming is leading to the bleaching of corals, and cyclones around the world are leading to the destruction of those reefs. We have been seeing the melting around the West Antarctic ice sheet; we have been seeing the melting of the Arctic; and now we are seeing the ongoing release of methane from the permafrost. 


We are seeing extreme weather events around the world. Those extreme weather events are already displacing people and destroying culture. On many of our Pacific Island neighbours' countries, burial grounds are next to the lagoon, next to the sea. Now, with sea-level rise and intensified storms, our neighbours are losing some of the fundamental parts of their culture, and they are being forced to move internally onto higher ground. The nation of Kiribati is buying land in Fiji, where ultimately it will move 100,000 people if it has to. The people of Tuvalu are saying that they are not going anywhere. I hate to think about the fear in the hearts of people in Tuvalu in the storms that come through there, the storm surges and the over wash of those very low-lying islands. Funafuti is already severely adversely impacted, and only a month or so ago in this parliament I had young people here from Kiribati and Tuvalu begging us to respond to the climate crisis because, as they see it, they are going to lose their homes, their country and their culture. 


With extreme weather events around the world, we are going to see a loss of food security. That is why the Greens have campaigned so hard to look after agricultural land and water. We have already seen, with the global food crisis in 2008—which was caused by extreme weather events wiping out crops around the world through fire and drought—an incredible rise in prices for grains. Ultimately, that led to the Arab spring. The first marches in the Arab spring were in Tunisia and were because of the increase in the price of bread. People were marching in the streets with baguettes, protesting about the increase in the price of grain. That is the reality. It is why the Pentagon has recognised global warming as a major security risk. The Pentagon says that future wars are not going to be planetary wars or global wars, they are going to be regional conflicts as a result of the displacement of people.


As I have said many times in this Senate over the years, if we think that the current issues that are driving the displacement of people are as far as it goes, we are wrong. We are going to see millions of people displaced in the coming years because of climate conflict, internal and external to various countries. This is the situation we find ourselves in: a four to six degrees trajectory of global warming and a loss of between a third and a quarter of all species on the planet by 2050. That is heartbreaking when you think about, in particular, alpine species that cannot go any higher—that is it for them. In Tasmania there is a cider gum which is heading for extinction because it is on the central plateau and it cannot go any higher. I mentioned earlier the white lemuroid possum in North Queensland: it cannot go any higher and it is likely to become extinct because of global warming. It is the same around the world. But it is not just global warming on its own; if you put that together with habitat loss and invasive species you will see an accelerated loss. 


Just last week I heard the anguish from scientists who are talking about, for example, the Ebola virus. They are saying that they now have to consider trying experimental drugs et cetera on chimps and apes in zoos around the planet in order to try to save species in the wild. This is whey we are going to hear increasingly asked: what do we do when we have reduced habitats so much that animals are in contact with humans and equally humans are spreading measles and the like into those ape populations in Africa?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Dear me!




Senator MILNE:
  Senator Macdonald can ridicule this, but the reality is that—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I am ridiculing, Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  respiratory illness is being brought to the gorilla populations by humans and not the other way around. We are seeing planetary disaster because of global warming. 


Australia had a framework to deal with this. When I came into the Senate, I came to address global warming. As an environmentalist I have campaigned all my life for the protection of the environment. But I realised that no amount of areas saved can survive global warning. Unless you deal with that, you will ultimately lose everything, from marine ecosystems through to terrestrial ecosystems, and you will also see impacts on people. That is exactly what we are seeing and that is why we developed a clean energy package. 


We worked very hard. It was a condition that the Greens made with former Prime Minister Gillard, before she became Prime Minister, that we would have a legislated carbon price and that it would come into effect by 1 July, 2012. And that is exactly what happened. It was an incredibly well designed package that was recognised by the International Energy Agency as template legislation for developed countries. We should be really proud of that. Australia took a leading role in the development of legislation that other countries could look to, together with complementary measures—things like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. 


It is an emissions trading scheme. The only reason it has a fixed price for three years—and I remind people that former Prime Minister Rudd's scheme also had a fixed price for one year—was that Labor and the Greens could not agree on the level of ambition that was required, and we still do not. The Greens are the only party in this parliament who are prepared to say we have to get to a 40 to 60 per cent reduction by 2030 and zero net carbon by 2050 to give ourselves even a 50 per cent chance of avoiding two degrees. That is the reality of the level of ambition. Five per cent is so far from where it needs to be it is laughable. It was laughable in 2007 and it cannot be taken seriously as a target now, either to address the science or to address the global equity. 


If you are trying to get to a 2015 treaty, it has to have a level of ambition that gives us a chance. That is absolutely the commitment the Greens will be making, from one end of the planet to the other—we are represented in parliaments of 70 countries around the world. We want a global treaty on global warming. As part of it, money needs to go to developing countries that, through no fault of their own, are now suffering the consequences of global warming. That is why we have to do that. It is immoral for Australia to stand up in a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and block finance for developing countries to adapt to global warming.


It is not just the fact that we cannot agree on a level of ambition. The idea of setting up the Climate Change Authority came from the United Kingdom, where they have a high-level scientific panel that advises the British House of Commons on what the level of ambition should be. Climate policy has been depoliticised through that process, and that is as it should be. The Climate Change Authority should make recommendations to the parliament. To its credit, the Climate Change Authority here has made some very important reports and recommendations to the parliament, including the recommendation that we get to the 40 to 60 per cent trajectory of reductions by 2030. That is exactly what we should be doing. If you think about that, you know that we have to get on—now.


The other point I want to make is that the rest of the world is already moving. In many ways, the revolution has been won. Renewable energy around the world is expanding at a fast rate. The greatest level of investment in new electricity generation, around the planet, is in renewables. We are hearing that every progressive economy around the world is investing in education and training and decarbonising their electricity system, because they recognise that that is where the jobs, investment and growth are in this century. This is the century of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  People should be made to listen to this!




Senator MILNE:
  If you do not get on board with it, you will be a left-behind rust bucket. I know that is where Senator Macdonald wants to be. That is where his comfort zone is—as a left-behind rust bucket. But the rest of us would like to see investment in education, innovation and cleverness. 


Today, we heard the government trying to argue that companies had been driven offshore. That is wrong. There are big solar companies not making investments in Australia, because of the uncertainty the Abbott government has created about carbon policy. We are losing mega-investment, because there is no certainty that Australia is on the right track with climate change. If it were, we would be attracting more investment. Trillions of dollars are in the sidelines. The Investor Group on Climate Change has given evidence to that effect. That is why we need to keep our renewable energy target—and keep it at 41 gigawatt hours—but it needs to go beyond 2016. That is why the Greens are committed to 100 per cent renewable energy as quickly as possible and to at least 90 per cent by 2030. 


If you put together 100 per cent renewable energy and a 40 to 60 per cent trajectory, you are putting together a really exciting plan for Australia. You are talking about redesigning our cities, thinking about the way we live—a huge investment in, retrospectively, looking at building renovations, the built environment, the urban environment, changing the way we do agriculture and looking at research and development, to see how we need to change in order to sustain ourselves into the future. 


They are the kinds of exciting things that young people want to be involved in. And they are the one group—the best and brightest—we will drive out of this country, because you want to abandon carbon pricing. They will go overseas, as they did during the Howard years. We lost some of our best and brightest in solar technology at that time, because they realised that there was no hope in Australia. They went overseas. They have come home to Australia and are working in these fields. But they will go again. They want to be part of the future.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  They do not want to be stuck in a rust-bucket economy like Senator Macdonald does. They do not want to be in that place. They want to be where innovation takes place. I feel incredibly disappointed that this Senate appears to want to destroy an emissions trading scheme that is in place right now, and that the Senate wants to abandon carbon pricing and leave us with nothing in terms of a market mechanism that provides the cheapest and most effective abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. 


To give hope to those young people who were outside today, who are no doubt despairing at the thought of this government abandoning carbon pricing and serious efforts on climate change, I say: 'This will galvanise a whole generation. You are not alone.' Around the world people are moving, and they want a 2015 treaty. That means people under the leadership of Present Obama, in the United States, are moving. People are moving in the United Kingdom, Europe and China—everywhere you look around the planet, except for Canada and Australia, which are in the rust-bucket category. They are over there in the umbrella group and they will do everything they can to rip down action on global warming at Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's summit, in Lima, at the end of the year and into next year. 


By imagining you are getting the climate-change issue off the agenda now, you are making it front and centre for the 2016 federal election campaign. Australians will not tolerate that kind of climate denial. That is why I am moving a second reading amendment in this debate. I want to make sure that we recognise the world is on track for four degrees of warming.



We are calling on the government to adopt 40 to 60 per cent below 2000 levels by 2030. I will move a second reading amendment because I want young people, future generations, to know that in this parliament every single one of us knew what was at stake, every single one of us knew we were on track for four to six degrees of warming and every single one of us knew what the consequences were, but only a few of us were prepared to act on it, including the Greens, who took a leadership role at that time and continued to do so. When the votes are taken, future generations will have the names to look back at of the people who sold out Australia—because they are selling us out in a global context. It is the opportunity cost to this nation, not only the physical cost of global warming and not only the trauma of global warming— (Time expired)




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
):  Senator Milne, you may, of course, only foreshadow your amendment, because there is an amendment already before the chair.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (21:31):  The most exciting thing I heard in Senator Milne's speech is the guarantee that the election in 2016 will be on a carbon tax. Nothing has been sweeter music to my ears than to hear that. I hope the Labor Party will again follow their Greens colleagues in making this the issue in the 2016 election. I can assure senators that the Australian people will give it the same result as they gave it in the 2013 election.


I want to start, while Senator Milne is here, by talking about the global warming that we have heard about so often in her speeches and in this parliament from the Greens and the Labor Party over the years. I quote from an article:


The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week.


That was in 2012.


This means that the 'plateau' or 'pause' in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years.


Is this Ian Macdonald saying this or some ratbag scientist that is vilified by the Greens? No, sorry. This is the United Kingdom Met Office. They say:


The new data, compiled from more than 3,000 measuring points on land and sea, was issued quietly on the internet, without any media fanfare, and, until today, it has not been reported.


I suppose Professor Judith Curry, who is the head of the climate science department at America's prestigious Georgia tech university, will be one that the Greens and the Labor Party will say is not a real scientist, but from all research she seems to be a very real scientist to me. She told this newspaper that it was clear:


… computer models used to predict future warming were 'deeply flawed'.


Senator Milne quoted the United Kingdom government. I understand that the new energy minister—or not quite so new now—promised:


The high-flown theories of bourgeois left-wing academics will not override the interests of ordinary people who need fuel for heat, light and transport—energy policies, you might say, for many, not the few.


Of course, that statement by the UK government bought fury from all those fearing reductions in huge subsidies given to wind farms.


I spoke earlier tonight on a related matter before the Senate. I quoted from an article in The Weekend Australian entitled 'Coral comes back from the dead'. It is an interesting article. I recommend that Senator Milne and her colleagues in the Greens have a read of it. I will quote one passage from this article and invite senators to have a look at the rest. The research was done by a Dr Gilmour. The report says:


Gilmour's boss at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, research director Jamie Oliver, concedes there's still no way of knowing whether powerful cyclones have struck before in clusters. 'I think all we can do at this point is say we are seeing a decline in the reef, and we are seeing that cyclones are playing a major role in that decline but we don't know for sure whether it has been as a result of human activities.'


If you listen to the Greens and the Labor Party, Dr Oliver would be pilloried as a climate change sceptic, simply because he says, as I say and as most sensible people say, the science is not settled. I do not know what Senator Milne thinks of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. I think it is a pretty good organisation. It is just one of many organisations, like the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, who say it is not quite as settled as some would have you believe. I said earlier that there is so much research done into trying to justify the Greens and Labor Party's view on climate change and, if you did not have that view—if you happened to be a scientist that had a different view—you would be pilloried. I mentioned many times Professor Bob Carter as being one that the Greens also pillory, but he is as well qualified as others who have a different view. I know, and I do not think I am giving away any confidences by saying, that he knows that he will never, under a Labor government, get any money for any research that is different to what the Labor government wants the results to be.


I mentioned an answer to a question on notice way back in 2009. I will have to get it updated. Over pages and pages it lists hundreds and hundreds of grants—grants of $250,000, $563,000, $255,000. There are pages and pages of them. All the grant money, all the research money, was going to those who would promote the Labor and Greens view on climate change. If you did not have that view, you got no research money. That is the way this whole debate has occurred in Australia.


I want those in the Labor Party to answer this one question: if the carbon tax is such a good thing, why is it that your leader, prior to the 2010 election, promised that there would never be a carbon tax under a government she led?




Senator O'Neill:
  Because an ETS is better, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I see. She promised it would not be there and then she introduced it. Tell me: why did she make that promise and then introduce it? It is a simple question. I am just waiting for the answer. Nobody has ever been able to tell me why, if it is such a good thing, the Labor leader promised not to introduce it. It just shows the hypocrisy, the absolute humbug, of the Labor Party and the Greens political party.


I thought the Labor Party would have learnt their lesson. I cannot talk about other states, but I can talk about Queensland. The Labor Party should have a look at the results of the last election in the seats that used to be traditionally Labor. Capricornia, which is based in Central Queensland and in the Bowen Basin coalfield, is as Labor a seat as you will get. I think we have held it a couple of times in the recorded political history of Australia. Who won it last time? Michelle Landry for the Liberal-National Party. Why? Because she opposed the carbon tax. Why? Because she knew that all of those workers the CFMEU is supposed to be representing understood that they would be losing their jobs. In fact, thousands of people in the Bowen Basin mining industry lost their jobs because of Labor and Green policies. And the Labor Party wonder why they did so poorly in the last election! Australians spoke. Nobody could deny the assertion by Tony Abbott before the last election that the last election would be a referendum on the carbon tax. Everybody knew that. What was the result? I do not need to tell the reduced Labor numbers in the Senate what the result was.


The duplicity and dishonesty of the Labor Party over the carbon tax is symptomatic of their approach to this whole question. The Labor scheme had carbon emissions going up by 2020. Those are their figures, not mine. They were all out there and published by the then department. They showed that Labor's carbon tax would actually increase the emission of carbon. They also showed that the cost of living went up for all Australians. They also showed—and this is beyond doubt—that electricity costs went up and would continue to go up. The only thing that went down was the number of Australian jobs. You have seen a rush of manufacturing jobs from our country to overseas countries. We have all given examples of this before. Just recently the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia was in Weipa—and I am pleased that Senator Waters was there. We heard firsthand how the aluminium industry in Australia is faltering because the bauxite now goes as a raw material straight across to China where they smelt it and make aluminium in far less conducive situations than we do in Australia. There are more carbon emissions when they do it in China than when we do it in Gladstone. This is the Labor Party's view on carbon reduction.


I think we have to keep in mind that Labor's promise with its carbon tax was to reduce Australia's emissions by five per cent. Do I need to remind senators that Australia's emissions of carbon in the world are less than 1.4 per cent? What Labor was going to do with this huge job-destroying carbon tax was reduce Australia's 1.4 per cent of world emissions by five per cent and that was going to save the world. All the biodiversity that Senator Milne talked about, all the forests and all the coral that are disappearing were going to stop if Australia reduced its 1.4 per cent of world carbon emissions by five per cent. How ludicrous! How absolutely ridiculous! How desperately defying logic is the argument of the Greens political party?


I have made my comments about the five per cent, but if that is what is good policy in Australia then I refer to the coalition's policy, which also had a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions but by direct action, things that encouraged people to reduce whatever it was that was causing pollution and particulates. Direct action would work. It is funding things like the wonderful algae project at James Cook University that will help in cleaning emissions from coalmines. They are the sorts of things that the Abbott government's Direct Action Plan would do.


The Labor Party particularly are quoting all of these economists. Have a look at what all the economists in business say about the carbon tax. The Labor Party have got 50 'economists' to sign a bit of paper. What about the thousands of economists in Australia who deal with real life and who demand that the carbon tax go? The Labor Party are quoting President Obama—and I am not quite sure they are quoting him correctly—but I am afraid they did not quote Al Gore, the white knight of the climate change industry. I wonder what the Greens, who used to worship Al Gore, might have thought when Mr Gore turned up with Mr Palmer as he announced he would be voting to remove the carbon tax. I have not heard too much about that at all. I am waiting for someone to give those glowing endorsements of Mr Gore they used to give. To my mind, Mr Gore's actions in relation to the whole climate change debate are circumspect at best, and other people have mentioned that far more relevantly.


They do not talk too much about global warming now because the UK Met Office has said, 'Sorry, it's not warming.' We hear that all of these events are happening more regularly. Remember Cyclone Yasi, up my way? That was the biggest cyclone that ever hit Queensland—since 1917, when there was a bigger one. We do not worry about that. We just think the original Australians must have been responsible for the carbon emissions, when they burnt off large tracts of land before 1917, that caused that much bigger cyclone. But we just forget that; we put it aside; we only talk about Cyclone Yasi. We talk about those huge, destructive, life-taking floods in South-East Queensland a few years ago. They were the biggest floods ever to hit Queensland—that is, the biggest since the early 1950s. We have all of these outrageous claims by those who would have us believe that the science is settled.


I repeat: I am not a scientist. I retain an open mind. I know the climate is changing because, as I mentioned earlier, the world was covered in ice once. It is no longer, so clearly the climate has changed. There used to be a rainforest in the centre of Australia; it is not there anymore. Clearly, the climate has changed. I think every Australian accepts that the climate has changed. But is it man's emissions of carbon that have done that? I do not know. There are respectable scientists who say no, as there are respectable scientists who say yes.


That is why I think Australia has been very foolish in leading the world. Senator Milne would have us believe that China is suddenly going to impose a carbon tax, or that America is going to impose a carbon tax, or that Germany is going to do something serious; but we have all seen the carbon prices and the carbon market, which is fraudulent and subject to manipulation. And this is what the Greens and the Labor Party want us to adopt.


We do have a responsibility to look after our environment. Our Direct Action Plan will help in that regard, and I certainly hope that other parties in the Senate will support it. But we do not need a job-destroying tax to do that. I say that and I know many senators say that, but, more importantly—forget about me and forget about what people will say in this debate about getting rid of the carbon tax—we are a democracy and there could not be a clearer message from the people of Australia to the legislators in this building about what they think of a carbon tax. They want to get rid of it. They understand it destroys jobs. They understand it puts up their cost of living. That is why we must move as quickly as possible to get rid of that soul-destroying tax and all of the paraphernalia that grew up around it, which is the subject of the other bills in the package of bills before the Senate. I certainly urge the Senate to support the bills introduced in this chamber, which reflect the decision made in the lower house to rid Australia of this job-destroying carbon tax.


Debate interrupted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,2,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2014-07-07,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (21:49):  As someone who spent 10 years, prior to entering this place, as a financial adviser, I am appalled at the recent conduct of financial planners within the Commonwealth Bank. I am not going to trawl over the respective facts, which have been canvassed quite thoroughly by the Senate committee and the media; however, I do want to make a few remarks about what did not protect the clients of these, or any other, crooked financial planners, and that is excessive regulation.


Far too often we are told that more and more regulation is required to protect individuals from rogue elements in our society. This is often heard in the arena of financial advice, where people are regularly dealing with their life's wealth—money that is meant to see them through their retirement and assist with a comfortable life. As someone who has spent 10 years in the industry and as a keen investor and private trader on the financial markets for the best part of a decade before that, I have seen a lot and learned a lot along the way. Many things have changed in that time and yet, no matter how much regulation and red tape is implemented by government or industry bodies, there are some things that will never change.


One of those is that investors are ruled by one principle emotion. I suggest it is fear. It is the fear of losing their money or of not having enough of it in the future. Some might say this is two emotions, fear and greed, and that might indeed be the case. But it is from this raw emotional state that clients seek to visit a financial adviser. When a client consults a planner, they have every expectation that the advice they receive is going to be suitable for their circumstances. Alas, that is not always the case, and some advisors are driven by their own greed and see the commission to be received from the sale of investment products as their overarching concern. It is hardly surprising that this is the case given, as ABC journalist Emma Albereci noted recently, it is harder to gain a hairdressing qualification in this country than to qualify as a financial planner.


It goes without saying that these so-called advisors, many of whom are really just slick salesmen, need to be exposed and drummed out of the industry as quickly as possible. By requiring planners to substantially invest in their own education before they can invite others to invest in them, we would go some way to addressing the 'get rich at the client's expense' mentality of a small section of the planning community.


However, there is another group of people that no amount of education will ever stop. These are the criminal elements. The ones prepared to falsify documents, forge signatures and lie in order to enrich themselves. These types of people are in every industry, but few of these 'white-collar crooks'—as they are called sometimes—in other areas have the impact that creating financial ruin can have on the trusting client. Frankly, that is why I am appalled that the Commonwealth Bank still retains the services of some of the planners involved in this most recent scandal and that the Commonwealth Bank funds the stress leave of some of the individuals involved through one of its insurance policies.


I have spoken on a number of occasions in this place about the shonky operators who need to be rubbed out and not given soft passage by ASIC or the FPA or anyone else for that matter. Unfortunately, these warnings have too often fallen on deaf ears. The rogues in the industry were supposed to be cleaned up by the FSR reforms of the early 2000s. These reforms put new regulatory and compliance burdens on securities dealers, which virtually doubled the amount of paperwork overnight. Business overheads skyrocketed, which ultimately means the costs are passed on to clients. This made even simple financial advice prohibitively costly for those of modest means. At that time I was a director of a securities dealer's license holder, which struggled under the compliance burden of the new regime. My clients were a mix of retirees, sophisticated investors, high net worth individuals and regular mum and dad investors, but the new consumer protections did nothing to protect them. They only served to increase my paperwork, their paperwork and the associated costs. The only answer for me was to get big or get out. I chose to merge my business with another reputable, independent, client oriented organisation, but many in a similar position were forced to move to the corporatised product pushers like the Commonwealth Bank.


It is now a matter of record that 80 per cent of the country's financial planners are controlled by the big four banks and the AMP. This is purely and simply a product of a regulatory regime that made the small, personalised advisory business too hard to be in. Clients are still being ripped off—perhaps even more so than ever before. To me it is a clear demonstration that all the rules and regulations in the world will not protect people from unethical or criminal advisers. So, if increased regulation is not the answer, how do we best resolve to protect consumers in the financial services marketplace? The answer can only be education—not just for the planning community but also for their clients and for every other member of the Australian community.


Throughout my time in the industry and since, I have sought to apply myself to helping people understand financial matters. I sought to document the difference between saving, investing and speculating because in many minds there is no real difference. And on that matter they could not be more wrong. If people understood the essential differences, fewer would fall for the slick sales patter. Saving is a skill based on habits that are most effectively learnt whilst young. So too is the discipline of investing. Time is the greatest advantage in the arsenal of the investor and patience one of the key elements of success. Speculation, on the other hand, may be done successfully, at least over the short term, through dumb luck, but success over the longer term requires highly specialised knowledge and enormous discipline. Unfortunately, too many supposed investors today are really only guessing on markets going either up or down. Thus they are speculators rather than investors.


In many ways speculating is just like having a bet, and those who provide the leveraged products for these punters are in reality financial bookmakers. Now some are very honest about this: those who provide financial spread services or contracts for difference describe themselves as such, while in other markets, like the futures markets, they provide a very similar service and marketplace but they require a much deeper capital pool with which to play. In the case of the former, it is interesting to note that the house usually bets against the client knowing that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of them will actually get it wrong. This is a highly simplified analysis, but the principle remains entirely true.


However, these sorts of speculative service providers have a place within our financial market, but they are not for the uneducated because they offer extreme leverage, which can be a wealth hazard. As I mentioned, most of the speculators in these markets will be wrong most of the time, but the truly successful ones have a plan on how to know they are wrong and what to do when they know it. Timing is absolutely everything. That is why I find it so frustrating to see people close to retirement being advised to use their home equity to invest in further leveraged instruments like margin lending, and then encouraged to punt on the market by outfits like Storm Financial and, more recently, the Queensland based Financial Technology Securities. The double leverage game is not investing; it is gambling of the highest order. The risk of loss is huge, and when risk became reality people do not know what to do and so they just hang on and hope. But hope is simply not a strategy.


The only strategy is ensuring the client knows what they are doing and why they are doing it and what action to take when it starts to go wrong. To me that means investor education is the key to ensure they understand the principles and differences attached to saving, investing and speculating. I have sought to do that over many, many years. When I was in the industry I presented seminars at ASX investor briefings, I wrote columns for newspapers, I presented financial reports for the media and I did talkback radio answering listeners' financial questions. I have written trading courses for finance markets; I have provided personalised tuition on how to use leverage and speculate on global equity and commodities markets whilst limiting risk to clients across the world. I wrote a manual for parents on how to help ensure their children's financial future and education while also hopefully learning a few financial skills for themselves. There was a subsequent children's book based on these simple but wildly effective techniques. It was released in 2007 and thus far tens of thousands of copies have been downloaded or given away for free through schools and community organisations to families. I have spoken and provided trading seminars on multiple continents in an attempt to help transfer my experience and knowledge from managing equity portfolios and client accounts to as many people as possible.


It is a start, but I am only one person. Simple lessons are vital to ensure people understand the implications of leverage, volatility and human emotion in the finance world. And this is one area where successive governments have failed miserably. Almost every year I hear of new financial literacy initiatives designed to educate people about how to save and invest. And every year I hear more people demonstrate just how unknowledgeable they are when it comes to money. For all the millions spent by government, they would probably be better served by directing people to the many personal financial blog websites available on the internet. Having spent some weeks recently reviewing many of these sites, I found more wisdom and common sense residing there than in many so-called professional advisory firms.


These blogs are real people applying real principles to bettering their financial lives. Their successes, their failures and the lessons learnt are there for all to see. None of them blame the government for their failures; none of them rely on regulation to protect them. Instead, they rely on personal responsibility to educate themselves through the wisdom of others' experience. They use leverage sparingly and know the difference between investing and speculating. They have emergency savings. They use index funds instead of expensive managed funds and they keep cash buffers for a rainy day to protect them. Within these blogs resides a plethora of common sense. As someone who has produced, sold and promoted both free and expensive investment education products, as someone who has managed investor funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and as someone who has benefited from the prudent use of leveraged financial products to speculate, I can categorically state that these personal blogs may be the best financial education that anyone's money cannot buy.
