"Allison, Senator Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—I need to continue my explanation of the amendments put last Thursday. Amendments (3) to (8) are to do with public consultation by the minister. Amendment (8) clarifies that, if the Australian Heritage Commission finds a place has national heritage values, the minister cannot refuse to list the place or all of its national heritage values unless it has complied with the additional public consultation process. Amendment (9), which is about the inclusion of a place on the National Heritage List, changes the current provisions concerning the making of the final listing decision so as to be consistent with the amended nomination and assessment process. It relates to the standard listing procedure only and not to the emergency listing procedure, which is outlined in amendment (16).
Amendments (10) to (16) are on emergency listing. Amendments (10) to (15) are relatively technical and do not have any substantial impact. They clarify the wording concerning the emergency listing process. Amendment (16) alters the decision making process for places included on the list via the emergency listing process, to account for the additional consultation process. Amendments (17) to (18) are relatively technical and account for the additional consultation process. Amendments (19) and (20) concern disclosure of the Australian Heritage Commission assessments and advice, and they ensure that the heritage council's assessments can be disclosed during the additional consultation period. 
That is really the crux of our set of amendments—the need for disclosure of heritage council decisions with regard to which sites are of heritage significance. We think that at the very least the government ought to agree—in fact it did agree, in my talks with Minister Kemp and his advisers over the last few months—that this disclosure keeps the government accountable. It does not stop the minister from deciding not to list. It does not stop the minister from saying, `That listing won't happen at this point in time.' What it does is allow there to be disclosure of a difference between what the heritage council says ought to be listed—that is, what is assessed to be of heritage value— and that which the minister determines.
I do not know whether, Senator Hill, you have had a chance to look at these more carefully over the weekend—and I am sure you have spent most of it on this legislation—but I remind you that this was the fourth in a line of different models that we attempted to persuade the government to address. Clearly, I think most of us in this place would like to see the heritage council determine what is on that list. We do accept that there is a political judgment to be made in some circumstances. However, the very least that should happen is that this requirement for disclosure be passed. Amendments (21) to (40)—and I remind you, Senator Hill, in case you missed it before, that the government did agree with us at some earlier stage but now chooses not to—mirror those discussed previously in relation to Commonwealth heritage listing processes. 
Before finishing my remarks on this debate, I thought I would point to some of the statements that have been made on listing. As I said, it is a crucial part of this whole bill. The protection or otherwise of heritage sites can be politicised, a matter just for the minister to determine, or a process whereby there is public involvement when there is disagreement. So when the council determines that a site is worthy of listing and the minister decides otherwise, I think it is reasonable to say that there should be a process which involves the public. I will quote from the joint letter that was sent to me from the Humane Society, the WWF and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. It contains a set of recommended amendments, and I think they are important. They say:
The bill should be amended to include a requirement that the minister be compelled to designate all heritage values of a place as national heritage values or Commonwealth heritage values if he or she is satisfied that they meet the national or Commonwealth heritage criteria. Further, there should be a presumption in favour of the inclusion or retention of a place or values on those lists if there is uncertainty regarding whether the place satisfies the listing criteria or continues to have certain heritage values.
I quote from that document because it is typical of the positions that were put by conservation groups. It does go to the absolute discretion of the minister to list or otherwise. As I said, this seems to me to be central.
The Democrats did understand the political reality and it is the case that this provides better protection for heritage—there is no question about that. But again, at the end of the day it comes down to the will of the minister to apply that protection. We think that, in terms of accountability and of being able to publicly demonstrate what is going on, this amendment is reasonable—even more than reasonable. This was compromise No. 4 as far as we were concerned. I strongly urge the minister to consider supporting it. We thought there was no opposition to this at the end of the day by the government, but it seems that the minister has changed his mind. I would be interested in the minister indicating to the Senate what his deliberations have been on this matter.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The government does not support the package of amendments before the chamber now but it does support the general direction of many of those amendments. As I said on the last occasion, there has been a very long process of debate on the listing process not only between the political parties involved but with the various interest groups. Whilst I could go through each of the amendments and express the government's concern about particular aspects of them, I do not know that it is a constructive use of time in the circumstances, whereby I can say that at least a number of these amendments have been picked up—but, we would argue, improved—in amendments that are to be debated further along the line. 
So, in terms of the efforts Senator Allison has made in improving—from her perspective—the listing processes, if the Senate does pass the foreshadowed amendments she will see that they have achieved some of the outcomes she has been seeking. In those instances, efforts have been made to improve the drafting so that, if the bill is passed in terms of the foreshadowed amendments rather than these amendments, the government will be more confident that they will achieve the outcomes which Senator Allison and others within the heritage community have been seeking. That would be my response to the block of 40 amendments we are looking at.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The Australian Greens support the amendments and think they are good ones. I think it is the proper place for me to ask the minister, because it crosses some of these amendments, for a response in general to the report by the Australian National Audit Office for January to June 2003. It is an audit activity report which I am sure the minister has. Page 74 says that the office made six recommendations to Environment Australia which aim, firstly, to improve the consistency and quality of referrals made under the act, which is the act we are dealing with; secondly, to address the risks from referrals of staged developments that may circumvent the objects of the act; thirdly, to improve awareness of the requirements of the act; fourthly, to strengthen monitoring and review arrangements; fifthly, to finalise compliance and enforcement procedures and guidelines, ensuring that there are timely and effective responses to all potential breaches of the act; and, finally, to enhance the quality of public reporting on the administration of the act. The report says that Environment Australia has agreed with all the recommendations. Could the minister explain how Environment Australia is going to remedy those shortcomings that were listed by ANAO? ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I read that audit report, and it did seem to be generally supportive of the processes implementing the EPBC legislation—which was good, considering that it is new legislation—but it did suggest some modifications, as indicated by Senator Brown. I am told that the minister has accepted that advice in each instance and that the department is currently developing the ways in which it will meet the commitment that it has made in regard to the processes that relate to each of the particular recommendations. So my advice is that that is work in progress. Senator Brown will understand that, because the audit report is very recent. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—Thank you. If the minister has any written response to that report, I would be pleased to see it. Because it crosses a number of parts of the legislation, I ask the minister about the report in this morning's Age on the erection of the Telstra tower on the Patriarchs group of rocky mountains on Flinders Island. I quote from that report by Melissa Fyfe, the environment reporter:
An 850-metre-long swathe—in places 12-metres wide—has been cut through a patch of the rare dogwood Pomaderris intermedia, listed under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act.
The Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment is investigating the incident.
Telstra said its contractors were told only to make a 45-centimetre trench for a power line under an existing narrow track.
Another plant, Isopogon ceratophyllus or horny cone bush, listed as vulnerable under the legislation, was also bulldozed, along with many centuries-old slow-growing grass trees.
The 30-metre tower, part of Telstra's mobile phone roll-out on the island, was approved despite the area's zoning as visually significant under the island's planning scheme.
It goes on to say how the local plant expert Mr John Whinray, a very famous local resident, had come across the environmental destruction—and there is a picture of the cobra greenhooded orchid recently found on Flinders Island by Mr Whinray. 
Could the minister tell me what progress has been made in discovering why Telstra made the extraordinary swathe—and there is a picture of it—through this particular high conservation area on Flinders Island? Could he tell me whether the species that are endangered there have federal listing or listing under this legislation? What is there in this legislation that is going to specifically whack people like Telstra and/or its contractors who create havoc like this which cannot be undone? Mr Whinray points out that he does not think that what has been done there will ever be undone.
This follows on my noting of the Auditor-General's report about the difficulty of sometimes getting to the very people who might breach components of the act—and if Telstra does not know then who does? If Telstra is able to behave in such an environmentally irresponsible fashion, then what can we expect of other enterprises which do not have the wherewithal of Telstra or their stated avocation for the environment?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I have asked for specific advice relating to that matter. I do not have that to hand but will get it. This is obviously another instance where the heritage—and it sounds as if this is principally natural heritage values—is protected by both the state and the Commonwealth according to the values that are protected. If they are national heritage values then, as defined, they would be protected under the Commonwealth legislation, and there are very significant penalties attached to that legislation for breach. Whilst I am not very familiar with the Tasmanian legislation, I assume there are penalties attached to that legislation if it relates to an asset that is protected by the state of Tasmania. But in relation to the detail of this particular action and whether it affects any Commonwealth values, that is something that I need some specific advice on and I will report to the Senate when I get that advice.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I thank the minister for that because I am very interested to hear what information there may be on this matter. On the matter of Tasmanian heritage, it is spotty down there. The breach is very often what is honoured and extensive habitat, for example, of rare and endangered plant and other species which are listed on both the national protected list and the Tasmanian protected list are repeatedly bulldozed in Tasmania under the regional forest agreement. 
The minister might like to comment at this stage because it is the next one that is very important. He will be aware that there has been an application to Dr Kemp, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, to approve the Meander Dam at the headwaters of the Meander River. The planning authorities in Tasmania decided not to go ahead with this project because, amongst other things, the area is a threatened habitat and a particularly rich one for the endangered tiger quoll in Tasmania, which, if my understanding of this is correct, is listed under this piece of legislation, the EPBC.
Not accepting the umpire's ruling on this, the Tasmanian Labor government of Premier Jim Bacon, who is the Minister for National Parks, hurried through legislation after the land and environment umpire had said, `No, you cannot proceed with the dam,' to override the heritage legislation in Tasmania so that it will proceed. Now the gatekeeper on this is the federal minister. I do not see how on earth, if we are to have faith in this legislation for the protection of the species and Australia's heritage, he could give the go-ahead for the flooding of a prime habitat—as found by the planning commission in Tasmania—for the tiger quoll, a large carnivorous marsupial with its healthiest stronghold in Tasmania. The matter is now before the minister for the environment, Dr Kemp.  
I know there is a great deal of anxiety about this particular habitat in the headwaters of the Meander River both locally and statewide. It is a very important test case as to whether this EPBC Act that we are dealing with is going to be honoured by the Australian government. I wonder whether the minister could tell the committee what the progress is as far as the minister making the decision is concerned—and I think it can only have one conclusion. Can he tell us whether there is a time line and what the process is that is being undertaken to ensure that this process is not listed by political actions, like those high-handed actions of the Tasmanian Premier and government just a couple of weeks ago?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I am advised that the process is advanced and that Dr Kemp determined that the proposed action was a controlled action in terms of the EPBC legislation. That triggers an evaluation process which has been taking place. Dr Kemp will have to make a decision, ultimately, on whether the project can proceed in terms of EPBC legislation. Advice to him on that issue from the department has not yet been received but I understand it is not too far away.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I wonder if the minister would be good enough to provide the committee with the terms of reference of the minister's inquiry to the department, which species are involved in that terms of reference, what the process is for making an evaluation and indeed if there is a time line. By terms of reference, I mean the minister's briefing, in whichever way it might be, as to what he needs to know about the issue of the Meander Dam and the threat it poses to this important habitat for the tiger quoll—and, I understand, a number of other species—and what other matters are entered into.
The other matter that impressed the Tasmanian planning commission was the failure of the government and the lobby group involved to be able to show that there were the financial benefits that were touted from this dam. There was very good evidence that it was not going to be as financially beneficial as pointed out. I know the minister will have the planning commission's full report on his desk. And I know that financial matters like that will be subservient to the environmental consideration being made by the minister about such an important endangered species as the tiger quoll. I would be very pleased to hear if there is an expected date of decision and what the parameters are of the advice the minister has sought.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The reference is on the web site and the details of the proposed action and the triggers as identified by the proponent are referred to in that reference. Detail, as it relates to any particular known endangered species, should have been included in that reference and be on the web site. As I said, the advice of the department to the minister was that it amounted to a controlled action and therefore triggered the Commonwealth legislation. Dr Kemp, I am told, accepted that advice. That leads to a process, as set out in the legislation, that enables public submissions to be lodged. No doubt the proponent has put further information, and that information is being evaluated by the department. Advice will be given to Dr Kemp. In the end he is obliged to take into account other circumstances, which is the balance that is created within the EPBC Act, and no doubt he will do so.
At the time of the drafting of the legislation that was one of the differences the government had with Senator Brown because Senator Brown was of the view that other circumstances should not be taken into account in the final evaluation process. It might be that the state government is putting an economic argument to Dr Kemp through his department; I do not know. As I said, that is work in progress within the department at the moment. I was asked whether we had an indication of a closing date and I am told that we do not but I have also been told that the matter is expected to be completed in the reasonably near future. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I thank the minister for that. Yes, I am very strong on the environment being given pre-eminence when it comes to environmental legislation. I would remind the minister that it is not unusual thinking. The World Trade Organisation legislation, which the government signed and put through this parliament in 1986, was made on the basis that economic considerations were paramount, and the environment and social justice were considered zip when it came to making decisions by that international body, with Australia's authority. So there is a precedent for not being across the board in an assessment of a piece of legislation. In this case, the environment should be seen as pre-eminent. That being said, can the minister tell the committee what the other considerations are—I know they will be listed on the web site—and whether these include the economic considerations and, of course, those political considerations which come down to lobbying from the pressure groups in Tasmania who are in favour of the dam, including both of the big political parties? I wonder if the minister could say how the financial assessment, which is the chief one of those other considerations, is being made by the department? Does it have expertise? Is the minister seeking other advice, or is he going to go on the advice of the planning commission in Tasmania or will he simply take the advice from the biased point of view of the Tasmanian government?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The usual practice is that the department would seek verification of a submission that did argue some economic benefit. Exactly how the department is doing that in this instance, I do not know. If Senator Brown wants to know, I can make those inquiries and see what information is available. If Dr Kemp is uncertain about any particular issue in the advice given to him by the department, he can require further work to be commissioned. In the end, it is his decision and he must be satisfied. I am sure Dr Kemp will ensure that he will make these very difficult decisions on the best evidence available. Whilst we have great respect for the states, the statutory obligation is on the Commonwealth if it is a matter of national environmental significance, and I would expect that Dr Kemp would exercise that responsibility with great care.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I would be pleased if the minister would furnish me with the information about how the assessment is being made and who is involved, so I thank him for making that offer. Secondly, because water policy is so important at the moment and this decision cannot be extricated from that, how is the government going to assess—because it must be built into this decision—the cost to the community of an environmental flow down the Meander River below this dam in the future, because that is a cost against the dam? Could the minister also explain how the current evolution of government water policy is going to affect this decision by the minister on the Meander Dam? There are very big environmental as well as other social and economic factors involved there. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I do not know the answer to that. The evolution of Commonwealth water policy is, firstly, to determine that important natural values are not lost through overextraction—in other words, that extraction for commercial, recreation or other uses is maintained at a sustainable level—and, furthermore, that the usage of such water goes to highest value outcomes. The determination of that is never easy, particularly if you are trying to equate, for example, a recreational benefit against a commercial benefit. But, because of our prejudices, we think there is room for the market to assist in that regard, certainly between commercial uses, and thus we are seeking to encourage and support regimes that properly cost water, that allow transfer of water to higher value outcomes and that in other ways seek to reduce waste and low-value usage. But all of that is after assessment and support for maintaining the flows that are at least necessary to preserve the health of the natural system.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The Meander River currently has a natural flow but has water extracted for various downstream purposes. If a dam comes along, can the minister foresee circumstances in which the environmental flow of a river such as that will have a price put on it?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I think what I said is better than trying to attach to environmental flows a somewhat artificial financial figure. Our preference—and Senator Brown indicated the direction of the government's proposed reforms—is that an assessment be made of the flows that are necessary, not just simply the quantity of water but the timing of the flows and so on, to conserve the natural system and those environmental values that are obviously important to us all and that commercial exploitation is subject to that necessary minimum. It is not easy to apply in practice, but I think approaching it in that way is actually better than the approach that I think is being advocated by Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The obvious question that comes from that is: how do you make an assessment that you can take away part of the flow of a natural watercourse and maintain its natural health? That is absurd. As soon as you start to interfere with the ebb and flow and the rise and fall of a river's natural reaction to precipitation and other factors, you start to have an impact on the environment. I want to correct the minister here: it is not within the realm of human capability to be able to subtract water from a river and still maintain its natural environmental health. What has to be judged here is how much detrimental impact you will have on the environment by taking water away and how far you will allow that to go.
Maybe as a result of the discussion about the Snowy Mountains getting 28 per cent returned to it—and I saw in this morning's Age that even that is not sure—there is some magic percentage below 100 at which you can draw a line and the river will not be affected. That is absurd; it is not true. What you are measuring is how much detriment to the environment you are going to allow to happen. There is no argument or debate in that; it is just a fact—it is just how life is on this planet. There is a lot of obfuscation and green wash that gets in there to say that we can take away 72 per cent of a river's flow and we have done the right thing to ensure what is called an environmental flow, which is a misnomer for a massive impact on the environment—that is, the water will get down there in a way that we can tout as a good thing for it and maybe we will not have to look at the damage that continues to occur through taking that water away. 
The Meander Dam is going to be the first in-stream dam on this river. It is one of those rarities in Australia these days where there is not a dam on the river—but it is coming. The people who are proposing that would put their shoulder behind another dozen or so dams being proposed in north-east Tasmania and down the east coast in the near future. I do not think that the minister is right in saying that there is going to be an outcome which says you measure what is good for the environment and then people can pay for what else is required to come out of the river. It will be the other way around: people will fight over the water they can get out of the river and the highest bidder will pay. Under those circumstances, it leaves the environment with no leverage, unless the government has policy. I am trying to establish what the government's policy is for defending the inevitable impact of subtraction of water out of rivers. Where is that defined? Is it true that it is not defined but left for an environmental grab-bag at the end of the day: the old leftover mentality of the age of materialism and resource extraction? I think that that is the case. If it is not, I would be pleased to hear from the minister as to the defined policy his government has in ensuring that the current circumstances for rivers around Australia are maintained or improved when it comes to the environment and that we just do not get terminology like minimal impact, mitigation or environment flow—whatever that might mean.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I am not sure that I can say much more. I have outlined the structure of the best practice proposal that the Commonwealth is taking to the forthcoming COAG meeting. It is obvious that, whenever water is extracted, it does have some consequences on the environment. If you adopt a policy of no extraction of water from Australia's river systems, that would be an uncomfortable experience for all of us who live in Adelaide, which is now totally reliant on extraction from the River Murray. How do we try and assess what quantity can be extracted sustainably? That is not an exact science, but you obviously take the advice of specialists and, in the end, make a judgment on the basis of that advice. If you find that you have made a mistake, as we have on many river systems in Australia that perhaps had not been thought through in quite that way, then you have to find a way of winding back the level of extraction. That is not easy either. One way in which you may do it in the public interest is to purchase water for environmental outcomes.
I have a little more information in relation to the Meander Dam proposal, in part to modify slightly my earlier answer. I am now told that, in the first instance, the proposal was assessed by the Tasmanian government on behalf of the Commonwealth under an assessment bilateral agreement. However, the Commonwealth then stopped the clock on the assessment process by requiring further information. Further submissions have been made by both the proponent and the Tasmanian government and they are being taken into account. I am further told that, in this instance, the department sought independent economic advice from ACIL Tasman. No doubt that will also be taken into account by the minister when he gets to make his ultimate decision.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—On a different river system, has there been any approach to the Commonwealth about the Apsley River in eastern Tasmania, which drains the southern boundary of the Douglas Apsley National Park, with a view to extracting water from that either in the park or downstream for purposes of the developments on the coast just to the east of that river?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—Minister, we raised questions here last week on the subject of those Norfolk Island sites. Could you indicate whether any further information is forthcoming on those? In particular, are you able to give the Senate the commitment that the nine properties with Crown tenure on Norfolk Island—the ones that were nominated for entry onto the RNE back in 1997 that we talked about—will be transferred onto the Commonwealth Heritage List before they are sold?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—There is a long answer to that question, which goes back to the whole process of land reform on Norfolk Island. In relation to the nine properties that Senator Allison has referred to, I am told that it is not a straightforward issue. I gather that each of these properties has a different mix of tenures and none of them will be wholly owned by the Commonwealth. That obviously does not affect the listing under the RNE but whether they would be eligible for listing under the new legislation as a Commonwealth property would depend on whether that bit of the land that is in Commonwealth tenure at the moment meets the standards as set out in the legislation.
I have a lot more here on the complexity of the issue, which is probably not what Senator Allison wants to hear. The bottom line is that I cannot give an assurance that the processes that are under way in Norfolk Island under their so-called land initiative will be put on hold whilst these matters are assessed under this new piece of legislation if it passes in this place.

I would be interested in the complexity you are talking about. Maybe that document could be tabled, Minister, if you think that is appropriate. I am assuming from your response that you cannot stop the sell off of this land—otherwise known as land initiative. Firstly, is that correct? Secondly, is it possible at least to have a commitment from the government that those nine areas would be assessed prior to the land initiative or sell-off of those properties? If it is not possible to do that, why not?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

If they are assessed before the enactment of the legislation, that is one thing; but what happens if they are sold between the time of the assessment and the enactment of the legislation? That is the key point. I would have thought that if they are sold before the enactment of the legislation they do not have any protection from it. So there is not much point in being assessed unless there is also a commitment to transfer the properties onto the Commonwealth Heritage List or, if they are no longer Commonwealth, to transfer them onto the National Heritage List.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I can provide further information on the nine properties that were of concern to Senator Allison, which deals with the tenure and the complexity of each site. I will table that document. It is headed `Norfolk Island Landscape Area nominations'. I have some information on the processes under the land initiative. I need to seek some further advice as to whether I can table that. I suspect that I can. It seems to be factual; nothing unkind is said in the note about the Australian Democrats or anything like that. Having said that, I still do not think it specifically answers the last question asked by Senator Allison. She asked whether she could be assured that the Commonwealth pieces of land within the nine properties that she has outlined would not be sold before assessment under the new legislation. So it would be after enactment and assessment. This is assuming that they met the criteria under the old Australian Heritage Commission Act assessment regarding whether they should also be included within a Commonwealth list.

To some extent it is hypothetical, but we are dealing with hypothetical situations because we do not know when this land will be sold. All we know is that it is up for sale.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—Because each of these properties that Senator Allison is referring to includes a range of tenure, although that does not affect listing under the existing Commonwealth legislation, only those parts that are Commonwealth owned would be eligible for listing under the new legislation, and that requires a separate assessment as to whether those pieces that are Commonwealth owned would individually be eligible for inclusion. I suspect that that is not a straightforward issue. It would be something that would be considered during the assessment process. I think that is fairly clear cut but I do not know the timing in relation to the proposed sale of any of those Commonwealth pieces. That falls under a different portfolio than that of Dr Kemp.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The vast majority of the land is being transferred to the Victorian government and it will, as I understand it, form an extension of their national park. A small piece of land is to be transferred to the local council, and I do not think that is of particular concern to Senator Brown. But there is a remaining area, in which a number of the historic buildings are located, which the Commonwealth wishes to dispose of—it no longer being of need, in defence terms. That process is ongoing. The Commonwealth has given certain commitments in terms of restraints on the use of that property to ensure that the heritage values are preserved. The EPBC legislation does not trigger sales per se; it triggers actions that are potentially contrary to national heritage values. Therefore it would be the issue of usage of the land, as it might affect any national heritage value, that could cause that legislation to be triggered—and it has not reached that stage at this time.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—Does the Commonwealth not see the need for national heritage in the sense of a competing needs spectrum? The minister just said that the historic buildings at Point Nepean are now surplus to the Commonwealth's needs. There is again this idea—in this market fundamentalist age—that if there is not a dollar coming out of it, or a use which contributes in this case to government performance outside the cultural and natural environment, then there is not a value put there. I ask the minister how on earth he could believe that if he is going to dispose of such heritage it is not going to be eyed off for a different function. Is he not, by his own philosophy, saying to people with money— that is, to the market—`See what you can do with this piece of national heritage'? Does not the very fact of divesting it immediately expose it to market control of its future? Doesn't the government see other values, outside the market, which are important to communities and to the nation when it comes to heritage? I think this is right at the crux of what we are debating here today. Ought not that value to the nation have been assessed more clearly before the government began to divest itself, saying that there was not a need for this heritage being in national ownership? I think many constituents would say, `There is a need for it, a very important need.' It is not based on the dollar sign but on other aesthetic, historical, cultural and environmental values which are part of the needs of a healthy community, when you view it from all aspects.

It is a very important built and cultural heritage asset that the government would wish to see conserved. Where the government differ from Senator Brown is that we do not necessarily see public ownership as the only way to conserve such an asset. In fact we are finding that public ownership in some circumstances is not always the best way, if you look at the state of quite a lot of Australian built heritage that is in public ownership—that governments have trouble funding the proper maintenance and conservation of these assets. If it is therefore possible to find a private sector purchaser who is prepared to fund the proper conservation of these assets whilst at the same time gaining some economic return for them, we believe it may be possible to achieve a win-win outcome: not only is the heritage preserved but it is also properly conserved.

But, without detailing that next step because that would be premature, the government has taken on board this and certain other issues that were raised at the estimates committee and will ensure that the values are properly protected for not only this generation but future generations as well.

We have here a process which is under way—it is not being considered; it is under way. There is great community apprehension about it. The minister says, `No, be assured the heritage values will be protected.' It is a very simple thing, then, to say how that is going to happen.

There certainly are purchasers who believe that they can obtain an economic return from the property whilst, at the same time, conserve the heritage values in the short term and the long term. There is a lot of money that needs to be spent in the short term. The Commonwealth is actually expending quite a little at the moment, but there is a great deal more that is going to be needed to be spent if these buildings are going to be properly conserved. The government is considering these matters and, before moving to the next step in relation to a disposition of the asset, the details will be made clear.

It was my understanding that the assessments had been done and that this site would be transferred to the Commonwealth list. Perhaps the minister could advise whether or not that will be the case. Minister, have you considered whether section 14 of the EPBC Act could be used to put in place conservation agreements covering these parts of the site?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The minister has said that the government is looking at a number of ways of protecting, variously, heritage and conservation values. The minister has said that people who are interested in developing the sites of these heritage buildings can conserve the heritage values and get on with their projects. What is missing, if that is the case, is the government's list of heritage requirements and the means by which they are going to be strapped down in perpetuity. The developer has no trouble with the heritage values being protected. The government is going to protect the heritage values. We have a process under way, but the government has no extant plan. It should have one. It should be saying to the public at large that is concerned about Point Nepean: `Here is your guarantee. Look at this. Our cards are on the table.' But it is not doing that. It is saying, `Trust us—coming down the line is some sort of formula that you will be happy with.' People do not accept that because, when that has been said in the past on matters like this, it has been found to be hollow, full of shortcomings and a let-down for those people who see the conservation of heritage values as important.
If we are dinkum about this the developers that are interested, the government that is giving assurances and the public that is worried should all be informed on the same basis. The problem is that the government and the developers know what is going on but the public does not. It is time the public was let into this. I do not feel at all reassured by what the minister has had to say. Where is the heritage values guarantee—the HVG? People do not believe the government is going to protect the heritage values and they certainly do not believe that developers who buy at a prodigious cost and develop at a prodigious extra cost to make a profit are going to have heritage values right at the forefront of their minds. It just does not work that way. I say to Minister Hill and, through him, Minister Kemp: for goodness sake come out with this insurance plan on the heritage values. It is missing. You should have it at the front. If you are happy with it you should be able to give it to the public, but you do not have one that guarantees these values. So far the clearest assurance I have had is that the developers—people who want to make this into a project—can conserve the heritage values.

Senator Brown will not accept it, but the government is also and that is why it has been taking advice on the site from the Australian Heritage Commission. What I cannot do at the moment is detail the protections the government will implement because, as I have said several times already today, that matter is still under consideration. But the information about the form of protection would be made publicly available before the next stage of the process. I think it is reasonable that, before we proceed to the next stage of the disposal process, the public be made aware of the protective regime we will put in place to ensure that the values are protected against subsequent purchasers.

Could the minister provide details of what specific Commonwealth assets could be caught in that time zone? It is a similar question to that about the Norfolk Island properties. Does that relate to any other Commonwealth assets that are scheduled for sale but also have items on the Heritage List, and what are the timing and implications for them?
In particular, I ask the question about the police cottage at Yarralumla Bay here in Canberra. My understanding is that this is an asset that has already been sold.

The commission has not made a decision on whether the place should be entered in the register.

Can the minister confirm that as of today Australian troops in East Timor will no longer be classified as being on warlike service? Doesn't this have significant tax implications for those affected? Can the minister confirm that as a result of this change the average infantryman could suffer a $190 a week cut to their take-home pay from next week? Is the minister aware that there is widespread confusion amongst troops in East Timor and their families in Australia over this change, with Defence simply advising individuals that they may be eligible for an exemption under the Income Tax Assessment Act?

Minister, I am still not clear from that whether you are confirming the advice from Defence that soldiers may be eligible for exemptions under section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act and whether you expect them to make those applications while patrolling the West Timor border. It is not clear to them and it is not clear to me. Why have the troops in East Timor been left in a situation where they do not know what the impact will be on their pay packet from today, and their families do not know what income their family member will be earning for them in the coming weeks?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The taxation circumstances differ between an operation that is warlike and one that is non-warlike. In many ways it is a celebration that the government has been able to accept advice from the ADF that the circumstances in which our forces are operating in East Timor can no longer reasonably be classified as warlike. It is true that the tax consequences now change, but it has occurred in circumstances that most Australians would be very pleased to hear about. Speaking generally, if it is a warlike operation then the whole of the salary as well as the allowances are tax free; if it is not warlike, that does not apply. So, yes, there will be a taxation consequence as a result of the government accepting that advice and making that decision, but it has not been made for any taxation reason; it is simply a reflection of the circumstances of the particular operation. Considerable advice was in fact given to the forces that this decision was being made and about when it was to come into effect.

In fact, to ensure that the government was reasonable to the forces, who we very much value and appreciate, we decided that even though the decision on warlike conditions was changing in the middle of a rotation the allowances could continue as though the declaration had not been made. So the normal thing would be that when the operation ceased to be warlike not only would the taxation consequences change but also the allowance would be reduced. We decided that, because this was mid-rotation, the best thing to do in the circumstances for the soldiers' wellbeing was to continue the $125 per day allowance until the end of this rotation.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-08-18,"—Last week in question time Senator Marshall asked me a question on private health insurance. I have a brief answer. Under the National Health Act 1953 there is no basis for funds to reject applications for membership having regard to a person's health status. If the senator can provide details of funds that are purporting to reject applications from people with mental illness, I will instruct my department to raise the matter with the funds.
I note that all people joining a health fund, or upgrading to a higher table of benefits, may be subject to waiting periods of 12 months for pre-existing ailments, illnesses or conditions. The pre-existing ailment rule is intended to protect members of health funds from people joining health insurance once they become sick and claiming benefits for immediate treatment. However, under the National Health Act, funds can only restrict benefits for pre-existing ailments for 12 months after a person joins a fund or transfers to a higher level of cover. After that they are eligible to receive benefits on the same basis as all other members. 
In 2000-01 some 100,000 of a total 275,000 hospital separations for mental illness were in the private sector. It is true that most patients compulsorily admitted are treated in the public sector, as many private hospitals do not have the required facilities. However, seven per cent of separations for compulsorily admitted patients in 2000-01 were from private hospitals. I note that the state and territory governments are responsible for the provision and regulation of mental health services in their respective jurisdictions. States and territories are responsible via their own legislation for determining the requirements that hospitals must achieve, whether public or private, before patients can be compulsorily admitted.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2003-08-18,"—On 14 August, Senator Ridgeway asked me a question without notice regarding year 12 retention rates for Indigenous students. I undertook to provide additional information. I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
The Minister for Education, Science and Training has provided the following additional information in relation to the question asked by Senator Ridgeway.
In 2002, the apparent retention rate to Year 12 for Indigenous students was 38.0% compared with 76.3% for their non-Indigenous counterparts. Apparent retention rates for Indigenous students have been improving gradually over time. Year 12 apparent retention rates for Indigenous students were 29.1% in 1996 compared to 38% in 2002.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-08-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to health.
I specifically wanted to tackle the issue of the non-attendance of the Minister for Health and Ageing at the national health summit this past weekend. The minister is quoted in the Canberra Times on Saturday, 16 August as saying: 
I am concerned that the summit is in danger of being hijacked by NSW for its own interests.
How outrageous and reprehensible a proposition it is that someone could seek to attend a national health summit and put forward their own case and speak in their own interests! Isn't that what a summit is meant to be all about? Isn't that the way summits are meant to work? Did the minister perhaps think that New South Wales should put forward the Commonwealth's position? Given that the minister did not attend then it may be right that the Australian people could be forgiven for thinking that New South Wales would put forward the Commonwealth's position.
The language the minister chooses to use also tells us about her frame of mind when tackling this issue. The minister uses some nice descriptive words about those attending the summit—words such as `hijacked'. There is nothing like resorting to the language of fear and personal attack when you are trying to get your message across! What an insult to the many organisations, professions and individuals and the states and territories that attended the national health summit. Here we have a minister saying that because New South Wales is going to advocate a position it is hijacking the summit. Everyone else who wants to attend the summit is therefore, by assumption, just there to behave in a craven way to the interests of New South Wales. I know that the New South Wales minister for health and, indeed, the Premier of New South Wales are very strong advocates for their state and the interests of the people of their state, but I did not realise they were capable of hijacking the entire national health summit.
Perhaps, though, what this really shows is the abject failure of leadership this minister is offering to the health industry throughout this country. Essentially, she is saying that unless she gets her own way she will not engage in any discussion with anyone else on any other issue. Unless you sign up to her one offer you cannot discuss any other reform agenda within the health industry. Basically, it is the good old-fashioned `sign or reject' scenario. You cannot debate the future delivery of health care services or debate a more collaborative approach until you fundamentally accept her offer. She will not even have a reasonable debate with the other ministers for health about ways of modifying or changing her offer. Instead, all of a sudden we have the position being put that she is the one who has made the big increase in health funding and no-one else has ever made any.
I do not know about the other states but in my state of Western Australia the state government delivered a nine per cent increase in health funding in this budget, and in the previous year there was a six per cent increase in health funding. That is a fairly good indication that there are going to be continued real increases in health funding in Western Australia. I accept that a lot of those increases had to recover from the complete sham and debacle under the Court government's delivery of health services so there is a lot of catch-up to take place, but they are significant real increases in health funding. Western Australia, like most other states, publish these great things called forward estimates, where they actually outline their future plans for health expenditure. Apparently, that is just far too hard for the minister for health.
The minister for health has suddenly discovered the reform agenda that state and territory ministers for health have been trying to get her to talk about for some time. But she only wants to talk about reform on her terms—and that is after you have locked yourself into a funding model and a reform agenda that I do not think is actually going to deal with things like the decline in bulk-billing. My colleague Senator Forshaw referred in question time today to figures that have shown the decline in bulk-billing in rural New South Wales. Those figures also show that people in towns where GPs do not bulk-bill use emergency departments 60 per cent more often than those in towns where doctors do bulk-bill. So unless the government does something about fixing this fundamental problem about the lack of access to bulk-billing services, it is just cost shifting onto the states. It will send all those people to the A and E departments, lock us into a funding model and then perhaps it might talk about reform if we are lucky. Then there is the question of access to GPs throughout Western Australia. The minister, in talking about her reform agenda, does not actually want to go to the heart of how the reform agenda is failing.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-08-18,"—I am so pleased to be standing here to discuss and debate health with the Labor opposition, in particular to debate Senator Webber's comment at the end of her speech about access to GPs. This is the key: access to adequate health care. There have been a lot of smoke and mirrors and a lot of misleading and deceptive statements in the media by the Labor Party with respect to health. Let us get a few facts on the table and make a few of these things clear. The first is about the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, and her willingness to attend health ministerial meetings. She has attended every—I repeat, every—scheduled ministerial health meeting. She does not attend events that are set up for political purposes. That is really the point. She does not particularly support the summit that has been referred to today in question time when she knows she is going to be set up and browbeaten. She does support summits that are debating these important reform issues in the health arena, and she is more than willing to participate in those. She has participated in my state of Tasmania and, I know, throughout Australia in terms of the key stakeholder groups. But she wants the clean air of a post-Australian health care agreement, and not to be browbeaten and used as a political pawn in this whole debate.
Let us focus on this health care agreement and what has been proposed. This is a historic offer, unprecedented in Australian political history: a $42 billion offer that is a $10 million increase on the amount in the previous five years. Those are the facts; they are on the table. If you believed what you read from the Labor Party in the media you would think there are actually funding cuts. What nonsense! What absolutely outrageous misinformation, deception and misleading comments. There is going to be a 17 per cent increase in real terms. We are talking about a 30 to 40 per cent increase.
In my state of Tasmania we are talking about a $220 million increase on $700 million—it is going to increase to $920 million over the next five years. What does that mean for Tasmania and Tasmanians? It is no good just having point scoring and political debate unless you look at what the impact is on the people. I will tell you. We have a waiting list for surgery in Tasmania of over 6,000 people. I know what will happen to that waiting list if they take up the offer: it will go down. Two things have to happen. First, they have to sign up to the offer and the agreement. Secondly, the waiting list will go down and waiting times will also go down. But the key issue here is whether Labor are going to hold good and support the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. The question for those on the other side of the chamber is: will they? I seek an interjection—in fact, I would welcome it—saying, `Yes, we will support the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.' By their silence I suggest that is not the case. That is because their counterparts in the state Labor governments—certainly in Tasmania, in the ACT and, as far as I am aware, in the other states—have said, `No, we want to reallocate those funds elsewhere.' That means abolishing the 30 per cent health insurance rebate. That means 44 per cent of the Australian population, and in Tasmania that means 208,000 Tasmanians, will be detrimentally affected and will have to pay an extra $750 per family and lose that 30 per cent rebate. 
It also means that waiting lists in the public hospital system will blow out. People will move out of private health insurance and into the public hospital system. That is going to be very damaging and hurtful. You will see the waiting times blow out and the waiting lists lengthen immeasurably. This will be the impact of Labor policy. We have a great health system in Australia. I am not saying it is perfect—we can always improve—but we have a mix of private and public that works well. I call upon the Labor opposition to reconsider their position with respect to the 30 per cent rebate. With respect to getting GPs into rural and regional areas, we have a host of policies to try to make that happen and we seek the support of the Labor opposition. We have the runs on the board in terms of an 11 per cent increase in getting GPs into those areas in the last few years. That has increased under us. It went down under Labor. We have the runs on the board and we have further policies and reforms to make things even better.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-08-18,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Patterson this afternoon in the ongoing discussion about what is going on in health in our community. The Minister for Health and Ageing, backed up very strongly by her colleagues, said that she preferred to talk `in the calm air' about the issues to do with health reform. We are now together in the calm air and we have been informed that the minister `does not wish to take part in any organisation, information or meeting that is purely a stunt'—only a stunt, manipulated by the ALP, about health issues. I would hope that people would agree. But this is certainly not a stunt; we are sharing information about health.
We need to know what actually constitutes a stunt according to the minister. It seems to us that perhaps anything that does not agree with the minister, does not accept the ministerial policy or is not humbly grateful for the government's options is automatically a stunt. Minister Patterson, we do not agree that a stunt is correspondence from current GPs working in remote and regional parts of the community who have been forced over the last six or seven years to seriously reconsider their options for providing health care to their communities and have had to face the decision to stop bulk-billing—not a choice they wanted to make but one that has been forced upon them. That is not a stunt; that is a decision forced upon them by policies of the current government.
You cannot always say, as the minister frequently does in this place, that every ill to do with the medical system in this country can be immediately traced back to what happened under previous governments. It is too late to use that excuse all the time, particularly as we heard today in answers that we can create a large number of doctors overnight—or perhaps within three months. Hopefully that process can continue.
It is not a stunt when you listen to people who work in the community such as those we have heard from through the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, in which many senators from all sides of the house are sharing. We hear from community workers who work with families in low-income areas who cannot access doctors. We are not talking about remote areas in this case; we are talking about areas in the immediate suburbs of Wollongong where children affected by outbreaks of scabies cannot attend school. They have been forced through poverty, lack of support in their community and no immediate access to health care to have their schooling reduced because they cannot go back into their community because they are sick. They are sick because they cannot get medical help. Not only can they not get to see a doctor; they cannot get the pharmaceutical help they need to fix their problem. That is not a stunt; that is reality. 
It is not a stunt when we hear about whole communities in rural New South Wales that have had to admit, not proudly, that they have no bulk-billing doctors. As we have heard from Labor senators who know them well, these are areas that used to have bulk-billing doctors. What has happened is that, as I said earlier, doctors have had to review their practices in good faith simply because they have not been able to continue to provide that service to their community—not in 1991, 1993 or 1994 but now. That is not a stunt.
We need to understand that there has to be some calm in the process. We need to know that there has to be some trust. Minister Patterson, we agree that, as your current statement says, `We can do it better.' We can do it better, but that does not automatically mean doing it your way and it does not mean imposing penalty clauses when your policies are not accepted by other people who share your concerns about providing effective medical services to the community. We can—we must—do it better, but that demands cooperation. That does not demand direction; it demands cooperation and a willingness to take part in all kinds of meetings, not just those which can be controlled by the participation and the agenda of the government. Minister, that is effective health policy and that makes sure that people across the country can be involved, not just those who share one particular view of the world. That is not a stunt; that is effective policy being implemented.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-08-18,"—Here we are debating the health issues again and talking about some stunt that was pulled at the weekend. It is interesting. Senator Webber asked a question about this of Senator Patterson and I—admittedly in an unparliamentary fashion—interjected and asked Senator Webber to confirm whether or not she had attended that stunt at the weekend. Her lack of response indicates to me that she did not. If she had attended something she thought was so important as to ask the minister for help about, she would have been the first to accept an interjection and say, `Yes, I did attend.' But clearly Senator Webber did not attend and was prattling on about something she has had no contact with and no information about—no nothing—but saying how wonderful it was. I find that pretty amazing. I cannot talk about a show unless I have seen it, so I go and see it. If Senator Webber thought this was so important, why didn't she go? She then tried to tell everyone else that they should go. That is the squib's way out by saying, `I do not want to go—I do not want to use my weekend—but you should go.' That is absolutely preposterous.
The minister is saying to the states that we have Medicare agreements for the expenditure of public funds and part of that comes from the Commonwealth government. We have to say that over recent years much of the money that has gone from the Commonwealth to the states has gone into the states' Bermuda Triangle, never to be seen or accounted for again. With this agreement the minister has gone to the states and said, `Because money has disappeared with no apparent accountability in previous agreements, for this agreement I want accountability; I want to see how it's going to be spent.' Under the new agreement the states will have to recommit to the Medicare principles, and specifically the availability of free public hospital treatment for all Australians who seek it, and will have to publicly commit to a specified level of funding for each year of the next agreement. Guess what? They will not do it. Why won't the states simply agree to a set amount of increase per year in public funding? They only have to agree to commit to a new financial and performance reporting framework. If you were dinkum, you would not think that that would be too hard. What is wrong with asking the states to agree to a reporting framework and a financial system that is clear and transparent to all who put in the money—that is, the taxpayers? But, no, the states will not do that. 
So why should Minister Patterson go off to some frolic at the weekend with a bunch of people who may be well intentioned but who are putting the cart before the horse instead of saying, `Let's look at the way in which this can work once the agreements are signed'? Nothing that happened last weekend is going to change the proposal that is on the table at the moment and to which the states have to agree or not agree.
By not signing and continuing to carry on, the states look set to deprive the hospital system of over $3.6 billion over the next five years. I would say that $3.6 billion amounts to a lot of explaining that they will have to do to their constituents. I will make sure that I do my bit to have it exposed that the states are going to deprive their constituents of $3.6 billion in Commonwealth funding because they want to play politics—just because it is all Labor states against a coalition federal government. That is not acting in the best interests of their constituents, but they do not seem to care about that and never have. This is all about trying to get the Commonwealth government because it is not of their political persuasion. That is naive; it is stupid. It is not in the interests of constituents, and the state governments are the ones who will have to account for it. If they do not want to sign up for a 17 per cent increase over five years, that is their business; but they will be held accountable for it. I look forward to the day when they are held accountable and they all lose office.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-08-18,"—I also rise to take note of answers given today in question time by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, in relation to the crisis in Australia's health system. The federal government's attitude to health has been nothing short of appalling. It has consistently attempted to shift the buck to the states, as we have heard here today, rather than implement reforms that will genuinely improve the deep-seated problems in our health system.
We heard today in question time that, as reported in the Daily Telegraph, in at least nine towns in New South Wales it is simply not possible to visit a GP who bulk-bills. It is more than likely that the figures in rural and regional parts of the other states would reflect these figures. The Daily Telegraph reported that pensioners and general patients must often pay almost twice the Medicare rebate amount to see a doctor. For these people, the decision to visit a doctor is not simply one that relates to their health; it also becomes a financial consideration. These people often have to pay up to $44 for the consultation before they can turn up and see a doctor. This is the situation in which Australia's health system finds itself under this government.
Labor has committed to strengthening Medicare and bulk-billing, which would take the pressure off the hospital emergency departments. We heard today that it has been shown that, in towns where doctors do not bulk-bill, emergency departments are used 60 per cent more than in towns where bulk-billing is available. The government's proposed changes to Medicare would do nothing to stop this outrageous misallocation of resources that leaves the states with nothing short of a task for Sisyphus. The Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, reported yesterday that some 9,000 people went to emergency rooms in hospitals across New South Wales last year for coughs and colds, some 3,500 for ear infections and some 900 for treatment for ear wax—all of which could, and should, have been treated by general practitioners. 
Senator Patterson has refused to address the correlation between bulk-billing and overflowing emergency rooms. These issues go fundamentally to the quality of health care Australians are able to access. What we need is an approach from the Minister for Health and Ageing that will address the problems of the health care system—the 60,000-odd Australians who have dropped out of the government's so-called solution to private health cover which has done nothing to stop overflowing emergency rooms and help towns where bulk-billing has disappeared altogether. The government has its priorities fundamentally wrong. The federal government is effectively blackmailing the states into signing the Australian health care agreement by the end of the month. The actual agreement would mean a cut of the order of $75 million over five years to public hospitals in South Australia and would deny public hospital treatment to some 35,000 South Australians—my constituents.
Senator Patterson is even refusing, as we heard today, to sit down and discuss the stalemate at the next Council of Australian Governments meeting in Canberra, due at the end of this month. In addition, in my state of South Australia Trish Worth, federal member for Adelaide and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, last month had the nerve to send a letter to her constituents asking them to make appeals to the state Premier, Mike Rann, to sign the Australian health care agreement. She also had the nerve to imply that the South Australian Minister for Health, Lea Stevens, would welcome pressure on the South Australian state government to sign the fundamentally flawed Australian health care agreement.
The minister's parliamentary secretary did not once mention the need for reform of the system nor the minister's continued refusal to meet with the states or her complete lack of interest in attending the Australian health care summit, a gathering over the weekend of some 200 health professionals from across Australia. This was not a stunt; it was a serious meeting of people who are concerned about the crisis in Australia's health system. Senator Patterson's non-attendance at the weekend summit shows her complete lack of concern for the urgent need for reform of Australia's health care system. What better opportunity to show a genuine commitment to sorting out the health system—a genuine commitment that will simply never be given by the present government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—I also take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing, both to the ALP and to us. I think that in this case the minister is being extraordinarily hypocritical—not only that, but she may actually be threatened by serious debate about policy. In an attempt to belittle what is a very serious debate at this time, the minister chooses to describe it as naïve and politically motivated—Senator Knowles added to that and called the meeting at the weekend a `frolic'. The reason we have a serious debate going on outside this place is that we do not see a great deal of it from this government. This government seems to think it has all the answers. What does it do? It puts a Medicare package on the table. Who says it is a good solution? Nobody: not a single body, except maybe the private health insurance groups. Not a single other individual or group has stood up and said, `What a great idea. This is a fantastic package; we can buy into it.' When it comes to policy, this government likes to do it by itself and does not like to think that anybody else may be having a discussion about it. 
With regard to politicisation, if there is one sector that has politicised this debate, it is this government. Let me go to the media release that was put out by the alliance. The final paragraph says:
The harsh reality is that while both state and federal governments have expressed their strong support for a reform agenda, so far they have failed to deliver. The conference will be held in time for suggestions made to seriously examine the state premiers when they meet with the Prime Minister for the COAG meeting at the end of August 2003.
That is the political statement. It says that both the state and the federal governments have failed. If all these people are part of a great conspiracy for the Labor Party then obviously they have their wires crossed when it comes to putting out their press release, because they are not politicised—they are not interested in which party says what. What they want are outcomes. That affects all of us one way or the other. Those of us who are ill and need hospital care, those who are frail and aged who need age care and rehabilitation, those who need care in the community because of chronic illness or frailty—these are the people who want outcomes; they want policy that is based on sound advice and they are sick to death of the divisiveness and the arguments between both levels of government, for starters.
What we should be able to expect from the Minister for Health and Ageing is vision—some pulling together and leadership on how limited resources can best be spent. We want some leadership to facilitate the implementation of health strategies that health providers and policy developers accept as best practice. For Senator Knowles' benefit: I was not able to get to the national health summit yesterday afternoon but I was there last night and I talked with a great number of people. They are extremely worried about the future of health in this country. We need leadership to facilitate the implementation of health strategies that health providers and policy developers can acknowledge as being best practice. What was said yesterday, is being said today and will be said again tomorrow is not likely to be terribly different, in terms of its generality, from papers that have been written over the past 30 years. I would also encourage Senator Knowles to look up those papers—they are on the web site; she does not need to go to what she describes as a frolic. Over and over we have heard from clinicians and researchers about the ways money is spent inefficiently and against patients' best interests, merely because of administrative fragmentation and responsibility fragmentation.
The Senate inquiry into public hospital funding is an excellent testament to the ideas that have been generated and discussed for Australia in the recent past. If the Minister for Health and Ageing sponsored the development of options by nine working groups of health policy analysts then why isn't the minister announcing reforms, together with the associated expenditure? Surely, it is indicative of a failure of leadership if the health minister cannot come up with solutions that improve the health outcomes of Australians. Minister, what we need are solutions. If the minister for health at a national level cannot effect change then perhaps it is time to revisit the responsibilities of the federal health portfolio. If it is all too political, then perhaps we need a fixed formula—an independent body to provide this funding and allow the states, through block funding perhaps, to provide services. We have had enough of the rhetoric of the Commonwealth purchasing services on our behalf, and we need to move on from there. The Democrats have called for an independent arbiter in the health funding round since February this year, and I note that more recently this approach has been endorsed by the Australian Health Reform Alliance. We should proceed down that path to avoid some of this bickering and some of the accusations of politicisation. (Time expired)

I understood that there had been communicated to me a similar sentiment on your part also, Senator Brown, that this matter be deferred for debate until this sitting week. Mr President, I was grateful that, having received that approach from the opposition, you quickly acted to ensure that the matter did not come on for debate on Thursday, and as I understand it your office was involved in communicating that to parties and senators in the chamber.
This is not a straightforward matter. It was dealt with by the House of Representatives at the end of the last sitting week, as Senator Brown and other honourable senators may be aware. But it seemed sensible in the circumstances, given the broad sentiment around the chamber, that we ought to deal with it now. I hope my having provided that information might assist the chamber.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-08-18,"—by leave—I think there is some good sense in what Senator Humphries has said, but I also accept the general approach to postponements that works cooperatively around the chamber. My expectation is that this matter will come on tomorrow. I think the original postponement was effective as of tomorrow—I can be corrected if I am wrong about that—but Senator Brown has given notification of a further postponement and that is the issue which should be before the chamber today. 
It seems to me that the sensible thing to do here, without wasting an inordinate amount of time, is for Senator Brown, if it were able to be done by leave, to withdraw the notification of this current postponement. This would mean effectively that a question for postponement will come back before the chamber tomorrow. You can correct me if I am wrong, Mr President, and no doubt you will quickly do so, but I think my understanding is correct. I know that Senator Lundy, as well as Senator Humphries and Senator Brown, has an interest in this and there may be a way that it can be worked through to see agreement being reached. Hence, the delay may well only be 24 hours, which is probably acceptable.
I think the general point made by Senator Humphries has substance and I think the chamber needs to take account of that. But surely, without getting into a long drawn out, knockdown debate about this now, the sensible way would be for Senator Brown to agree to withdraw the notification before the chair and see if it can be worked through to agreement to bring on the debate at the earliest possible opportunity. If it cannot be agreed, obviously we can go to determining the matter substantively tomorrow. That is my suggestion to the chamber through you, Mr President, which I think might be a sensible way of dealing with this. At worst, it is only delaying this matter for final determination tomorrow as opposed to today, but it may be able to be agreed upon amongst senators in the chamber. If it finds favour with the government as well, it seems to be a sensible way through in this circumstance. We are expecting the postponement to come before us tomorrow anyway. Senator Brown's notification has brought forward the matter to today that we were expecting to deal with tomorrow. If that is withdrawn, we can deal with the matter, as I understand it, and there would be the substantive question of dealing with that tomorrow. With a bit of luck and a little bit of goodwill, perhaps we can work that through in a cooperative way.
—Senator Faulkner, if Senator Brown were to withdraw, by leave, his notification today, he would then be able to put a motion for postponement tomorrow. The situation is that if the notification is withdrawn the matter will come up tomorrow; if it is not withdrawn it will come up in November.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-18,"—In the debate earlier today we were discussing the implications for the sale of Commonwealth assets and their placement on the list. In response to a question I asked about the implications for Commonwealth assets that had already been sold and that had an indicative place on the list under the current regime, the minister informed the committee that the process would effectively have to begin again under the new regime if this legislation were to pass. That would mean that Commonwealth assets that were being considered but which were not formally on the list would effectively have to start the process again. There would be no ability for them to transfer onto the new list because they are not Commonwealth assets anymore. Because they are former Commonwealth assets, they would not be locked into any sort of transferring process. So to be listed they would effectively have to be nominated again. The example that was used was the police cottage—part of the Water Police station at Yarralumla Bay—that was sold off. It is my understanding that it is currently leased by the Commonwealth. Minister, I know you are undertaking to get some additional information about that particular circumstance, but can you further clarify whether, if these bills were to pass, there would be any process by which the police cottage would find its place on a list under the new regime? Would it be part of a process that was at least moving in that direction if these bills were to pass?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I can provide some further information on the police cottage. I am not sure that it totally answers the question, but it shows the efforts that are being made to protect its heritage values. It is true that the cottage was sold in May this year. The property was leased back by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth nominated the place to the ACT Heritage Register in June this year. The Commonwealth took that initiative. The place is currently being assessed by the ACT Heritage Council. The Australian Heritage Commission was involved in the contract of sale to ensure the protection of heritage values. Special conditions were attached to the sale document to require: (1) that the purchaser was made aware of the intention to list the place on the ACT Heritage Register and (2) that the purchaser cannot lodge an objection to the place being entered onto the ACT Heritage Register or the Register of the National Estate. So it seems that, between them, the Commonwealth and the Australian Heritage Commission decided that the process that I have just outlined would best protect the heritage values and was therefore adopted.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-18,"—Thank you, Minister. If this legislation were to pass, can you tell me what the process would be for the police cottage to be entered onto the Register of the National Estate? I acknowledge that you said it was a condition of the sale for that not to be opposed, but is it effectively a ministerial decision whether or not to place it on the Register of the National Estate, as opposed to an ACT government process, which would relate to the ACT Heritage Register, which you also mentioned? I guess I am asking whether, as part of this transition—if these bills are passed—the police cottage will be automatically nominated to go on the Register of the National Estate.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I understand that it has also been nominated to the Register of the National Estate under the existing legislation. I am also told—and I may have been in error this morning—that if it is leased back to the Commonwealth then it is eligible to be listed, under the Commonwealth part of the new legislation. That would be a question of whether its values meet the standards under the new legislation. It seems that whether they meet them under the existing legislation is still being assessed. What surprises me a little bit is that, while it is not inconsistent to be going down the ACT Heritage Council path as well, that seems to be the emphasis that those who have a primary responsibility to protect these values have preferred rather than putting an emphasis on a future Commonwealth list.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-18,"—I just make the observation that that itself says something about the relative merits of the two systems. I do not know if this is anything that the minister can answer, but I will put the question anyway. I am curious, given the location, as to why that is the preferred path. One, the location is very much in an area that is, obviously, under the auspices of the National Capital Authority, being immediately on the lake foreshore. Two, it is in an area where the National Capital Authority—and, therefore, the Commonwealth—have had the greatest interest in everything from design and siting to planning arrangements on the lake foreshore. Three, what is the view of that organisation? 
But I think that, for the purposes of this bill, the issue here is that it seems to be perceived by those who are trying to protect the heritage value of the police cottage that in fact—in the light of the bills we are debating—ACT heritage registration is perhaps the stronger of the two. I think that that reflects very unhealthily upon the propositions before us. If I can think of any more questions about this particular circumstance, I will ask them. I think it is quite a reasonable case study to demonstrate what happens to former Commonwealth assets—or, as we have now heard, former Commonwealth assets that are leased by the Commonwealth and, therefore, are still eligible to transfer to the Commonwealth list. I think that the minister is learning more about these bills as we go along. I know that the more questions we ask, the more convoluted it seems to get, particularly about the issues that arise when you introduce the sale or pending sale of Commonwealth assets into the considerations of heritage status.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I do not know that it is more convoluted, but I do not have the answer to that specific question. The question is: whilst this property is being assessed for National Estate values, is it also being assessed or is it going to be assessed for Commonwealth values under the new legislation?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I ask the minister, because it is pertinent to this, about the answer he gave to question on notice No. 1553, which was about the Iraq war. The minister, Senator Hill, said:
On 25 February 2003, I declared under subsection 28(3) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, in the interest of Australia's defence and security, that actions, as deemed appropriate by the Commonwealth Government, undertaken outside the Australian jurisdiction in relation to the training, deployment and operation of members of the Australian Defence Force in the Persian Gulf region in support of any military action against Iraq, are actions to which section 28 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does not apply.
The minister then went on to say that this was not put up on the public list on the web site, because the government is not required to do so. The minister said, in this reply:
I am aware of the penalty provision associated with the unlawful taking of an action under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
I ask the minister: could he elaborate on that? Why did he move to remove actions that might be taken under the Australian government's decision to go to war in Iraq from the provisions of the EPBC? Why did he not make a public notification that he had taken that action back on 25 February?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—This was a decision that was open to be taken under section 28(3) of the EPBC legislation, and it was duly taken. In other words, it was in the interests of Australia's Defence Force security. I am not sure what the date of that was in relation to the actions that Australia was involved in, but certainly there was no secret at any stage on this matter. I am sorry; I missed the last point. 
—The declaration was—
—It was made under the provisions of this act—the provisions specifically designed for these reasons. It is made where it is either impossible or inappropriate to be carrying out an assessment process, and that was deemed to be so in these circumstances, for obvious reasons. It was made particularly to protect the interests of Australian forces, and there was no secret in the matter.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—There was. The exemption for the purposes of the war was not listed under the public notices on the Environment Australia web site, as are other such exempt actions. I will give you the question again, to put this in context. I asked:
With reference to the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, under which the Australian Defence Force must not take action that has, will have, or is likely to have, a significant impact on the environment anywhere in the world without the approval of the Minister for Environment and Heritage:
(1)Did the Minister provide this approval prior to Australia's war on Iraq; if not, is the Minister aware that the unlawful taking of an action can attract a civil penalty of up to $1.1 million, or a criminal penalty of up to 2 years imprisonment.
I further asked:
(2)If the Minister was notified and gave approval for military action in Iraq by exempting the action under the Act, why is the exemption not listed under the public notices on the Environment Australia website.
I asked that original question in June this year, and I wonder why it took some work to find out that in fact the minister had made that decision. In other words, why didn't the minister make that declaration public at the time, and why did the minister make the declaration anyway?
Again, what is the point of this legislation, the EPBC Act? There were enormous concerns about both the environmental and cultural heritage of Iraq at the time. The minister will remember some of the destruction of cultural heritage, which was obvious. It always takes a long while before the environmental impact comes through, but there are great worries about a whole range of things, obviously, when armies are invading a country. I ask why the minister made the exemption. Where do you draw the line? It seems that the exemptions are made domestically for social and economic parameters and that they are made internationally before the war is on and then you protect the site after the war is over—the minister has mentioned Gallipoli a number of times. When does the Australian government get to the stage of believing that it should protect environmental and cultural heritage, particularly of world heritage significance, and make sure that it is protected under all circumstances? After all, there is a 1954 code which says that such places should be protected in times of war.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—There are a few points. Firstly, the Australian forces obviously make every endeavour to protect cultural heritage assets, whether or not they are in Australia. My second point is that we are a party to various conventions in which we accept a national responsibility to protect heritage—that is a fact of life and we are proud of it. We do everything possible to meet our obligations under those conventions. The third issue is in relation to making public the determination made under subsection 28(3) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act. There was no reason not to make it public. I understand from the officials of Environment Australia that it was simply not put on the web site because there is no obligation in the legislation to put it on the web site. 
When I said there was no secret in this regard, clearly there was no secret that Australian forces were going to that region of the world—at various times during the conflict they had different tasks, but it was made very public at the time and debated almost on a continuous basis in this parliament. So there is no secret in that regard. As to why the decision was taken: as I recall, the decision was taken as a precaution to protect Australian servicemen in case there was an argument that an action they may have taken was in breach of this piece of legislation. The legislation provides that in circumstances of national security they can receive an exemption, and the government so acted.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The reason the government did not publicise this is that it covered it up during the onset of the Iraq war. The government did not want the people of Australia to know about it. This minister, the Minister for Defence, did not make a public declaration about this very important matter, and there had already been worldwide alarm about the potential for destruction of the cultural heritage of global significance in Iraq—of course, that is heritage of the whole of humankind. I believe it was a contentious matter and I believe this minister covered it up by not making it public. All down the line, the government was flagging other intentions which were of public moment—put aside secret matters, but this is definitely not in that category. The minister, quietly and without notifying the public, declared that, as far as Australia was concerned, the invading forces were exempt from the act which was designed to ensure that we protect places of global significance anywhere in the world.
What is the point of a piece of legislation when you have a government or a minister able to do that and, moreover, able to cover it up? If there is one amendment which obviously needs to be made here it is that such declarations must be published. What excuse could you have for not publishing such a critical decision by the government in the run-up to the Iraq war? We all remember the ferment and the intense national interest, and it is still a matter of great contention. I maintain, unless the minister has an argument to the contrary, that he made this critical decision to waive the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for the Iraq war and did not tell the Australian people. That is reprehensible; there is no excuse for it.
—There was no copy of a notice of exemption.
—As Senator Allison said, there was no copy of the notice of exemption. People were not told about it. The government did not want the people of Australia to know about it. The Howard government covered up this component of its war preparations for Iraq, and it should be ashamed of itself. This legislation needs amending now so that it cannot do that again. It was part of the deceit that the government engaged in at that time. There is no excuse for not having made that public, and there is also no excuse for not putting it on the web site and not making the document public and sending it out with a press release at the time. But for political reasons the government did not do those things.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Before the dinner break I was asking Senator Hill to explain the government's behaviour in covering up the exemption it gave to the Australian Defence Force from the requirements under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act that the ADF not take an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment anywhere in the world. The minister responded to my question by saying he did make such a declaration on 25 February this year but did not put it on the Environment Australia web site—he did not put out a publication of it, in effect—and that he is not required to do so. I ask the minister would he care to say what he has done with other such actions and why he thought that in the middle of such a massive public debate as there was over the Iraq war, with very real concerns about world heritage sites in Iraq, he made that determination but did not tell anybody in the public about it.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—We did cover these matters before the dinner break, and I do not know that there is a lot more that I can add. Environment Australia chose not to put it on their web site because there is no obligation in the act to do so. They put on their web site what they are obliged to do. There was no wish to hide anything from the Australian public, but I will never convince Senator Brown of that. The government was very up front about the role of Australian forces. I think most reasonable Australians would see that there is always the chance of inadvertent damage to a heritage site and would wish us to protect Australian forces, who are acting responsibly and with the appropriate level of care given the nature of the operation. So we took this action to protect Australian forces in such circumstances and believe it was the correct thing to do.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—What could possibly be the point of having a section in the act which says that the Australian Defence Force must not take an action that is likely to have a significant impact on the environment elsewhere in the world if the minister is going to do this? Could the minister explain what the point of that clause is? What is the point of putting a clause in an act which I think quite rightly protects global heritage from Australian actions overseas if the first time it is tested you bring out an exemption clause? We have seen serial transgressions of the so-called protection of the domestic environment under this legislation. We have heard the minister say that social and economic interests, which means the interests of the big end of town, need to be in no way trammelled when it comes to heritage listing—in other words, you do not list a place because of its heritage value; you first of all ask the developers whether they have something in mind and for goodness sake do not let the heritage get in the way. 
But this is the government's own legislation. Remember it was guillotined through this Senate on the last day of June in 2000. Here we have the first test of a very important component of it and the minister gives a secret exemption and does not tell the public about it—in a matter of high public interest and in a moment of high contention. Minister, what is the point of that component of the bill? When are you going to agree to the terms of your own legislation? What is meant by it? Can you make a commitment that in future when you or your colleagues do make an exemption you will let the public know about it in the time-honoured way—by putting it into the news stream one way or the other?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The act of course is structured for environmental assessment processes and approvals in certain circumstances, and that is by far the most desirable way to go where damage to an important asset might be caused by an action. However, in certain circumstances it is not possible to go through that process, and this was one of those circumstances. There was not time or the capability to do an analysis on what might be the consequences of Australia's involvement in military action in Iraq. In those circumstances and to protect the interests of Australian forces the exemption was given. 
As to whether we should have put out a public statement, I hear the argument. As I said, there was no reason that I can recall, no secret agenda and no plot in this regard to keep anyone in the dark. Generally speaking, my view is: when administrative actions can be transparent they should be. I think the general approach should be: when decisions are made that are of public interest and there is no reason why they should not be made public then it is better that they are. As far as I can recall this is the only occasion that I have had to act under this particular provision, but both I and the department could bear in mind the issues that have been discussed here if ever there is another instance.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—That is it, isn't it? Section 28 of the act states:
The Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency must not take inside or outside the Australian jurisdiction an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment inside or outside the Australian jurisdiction.
The first time the section applies to an action outside the Australian jurisdiction, the government exempts it. The point I make is that there is deceit involved in this legislation. Time after time we are seeing the exemption, the out, the refusal to enforce. The first time that it gets applied overseas, an exemption is given. But what is worse than that—and this is the third and last time I will say this—is that there was a cover-up involved. The minister acted in secret and did not make this known to the public, and that is inexcusable. It was a political action. It is the only time the minister has done this and it was a complete cover-up. It was totally inexcusable. It took quite a bit of deliberation—it was not just an off-the-cuff thing—to make a decision to give a written exemption for the war in Iraq to Australia's single environment bill, which this minister has advocated so strongly. With a pen, in secret, he got around it at a time of great national contention. Out of that came a deceit of the Australian public.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The minister will remember from last Thursday that I drew his attention to the situation at Recherche Bay, at which the D'Entrecasteaux scientific expedition sent by the French government arrived in 1792 and, after circumnavigating Australia, came back to in 1793. Both times they went ashore in southern Tasmania for five weeks. On the first occasion they built a rock-wall garden which has recently been rediscovered and which may well be one of the oldest, if not the oldest, intact European structures in Australia—a site of great interaction with Indigenous people as well as many other matters about which I spoke last week. The question was: is it true that the assurance given to me and other people in writing by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, that the Tasmanian Heritage Council was undertaking an independent inquiry into the heritage values of this place is in fact not so?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—As I think I said the other day, the position is that the council was making an assessment but, with the agreement of other parties, it decided to do it by different means—that is, by an application from a number of different organisations—including the Tasmanian Greens, as I recall it—for protection. The issue is whether it should be listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register, which is maintained by the Tasmanian Heritage Council under the provisions of the Tasmanian cultural heritage act.
As Senator Brown no doubt knows, the register is a list of places that have historic cultural heritage significance in Tasmania. How the state level assessment is undertaken and information for that assessment is provided is a matter for the Tasmanian government. As to the action of the Australian Heritage Commission, it has been awaiting the heritage assessment by the Tasmanian Heritage Council before considering the issue of assessment for the Register of National Estate. In other words, there is no point in doing two assessment processes in parallel. It is waiting for the assessment process to be completed by the Tasmanian Heritage Council and will take that into consideration.
On 13 August this year I am told that the Tasmanian Heritage Council deferred its assessment to September this year. So we are expecting an outcome at that time. That will be made available to the AHC, which will then decide how to proceed with the Commonwealth matter—whether it can proceed on the basis of the Tasmanian documentation. If the AHC is not satisfied the documentation is sufficient for its purposes, it will consider what additional action is required to obtain the necessary information. The Commonwealth's position has been at this stage to allow the Tasmanian initiated processes to run their course. But it is true, as I said, the process seems to have changed from one where the Heritage Council was taking the initiative to one where it is responding to the initiative of a number of concerned parties.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—No; that is not true. What happened was that the Tasmanian Heritage Council, under the authority of Premier Bacon, announced that it would be making an independent investigation of the heritage values of Recherche Bay. Then suddenly two weeks ago it told the interested parties—which do include the Tasmanian Greens but, more importantly, the local community groups— that it was not going to do so; they would have to do it themselves. They did not make any offer; they were told. The Tasmanian Heritage Council unilaterally withdrew from that commitment it had made, by the way, to Environment Minister Kemp and which he had then made to me. Premier Bacon had made it too. I ask why.  
The answer is that the woodchip industry and Gunns leant directly or indirectly on the Tasmanian Heritage Council, unless the minister can give some other explanation. It just does not add up. There has been political influence on a process that had been publicly announced. If the Australian government allows it to get away with it again, what is the point of this legislation? Now it is left, by the way, to the community groups who, earlier on, may have had decent time—I know they do not have the money to get independent expertise because it does cost money— and suddenly their time is almost out and they have no wherewithal to do that except to get together the best information they have. I suggest to the minister that the process is wrong. The national government cannot allow itself to be compromised by the Tasmanian government in that fashion. The minister says, `When the assessment comes back, if there is not sufficient information we will get an independent study done here.' I do not have any faith in that. If you cannot keep the Tasmanian government to its word, what is the difference when we hear the word coming from this government? 
I would submit that the minister should go back to Tasmanian Premier Bacon and say, `You made this commitment; you stick by it. We require you to stick by it.' Otherwise this process is breaking down through interference by vested interests—and that is what is worrying me all the way down the line—and here is a clear example of it happening. If I am wrong, please give an explanation as to why that commitment from the Tasmanian Premier and his Heritage Council has suddenly evaporated. It just does not make sense. After long consideration they made that commitment. The Greens have no experts on staff who can take up this matter. You should go down there and do all the investigations that the Tasmanian Heritage Council and the Tasmanian Premier said they would do. What is more, on 13 August the council's decision was deferred and we are closing the gate on this in September. And, what is more, you know that you have to get the permission of the owners, and there are all sorts of hoops to go through down there. 
It is a terrible process, and I want the minister to restore some confidence in it. Again, it is this act that we are dealing with here and part of this act, which we were given all sorts of assurances about three years ago, covered the transfer of many of the obligations for assessing and protecting the national heritage to the states. But you cannot transfer that authority; this is federal legislation. You cannot transfer the responsibility. I am asking the minister what the Hon. David Kemp, Minister for the Environment and Heritage, has done to investigate why that change took place in Tasmania. Surely we are owed an explanation here. The minister says that suddenly the groups decided to undertake it. They did nothing of the sort. They were told there was no option; they would have to do it or it would not be done. There was going to be no investigation. So I presume they are cobbling together whatever they can at the moment. What a process—a process that can be cut in two by vested interests in such an extraordinary way as that!
I also asked the minister last week about the eyebright, which is critically endangered and on the protection list under this bill. Premier Bacon has to make a decision as to whether he will allow a resumption of roadworks going right through the territory of the one known place where that critically endangered flowering plant in southern Tasmania exists. What is the process here? Who is doing the independent analysis this time? What assurances have we that Premier Bacon will not be allowed to give the go-ahead to that road which damages that environment and, therefore, is likely to push this critically endangered native closer to, if not all the way to, extinction?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The Tasmanian assessment process is one under Tasmanian legislation, with a protective regime set up thereby. Whilst we seek cooperation, because we think the most effective form of protection for the nation is each level of government playing its part, nevertheless how the Tasmanian government implements its statutory obligation is primarily in its hands. I am advised that there was no commitment as such to Dr Kemp. Certainly Dr Kemp was led to understand that the process was being driven by the Tasmanian Heritage Council, but I am told that on 14 August the Commonwealth department was advised that the Tasmanian Heritage Council was adopting a different approach to that originally advised. 
I have outlined what that different approach is. What I have said is that, whilst the Commonwealth can take the outcomes, the assessments or the matters that were involved in the Tasmanian process into account in its obligations—and, sensibly, it would—it is not limited by the Tasmanian investigation under the Australian Heritage Commission Act, as it is now, in terms of a listing application, of which there is one, as I have said, or if the EPBC Act comes into play the Commonwealth is free to seek what other advice it considers necessary in order to make the best decisions and I am sure under Dr Kemp will do so.
I have some further information which I can give to Senator Brown on the swamp eyebright. I understand that Minister Kemp has previously advised Senator Brown that the EPBC Act does not apply to the construction of the access road through the Southport Lagoon Conservation Area as the road is for forestry purposes. Forestry operations undertaken in accordance with the forest practices plan meet the requirements of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement and, therefore, are exempt from the EPBC Act. The Forest Practices Plan for the construction of the access road was certified in April 2002.
I am advised that the swamp eyebright is listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act and the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act. Officials from the Department of the Environment and Heritage have been in contact with the Tasmanian officials in an effort to find further information on the matter. As a result, I understand that the access road is located approximately one kilometre from the swamp eyebright population in the conservation area and that the action will not directly impact on the eyebright population. In fact, it is the officials' view that the uncontrolled access by recreational four-wheel drive vehicles is actually a greater threat to the swamp eyebright. However, the department is informed that potential for impacts on the eyebright was considered during the forest practices plan process and that the plan for the road incorporates specific construction measures designed to prevent unauthorised recreational four-wheel drive vehicles from using the road to gain access to the conservation area where the eyebright is located. I think Senator Brown made reference to a particular study. Commonwealth officials have been unable to identify that study. I hope that that basically answers the issue that Senator Brown has raised.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I am surprised that the Commonwealth officials have not been able to get the study by Parks and Wildlife in Tasmania which lists the potential for a logging road to be a threat to the eyebright. The minister will know, from his years of experience with the environment, that a logging road going within a kilometre of a critically endangered plant is a very serious threat indeed—particularly where it is not warranted and where it is going through a conservation area. We get into a downward spiral with the logic the minister used. He says, `Forestry is a protected activity as far as this bill is concerned.' So here we go: this bill is to protect Australia's heritage, logging operations not included. The minister says, `This critically endangered plant is on the list, but if it is a logging operation it does not count.' 
The first attempt on that road, by Gunns Pty Ltd, to get in and woodchip the north-east peninsula was in May last year. A combination of factors including bad weather stopped them, but I bet it was not even brought to the minister's attention that this critically endangered plant was in the vicinity, let alone the values of the north-east peninsular. If either of those factors were brought to the attention of the minister, I would like to see that evidence. I point out that on both counts this legislation and the process of divesting authority to the logging operatives in Tasmania and to the Tasmanian government has failed. It failed with a critically endangered species and it failed with top-rank national, cultural and environmental heritage. If it is going to that down there, where is the guarantee of this legislation? That is the question I was putting here three years ago.
The Commonwealth has an obligation to understand what is going on at state level because otherwise anything goes—and I said that three years ago. You get maverick state governments when it comes to the environment—you get maverick premiers, ministers and chief ministers—and this legislation has no way of dealing with that. You are ransomed by their behaviour. The behaviour I am outlining here regarding Recherche Bay, and a cascading series of events that all tumble against the environmental interest and the public interest, has not been countermanded in any way by Commonwealth action. The minister makes an assertion that there is going to be an independent inquiry, and then within a month of that there is not. Efforts are made to try to feed me that the community group opted to take up responsibility, when I know that is wrong. The government down there intervened, one way or another, and the Tasmanian Heritage Council said it will haul off the independent investigation— because there is money involved here.
The minister is listening to this debate, and I would have thought that he would be able to respond to that. I can tell him that the Recherche Bay issue has drawn international attention. It is being watched by the international media, not least the French media, and there is national and international archaeological, anthropological and environmental interest. The Commonwealth government is going to get itself into a big stew here if it does not have the backbone to say to the Tasmanian state government, `Haul off on this occasion. You can't do that.'
In concluding, let me tell you where the state government and the Tasmanian Heritage Council are going to do. They are going to put in two postage stamp exclusions: one for the French garden and one for the observatory. The observatory is outside the logging range anyway, and they will argue that the French garden is too because they have a 100-metre zone around the outside and it happens to be just within the zone, next to the coast. They are going to put in postage stamp exclusions to what should be a culturally protected landscape. This is a cultural landscape of international significance. I have handed the minister the sum of the evidence on that. There are known historic sites all over this peninsula.
Minister Kemp needs to know that he is dealing with a very dangerous situation as far as the environment and Australia's international kudos are concerned, because the decisions the Tasmanian government makes under this legislation are the decisions the Howard government makes. If I were the national government I would not simply be the fall guy for the delinquency that is coming down the line over this particular, extraordinarily important historic, environmental and—well above all—Indigenous site, which has so far remained miraculously intact but which is about to be blitzed within the next six to eight months.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I hear what Senator Brown says but I do not think I can take the swamp eyebright or the Recherche Bay matters any further at this time. He is unhappy with the state government and he is unhappy with the Commonwealth government. Both assets are very important assets in different ways. I do not think that is in dispute. The issue is whether the state or the Commonwealth protective regimes, or both in conjunction, provide adequate protection. The process in relation to Recherche Bay is still under way, so I think it is premature to make a judgment on that. In relation to swamp eyebright, the agreement that was reached between the Commonwealth and the state gave the responsibility to protect those assets primarily to the state. The state is arguing that the course of action it is taking is not going to threaten the asset, and no doubt there will be debate and public interest on that particular issue.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—On another matter, I did ask the minister last week about the protection of Aboriginal heritage by the logging operations under the regional forest agreement. I asked him to let the committee know that my fears that such sites, including listed sites in Tasmania, are being obliterated by clear-fell logging are not in fact well founded.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I have been able to get quite a bit of information on this subject as well. In Tasmania the protection of Aboriginal sites in areas proposed for logging is informed by the state government's Forest Practices Code, which is underpinned by the National Parks and Wildlife Act, the Threatened Species Protection Act, the Aboriginal Relics Act, the Forestry Act and the Commonwealth EPBC Act. The Tasmanian Heritage Office and the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board have advice that logging activities are not exempt from the provisions of the Aboriginal Relics Act 1975, which provides penalties for any person found to have interfered with a protected Aboriginal relic or site. The Forest Practices Code, which is a public document, sets out the process whereby cultural values should be assessed at the strategic or property level and evaluated during the preparation of forest practices plans. The code stipulates:
Requirements for the conservation of ... cultural values, including specific sites, should be recorded to aid in future decision making and ensure continuity of management.
	...	...	...
Areas of high conservation significance may be designated as special management zones ...
	...	...	...
During the planning for broad areas of forest, areas of Aboriginal cultural heritage site potential and/or sensitivity should be identified using the Archaeological Potential Zone maps ... or the potential zoning predictive statements ...
Heritage specialists within the Forest Practices Board advise that all areas of high archaeological potential are surveyed within the limits of access and visibility. A proportion of the areas of medium and low archaeological potential are also surveyed. Known sites are managed by avoidance. Following the logging of coupes, an assessment is undertaken to determine ongoing management requirements. 
The Tasmanian Heritage Office advise that the Forest Practices Board were originally provided with data relating to some 3,500 sites around Tasmania. They advise that since 1994 they have undertaken some 3,000 pre- and post-operational surveys of logging areas. Information relating to cultural heritage sites located during these surveys is provided to the Tasmanian Heritage Office for inclusion on the Tasmanian Aboriginal site index. Information used to prepare the Tasmania-Commonwealth Regional Forest Agreement identified some 180 natural and Indigenous heritage places located in forest areas either in the interim list or inscribed in the Register of the National Estate. Both the Tasmanian Heritage Office and the Forest Practices Board advise that producing specific figures on the number of sites identified within logging coupes and the management status of each would take some time to generate.
I am also advised in relation to applications for protection under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act—that is, the Commonwealth act. Until 1998 the administration of the act rested with ATSIC. There was up until that date only one application that related to a claimed threat from forestry actions. That was the Kooparoona Niara application. I understand that a buffer zone was provided to protect the site and that ultimately the matters were resolved. As I suspected, there have been no further applications for protection since the Commonwealth department took over the administration of that piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—Thank you, Minister. I know you are giving us the information you have. You said during that submission that known sites are managed by avoidance. Let me be a bit more particular. Your good officers have had some time to work on this. I mentioned last week quarry sites, middens and scatter sites that are listed, and I asked specifically if such sites had been destroyed, isolated or removed or were under threat of same. I want the minister to know that his information is not right. I would like to ask the minister if all logging operations in the Tarkine in north-west Tasmania—that is, in that corner of the state—at the moment exempt damage to Aboriginal sites. I very specifically ask if there are intentions, applications or otherwise to forgo protection of logging sites so that logging can take place or is taking place already. Another way of asking that is: has the Tasmanian government or any of its instrumentalities or ministers given exemption for the interference in such sites at the request of logging operatives or have logging operatives made such a request?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—Again, Senator Brown asks for a great deal of detail about the application by Tasmania of its protective legislation. I do not have the answer to that specific question, but I have said to the Senate that the Tasmanian relics act takes precedent. If a site has been protected then to damage it is a serious offence. There seems to have been an extensive process of evaluating Aboriginal sites in Tasmania, which is obviously a good thing. If they have been identified and listed, they are managed by avoidance—which seems to me to be the best way to manage them. I do not know of any provision under the Tasmanian legislation that allows for what I think Senator Brown referred to as an exemption, which I take to mean that the forestry operation would be permitted to destroy a protected site. Certainly that would not occur under the Commonwealth legislation, but the fact that there have not been applications under the Commonwealth legislation would suggest that, by and large, interested parties are happy with the operation of the Tasmanian regime. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I ask the minister if he will go back to the Tasmanian government and ask if an exemption has ever been given to exempt from protection a listed Aboriginal site in Tasmania, if a request for an exemption has been made and if there is the facility for the minister or the Premier or anybody else to make such an exemption. The minister has indicated that is not the case—that is not my information. I am very serious about the matter. The minister says, `Well, under the Forest Practices Board, there are 3,500 sites and there have been 3,000 surveys in the last eight years.' He says this is Tasmanian legislation. No, it is not. This is this legislation, which transfers the Commonwealth's guardianship of such heritage to the Tasmanian authorities. It exempted logging operations because there is a code of practice there. What I am talking about breaches that code of practice, but the responsibility is with the federal government. The Prime Minister signed that regional forest agreement giving authority to the state to do the Commonwealth's work. The minister knows that that is the case. I do not know whether any other member of this committee wants to comment on this, but we are talking about legislation here to protect the nation's heritage. 
Is the minister saying to me, `Yes, the Commonwealth exempts logging operations from protecting known sites of national cultural or environmental heritage'? Is that what you are saying? That is new. The line we have always been given here is that the Forest Practices Code, which operates under the regional forest agreement which Prime Minister Howard devised with then Premier Rundle, does the Commonwealth's job. I am saying it does not. The question is: how can the Commonwealth allow that to happen? How can it have national heritage being damaged or destroyed under its authority, under the Prime Minister's signature? Don't they value the Prime Minister's signature? Isn't there an expectation that the state government, inheritors of that regional forest agreement, will be honest and true to its requirements and to the assurances given to the people of Tasmania and indeed everywhere else about the Tasmanian heritage? Or is the minister saying to the committee that the national obligation to protect sites, places and values of national significance does not apply to logging in Tasmania? If that is the case, say so. It has never been said before. If it is not the case, I ask: how do you protect Indigenous and other cultural and environmental heritage from those people who breach the spirit of this legislation? And it is being breached. You cannot wash your hands of it. You cannot be Pontius Pilate and say, `That is not my business; it is somebody else's.'

As I said, my advice is that logging activities are not exempt from the provisions of the Aboriginal Relics Act 1975, which provides penalties for any person found to have interfered with a protected Aboriginal site or relic.

I note that you say that no decision has been made on this and you are currently looking into it and so forth, but there is also, as I understand it, a list of Commonwealth places that were ready for transfer. I ask you directly: are those four sites at Point Nepean on that list of sites that are ready for transfer and can the most up-to-date version of that list be tabled? Can you also table the list of Commonwealth places that remain to be assessed?

I am told that other areas have been assessed, so there must be instances where there has been a nomination, they have been assessed and the Australian Heritage Commission believes that they meet all of the tests and would therefore be eligible for transfer to the Commonwealth Heritage List under the new legislation. I presume that also means that they would probably meet the test for listing under the existing legislation.

As this is your portfolio, I would have thought you could enlighten us as to whether this land is to receive the protection of the new legislation.

I am interested in the values being protected. In some instances we are protecting natural values by transfer to the state, which we hope will do its job— although I am not sure that Senator Brown would be very confident of that. I have said in relation to the piece of land which the Commonwealth government proposes selling that there are a number of ways in which we can protect the historical and cultural values on that land, and it is our determination to do so. What I also said is that, of the number of different options that are open to us, a decision as to exactly what protective regime will be put in place has not yet been made.

1A Including World Heritage properties in National Heritage List
(1)	This item applies to a place consisting of a property that, at any time within 6 months after this item commences, is included in the World Heritage List after being submitted by the Commonwealth to the World Heritage Committee under Article 11 of the World Heritage Convention. It does not matter whether the property was first included in the List before, on or after the commencement of this item.
Place may be included in National Heritage List within 6 months
(2)	The Minister may, by instrument published in the Gazette within 6 months after this item commences, include in the National Heritage List the place and the National Heritage values it has because of subitem (3). To avoid doubt:
	(a)	all those values must be included in the List if the Minister includes the place in the List under this item; and
	(b)	this item does not prevent the Minister from including in the List at any time under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Con-se-r-v-ation Act 1999:
	(i)	the place; and
	(ii)	a National Heritage value the place has because of subitem (3) or otherwise.
World heritage values taken to cause place to meet National Heritage criteria
(3)	For the purposes of this item and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, each world heritage value that the World Heritage Committee has identified the property as having is taken to cause the place to meet a National Heritage criterion.
Note:	This has the effect that, under subsection 324D(1) of the Environment Protection and Bio-diversity Conservation Act 1999, the place has a National Heritage value corresponding to that world heritage value. Under that subsection, the place will also have another National Heritage value if the place has a heritage value that causes the place to meet one of the National Heritage criteria apart from this item.

	(2)	If the Minister decides to not accept a referral under subsection (1), the Minister:
	(a)	must give written notice of the decision to the person who referred the proposal to the Minister; and
	(b)	must give written notice of the decision to the person who is proposing to take the action that was the subject of the referral; and
	(c)	may, under section 70, request of the person proposing to take the action that was the subject of the referral, that they refer the proposal, to take the larger action, to the Minister.
	(3)	To avoid doubt, sections 73 and 74 do not apply to a referral that has not been accepted in accordance with subsection (1).
	(4)	If the Minister decides to accept a referral under subsection (1), the Minister must, at the time of making a decision under section 75:

77A Action to be taken in a particular manner
	(1)	If, in deciding whether the action is a controlled action or not, the Minister has made a decision (the component decision) that a particular provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision for the action because the Minister believes it will be taken in a particular manner (whether or not in accordance with an accredited management plan for the purposes of a declaration under section 33 or a bilaterally accredited management plan for the purposes of a bilateral agreement), the notice, to be provided under section 77, must set out the component decision, identifying the provision and the manner.
Note:	The Minister may decide that a provision of Part 3 is not a controlling provision for an action because he or she believes that the action will be taken in a manner that will ensure the action will not have (and is not likely to have) an adverse impact on the matter protected by the provision.
	(2)	A person must not take an action, that is the subject of a notice that includes a particular manner under subsection (1), in a way that is inconsistent with the manner specified in the notice. 
Civil penalty:

I will speak to these amendments as a package, as I have moved them that way. These amendments go to the heart of issues relating to both transparency and accountability.
—Mr Temporary Chair, I raise a point of order. It is my understanding that Senator Lees's amendment (18) at least—and I did not write down all of those that she has moved together—was identical to one of my amendments which was defeated last week. According to standing order 92, it is not permissible to move an identical amendment when the previous one was defeated.
 (Senator Hutchins)—There have been previous rulings that, if this becomes part of a different package of amendments, it can be moved again.
—These amendments cover three areas. In general terms, they are heritage related amendments: some relate to Commonwealth obligations and some are general amendments relating to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Firstly, the heritage related amendments cover a raft of different issues. They stipulate that the EPBC Act definition of environment includes places listed on the Register of the National Estate. They insert obligations for the minister when making a decision in relation to the taking of an action in regard to World Heritage or national heritage places. Also they increase transparency in the listing process by requiring the minister to publish his preliminary decision about listing, the council's assessment report and the value statements when the minister invites public comments.
Amendment (116) specifically relates to transparency and inserts time frames. I will go through some of the publishing requirements—and I list these—in relation to nominations that need to be assessed, the minister's statement of reasons for listing or non-listing, notifying the nominator and other interested persons. Amendments (37) to (39) relate to seeking comments on proposed removals; amendment (42), to seeking comments on management plans; amendment (88), to the minister's decision on endorsement of Commonwealth management plans; and amendment (10), to providing reasons for extending the council's assessment period. All of these will now have a requirement to be published and to be openly accessible, increasing the transparency of the process.
Amendment (53) clarifies the fact that anyone may notify the minister if they believe a place has national heritage or Commonwealth heritage values and is under threat. It clarifies that management plans in Commonwealth reserves that include a heritage place must be consistent with the management principles and the regulations. Amendment (106) allows for the transfer of World Heritage properties to the National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List. It expands requirements in relation to reviewing management plans and reviewing and reporting on the lists. Amendment (104) amends the definition of Indigenous heritage value to ensure that historic places of Indigenous heritage value can be protected under the new heritage legislation. 
I want to look quickly at the Commonwealth obligations. Amendment (109) says that the Commonwealth must not, or authorise any other person to, contravene a management plan in a Commonwealth area or a state or territory, or act inconsistently with the management principles and the Ramsar or World Heritage conventions. Then there are a series of amendments that relate to improved protection and management of Commonwealth heritage places by Commonwealth agencies: amendment (100) gives the minister prior notification of an intended disposal; amendment (92) assists the minister and the council to monitor a place's heritage values; amendment (93) seeks the council's advice before making a heritage strategy for a place; amendment (97) involves seeking the minister's advice on the heritage strategy in relation to management principles, assisting the minister in nominating places to the Commonwealth Heritage List and publishing general implementation details about the heritage strategies in agencies' annual reports; and amendment (99) involves not undertaking any actions that may have any impact on the heritage values of a national or a Commonwealth heritage place unless there is no feasible or prudent alternative.
Finally, there are amendments that relate to the EPBC Act. These amendments deal with referrals that relate to split projects or staged referrals. There are general amendments that tighten up the EPBC Act itself. They amend the EPBC Act by providing penalties for not taking an action in a specified manner; increase transparency by removing an exemption for giving reasons where the person referring a proposal states that the action is a controlled action; and insert additional publishing requirements for the secretary in relation to all EPBC Act matters, not just those affected by this legislation.
As well as the amendments, I have received a number of non-legislative commitments from the minister. Environment Australia's administrative procedures will provide for consultations with Indigenous persons or groups with rights and interests in a place, identified at the time of listing the place, to be alerted to the referral stage—so it will happen much earlier. They will be provided with the opportunity to comment. All regulations associated with the heritage amendments will be placed on the Environment Australia Internet site—again, a transparency issue. Environment Australia will maintain a consolidated register of Commonwealth heritage registers received from agencies. Environment Australia will review the operation of the EPBC Act in 4½ years time. 
Environment Australia will ensure that the new Australian Heritage Council will be a separate budget item in the annual budget statement to enable a year-to-year scrutiny of the funds appropriated to the new council. This is an issue that was raised by quite a number of groups who were concerned that funds would be effectively pooled and the actual amounts of money available to the new body would be very difficult to track and monitor. I have also been given the commitment that the government will work with the states to ensure the protection of national heritage values through the regional forest agreement process. I recommend to the chamber that the amendments that I have moved tonight, which considerably strengthen the legislation, be supported.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—The Democrats will support the amendments, but I may ask that one or two be voted on separately. Most of them are almost exactly the same as Democrats amendments, as would be obvious to anybody in this place. Amendments (13) to (18) are ones that I would like to speak about briefly. They relate to the listing procedure. The amendments include the obligation to undertake consultation in circumstances where the Heritage Council indicates that a site should be listed and the minister either has not made up his mind yet or simply wishes not to indicate one way or the other— that is the difference between this amendment and the last.  
Amendment (17)(5)(iii) states that the minister may make a statement that he or she does not have a view whether or not a place should be included in the National Heritage List. I want to draw honourable senators' attention to that clause. We might as well not have that provision there at all because it simply means he can advise that there is no advice on the matter—whether the minister proposes to list or otherwise. So it is rather a nonsense amendment in our view.
I would also like to raise some questions about amendment (31). This act applies to Australian residents, but there is a provision for emergency listing which—as I understand it—amendment (31) changes. I wonder if there could be a further explanation of the implications of that amendment. In our amendment, for instance, in our listing option the time line for decisions applies to all places, including those that are outside Australia, whereas—as I understand it—in this amendment it does not. I wonder what the implications of that are for foreign sites, such as Gallipoli, and for our companies operating overseas. There is also the question of what this amendment does about emergency listing.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,"—It was presumed that there might be some difficulties with sites outside Australia. The government certainly should be able to control processes here. The amendments in this section go to timely listing and making sure that we do not have drawn-out processes that put places of significance at risk. However, this amendment argues that places outside or partly outside Australian jurisdiction are not subject to the time frames. In the discussions, the fact that there might be some extra sensitivities in negotiating with other parties was allowed for.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—I am still not altogether clear why we need that time frame. It seems to me that this effectively takes away the ability to have emergency listing. As I said earlier, this only applies to Australian citizens or Australian companies. It is hard to see why we would need time limits and or at least would not have the provision for emergency listing. Even though a site may not be within our jurisdiction, at least the actions of those who might damage the site would be. It seems to me that it would be possible to advise foreign governments of any action to be taken. It is hard to see why there should sensitivity to this question.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,"—It is my understanding that subsection (5) cannot apply to a place that is wholly outside Australian jurisdiction because a place wholly outside must not be included in the list under this particular section—324F. We were advised that this was the way to make sure that obligations are met.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Allison, would you like the vote split? You hinted that you might like to vote for amendments (13) to (18) separately.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

— Only amendment (31)? What about amendments (13) to (18)? Will you proceed with them? 
—My request also relates to amendment (53), which I think is in the group.
— Could you summarise your request to the committee in relation to Senator Lees's amendments?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—The government will support Senator Lees's amendments. They have come about after long and difficult, but constructive, negotiation. We believe that they will also largely meet the requirements of the Australian Democrats— although there were obviously some differences of detail which the government was not prepared to agree to in the alternative Democrat amendments that have been voted down today. But, as I say, if these amendments now pass, the Democrats can be pleased that at least the general direction that they were seeking for the further improvement of this legislation has been achieved. I thank Senator Lees for her cooperation in being prepared to negotiate a package of amendments that can lead to the better protection of Australian heritage.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—It is my understanding that the operation of emergency listing that Senator Lees talked about is not correct. Places outside Australia can currently be included on lists, under emergency listing procedures, but the government's amendments—which we will deal with shortly—will alter that. There is a fairly complex relationship between those amendments. I do not now need amendment (53) to be dealt with separately, so that could be included as part of the group.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-18,"—I take this opportunity to restate Labor's position. We will not be supporting these amendments because we do not believe that these bills are salvageable. Labor moved a series of amendments, when we first started debating this bill in committee, relating to the independence of the Heritage Commission. Those amendments were defeated. We now feel that this bill no longer has integrity or provides the foundation for an independent Heritage Commission. Therefore, regardless of these amendments or earlier Democrat amendments, this bill is not able to be supported by Labor.
I would also again make the observation that what we have witnessed with a series of very lengthy amendments by the Democrats—the first batch, and the second batch that we voted on a few minutes ago—demonstrates quite a humiliating attempt by the Democrats to try to be the ones to do the deal with the government on these heritage bills when in fact the deal has been done with Senator Lees. As we have just heard, the government is about to support the remaining amendments that Senator Lees has moved which exclude identical ones that the Democrats have moved previously that the government found it in their hearts to support. On my count—and it was a pretty rough tracking of a very complex series of amendments with some eight of 65 in the first batch and then none out of 40 in the second batch—we are dealing with the leftovers, if you like, of those amendments. The government obviously prefers to do the deal with Senator Lees on this occasion. From Labor's perspective, we think that this is all quite unfortunate, as the bills themselves are no longer worthy of overall support. Nonetheless, in the forthcoming amendments we will be seizing a couple of opportunities to comment, and we look forward to the debate continuing.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—The Greens will be supporting the amendments. They do not give teeth to the bill, but they give an indication of teething troubles. I think it was John Gould who said, back in 1863 or thereabouts, about the Tasmanian tiger, that not many years must elapse before that creature went to extinction. He was noting the troubles and so on. There is an inverse process going on here. It is going to be many years before this bill becomes worthy of becoming the environmental legislation that this nation should have. Incremental bits and pieces are being added on against enormous pressure to prevent that from happening. The problem with that process is that the government can go to a series of players and, as Senator Lundy has just pointed out, shed off pieces each time, which then have to be picked up—hopefully, somewhere further down the line. 
That said, who knows what the final vote on the legislation will be? I will not be supporting it, but I have been around long enough to know that one has to stand by even little increments on the environment. So I will be supporting the amendments. Goodness knows: somewhere an eyebright or something might have its status marginally improved by some clause in the legislation. It is like the butterfly's wings moving in the forest somewhere. Many of these amendments are hoping that sort of thing, because this legislation simply does not measure up. Practice has found that it does not measure up to protecting the nation's heritage. But, for the reasons that I have outlined, I will be supporting the amendments. I would rather do that than reject the very marginal improvement that they might make to very faulty legislation.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-18,"—I will address a couple of things just briefly in response to a few of the comments that have been made by the minister—for example, the amendments being the result of long and difficult negotiations. As I have said before in this debate, they were difficult negotiations because I have never seen negotiations conducted in such bad faith in my life. Bad faith is not about not reaching agreement but about misleading people about what you are doing and what you are agreeing to. Obviously Senator Hill was not the person involved, so that is not a direct reflection on him.
Also, I think that Senator Lundy is basically mistaken. Personally, I am not interested in doing a deal one way or the other. These amendments are in effect Democrats amendments, but they are slightly weaker. Unfortunately, the ability to have them stronger has been lost. But, as Senator Brown has said, any advance forward is always better than none and is better than going backwards. The Democrats' approach to this issue, as it is with every issue, is not to try to wrap ourselves with some ribbon where we can say that we have the deal or whatever; it is about trying to get an outcome. Whether that outcome is achieved through specific amendments we have put forward, or in this case amendments that were developed by the Democrats in discussions with government and then put forward by others, is fairly irrelevant. The outcome is to try to get a move forward.
My only disappointment is that the opportunity for a stronger outcome can be lost by misjudgments about where the best gains can be made. But that is a very different thing from just deciding that, unless we can get something that has our name on it, we are not going to agree on it. The end result that I think all of us, most of the time, recognise as the reality is that we are trying to get the best possible legislative outcome. That is the approach we have taken with our amendments and, as has been widely reflected in this chamber, these amendments are basically Democrat amendments rebadged and slightly weakened. But, as Senator Brown has said, they are nonetheless an advance forward, albeit not as far forward as would be desirable. Of course, these are not the only amendments that are being considered in the context of the bill. We have to look at what the end product will be in making a judgment about that. I think that there are still some issues to be considered about that— some very substantial and important issues that I think need to be flushed out properly. 
Again, in part because of the approach the government or at least the minister—not the minister in the chamber, but the relevant government minister—has taken on this has meant that we have had to take up more time than would otherwise have been necessary to try to ensure that we get accurate information. Particularly in a process that to date has, as I have said, involved bad faith and, therefore, an absence of trust, you have to try to use the public process of the Senate chamber to get things on the record and to at least try to get something slightly more clear-cut for the public. Even though we have had commitments to the chamber gone back on in the past, at least as far as possible we have to try to get some accurate information in the public arena that we can then use to hold the government accountable.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-18,"—I really do not want to take more time than is necessary, but it would be inappropriate for me not to respond again to this allegation of bad faith. Dr Kemp does not negotiate in bad faith. The problem for the Australian Democrats is their failure to understand that nothing is achieved through years of negotiation if, ultimately, a bill is not passed. The Democrats do not seem to be prepared to negotiate towards the ultimate passage of a bill. They are prepared to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate, but the end seems to be further negotiations. After six years, it is the government's view that the matter has to be brought to a head, and if it can garner the numbers within the chamber to pass what it believes is a piece of legislation that will take huge steps forward in terms of protecting Australia's heritage then, as a government, it has a responsibility to do so.
That is not bad faith; it is the path the Democrats have chosen to go down. As I said, this bill has been in development and negotiation for some six years, during which time the Democrats have had to reach a conclusion that will lead to the passage of the bill, but they are still not there. As far as we know, the Democrats will still vote against this bill in the end. That does not achieve the government's outcome; the government must negotiate towards an ultimate passage.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-18,"—Minister Hill, it is not an allegation of bad faith; it is a straightforward fact. I do not expect you to agree to that but you were not involved in it and so you would not know; I was, and I do know that it is a straightforward fact of blatant bad faith. Obviously, the government is keen to get the numbers wherever it can, and I do not blame it for that. But I can absolutely say, having given a very clear-cut message to the relevant minister and advisers a few times about an interest in trying to bring the matter to a conclusion, that it is impossible to get any sort of agreement on something when you get written correspondence from a minister that suggests one thing and then a completely opposite action happening at the same time—that is bad faith. It is nothing to do with getting the numbers; it is to do with basically misleading people, stringing them along and giving inaccurate information. That is a very unhelpful process in any circumstances, in anyone's language; it is completely different from having disagreement. 
I have been and I am still very keen to get an outcome on this. Despite everything, how the Democrats vote has nothing to do with how the government has behaved; it is about whether or not our view of the legislation is that, overall, it is an advance forward. We can deal in other venues and circumstances and in other ways with the issue of the bad faith shown by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. We are not going to prevent beneficial legislation, however marginal, from going through simply because we are annoyed. That would not be responsible or mature. It would be nice if the government took the same approach, but they obviously have not done so in this debate. Hence their refusal to support Democrat amendments despite them reflecting what they had agreed in written correspondence to support, apart from verbal assurances. As I said, that is not our game; that is not the way we do business here.
It would be worth while for the minister in the chamber, the Minister for Defence, to realise for his benefit and that of all his colleagues that it is not helpful for any minister of the government to behave in this way. If it is seen to be acceptable by his colleagues then that makes it difficult to trust anybody in any form of negotiation at any time. I would prefer that not to be the case, because I do not like wasting my time, as I am sure neither the minister nor anybody else here does. The simple fact is, nonetheless, that that is what occurred in this circumstance. I am not going to labour the point but neither am I going to back away from it or ignore the fact that it has happened. However, our approach to the legislation and the amendments will not be based on our justified outrage at the completely inexcusable manner in which the minister has behaved in this case; it will be on what the better outcome is for the protection of heritage and for the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—I have a question to raise about amendment (106), which relates to including World Heritage properties on the National Heritage List. The Senate may recall that the Democrats put forward amendments which would have seen World Heritage sites transferred, and we had some debate about that.
This amendment applies to properties that, at any time within six months of the amendment commencing, are included on the World Heritage List, which would then be automatically transferred onto the National Heritage List. My question is: why is there the six-month period? Why would not all future World Heritage sites, as they are included as World Heritage sites, automatically be included on the National Heritage List?

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,"—In some discussions I had with them about 12 months ago now, the various groups who have a very particular interest in heritage were concerned that, while World Heritage places are already protected and are already under the EPBC Act et cetera, virtually all of them on mainland Australia involve Indigenous heritage. There has been very little, if any, consultation to date with Indigenous people. This amendment gives the opportunity for that to take place. There are certainly no suggestions whatsoever that there would be any loss of protection for World Heritage sites—as I said, they are already locked in. But we have to acknowledge that in the past we have bypassed Indigenous people; we have not consulted with them. According to the groups that have raised these issues with me, this was one of the mechanisms to do so.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—With respect to Senator Lees, that is not what this amendment does. Our amendments did in fact ask for current Australian World Heritage sites to be immediately transferred onto the National Heritage List—this amendment goes forward six months. The argument for not supporting our amendments was that Indigenous groups would want to have that additional time to be part of a new assessment. We argued that you could still do that; you could put them onto the National Heritage List and then you could have a subsequent assessment process whereby other cultural and Indigenous values might be taken on board and added to those World Heritage values for the purposes of the National Heritage List. 
As I read it, this amendment provides for the automatic transfer of World Heritage sites which, after the enactment of this legislation, would go automatically onto the National Heritage List without further process or procedure. That is my understanding of what this does. My question is: why the six-month limit? What happens after the end of that time? I wonder if the minister would attempt to at least answer this question, because it is otherwise left up in the air.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

For example, the wet tropics is not listed on the World Heritage register for Indigenous values and neither is the latest Australian listing, Purnululu, but it may well be that Indigenous values do meet the standard required under this legislation and that the asset could be listed not only for the values that are currently inscribed on the World Heritage List but also for these additional values.

For the purposes of this item and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, each world heritage value that the World Heritage Committee has identified the property as having is taken to cause the place to meet a National Heritage criterion.
As Senator Hill said a minute ago, there might be some additional values, in particular Indigenous values, that as yet have not been identified. But I take it from the discussions that we have had that it basically means we do not have to redo it; they are going to accept as a given the values that have been decided upon by those making the decisions on World Heritage. They are just going to accept those, roll them over and say, `We are looking at Kakadu and the particular values it was listed for.' I think that is a bad example, as it has Indigenous heritage in it, but I know some of them have not and they were listed on other criteria. Those other criteria are accepted but we can now go through the process of seeing whether or not there are Indigenous values that should also be recognised.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—Senator Lees, why not just list the places in toto for protection under this legislation? There has been a big debate in the World Conservation Union on a proposal coming from Australia to devalue World Heritage listing by simply saying you protect the values but you do not protect the places. It allows operators to get in there under all sorts of guises—they say they are not going to affect Indigenous heritage here or rare woodland over there, but they are going to put a mine in there. It was rejected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, but here we are getting the government putting it into this legislation. This means that World Heritage properties put on the National Heritage List are going to have less protection than they are intended to have under the World Heritage List itself. Why simply go to values criteria? Why not protect the places in toto? The reverse way of saying this to Senator Lees is: why not protect the place? Once all the studies have been done and it has been given World Heritage status, why not say, `This place in its totality should be listed'? Why reduce it to the values of the place?

This is giving total protection to World Heritage places. We are not taking anything away. It is simply an opportunity to further list them, to look at the possibility that they have additional values. When a site is listed on the new national list it may be for additional reasons. This is in no way reducing the protection. If you want to talk about why we are now looking at themes and protecting values, in the opinion of the groups that I have been working with it is actually an improvement to look at a place in its entirety as an entity and not try to designate a particular spot, building or garden as having value.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

It applies to new World Heritage places and properties that would come on board after this legislation is enacted. That is my understanding. Not only does it provide for automatic transfer to the National Heritage List but it provides the minister with the power to do so without going through any other assessment. I wonder if I could have clarification that that is the effect of this amendment. It has nothing to do with existing World Heritage sites, as I understand it. This is about those which in the next six months will be put on the list, nominated or included. That is why I ask why it is six months and not some other time.

As was said in response to the exchange on clause 3, if the values have been assessed as World Heritage values then there is no need to do a reassessment; they can be taken as such. But values that may not have been deemed to be of sufficient standard or for some other reason—there may not have even been an application—may nevertheless be considered under this legislation and, if they meet the standard of this legislation, would enable the asset to be listed for those values as well.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—With regard to amendment (106), I draw the committee's attention to the issues paper from the Australian Conservation Foundation which says the Australian Conservation Foundation has: 
... consistently highlighted critical shortfalls in the government's heritage legislation and called on all parties to seek amendments which include ... 
And the second point is: 
·	Protection for the place and its values—not just values. The values only approach, which the Government unsuccessfully tried to foist on the World Heritage Convention, allows for piecemeal protection of sites of significance.
The existing Australian Heritage Commission Act focuses on the place and does not mention values. That is the danger that is inherent in the wording of the third part of amendment (106). It is a values based assessment; it is not a place based assessment. It means that you can go in and make changes to the place because you can say, `We are protecting that value—for example, that Indigenous site over there—by logging around it.' But the whole site loses its connection to the Aboriginal site over there. 
The argument for piecemeal intrusion on sites of World Heritage significance is left open if you only have the values based argument, and that is written right into this amendment (106). I am happy to wait and hear an explanation later on or to have one from the minister now. This was debated at the World Heritage Bureau. There was a move by Australia to go to values based. The Australian government got the support of other governments, but the Iraq war intervened and it did not succeed. It happened to be Australia, Britain and the United States putting it forward, wouldn't you know, and the Iraq war broke out and the rest of the world did not like the look of it very much. So the environment did get a quite incidental gain out of those events. Senator Lees, I am very concerned about simply listing World Heritage values, which is inherent in this amendment, rather than listing World Heritage places which have values.

In other words, we do not stop after six months and that six months is the time frame within which this is done for existing sites—if that is the intention of the amendment, and I am pleased it is.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,—What we are talking about is the current listing system for World Heritage properties. There are a number of reasons why places go onto the World Heritage List. I do not have in front of me the list of all the Australian places and why they have been put on the World Heritage List. I know from talking to some of the groups which have worked with me on this legislation that the concern is that there has not been a thorough assessment of the Indigenous importance and Indigenous values of particular places. Not only is this giving us the opportunity to move straight across from those values and accept those values that have been assessed but also it gives us the opportunity to include other reasons why we are putting this in the national heritage criteria.,SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

We do not have to go to this building or that particular path or that bit of bridge; we can stop inappropriate activity that impinges anywhere on those particular values. Yes, it will have boundaries and, yes, the theme will be very clearly defined—for example, its convict heritage— but, if someone wants to put up an additional building within sight of the place that is nothing like a convict ruin or in keeping in any way with that particular classification, that can be stopped.

In other words, with a World Heritage item, the place is listed but it is listed for certain specified values. It is those values that are assessed and found to meet the required standard. That is why all sorts of activities may be permitted within a World Heritage listed site, provided they do not damage the values for which it has been listed. Obviously that is World Heritage, but basically the same scheme has been adopted in this legislation: the place will be listed, but what is protected are the values for which it is listed.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—I am going to make a stand here. I know what the minister is saying and I know what Senator Lees is saying, but what the minister just said is to the point of my argument. Yes, we have World Heritage places, and then you allow all manner of activities within them as long as they do not infringe on certain values. The places themselves are not protected. There is a whole drift to that because, in the world of greenwash—developers wanting to make money out of World Heritage—they can always go in there and do whatever it is they are going to do without damaging the values, because that becomes a matter of opinion. The place is not a matter of opinion. The boundary is set; you protect it. Once you start to say, `You can do this in there without damaging this value', you can get a consultant to say you can do that. It is very fraught. It needs to be listed and protected because of the place it is as well as the values it has. If you just go to the values, when you get to section (3) of this amendment, suddenly the place is gone. If the place is listed because of its values, you are in trouble.
There will be the argument that says, `That's the situation we've got.' We should improve on it because, as the minister will know, in the Tasmanian World Heritage place, there are all manner of `get rich' operators wanting to move in for all sorts of reasons. You get death by a thousand cuts. You should protect the place, make sure the developers stay outside that place—particularly if it is the cream, a World Heritage listed place. But, when you get down to protecting only the values, sure. We have even had this recent example of the World Heritage in Tasmania: they can put in Basslink and they can allow floods to go twice a year down the Gordon River because they can look after the values there and the place has not got the protection it deserves. It does not have it under national legislation, and it is not going to get it under this legislation—because they will just bring in consultants and argue, `A flood a couple of times, ripping down through the Gordon Gorge, to meet the airconditioning needs of Melbourne might even improve the place.' Terrific! You can find an argument for saying it is going to actually improve the place because you have paid your consultants well enough. They will find it.
It is time we got away from that and gave guaranteed protection to places of World Heritage significance. When you list them, you know what they are and that is where it stays. Leaving this values approach opens them to all sorts of attrition in the future.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Brown, as a point of clarification, could you help the committee? Your amendment for deletion of clause 3 does not, I believe, necessarily meet the twin objectives that you have outlined to the Senate. Do you propose to follow it up with another amendment? 
—It is very difficult. If I can help you: I am making a stand of principle here. I do not have the numbers.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,"—I apologise to the Senate; I realise that time is getting on. I just want to make one further point—that is, what perhaps Senator Brown is missing is that some of these properties may indeed now be on private land. They may be, for example, a working farm. I can think of a couple—one, certainly, in eastern Victoria and another one on another site in Victoria—where, yes, some of the buildings are in fact already listed in this place under state legislation. But, if the entire property were to be listed under this legislation, it is not just the activities related to an individual building; it is the activities on the entire farm and every part—
—Whole cities are listed under World Heritage: Dubrovnik.
—That is right, Senator Hill: whole cities may be listed. This gives us flexibility. Indeed, regarding what Senator Brown has just mentioned, that particular wild river is already in a protected area but there are other wild rivers that we may be able to protect. That is one of the themes that the groups supporting this legislation are rather hopeful of: that we will be able to further protect those few rivers in Australia that are still running free and that are not dammed. In some cases they run through, and parts of the catchment are in, private land. You will not be able to give the protection unless you have the theme of the river and are protecting the river in its entirety.

	(d)	the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assessment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however des-cribed) of such an action.
24C Interpretation
		In this Act:
greenhouse gases include any of the following:
	(a)	carbon dioxide;
	(b)	methane;
	(c)	nitrous oxide;
	(d)	hydrofluorocarbons;
	(e)	perfluorocarbons;
	(f)	sulphur hexafluoride.
greenhouse gas emissions are emissions of greenhouse gases measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.
This amendment inserts a greenhouse trigger into the legislation; we have tried before and I hope this time we will be successful. It is very difficult to conceive of truly national legislation on the environment without some effort to contain both air pollution and global warming. On the last day of sitting, the Senate passed a motion calling on the government to do much more about reversing Australia's status as the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas emitter. The Senate agreed to that motion, taking into account that we are now seeing a rapid series of very troubling events, including the heatwave that tonight's news tells us has claimed 5,000 lives in France, the almost doubling of the record number of tornadoes in the United States in May, the bushfires and droughts we had in Australia last season and before that, and the fact that most of the hottest years recorded for the globe in human history have been in the last decade; and that Australia is in the sad position of being up there with the United States as the world's worst performer on a per capita basis. What this amendment says—I think it is far too lax; however, it is there—is:
A person must not take an action that will or is likely to lead to emissions of greenhouse gases in excess of 500,000 tonnes in any year.
It is extraordinarily important that we do make some stand on this critical matter of greenhouse gases, which are listed in the amendment. I commend this very important amendment to the committee.

Whilst the Democrats would like very much to see a greenhouse trigger, I think there are some difficulties with this amendment as it has been drafted— which is why the government needs to do this and not rely on individual amendments from this chamber. One of the problems I foresee is that 500,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents would be quite a small amount if you were to take into account a series of activities as an action. For instance, I imagine that a reasonably large transport company would generate that level of CO2 emissions in a year. I imagine there would be a lot of activities that would fit this action. So whilst the Democrats are very keen to see a greenhouse trigger, the minister may wish to comment about how this would work and whether the government has a view on an alternative approach that might be workable.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,"—I agree with Senator Allison and I have some real concerns about us proceeding not only with this specific amendment but also knowing tonight that the government is, hopefully, still in debate and discussion with others and is making some progress on both this issue and land clearing, particularly land clearing in Queensland. So, at this point in time, I do not believe we should deal with this issue. Hopefully, the government will be able to tell us very shortly about its discussions and debate with the states and be able to announce that it has made some progress.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-18,"—As far as land clearing in Queensland is concerned, there is still ongoing debate and I have been assured that some conclusions over funding issues are being reached. With respect to the issues of substance, I have not been involved in a time line but I have been kept up to date with where they are going. As for a greenhouse trigger, the government is undertaking—as Senator Allison has just said—to discuss this with the states. Hopefully we can come up with a system that is workable and that has flexibility but that catches any major emitters and is gradually built into a system whereby we can have an actual reporting and recording process.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-18,"—On both those matters, we are three years down the line from the year 2000, when the same commitment was made and when this was guillotined through by the government and the then Democrats. I just think that time is up. These are really important triggers. I say to Senator Allison: sure, you cannot always expect people on the crossbench to get the perfect amendment up, but if you allow the government to get away with no amendment at all then you absolve them of the pressure that should be put on them. Senator Lees, one thing that will move the government to action on the greenhouse trigger is getting this amendment through the Senate tonight.
—It will just sink the bill.
—I do not accept that. That is a matter of where you put the line with the government. This government has no intention of coming up with a trigger; it has none. You go along with that if you turn down the amendment—and I think it is a good amendment—that tries to tackle this issue. Everybody has had plenty of time to come up with alternatives, but no-one has. The government is sitting over there pat because it has no intention of bringing in a greenhouse trigger. It is up to us to put it in there and to have the government improve it and not simply say, `Oh, well, the government is still working on it.' When Rip Van Winkle wakes up, it might have done something. Let us hope. It just does not work that way.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-18,"—Every now and again Senator Brown says something I agree with. He says this is a good amendment. We think Labor has a better one and we will also be moving an amendment, which is coming up shortly on the running sheet, on a greenhouse trigger, and we too will be seeking the chamber's support. We are looking for support for our amendment and will not be supporting this amendment.

Subdivision FB—Native vegetation
24D Requirement for approval to clear native vegetation
	(1)	A person must not take an action that will lead or is likely to lead to clearing of native vegetation in excess of 1,000 hectares in any period of 5 years if the action will have or is likely to have an adverse impact on any of the following:
	(a)	the habitat of flora or fauna;
	(b)	ecological processes;
	(c)	the genetic diversity of flora and fauna and their potential for evolutionary development in the wild;
	(d)	greenhouse gas emissions;
	(e)	erosion, salinisation and other forms of land degradation;
	(f)	wetlands, waterways and water resources; 
	(g)	landscape quality.
Civil Penalty:
	(a)	for an individual—5,000 penalty units;
	(b)	for a body corporate—50,000 penalty units.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to an action if:
	(a)	an approval of the taking of the action by the person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(b)	Part 4 lets the person take the action without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(c)	there is in force a decision of the Minister under Division 2 of Part 7 that this section is not a controlling provision for the action and, if the decision was made because the Minister believed the action would be taken in a manner specified in the notice of the decision under section 77, the action is taken in that manner; or
	(d)	the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assessment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however described) of such an action.
24E What is native vegetation?
		In this Act:
clearing, in relation to native vegetation, means:
	(a)	lopping native vegetation; or
	(b)	destroying native vegetation; or
	(c)	removing native vegetation.
native vegetation means vegetation that is indigenous to the land, local government area, Territory or State in question.
This is a requirement of approval before a person removes more than 1,000 hectares of native vegetation. It is extraordinarily important and it is to help redress Australia's position as the world's worst destroyer of native vegetation cover amongst the developed countries.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-18,"—The Democrats have been very keen to see land clearing triggers included in the EPBC specifically. However, I do have some questions about how workable this might be. For it to apply to the clearing of native vegetation in excess of 1,000 hectares in any five-year period, whilst I am sure 1,000 hectares is important in the scheme of things, one could imagine 200 hectares per year being cleared over a five-year period and having the capacity to monitor whether or not that was happening might be a very difficult thing to do. The minister may wish to comment on that. I just think the administration and enforcement of this might be difficult, and the Democrats would like Senator Brown to consider another limit.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-08-18,"—Last Saturday, the Australian people learned of the appointment of the disgraced former Queensland Labor MLA, Mike Kaiser, to the position of Assistant National Secretary of the ALP. A spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, was reported as saying that he was `delighted with the appointment—he's acknowledged as a superb campaigner'. The appointment of Kaiser to the second most senior professional office within the ALP is an example of cynicism and double standards so odious that, if it were possible, it would even put the Labor Party to shame. And it exposes the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, for the grinning hypocrite that he is. 
Let me remind the Senate of the circumstances in which Mike Kaiser was forced out of the ALP. On 15 August 2000, I told the Senate about serious and systematic corruption within the ALP in Townsville. The sequence of events which followed ultimately led to the establishment of the Shepherdson inquiry into electoral fraud, which reported on 17 April 2001. That inquiry revealed the existence of a culture of systematic corruption, vote-rigging, branch-stacking and the falsification of electoral enrolments endemic within the Queensland branch of the Labor Party throughout the 1980s and 1990s. 
In the course of evidence before the inquiry, Mike Kaiser, then seen as a Labor rising star, admitted that he had been a party to the falsification of enrolments for the Brisbane City Council ward of South Brisbane in 1986. The Commissioner, Mr Tom Shepherdson QC, found that Kaiser's conduct would have constituted the offence of making a false declaration under section 117 of the Queensland Elections Act and the corresponding penalty provision under the Criminal Code. However, because the charge was statute-barred—in other words, the time within which a prosecution could be commenced had expired—since Kaiser's fraud only came to light 14 years later, the charge could not be brought. For the same reason— that the fraud had been concealed for so long—and for only that reason, Mr Shepherdson declined to recommend a charge of criminal conspiracy.
So Kaiser did not end up in jail, as did other Labor Party identities who had engaged in similar behaviour. But he did pay a heavy political price. He was forced to relinquish his Labor Party endorsement for the safe seat of Woodridge and, apparently, his political career.
Mr Beattie went on to lead the Labor Party to a famous election victory, largely because he succeeded in convincing voters that he was sincere in his strong stand against Kaiser and the other rorters. When asked on election night whether Kaiser and another fraudster, Jim Elder, had paid too high a price, Mr Beattie was as eloquent in his denunciation as he was uncompromising in his righteousness. He said:
Look, I know that there'll be some people who will say that but when it comes to matters of principle, when it comes to matters relating to the integrity of the electoral system, I have to be clear. I was clear, I will be clear and my view about that will not change.
Two months later, after the release of the Shepherdson report, Mr Beattie told the Queensland parliament:
I welcome the Shepherdson report on electoral fraud, and so does my government. The inquiry was good for the Labor Party and good for democracy. The actions of a few rorters nearly destroyed a good Labor government ... and I will never forgive them for it.
Earlier on, on 6 November 2000, Mr Beattie had said:
I don't want people who break the law in the Labor Party. I don't care whether this goes back to 1917. If people are still alive and they've broken the law in these electoral matters, they should go to jail.
Beattie made the treatment of the electoral rorters the test by which he invited Queenslanders to judge his own integrity. Speaking of the electoral rorters, he told the journalist Hedley Thomas, in remarks quoted in the Courier Mail on 2 December 2000:
I have had at different times every faction in this party after my guts for garters because I never compromised on these matters, on principles, on matters of decency and honesty. ... I have had a gutful of these crooks. My sensitivity is about this—my integrity means something to me. It's about my honesty. And I will not compromise on these— 
expletive deleted—
things ever.
And you know, most people believed him. As a piece of political performance art, it was breathtaking. He put in a bravura performance as a political ingenue—as a bewildered innocent—which would have given Jimmy Stewart a good run for his money in Mr Smith Goes to Washington. And he got away with it! The people of Queensland trusted him, because, sick of a decade of the corruption of the Bjelke-Petersen government, they so badly wanted to believe him. And it was all phoney. It was all just an act. Now, as we know, he was conning them all along.
Yesterday, Beattie welcomed Kaiser's appointment—
—Order! Senator, I believe it is appropriate to refer to a premier or a person in another parliament as Mr Beattie or Premier Beattie.
—As you wish, Mr President. Yesterday, Mr Beattie welcomed Kaiser's appointment—the appointment of this man who, to steal an election three years ago, he had described as `scum, scum, scum'.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 193(3). I think the reference by Senator Brandis to the Premier of Queensland is an improper reflection on the Premier and I ask you to listen carefully to his words in respect of this matter.
—Senator Forshaw, I will listen carefully. I was of the opinion that Senator Brandis was quoting from an article or something similar, but I have to admit that quoting from an article does not make such language acceptable to the parliament. I have had occasion recently to pull up members on both sides of the Senate for using unparliamentary language, so I will listen carefully in future.
—Under the headline `Beattie backs new role for ex-MP Kaiser', the Brisbane Sunday Mail reported:
Mr. Beattie told The Sunday Mail yesterday the ALP national executive advised him this week of its plans to appoint Mr. Kaiser, who was dumped from Queensland Parliament two years ago for electoral rorting.
“I was contacted after the decision had already been made,” he said. “I indicated that I was not going to oppose it.
“Mike Kaiser is one of the most gifted campaigners this party has ever produced. I can understand why the Federal ALP would want him.”
After a performance like that, nobody should ever believe a word Mr Beattie says again. I am glad to say that in Queensland these days, fewer and fewer people do.
Let me give the lie to the suggestion that the time has come to forgive Kaiser for what was nothing more than a youthful indiscretion. In the first place, it was a matter of the utmost seriousness—it wasn't a frolic, it was a fraud. The Shepherdson inquiry heard extensive evidence of the same conduct, part of a pattern of conduct over numerous episodes in the course of many years—during most of which Kaiser, as state secretary, was the chief executive of this most corrupt organisation. I refer to the evidence of Mr Warwick Powell and Mr Lee Bermingham in relation to Kaiser's conduct in the East Brisbane plebiscite of 1993, the Archerfield plebiscite of 1994, the Townsville plebiscite of 1996, as well as his systematic handling of large sums of cash, delivered in unmarked envelopes of which Powell and Bermingham testified. In fact, Mr Powell went on to describe how Kaiser boasted about his behaviour, telling `war stories' at Young Labor retreats in which he regaled new recruits with tales of his shenanigans—and, no doubt, thereby perpetuated the Labor Party's corrupt culture by letting each new generation of recruits know that this behaviour was not only acceptable, it was the way to get ahead—it was fun—it was cool. 
So this is not a case of a gifted young man condemned forever to the political wilderness for a youthful indiscretion. Here is a case of a hardened young serial offender— premeditated, systematic, amoral, shameless, remorseless—educating and corrupting new generations of young Labor activists into the corrupt old culture over which he presided. No wonder Mr Beattie struck such a chord three years ago when he called him `scum, scum, scum'.
—Order! I have already ruled on that. I do not believe that is parliamentary language. While you may be quoting, I still do not believe that is the appropriate sort of language that we want to hear in this place.
—Very well, Mr President. There is one further aspect to this story. Oddly, when Kaiser assumes the position of assistant national secretary, he will remain resident in Brisbane. I am informed by a reliable senior source within the Queensland Labor Party that a deal exists whereby Kaiser will only hold the position of assistant national secretary briefly and that, after the next Queensland state election, the current state secretary, Cameron Milner, will replace him, and Kaiser will return to his old position as Queensland state secretary, from which position he will be given the opportunity to rehabilitate his political career.
I call upon Mr Beattie to assure the people of Queensland that this is not the case, that Mike Kaiser will not return as state secretary, and to honour the unambiguous, emphatic assurances he gave Queenslanders three years ago. And I call upon Mr Crean, if he has any respect for the integrity of his own party, to countermand this disgraceful appointment forthwith.
